            <p>This case study illustrates how carefully designed digital publications can make significant contributions to 
               decolonizing ethnomusicology. Drawing upon my recent experience creating <title rend="italic">Sekuru's Stories</title>, 
               a co-authored digital humanities project featuring music from Southern <name>Africa</name>, I suggest several ways 
               for ethnomusicologists to engage this decolonizing potential. Among other issues, I discuss which digital platforms 
               may prove most readily accessible to users with limited internet access, outline options for making content available 
               in indigenous languages, and highlight special interactive features such as comparative map viewers and 3D imaging. 
               I also discuss considerations in building digital projects that will prove accessible, robust, and sustainable over 
               time, as well as specific strategies for cultivating a wide audience. One highlight of digital publication is its 
               ability to support multiple navigation options, including both linear and non-linear ways of moving through content. 
               Similarly, digital projects can integrate both narrative and non-narrative formats, blending aspects of monograph and 
               website. When these considerations are taken into account, well-designed digital projects are uniquely capable of 
               reaching a wide audience of scholars, students, and laypeople. As evidence, I analyze data from Google Analytics 
               showing that the primary readership for our project is located in Southern <name>Africa</name>. I argue that digital 
               humanities projects can prove accessible and engaging for non-specialists without sacrificing scholarly rigor, and I 
               call upon ethnomusicology to embrace the decolonizing potential of digital work. I conclude by outlining concrete 
               steps to place the digital humanities more firmly at the heart of our discipline.

               player <name>Sekuru Tute Chigamba</name>.

          <head>Introduction</head>
            <p>Shortly after arriving in Zimbabwean territory in the mid-1890s, the British South Africa Police established a 
               small camp in the town of <name>Chinhoyi</name>. Soon, however, British authority was threatened by a spirit medium 
               named <name>Sasa</name>, who had settled at the nearby sacred site of <name>Chirorodziva</name>. <name>Sasa</name> was 
               captured and taken to the police camp with his brothers, precipitating a dramatic series of events still recounted by 
               his descendants. Among them is <name>Sekuru Tute Chigamba</name>, a renowned performer of the Zimbabwean 
               <term xml:lang="sn">mbira dzavadzimu</term>, or <foreign xml:lang="sn">mbira</foreign> of the ancestral spirits. In 
               <name>Chigamba</name>'s telling, the British forces demanded that <name>Sasa</name> prove his legitimacy by making 
               rain fall within the hour. Positioned beneath the hot sun, the brothers began to sing, 
               <quote xml:lang="sn" rend="inline">Kakore tenderera, kemvura tenderera</quote>, or, <quote rend="inline">Little cloud, 
               circle around, full of rain, circle around</quote>. Soon, a small cloud appeared in the sky. The ensuing downpour 
               lasted more than a day, and after begging <name>Sasa</name> to halt the deluge, the British ordered him to resettle 
               near the British encampment. As <name>Chigamba</name> recounts, <quote rend="inline">The British said to 
               <name>Sasa</name>, <quote rend="inline">Whenever we need rain, we will come to you. You are the… [best] rainmaker in 
               <name>Rhodesia</name></quote>. … And people were coming to them to ask for rain</quote>.
            </p>
            <p><name>Chigamba</name>'s fascinating account of this colonial encounter belongs to the Shona narrative genre of 
               <term xml:lang="sn">nhoroondo,</term> or stories about the past. Drawing on decades of ethnographic work, I present 
               a series of <name>Chigamba</name>'s oral narratives through a born-digital project titled <title rend="italic">Sekuru's 
               Stories</title> (<ref target="http://sekuru.org/">sekuru.org</ref>). <title rend="italic">Sekuru's Stories</title> 
               brings together a multimedia ethnographic archive of photographs, musical transcriptions, maps, audio and visual 
               recordings, and narrative text, making it a project ideally suited for digital as opposed to manuscript publication 
               (see Figure 1). This digital project was co-authored with <name>Chigamba</name>, who is often referred to by the 
               honorific title <term xml:lang="sn">Sekuru</term>, or <q>Grandfather</q>. Born in 1939, <name>Sekuru Chigamba</name> 
               grew up immersed in the ritual life of northeastern <name>Zimbabwe</name>, where his father served as an interpreter 
               for a senior clan spirit, or <term xml:lang="sn">mhondoro</term>. Yet his father also worked as a cook on a succession 
               of commercial farms owned by white Rhodesian settlers, giving the young <name>Chigamba</name> an intimate view of 
               everyday colonial entanglements. Echoing one of the world's most recurring twentieth-century narratives, 
               <name>Sekuru Chigamba</name> migrated to the colonial capital in 1962. Here, he gained employment in a shop owned by 
               <name>Albert Amato</name>, a Jewish refugee who fled <name>Rhodes Island</name> during the Holocaust. During this time, 
               <name>Sekuru Chigamba</name> also began teaching himself to play the <foreign xml:lang="sn">mbira dzavadzimu</foreign>. 
               Now considered one of the world's foremost <foreign xml:lang="sn">mbira</foreign> musicians, <name>Sekuru 
               Chigamba</name> has toured widely in <name>Europe</name>, <name>North America</name>, and beyond.

            <p>Around the time of <name>Zimbabwe</name>'s political independence, a rising tide of decolonial scholarship analyzed 
               several of the nation's oral poetic genres, with emphasis on the resilience and contemporary import of African 
               languages and cultures. Among these genres were <foreign xml:lang="sn">tsumo</foreign> proverbs 
               <ptr target="#hamutyinei1987"/>, <foreign xml:lang="sn">nhetembo</foreign> praise poetry 
               <ptr target="#hodza_etal1979"/>, <foreign xml:lang="sn">ngano</foreign> folktales <ptr target="#hodza1980"/>, song 
               lyrics <ptr target="#pongweni1982"/>, and the didactic and narrative poetic forms of 
               <foreign xml:lang="sn">nhango</foreign> and <foreign xml:lang="sn">ndyaringo</foreign> <ptr target="#fortune1974"/>. 
               By comparison, <foreign xml:lang="sn">nhoroondo</foreign> have received scant scholarly attention. This may be partly 
               because the term <term xml:lang="sn">nhoroondo</term> can refer to various ways of narrating the past, including 
               legends and myths, specific historical accounts, individual life histories, and academic narratives. A variety of 
               other expressive forms, including songs, folktales, proverbs, and even dream narratives, are also frequently caught 
               up within <term xml:lang="sn">nhoroondo</term>. As exemplified in <name>Sekuru Chigamba</name>'s account of 
               <name>Sasa</name>'s encounter with British authorities, the narrative genre of 
               <foreign xml:lang="sn">nhoroondo</foreign> brings together multiple strands of scholarly interest, including 
               relationships between mediumship and musical performance <ptr target="#berliner1993"/>, ritual and place 
               <ptr target="#ranger1999"/>, and the problems of navigating different forms of power <ptr target="#werbner1991"/>.
            </p>
            <p>Through digital engagement with <name>Sekuru Chigamba</name>'s narratives, <title rend="italic">Sekuru's 
               Stories</title> takes up <foreign xml:lang="sn">nhoroondo</foreign> as a multivalent and polyphonic form, offering 
               a new way of approaching Zimbabwean history, biography, and memoir. Following <name>Sabelo J. Ndlovu-Gatsheni</name>, 
               I consider <name>Sekuru Chigamba</name>'s oral narratives through the larger framework of decoloniality, marked by an 
               <quote rend="inline">epistemological movement gesturing towards…  the different ways of knowing by which people across 
               the human globe provide meaning to their existence</quote> <ptr target="#ndlovu-gatsheni2019" loc="4"/>. This is 
               especially significant in light of published accounts of <name>Zimbabwe</name>'s colonial and postcolonial history, 
               which includes a recent spate of both scholarly and popular memoirs <ptr target="#fuller2003"/> 
               <ptr target="#godwin2007"/> <ptr target="#meldrum2005"/> <ptr target="#ranger2013"/> <ptr target="#todd2007"/>. With 
               the exception of the account of a few black nationalists <ptr target="#marembo2014"/> <ptr target="#mayowe2015"/> 
               <ptr target="#msipa2015"/>, however, these memoirs overwhelmingly portray the experiences of expatriates and white 
               Zimbabweans.<note>One notable exception is a memoir published by third-generation Chinese Zimbabwean 
               <name>Fay Chung</name>, who played an important role in the nationalist movement <ptr target="#chung2006"/>.</note> 
               In this context, the digital presentation of <name>Sekuru Chigamba</name>'s oral histories offers precisely the type 
               of <quote rend="inline">counterstories</quote> that <quote rend="inline">narrate away from the center of the digital 
               humanities which has been consistently and frequently imagined as a white, male, able-bodied, cisgendered, 
               heternormative space</quote> <ptr target="#kim2018" loc="25–26"/>.
            </p>
            <p>Based on my experience creating <title rend="italic">Sekuru's Stories</title>, I discuss some of the many ways in 
               which carefully designed digital publications can contribute to the decoloniality of knowledge by presenting new 
               ways <quote rend="inline">of thinking, knowing, and doing</quote> <ptr target="#kim2018" loc="4"/>.<note>I take the 
               idea of decoloniality of knowledge specifically from the work of <name>Sabelo J. Ndlovu-Gatsheni</name>. Echoing 
               <name>Kim</name>'s formulation, <name>Ndlovu-Gatsheni</name> likewise emphasizes the importance of 
               <quote rend="inline">the emergence of another-thinking, another-logic, and another-world view</quote> 
               <ptr target="#ndlovu-gatsheni2019" loc="16"/>.</note> My account highlights specific strategies and approaches in 
               building <title rend="italic">Sekuru's Stories</title>. Among them, I advocate for building accessible, robust, and 
               sustainable digital projects, making content available in indigenous languages, cultivating readerships outside 
               <name>North America</name> and <name>Europe</name>, and integrating non-linear as well as linear paths through 
               digital humanities projects. I also discuss how specific design elements in <title rend="italic">Sekuru's 
               Stories</title>, notably its logo and color scheme, both reflect and contribute to the project's decolonial goals. 
               Before turning to the project itself, however, I offer a brief description of <name>Sekuru Chigamba</name>'s primary 
               instrument, the <foreign xml:lang="sn">mbira dzavadzimu</foreign> (or <foreign xml:lang="sn">mbira</foreign> of the 
               ancestral spirits), which has come to be one of <name>Zimbabwe</name>'s most iconic musical traditions.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <head>The <foreign xml:lang="sn">Mbira Dzavadzimu</foreign></head>
            <p>One of many types of <foreign xml:lang="sn">mbira</foreign> played throughout Southern <name>Africa</name>, the 
               <foreign xml:lang="sn">mbira dzavadzimu</foreign> features between 22 and 28 keys mounted on a wooden soundboard, or 
               <foreign xml:lang="sn">gwariva</foreign> (see Figure 2). These keys are organized into three separate registers, 
               with the highest register on the instrument's right-hand side, a middle register on the instrument's upper left-hand 
               side, and the lowest register on the instrument's lower left-hand side. Played during all-night ceremonies called 
               <term xml:lang="sn">mapira</term>, the <foreign xml:lang="sn">mbira</foreign> is instrumental in summoning the 
               ancestral spirits to possess living mediums, known as <term xml:lang="sn">masvikiro</term>. The 
               <foreign xml:lang="sn">mbira</foreign>'s unique timbre is produced by shells, bottle tops, or wire beads affixed to 
               the instrument's soundboard, which produce a gentle buzzing sound integral to generating states of trance. During 
               performance, the <foreign xml:lang="sn">mbira</foreign> is often placed inside a calabash resonator, or 
               <foreign xml:lang="sn">deze</foreign>, which amplifies its sound. Within a typical ensemble, 
               <foreign xml:lang="sn">mbira</foreign> players are joined by at least one musician playing the 
               <foreign xml:lang="sn">hosho</foreign> shakers, which are responsible for maintaining a steady triplet pulse. The 
               <foreign xml:lang="sn">hosho</foreign> also contribute a dense, distinctive timbral quality that complements 
               the buzzing tone of the <foreign xml:lang="sn">mbira</foreign>.

            <p>The repertory of the <foreign xml:lang="sn">mbira dzavadzimu</foreign> includes well over a hundred songs. While 
               some are specific to particular regions, families, or individuals, others are widely shared, immediately enabling 
               musicians from different areas to play together. <foreign xml:lang="sn">Mbira</foreign> songs generally feature two 
               interlocking parts, known as <foreign xml:lang="sn">kushaura</foreign> and <foreign xml:lang="sn">kutsinhira</foreign>, 
               which are played simultaneously by two or more musicians. The interplay between these parts produces the complex

               Because <name>Sekuru Chigamba</name> actively composes new songs for the <foreign xml:lang="sn">mbira</foreign>, his 
               stories offer examples of innovation within a musical tradition often described as inherently conservative in its 
               orientation toward the past <ptr target="#berliner1993"/> <ptr target="#turino2000"/>. In addition, 
               <title rend="italic">Sekuru's Stories</title> presents a range of other musical practices, from twentieth-century 
               acoustic guitar playing to endangered Zimbabwean musical bows such as the <foreign xml:lang="sn">mukube</foreign>, 
               <foreign xml:lang="sn">chipendani,</foreign> and the groundbow.

          <head>Building <title rend="italic">Sekuru's Stories</title></head>
            <p>I developed <title rend="italic">Sekuru's Stories</title> between April 2018 and September 2019 with funding from an 
               <name>ACLS</name> Fellowship and institutional support from the <name>University of Rochester</name>'s Digital 
               Scholarship department, led by director <name>Emily Sherwood</name>. With the backing of the <name>Andrew W. Mellon 
               Foundation</name>, as well as dedicated institutional investment, the <name>University of Rochester</name> is a leader 
               in the field of digital humanities. Many born-digital research projects supported by the Digital Scholarship 
               department, such as the Blake Archive, the Seward Family Archive, and the Bragdon Train Station, have come to 
               successful fruition. Through the Digital Scholarship department, I had access to a team of tech professionals that 
               included programmers, archivists, geographic information system (GIS) research specialists, visual technologists, 
               and specialists in metadata, information discovery, and digitization. After evaluating three different platforms — 
               Omeka, Scalar, and Wordpress — we selected Wordpress as best suited for broad, international accessibility. The 
               team then helped me select and customize a Wordpress theme that suited the project's requirements. Along the way, we 
               took care to minimize our use of plug-ins and external links to ensure long-term sustainability. The team's initial 
               contributions enabled me to work independently throughout the rest of the year as I built the project's internal 
               structure and added content.

          <head>Structuring a Digital Monograph</head>	
            <p>Designed as a digital monograph, <title rend="italic">Sekuru's Stories</title> is organized into five sections 
               roughly akin to chapters, allowing readers to page sequentially through its content. Reflecting this project's 
               structure as a digital monograph, its initial landing page is designed to look like the digital analogue of a physical 
               book cover (see Figure 3). Despite growing interest in the digital humanities, relatively few digital humanities 
               projects present monograph-length scholarly work in the form of an interactive website. While many university presses 
               now work digitally, for example, they tend to employ the conventional format of e-books, which seldom accommodate 
               extensive multi-media features. Projects such as digital archives, on the other hand, often focus primarily on 
               curating primary source materials rather than presenting detailed interpretation and analysis. With its distinctive 
               format as a born-digital monograph, <title rend="italic">Sekuru's Stories</title> has proven exceptionally successful 
               in garnering readers in Southern <name>Africa</name> and in the Global North.

            <p>Reflecting the multivalent nature of <name>Sekuru Chigamba</name>'s oral narratives, <title rend="italic">Sekuru's 
               Stories</title> is designed to encourage various modes of engagement, making it accessible and engaging for general 
               audiences and specialists alike. Organized in chronological order, the first three sections of the project — Early Years, 
               Musical Life, and Independence — chart the trajectory of <name>Sekuru Chigamba</name>'s life. Two other sections — 
               <foreign xml:lang="sn">Mbira</foreign> and Ancestors — present <name>Sekuru Chigamba</name>'s specialized knowledge of 
               Zimbabwean music and history. Each section of the project is accessible through the top navigation bar, which serves as 
               an analogue to the table of contents in a physical book. Within each section are the actual stories, which may be read 
               individually or sequentially and are accessible through drop-down menus. In addition, each section of the site features 
               introductory and concluding essays framing the stories within that section for readers.
            </p>
            <p>In the first section of <title rend="italic">Sekuru's Stories</title>, titled <quote rend="inline">Early Years</quote>, 
               <name>Sekuru Chigamba</name> relates stories from his early years in <name>Guruve</name>, beginning with his birth in 
               1939 and ending with his departure as a migrant laborer in 1957. The stories in this section offer vivid oral testimony 
               about the detrimental effects of colonialization as experienced by an ordinary Zimbabwean family. At the same time, the 
               vibrant world of Zimbabwean musical practice within these stories illustrates the vitality and resiliency of indigenous 
               lifeways even under trying circumstances. In the second section, titled <quote rend="inline">Musical Life</quote>, he 
               recounts stories about his life in the urban capital, from his attendance at ceremonies in the early 1960s to his family's 
               experiences of extreme hardship in the late 1970s. Here, <name>Sekuru</name>'s oral narratives challenge conventional 
               portrayals of the <foreign xml:lang="sn">mbira dzavadzimu</foreign> as an inherently conservative musical tradition. 
               Rather, his stories depict the <foreign xml:lang="sn">mbira dzavadzimu</foreign> as a vibrant musical practice 
               characterized by relentless innovation, creativity, and change.
            </p>
            <p>The third section of <title rend="italic">Sekuru's Stories</title>, titled <quote rend="inline">Independence</quote>, 
               begins at the pivotal moment of political decolonization, which in turn paved the way for <name>Sekuru Chigamba</name>'s 
               emergence as an international touring artist. The stories in this section illustrate how seemingly opposed spiritual 
               figures important during <name>Zimbabwe</name>'s liberation struggle interact within a worldview that understands 
               political and religious authority as interrelated. Through his involvement as a <foreign xml:lang="sn">mbira</foreign> 
               musician, <name>Sekuru Chigamba</name> brought this worldview to life in many forms. These include his work composing 
               <foreign xml:lang="sn">mbira</foreign> songs and lyrics dedicated to senior ancestral spirits, his creative arrangements 
               of songs performed by Apostolic Christian leaders and their followers, and his active musical participation in ceremonies 
               organized by traditionalists and Apostolic sects alike. In the process, <name>Sekuru Chigamba</name>'s musical engagement 
               and oral histories have participated in what anthropologist <name>Joost Fontein</name> has called the creation of 
               <quote rend="inline">alternative, moral visions of the past, present and future</quote> 
               <ptr target="#fontein2006" loc="178"/>.
            </p>
            <p>In the fourth section of the project, titled <quote rend="inline" xml:lang="sn">Mbira</quote>, <name>Sekuru Chigamba</name> 
               offers a detailed account of his primary instrument, the <foreign xml:lang="sn">mbira dzavadzimu</foreign>, exploring 
               topics such as the <foreign xml:lang="sn">mbira</foreign>'s origins, the law of <foreign xml:lang="sn">mbira</foreign>, 
               and the social role of the <foreign xml:lang="sn">mbira</foreign> player, or <foreign xml:lang="sn">gwenyambira</foreign>. 
               This section includes a catalogue of various songs from the <foreign xml:lang="sn">mbira</foreign>'s extensive repertory, 
               with audio examples and <name>Sekuru Chigamba</name>'s explanation of each song's meaning and significance. Here, 
               <name>Sekuru Chigamba</name>'s oral narratives describe constant practices of innovation, revealing the creativity, 
               experimentation, and innovation inherent in indigenous ritual and musical traditions. In the fifth section, 
               <name>Sekuru Chigamba</name> turns to the ancestor spirits for whom the mbira has historically been performed. The fifth 
               section, titled <quote rend="inline">Ancestors</quote>, presents <name>Sekuru's Chigamba</name>'s understanding of the 
               long perspective of Zimbabwean history.
            </p>
            <p>The last section of the site, titled <quote rend="inline">Explore</quote>, invites readers into the project through 
               completely different modes of engagement (see Figure 4). This section offers several non-linear paths through the site, 
               inviting viewers to engage with an extensive image gallery, musical archive, and other special features. These include a 
               3D viewer of one of <name>Sekuru Chigamba</name>'s oldest instruments, online audio streaming through a SoundCloud 
               playlist, free digital audio downloads through Bandcamp, an interactive family tree and timeline, and individual pages 
               describing several indigenous Zimbabwean instruments.

            <p>The single most prominent design element in <title rend="italic">Sekuru's Stories</title> is its logo, which depicts a 
               stylized version of a fish eagle, known in Shona as <term xml:lang="sn">hungwe</term> (see Figure 5). Long held sacred by 
               Shona speakers, the fish eagle is closely associated with the pre-colonial empire of <name>Great Zimbabwe</name> in 
               <name>Masvingo</name>, where several soapstone carvings of fish eagles rose prominently from the imposing stone walls of 
               the kingdom's many enclosures. In the nineteenth century, colonial explorers removed these carvings from the sacred site 
               of <name>Great Zimbabwe</name> and sent them to various museums in apartheid <name>South Africa</name> and 
               <name>Europe</name> for display. Following independence, the carvings were subsequently returned to <name>Zimbabwe</name>, 
               with an initial group of four birds returned by <name>South Africa</name> in the early 1980s and a final sculpture returned 
               by the German government in 2003 <ptr target="#ranger2004"/>. The carvings' history has rendered them metonyms of

            <p>Centrally positioned in the static header that appears on all pages on the site (see Figure 6), the logo for 
               <title rend="italic">Sekuru's Stories</title> features <name>Sekuru Chigamba</name>'s own rendition of the Zimbabwe Bird, 
               which he began carving into the wooden soundboard of <foreign xml:lang="sn">mbira</foreign> instruments shortly after it 
               was adopted as a symbol of the new nation in the early 1980s. Yet <name>Sekuru Chigamba</name> also holds the fish eagle 
               particularly meaningful on a personal level, as it was his mother's totem, or <foreign xml:lang="sn">mutupo</foreign>. 
               Indeed, <name>Sekuru Chigamba</name> was first motivated to carve the Zimbabwe Bird on the back of his own personal 
               instrument as a form of remembrance, or <foreign xml:lang="sn">mucherechedzo</foreign>. As he told me, 
               <quote rend="inline">It was a form of remembrance. I did it for my mother, who is of the Shiri (bird) totem, that fish 
               eagle… I just thought, <quote rend="inline">Let me add the image of the fish eagle</quote>. And then I added it. I said, 
               <quote rend="inline">I am adding an image of my mother</quote></quote> (Interview with author, 18 May 2017). Shortly 
               thereafter, <name>Chigamba</name>'s fellow <foreign xml:lang="sn">mbira</foreign> maker <name>Chris Mhlanga</name> noticed 
               the carving and encouraged him to begin carving it on all of the instruments he made and sold. As <name>Chigamba</name> 
               recalled, <quote rend="inline"><name>Mhlanga</name> saw it, and said, <quote rend="inline">Oh, your 
               <foreign xml:lang="sn">mbira</foreign> has an image of the fish eagle. Why?</quote> I said, <quote rend="inline">That is 
               my mother's totem</quote>. He said, <quote rend="inline">Put it on all your <foreign xml:lang="sn">mbira</foreign></quote>. 
               Yes, and I said, <quote rend="inline">That's a great idea</quote>. Then I put an image of the fish eagle on all my 
               <foreign xml:lang="sn">mbira</foreign></quote> (Interview with author, 18 May 2017). <name>Sekuru Chigamba</name>'s carving 
               of the Zimbabwe Bird thus functions both as a widely recognized icon of political decolonization and as an intimate 
               remembrance of his maternal lineage, history, and kinship networks.

            <p>The elongated shape, unique patterning, and lack of color in <name>Sekuru Chigamba</name>'s rendition of the fish eagle 
               clearly distinguish his carvings from the Zimbabwe Bird featured on the nation's flag. In <title rend="italic">Sekuru's 
               Stories</title>, his carving is rendered as a simple, black-and-white line drawing. While this color scheme echoes the 
               coloring of the fish eagle itself, black and white also have particular significance for 
               <foreign xml:lang="sn">mbira</foreign> players, spirit mediums, and other ritual specialists. As Zimbabwean scholar 
               <name>A.C. Hodza</name> explains, <quote rend="inline"><foreign xml:lang="sn">Hungwe</foreign> (fish eagle) becomes 
               sacred because of its two colours, namely, white and black… the two colours are likened to two black and white pieces 
               of cloth given to a spirit medium. When the two pieces are sewn together, and have become one, it is called 
               <foreign xml:lang="sn">jira rehungwe</foreign> or <foreign xml:lang="sn">fuko remudzimu</foreign></quote> 
               <ptr target="#roberts_etal1982" loc="57"/>. This color combination likewise inspired the overall aesthetic of 
               <title rend="italic">Sekuru's Stories</title>. Apart from photographs, the site's design largely features simple black 
               text set against a clean, white background, with shades of gray and tan used for most borders, buttons, and hyperlinks. 
               Like its logo, the color palette of <title rend="italic">Sekuru's Stories</title> thus references both the black-and-white 
               coloring of the fish eagle and the <foreign xml:lang="sn">jira rehungwe</foreign> cloths worn by mediums during spirit 
               possession ceremonies, which are in turn the subject of many of the oral narratives presented in this digital project.

          <head>Cultivating Readership in the Global South</head>
            <p>As critical digital pedagogy scholar <name>Jesse Stommel</name> has observed, <quote rend="inline">Making scholarly work 
               legible to the public and helping it find audiences is a form of outreach, community building, and advocacy</quote> 
               <ptr target="#stommel2018" loc="81"/>. Early on, I made the decision to build <title rend="italic">Sekuru's Stories</title> 
               publicly, giving readers access to the site as I created it. In doing so, I sought to build an audience for the project 
               from the beginning, rather than waiting for the project's completion. At the same time, I understood that readers would be 
               more likely to engage with the project's extensive materials piece by piece. Through the subscription function on 
               Wordpress, I sent out weekly emails informing subscribers about newly published pages. I also shared new material on 
               Facebook through my personal page and in groups for the global Zimbabwean music community. Finally, I circulated the 
               project through the <name>Society for Ethnomusicology</name> listserv and various Zimbabwean music community listservs. 
               People began reading <title rend="italic">Sekuru's Stories</title> immediately, with 162 users on the first day. These 
               numbers picked up quickly, with more than three hundred readers in the first week, five hundred in the first month, and 
               twenty-two hundred in the first year, for a total of over twenty thousand individual page views. 
               <title rend="italic">Sekuru's Stories</title> was also assigned in graduate and undergraduate classes in ethnomusicology 
               during the build phase. Presently, over fourteen thousand individual users have accessed the site since I launched it in 
               January 2019.

            <p>During the build phase, the major readership for <title rend="italic">Sekuru's Stories</title> was in the 
               <name>United States</name> and <name>Canada</name>, followed by a secondary concentration in Southern <name>Africa</name>. 
               Gradually, however, this situation has reversed, and most readers are now located in <name>Zimbabwe</name> and 
               <name>South Africa</name>, followed by the <name>US</name> and the <name>UK</name>. In one recent month, for example, 
               just over eleven hundred users visited <title rend="italic">Sekuru's Stories</title>. Fully seven hundred of them were in 
               <name>Zimbabwe</name>, representing 65.23% of the site's recent readership. And of the fourteen thousand individual users 
               who have accessed the site since its inception, nearly five thousand have been in <name>Zimbabwe</name>, with another two 
               thousand readers in <name>South Africa</name>. Together, this represents roughly half of the total readership for the 
               project. The <name>US</name> and the <name>UK</name>, on the other hand, jointly account for just over four thousand 
               discrete users, or roughly a third of the project's total readership.

            <p>Anthropology and related disciplines have increasingly recognized that ethnography involves work <quote rend="inline">with 
               real, everyday people who deserve to know what we are up to and how we are interpreting their lives</quote> 
               <ptr target="#lassiter2005" loc="121"/>. Enacting this premise in a digital realm, <title rend="italic">Sekuru's 
               Stories</title> is designed for both scholars and general audiences, including a world-wide community comprised of 
               students and performers of the <foreign xml:lang="sn">mbira dzavadzimu</foreign> and related Zimbabwean musical 
               traditions. <title rend="italic">Sekuru's Stories</title> is also specifically designed to appeal to both English and 
               Shona speakers, as well as readers with an interest in learning the Shona language. Many of <name>Sekuru Chigamba</name>'s 
               stories are available in both Shona and English versions, with a button enabling viewers to easily move between the two 
               languages (see Figure 7). Combined with platform choices and a public build, this Shona-language component has contributed
               significantly to making <title rend="italic">Sekuru's Stories</title> accessible to audiences in <name>Zimbabwe</name> and 
               its associated diaspora.

          <head>Decolonization and Fieldwork Ethics</head>
            <p>As <name>Eve Tuck</name> and <name>K. Wayne Yang</name> remind us, decolonization is not a metaphor; rather, it is the 
               struggle for the <quote rend="inline">the repatriation of Indigenous land and life</quote> 
               <ptr target="#tuck_etal2012" loc="1"/>. While co-authorship conveys some limited benefits within the international 
               framework of intellectual property rights, it does little to change material inequalities. To this end, after receiving 
               an <name>ACLS</name> Fellowship for <title rend="italic">Sekuru's Stories</title>, I found it important to share this 
               funding with <name>Sekuru Chigamba</name>. With slightly over half of the fellowship money, <name>Sekuru Chigamba</name> 
               purchased a four-bedroom home for his wife and young children. During the COVID-19 lockdowns, I then began teaching online 
               community <foreign xml:lang="sn">mbira</foreign> classes to support my three primary mbira teachers, 
               <name>Musekiwa Chingodza</name>, <name>Patience Munjeri</name>, and <name>Sekuru Chigamba</name>, all of whom were affected 
               through canceled tours, closed post offices, and the demise of international travel. Over fifteen months, these classes 
               raised a total of around $35,000. <name>Sekuru Chigamba</name>'s share of these funds has enabled him to install solar 
               panels and dig a generator-operated borehole, providing the family with both electricity and running water.
            </p>
            <p>My collaborative, digital projects with <name>Sekuru Chigamba</name> and other Zimbabwean musicians reflect my conviction 
               that our <quote rend="inline">primary responsibility is to the community consultants with whom we work</quote> 
               <ptr target="#lassiter2005" loc="83"/>. In addition to writing articles, teaching classes, and presenting at conferences, 
               I have sought to privilege working with my teachers on projects in which they derive significant economic benefit. The 
               struggle for the repatriation of indigenous life and land remains incomplete; as such, our efforts to work toward 
               collaborative projects must remain ongoing and subject to critique and revision at all times. Digital, online, and applied 
               approaches to ethnomusicology hold great promise for those of us who are committed to the co-creative process of this 
               ethical imperative.

          <head>Moving Forward</head>
            <p>The digital humanities offer unique opportunities for ethnomusicologists to work toward innovative projects with our research collaborators. As we worked together on developing <hi rend="italic">Sekuru's Stories</hi>, Sekuru Chigamba read over and commented upon all my transcriptions and translations. With funding from the University of Rochester Humanities Center, he also came to workshop the material with Darien Lamen, Tony Perman, and Stefan Fiol, all of whom he knew from their previous travel to Zimbabwe as graduate students in ethnomusicology. Our discussions at this workshop proved essential in enabling me to develop the theoretical framing for the individual stories on the site and brought our voices together much more closely than if I had worked on this material independently. </p>
            <p>While <hi rend="italic">Sekuru's Stories</hi> was co-authored, one of the project's limitations is a design team based entirely in the Global North, without the participation of institutions and individuals working in the digital humanities in Zimbabwe. This was largely due to the combined pressures of balancing the demands of a tenure-track academic career and family life. In the first place, I built <hi rend="italic">Sekuru's Stories</hi> while raising my young, Black son as a single parent and full-time academic, with limited working hours and ability to travel. At the same time, I conceived the project while still a junior faculty member, which hindered my ability to envision and execute complex collaborative projects spanning multiple institutions and continents. The circumstances under which I built <hi rend="italic">Sekuru's Stories</hi> reflect Kim's observations regarding how women and people of color may find themselves “doing double or triple the work” as they seek to engage in the necessary “labor — political, social, and cultural capital — to work ethically and with respect for various communities” (2018: 486). They do not, however, erase critical distinctions between the content of Sekuru's Stories, which was produced through a long-term, collaborative effort between Sekuru Chigamba and myself, and the project's design, which I undertook largely on my own.    </p>
            <p>Following directly on <hi rend="italic">Sekuru's Stories</hi>, I am currently working toward a second digital project that will bridge various departments at the University of Rochester and the University of Zimbabwe, representing a more sustained, collaborative foray into the digital humanities. Provisionally titled <hi rend="italic">Portrait of Zimbabwe/Mufananidzo weZimbabwe</hi>, this project will curate and present an extensive selection of images from the Chicago Dzviti Photographic Archive.<note><ref target="https://rbscp.lib.rochester.edu/finding-aids/D537">https://rbscp.lib.rochester.edu/finding-aids/D537</ref></note> Several of these images were also featured in <hi rend="italic">Sekuru's Stories</hi> (see Figure 8), paving the way for this new project. The design team for <hi rend="italic">Portrait of Zimbabwe/Mufananidzo weZimbabwe</hi> will include Dr. Bridget Chinouriri in the Department of Creative Media and Communication and Dr. Reggemore Marongedze in the Department of History, Heritage, and Knowledge Systems. Through a multimedia approach linking Dzviti's photographs of Zimbabwean musicians to audio examples, physical instruments, and ephemera, our collaborative digital humanities project will offer a unique depiction of Zimbabwean musical life as viewed through the eyes of a pioneering Zimbabwean visual artist. Expanding my initial work on <hi rend="italic">Sekuru's Stories</hi>, <hi rend="italic">Portrait of Zimbabwe/Mufananidzo weZimbabwe</hi> represents a more complex and sustained collaborative effort in digital publication, in which scholars located on both sides of the Atlantic engage as digital subjects and producers.<note> I thank an anonymous reviewer for this wording.  </note></p>

            <p><hi rend="italic">Sekuru's Stories</hi> illustrates several promising facets of the digital humanities, with great significance for future projects. This includes their capacity to present narrative content in multiple languages, ability to integrate special interactive features, compatibility with online music platforms such as Soundcloud and Bandcamp, and accessibility for readerships located in the global south. Yet, the digital humanities continue to occupy an uneasy space in academic scholarship. The ACLS Fellowship I received for <hi rend="italic">Sekuru's Stories</hi> confirmed the project's scholarly importance and served a function akin to peer review. <hi rend="italic">Sekuru's Stories</hi> has also been favorably reviewed in many academic journals, including Reviews in Digital Humanities 1(1), Journal of the American Musicological Society 73(2), African Music 11(2), Yearbook for Traditional Music 52, and Ethnomusicology Forum 29(3). In the absence of a formal peer-review process for digital humanities projects, fellowships and scholarly reviews are two modes of providing evidence of a project's scholarly rigor.</p>
            <p>There are many other ways in which ethnomusicology and other academic disciplines can and should work toward facilitating full acceptance of digital humanities projects. These might include actions at the level of our professional societies such as creating prizes specifically for digital projects, as well as opening existing prizes to digital work as well as printed publications. Of equal if not greater importance, professional societies should develop guidelines for evaluating work in digital humanities for the purposes of hiring, tenure, and promotion. Such guidelines have been adopted by some organizations, such as the American Musicological Society, the Modern Language Association, and the American Historical Association. Yet many of these statements do little more than refer readers back to guidelines developed by the Modern Language Association nearly a decade ago, in 2012. By developing their own detailed guidelines for the evaluation of digital projects, professional societies can establish useful baselines both within the disciplines, and for individual universities dealing with questions of hiring, promotion, and tenure. </p>
