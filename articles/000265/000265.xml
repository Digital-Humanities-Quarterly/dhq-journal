                <!-- Include a brief abstract of the article -->
                <p>The art history domain is an interesting case for search engines tailored to the
                    digital humanities, because the domain involves different types of sources
                    (primary and secondary; text and images). One example of an art history search
                    engine is RemBench, which provides access to information in four different
                    databases related to the life and works of Rembrandt van Rijn. In the current
                    paper, RemBench serves as a case to (1) discover the requirements for a search
                    engine that is geared towards the art history domain and (2) make
                    recommendations for the design of user observation studies for evaluating the
                    usability of a search engine in the art history domain, and in digital
                    humanities at large.</p>
                <p>A user observation study with nine participants confirms that the combination of
                    different source types is crucial in the art history domain. With respect to the
                    user interface, both free-text search and facet filtering are actively used by
                    the observed participants but we observe strong individual preferences. Our key
                    recommendation for specialized search engines is the use of faceted search (free
                    text search combined with filtering) in combination with federated search
                    (combining multiple resources behind one interface). In addition, the user study
                    shows that the usability of domain-specific search engines can successfully be
                    evaluated using a thinking-aloud protocol with a small number of participants.

                <head>1. Introduction</head>
                <p>For the interpretation of works of art, art historians study these works along
                    with different types of textual sources: primary documents describing the works
                    of art, their maker, the patron, the provenance, etc., but also contemporary
                    documents related to the social and economic context in which the artist worked,
                    and secondary literature. The information about works of art, both as primary
                    and secondary documents, can be found independently in digital (and in part also
                    non-digital) resources produced by museums, archives and libraries. Increasing
                    amounts of sources residing in libraries and archives are digitized and made
                    accessible online <ptr target="#rodriguez2013"/>.</p>
                <p>In a previous project (<title rend="quotes">RemDoc</title>) we developed a
                    digital collection of primary documents that relate to the life and works of
                    Rembrandt van Rijn (1606-1669). These documents had partly been published before
                    in the form of books <ptr target="#strauss1979"/>
                    <ptr target="#roscam2006"/>. In the Rembrandt Documents (<title rend="quotes"
                        >RemDoc</title>) project we digitized them, added metadata, and made them
                    available through an online search engine.<note>
                        <ref target="http://www.remdoc.org">http://www.remdoc.org</ref>
                    </note> Digital collections such as RemDoc form a pivotal tool for the research
                    of art historians: they serve as the entry point for and guidance in research
                    projects. However, for many of the research questions faced by Rembrandt
                    researchers, often other sources than primary documents are needed. Here are a
                    few examples of questions that might be asked by Rembrandt researchers:</p>
                <list type="unordered">
                    <item>Was Rembrandt’s <title rend="quotes">Reading Woman</title> in the
                        Rijksmuseum painted on canvas or panel?</item>
                    <item>Did Rembrandt paint dogs?</item>
                    <item>How old was Titus when he died?</item>
                    <item>Where is Rembrandt’s <title rend="quotes">Storm on the Sea of
                            Galilee</title>?</item>
                    <item>Find etchings after Rembrandt’s self portraits</item>
                </list>
                <p>To answer these questions, researchers need to combine diverse and geographically
                    distributed sources of information: text, images, and bibliographical data.
                    Probably the most consulted resources for art historical information on the
                    topic of Rembrandt are the databases of the Netherlands Institute for Art
                    History (RKD). The database RKDimages contains descriptions and images of mainly
                    Dutch paintings, drawings, prints and original photos before 1940; the database
                    RKDartists contains biographical information about Dutch and foreign artists of
                    the middle ages to the present. For Rembrandt research, the RKD databases are an
                    important reference. In addition, secondary literature stored in libraries is
                    relevant for art history research. The dispersed nature of relevant resources in
                    the Rembrandt research domain motivated us to design and develop an online work
                    environment that integrates these resources. </p>
                <p>This resulted in the development of RemBench.<note>
                        <ref target="http://rembench.huygens.knaw.nl/"
                            >http://rembench.huygens.knaw.nl/</ref>
                    </note> RemBench provides access to information related to the life and works of
                    Rembrandt van Rijn stored in four different databases: RemDoc, RKDimages,
                    RKDartists, and a university library catalogue. These databases are made
                    accessible through a single search interface. The target user groups of RemBench
                    are art historians, historians, and other humanities scholars and students who
                    are interested in Rembrandt’s period, the 17<hi rend="superscript">th</hi>
                    century. The goal of the RemBench project was to show the value of online
                    digital data for art history research. We defined two sub-goals: (1) to connect
                    the metadata of four different databases and (2) to build a demonstrator search
                    interface to these databases. The focus of the current paper is on the
                    development and evaluation of a search interface that gives access to the four
                    databases.</p>
                <p>Access to the four different databases is realized through <term>federated
                        search</term>. Federated search (sometimes called <term>distributed
                        information retrieval</term>) is a technique for searching multiple
                    collections simultaneously with a single query. The results returned by the
                    selected collections are integrated into a single result page <ptr
                        target="#jasco2004"/>
                    <ptr target="#shokouhi2011"/>. Federated search is often used in online library
                    services that give access to publications stored in multiple different
                    repositories, but most people also know it from the use of Google, where one
                    query often generates results from Google images, Google maps and the textual
                    Google index. In the terminology of federated search, the different resources
                    are called <term>verticals.</term></p>
                <p>Because of the importance of metadata for searching in the art history domain
                        <ptr target="#bates1996a"/>
                    <ptr target="#yee2003"/>, we decided that RemBench should not only allow for
                    free text search, but also for filtering metadata values. For example, filtering
                    on location can help find works of art that are stored in Moscow; filtering on
                    document type can help find birth certificates, and filtering on date can help
                    find documents from before 1700. The search engine technology that combines free
                    text search with filtering for metadata values is called <term>faceted search </term>
                    <ptr target="#tunkelang2009"/>. Faceted search is commonly used in web shops,
                    booking sites and review sites, where users can select options for the items
                    they are searching for. Figure 1 shows the faceted search interface of RemBench.
                    RemBench will be described in more detail in Section 3. </p>

                </figure>



                <p>For the development and evaluation of domain-specific search engines, it is
                    important to know the information-seeking behaviour of the target group <ptr
                        target="#gossen2013"/>: what type of queries do they phrase given a research
                    question, how do they formulate follow-up queries, and how do they decide which
                    results are relevant? However, these behaviours are to a large extent determined
                    by the functionality and usability of the search system at hand. At the same
                    time, the satisfaction of a user group with a search system depends on the match
                    between the functionality and design of the system and the goals of the users.
                    This interaction makes it difficult to disentangle information-seeking behaviour
                    and the requirements that a search engine should meet. It is therefore crucial
                    to observe the target group in interaction with a search engine in order to
                    understand their information-seeking behaviour and evaluate the usability of the
                    search engine. Therefore, we set up a user observation study in order to address
                    the following research questions, using RemBench as a case study: </p>
                <p>1. What are the requirements for a search engine that is geared towards the art
                    history domain? </p>

                <p>These requirements follow from the analysis of three user aspects: (a) the
                    questions asked by Rembrandt researchers; (b) the user-system interactions that
                    we observe, and (c) the measured user satisfaction. In Section 5, we will
                    address these three aspects.</p>
                <p>2. What are recommendations for the design of a user observation study for
                    evaluating the usability of a search engine in the art history domain?</p>

                <p>These recommendations follow from our experiences with the user observation
                    study, combined with the recommendations from earlier work on the usability of

                <p>For answering our research questions, two topics from the literature are
                    important: the information-seeking behaviour of humanities scholars (Section
                    2.1) and the methodology for evaluating the usability of domain-specific search
                    systems and analysing user-system interactions (Section 2.2).</p>

                    <head>2.1. The information seeking behaviour of humanities scholars</head>
                    <p>When designing search systems for specific target groups it is important to
                        take into account the information-seeking behaviour of the target user group
                            <ptr target="#gossen2013"/>. Many studies address the
                        information-seeking behaviour of specific target groups, e.g. of medical
                        doctors <ptr target="#davies2007"/>, social scientists <ptr
                            target="#meho2003"/>, academic scientists in general <ptr
                            target="#hemminger2007"/>, graduate students <ptr target="#george2006"
                        />, lawyers <ptr target="#makri2008"/> and doctoral students in the field of
                        biology <ptr target="#vezzosi2009"/>. Some studies address the
                        information-seeking behaviour of humanities scholars, or even more
                        specifically, of art historians. For the current research it is relevant to
                        know whether humanities scholars – and art historians in particular – have
                        different information-seeking behaviour than other groups and therefore have
                        different needs for domain-specific search engines.</p>

                        <ptr target="#bates1996b"/> is a large study of online searching by 27
                        humanities scholars, conducted over a two-year period. Complete logs of the
                        searches and output were captured, and a small number of scholars were
                        interviewed in depth. Based on these interviews, it is argued <ptr
                            target="#bates1994"/> that humanities scholars have different needs than
                        researchers from other fields, because (a) publications in the humanities
                        are not so much about fact discovery, but more about the author’s opinions,
                        and (b) humanities scholars use very different terms than researchers in
                        other fields to describe the information they need. However, the study was
                        conducted in a time when web-based search engines were still in their
                        infancy, which might mean that the reported behaviour <ptr
                            target="#siegfried1993"/> may not be representative of current
                        information seeking behaviour. Nevertheless, some of the recommendations
                        made in the final report <ptr target="#bates1996a"/> still hold, such as the
                        recommendation to combine multiple databases in one search engine, and to
                        enable faceted search: <cit>
                            <quote rend="block" source="#bates1996a">“Recognize that humanities

                                this sort, good online database searching in the humanities may
                                actually be harder than for the sciences, even for the skilled
                                online intermediary, and will almost certainly be difficult for the

                        </cit></p>
                    <p>It could be argued that the difficulty mentioned in the last sentence does
                        not hold anymore nowadays, since all end users are expected to have
                        experience with web search engines and web interfaces to databases <ptr
                            target="#rowlands2008"/>. For example, it was found that the
                        expectations and behaviour of the users of digital libraries have changed
                        since the mid-90s <ptr target="#sadeh2007"/>. In 2007, Hemminger et al.
                        found that although bibliographic and citation databases still were the most
                        commonly used tools by academic scientists for finding information, these
                        were closely followed by search engines and digital libraries. Hemminger et
                        al. note that <cit>

                        </cit>. Around the same time, George et al. <ptr target="#george2006"/>
                        found that 97% of graduate students use the Internet (non-library websites)
                        as source for information and 73% report the use of Google for their
                        research-related information seeking. This is also the case for art
                        historians, as has been shown in more recent research by Beaudoin and Brady
                            <ptr target="#beaudoin2011"/>, who studied the search behaviour of
                        archaeologists, architects, art historians and artists in digital image
                        libraries. One of their findings was that the art historians who
                        participated in their study all reported Google Images as their favourite
                        resource for images. </p>
                    <p>On the other hand, the study by George et al. <ptr target="#george2006"/>
                        shows that the use of Google is the least frequent for humanities students,
                        compared to students from other fields, while their use of library databases
                        is the highest compared to other fields. This may be explained by the
                        importance of primary sources for the humanities, which often reside in
                        libraries and archives. Tenopir et al. <ptr target="#tenopir2009"/> confirm
                        this. They found that humanities scholars read fewer articles than academics
                        from other disciplines, and that they rely more on browsing (as opposed to
                        searching, using citations and asking colleagues) for finding relevant
                        articles. However, <cit>
                            <quote rend="inline" source="#tenopir2009">this is not to say that

                    <p>The effectiveness of faceted search for research in the art history domain
                        has been shown by Yee et al. <ptr target="#yee2003"/>, who present the
                        results of a usability study in which art history students explored a
                        collection of 35,000 fine arts images, using a faceted interface for
                        metadata filtering. They find that for these data, 90% of the participants
                        preferred the metadata approach over a free-text search functionality,
                        despite the fact that the latter was more familiar to them. This was likely
                        due to the nature of the data: images cannot easily be disclosed through
                        free text search. Metadata can disclose images, but the user then depends on
                        the terms chosen by the developers of the database for labelling the images.
                        If there is a mismatch (or the users suspect a mismatch) between the terms
                        in the database and the terms they would use themselves, metadata filtering
                        is a better option than free-text search, because selecting the most likely
                        (best matching) term(s) from a list is more effective than guessing query
                        terms. </p>
                    <p>In summary, the literature shows that humanities scholars are experienced in
                        the use of web search engines, but rely on digital libraries more than
                        researchers in other fields. Because of the importance of metadata in the
                        art history domain, faceted search is an important feature for the interface
                        to databases and libraries.</p>

                        seeking</head>
                    <p>It has been shown that there is a strong relationship between usability and
                        popularity of web search engines <ptr target="#dudek2007"/>; thus it is
                        important that usability is evaluated properly. The most-used method for
                        usability testing is to have users from the target group work with the
                        software or website, and ask them to provide feedback on the usability. With
                        respect to the number of users needed, Nielsen and Landauer <ptr
                            target="#nielsen1993"/> show that for most usability tests, the
                        proportion of additional usability problems found when adding test users
                        quickly decreases beyond five users. A common method for registering user

                        thinking aloud with recording of the navigation process is a valuable

                        </cit>. The common way of evaluating the usability of search engines is to
                        give users a series of information problems and ask them to find the answers
                        using the search engine at hand. Afterwards, the users are presented with a
                        questionnaire in order to assess their satisfaction with the system <ptr
                            target="#spink2002"/>. This latter method of usability testing is
                        adopted in the current paper; in addition, we combine screen capturing with
                        thinking-aloud as suggested by Van Waes <ptr target="#vanwaes2000"/> to
                        collect the user interactions.</p>
                    <p>In the interaction between a user and a search system, two aspects play a
                        central role: (1) query formulation and reformulation and (2) the
                        examination and judgement of search results. Both topics have been addressed
                        before:</p>

                        <item>Query formulation and reformulation strategies in multi-query sessions

                                target="#rieh2006"/>. They distinguish query specification (making
                            the query narrower by adding one or more terms), query generalization
                            (making the query broader by removing one or more terms) and query
                            reformulation (replacing one or more terms by other terms without making
                            the query broader or narrower). The effect of query specification is
                            generally a higher precision and lower recall of relevant results in the
                            result set, while the effect of query generalization is the opposite. In
                            the case of faceted search interfaces, query formulation does not only
                            comprise the typing of textual queries, but also the selection of facet
                            values. Kules et al. <ptr target="#kules2009"/> found in an eye-tracking
                            study that users of a faceted search interface working on an exploratory
                            search task spent about 50 seconds per task looking at the results,
                            about 25 seconds looking at the facets, and only about 6 seconds looking
                            at the query itself. These results suggest that facets are important for
                            users with exploratory search tasks.</item>

                <p>RemBench connects four existing databases. The first two are RKDartists and
                    RKDimages, two art historical databases maintained by the Netherlands Institute
                    for Art History (RKD)<note>
                        <ref target="https://rkd.nl/en/">https://rkd.nl/en/</ref>
                    </note>. RKDartists is a database of biographical information about Dutch and
                    foreign artists from the middle ages to the present day. RKDimages is a database
                    with descriptions and images of mainly Dutch paintings, drawings, prints and
                    original photos from before the Second World War. For RemBench, a selection of
                    records from the RKD databases was made that only includes artists and images
                    that are related to Rembrandt van Rijn. The starting point for this selection
                    was the record of Rembrandt himself in RKDartists. In the selection of artists,
                    all artists were included that are mentioned in the Rembrandt record (either as
                        <q>pupil of</q>, <q>teacher of</q>, <q>followed by</q>, <q>influenced by</q>
                    or <q>had influence on</q>). In the selection of images, all works of art from
                    RKDimages were included that have been created by one of the artists in the
                    artist selection. The resulting selection consists of 1,857 works of art and 59
                    artists. </p>
                <p>The third database connected to RemBench is RemDoc,<note>
                        <ref target="http://www.remdoc.org/">http://www.remdoc.org</ref></note> the
                    digital collection of primary documents that relate to the life and works of
                    Rembrandt van Rijn. In the RemDoc project, all known documents have been
                    collected and disclosed that relate to Rembrandt, as a person and as an artist,
                    as well as to his ancestors, family, offspring and business partners, from the
                    15th to 18th centuries. The database contains 2,003 documents. Since all these
                    are related to Rembrandt, all were included in RemBench.</p>
                <p>The fourth database in RemBench is a university library catalogue, digitized and
                    disclosed through the RUQuest<note>
                        <ref target="http://www.ru.nl/library/vm/ruquest/"
                            >http://www.ru.nl/library/vm/ruquest</ref></note> system, a library
                    search system that provides access to the full collection of the Radboud
                    University Library, and full-text articles of all journals that Radboud
                    University subscribes to. From the data available through RUQuest, a selection
                    was made that is defined by all records that are returned for the query
                        <q>Rembrandt</q> (68,958 records in total). </p>
                <p>The RemBench project consisted of two phases: First, the metadata of the four
                    databases were connected by mapping them onto one common metadata scheme.
                    Second, a search engine was developed to disclose the data in these databases.
                    The technology for faceted search and free text search that allows the user to
                    search all databases at once was developed by the Huygens Institute for the
                    History of the Netherlands using Apache Solr.<note>
                        <ref target="http://lucene.apache.org/solr/"
                            >http://lucene.apache.org/solr/</ref>
                    </note> The four databases were treated as four separate verticals in the
                    interface, not merging the results in one result list. The main reason for that
                    decision came from the art historians in the research team: They argued that
                    four different groups of results would be more clear to the user. By doing so,
                    the challenge of ranking the results from the different verticals relative to
                    each other <ptr target="#ponnuswami2011"/> was avoided. In the user interface,
                    the verticals are labelled <q>Works of art</q> (group of results from
                    RKDimages), <q>Artists</q> (group of results from RKDartists), <q>Primary
                        Sources</q> (group of results from RemDoc), and <q>Library Sources</q>
                    (group of results from RUQuest). In every vertical, maximally five results are
                    shown on the front page. To see more results (in an overlay screen), the user
                    has to click <q>More</q>.</p>
                <p>The RemBench user interface was designed by a professional designer, in
                    interaction with art historians, who added their specific wishes. The beta
                    version of RemBench was used in the user observation study described in the next
                    section.</p>

            <div>
                <head>4. User study</head>
                <p>As introduced in Section 1, we set up a user study for the observation of
                    information-seeking behaviour by the target group of RemBench. Based on the
                    observed information-seeking behaviour, we address the first research question:
                        <q>What are the requirements for a search engine that is geared towards the
                        art history domain?</q> For the user study, we adopt the methods for
                    usability testing described in Section 2.2: we asked users from the target group
                    to work with RemBench and to describe their actions and motivations using a
                        <term>thinking aloud</term> protocol. We provided the subjects with a number
                    of information problems and asked them to find the answers using RemBench. This
                    set-up allows us to observe the information-seeking behaviour of RemBench users. </p>
                <div>
                    <head>4.1. Design, materials and procedure</head>
                    <p>Students of history and art history (bachelor and master level) from Radboud
                        University were recruited to participate in the user study; nine
                        participants (2 male, 7 female, median age 20,5) in total. The participants
                        were paid a volunteer fee of €10.</p>
                    <p>The task for the students was to find the best possible answers to a series
                        of questions related to Rembrandt, using RemBench. Each participant was
                        given 10 questions (see Section 4.2), one at a time. Some of the questions
                        expected a single answer (yes/no, name, title, place), others a list of
                        items. The participants were asked to use all functionalities of RemBench
                        they needed to find the answers and stop their search when they felt that
                        they had tried everything to find the answers. It was emphasized in the
                        instructions that not their capabilities were not being tested, but the
                        usability of RemBench. </p>
                    <p>The participants were working on a Windows 7 PC with Firefox. A researcher
                        started the RemBench homepage for them and gave them the list of questions
                        to work with.</p>
                    <p>User-system interaction was observed using a thinking-aloud set-up <ptr
                            target="#gerjets2011"/>: The participants were asked to voice their
                        thinking process aloud, what actions they took in the search process and why
                        they took them. Before the participants started working with RemBench, they
                        were asked to orally describe the route they take from home to the
                        university and count the number of traffic lights, as a way of familiarizing
                        them with the thinking-aloud procedure <ptr target="#vanwaes2000"/>. A
                        researcher was sitting next to the participant and took extensive notes of
                        what the participant did and said. The researcher tried to minimize the
                        number of interruptions of the participant, but in some cases she requested
                        the participant to go to the next question if the participant did not make
                        any progress in finding the answer(s) to a question. Desktop activity was
                        recorded using screen capture software,<note> BB FlashBack Express, <ref

                        behind the user. After 45 minutes, the researcher asked the participant to
                        finish the current question and skip the remaining questions.</p>
                    <p>After each question, the participants were asked to write down the answer
                        they found on paper, and give two evaluative judgments:</p>
                    <list type="unordered">
                        <item>How satisfied are you with the answer found? (5-point rating

                        <item>How satisfied are you with the use of RemBench for answering the
                            question? (5-point rating scale)</item>
                    </list>
                    <p>After finishing all questions, the participants were given a post-task
                        questionnaire with two evaluative questions:</p>

                    <head>4.2. Questions about Rembrandt </head>
                    <p>Two art historians from our research team (who are working in the Rembrandt
                        domain themselves) formulated a number of questions about Rembrandt that are
                        likely to be addressed by Rembrandt researchers. They provided 61 questions.
                        The questions were formulated independently of the possibilities of RemBench
                        as search tool; this implies that it is possible that for some of the
                        questions the answer cannot be found using RemBench. With these 61
                        questions, and nine participants who were each given 10 questions, some of
                        the questions could be offered twice, which made it possible to measure
                        agreement between the participants.</p>

                    <head>4.3. Annotation of the data</head>
                    <p>The thinking-aloud data, the screen recordings and the notes taken by the
                        researcher during the user observations were used afterwards to create an
                        annotated data set of search sessions. A search session is defined as the
                        series of all actions related to one question <ptr target="#sriram2004"/>.
                        The sessions were manually annotated with the following information: the
                        queries issued, the facets used, and the verticals used. In the case of
                        facets, <q>using</q> means <q>selecting at least one value of the facet</q>;
                        in the case of verticals, <q>using</q> means clicking at least one result
                        from a vertical, or interpreting the results shown for a vertical as
                        evidence for the answer.<note> These interpretations were expressed by the
                            users because of the thinking-aloud set-up</note> In the case that a
                        user opened a result and clicked on the permalink<note>A permalink is a
                            unique URL that points to one specific record in a database. A permalink
                            is meant to be stable for a long period of time. For example, the
                            permalink to the entry <title rend="quotes">the Nightwatch</title> in
                            RKDimages is <ref target="https://rkd.nl/en/explore/images/13893"

                        </note> to the original database (RKD, RemDoc or RUQuest), it was counted as
                        an additional use of a vertical. Examples of the annotation are in Table

                    <p>We classified the 61 questions phrased by the Rembrandt researchers in three
                        types, using the question taxonomies of Hermjakob et al. <ptr
                            target="#hermjakob2000"/> and Voorhees <ptr target="#voorhees2003"/>:
                        closed questions, factoid questions, and list questions. The distribution of
                        question types is shown in Table 2. Factoid questions are the most frequent,
                        but there is also a relatively large share of closed questions and list
                        questions. Note that list questions are the most difficult to answer because
                        they require exhaustive searching: In order to answer a question starting
                        with <q>which works are</q>, the user has to find <hi rend="italic">all</hi>
                        words for which the description in the question is true. Factoid questions
                        starting with <hi rend="italic">how many</hi> have the same characteristic
                        and can be equally difficult to answer.</p>

                            The overall counts are given in Table 3. The results show that on

                            deviation is large. Figure 2 shows the number of interactions (facets,

                        <p>In Figure 3 the distribution of numbers of queries in RemBench sessions
                            is compared to the distribution for library search and web search. The
                            average number of queries per session reported by Jansen et al. for the
                            Excite search engine was 1.6; for the MSN data, the average number of
                            queries per session is 1.5, which both are a bit lower than the 2.1 of
                            RemBench. For the TEL data, the average number of queries per session is
                            similar to RemBench: 2.0. </p>
                        <p>Figure 3 shows that especially the proportion of sessions with only one
                            query differs between the different search contexts. The high proportion
                            of sessions with one query can probably be explained by the high
                            proportion of navigational queries on the web (33% of web queries,
                            according to White and Drucker <ptr target="#white2007"/>), where the
                            user already knows which web page (s)he wants to find. The proportion of
                            one-query sessions increased between 2000 and 2006, probably because web
                            search engines became more efficient and users more often found what
                            they needed with one query. The proportion of single-query sessions in
                            the TEL logs is a bit smaller than for web search, but larger than for
                            RemBench.</p>

                        <p>Another difference between RemBench, TEL search, and web search is that
                            in the web search logs and the TEL logs there are no sessions without
                            queries. In the RemBench interaction data, there are four sessions
                            without text queries; in these cases, metadata filtering was sufficient
                            to answer the question. Examples are the question <q>Are there works of
                                Rembrandt in the collection Otterloo?</q>, where the user only
                            applied the location facet, and the question <q>Where were Rembrandt’s
                                children baptized?</q>, where the user only filtered for the value
                                <q>baptism, marriage and burial records</q> and found the answer
                            within the returned primary sources.</p>

                        <p>Figure 4 shows the number of interactions (facets, queries and verticals
                            used) for each individual participant. There is a fair amount of
                            divergence among users, especially in preferences between faceted search
                            or free text queries. User 3, for example, hardly used any facets, while
                            user 2 used more facets than text queries. The average satisfaction
                            scores of the users range between 2.1 and 3.6. </p>
                        <p>The relation between number of interactions and answer satisfaction is
                            analysed in Figure 5. It shows that for the questions with the lowest
                            satisfaction score, the highest number of queries was needed and for the
                            questions with the highest satisfaction score, the fewest queries were
                            needed. Kendall’s τ between the satisfaction score and the number of
                            queries is -1 (<hi rend="italic">p</hi>=0.027). There is no significant
                            relationship between the satisfaction score and the number of facets (τ
                            =-0.2, <hi rend="italic">p</hi>=0.81) or the number of verticals (τ =

                                first query issued by a user by definition starts a new

                            counted. The results are in Table 4. The results show that just like in
                            web search, the most frequent pattern is <q>new topic</q>. This is not
                            surprising since every first query of a session starts a new topic. The
                            proportion of <q>new topic</q>, however, is lower than in web search
                            data, because RemBench sessions contain more queries on average – hence
                            a smaller portion of queries are the start of a new topic. An important
                            difference with web search data is that generalization, specialization
                            and reformulation are similarly frequent in the RemBench data, whereas
                            the generalization and specialization are much more infrequent in web
                            search data. This indicates that it was relatively difficult for the
                            users to find the precise results they were looking for (not too
                            specific, not too general). In addition, for some topics, the
                            reformulations are shifts from Dutch to English or from English to
                            Dutch, e.g. the query <q>Rembrandt stadhuis</q> followed by the query
                                <q>Rembrandt city hall</q>. </p>

                            Scores were given on a rating scale of 1-5, 5 being the highest

                        <p>We studied the 15 questions that were addressed by two participants, in
                            order to get an impression of the agreement between the participants.
                            This agreement was low: weighted Cohen’s κ = 0.06, which indicates that
                            the agreement was only slightly higher than chance agreement. This
                            suggests that the evaluative judgments heavily depend on the individual
                            users. </p>
                        <p>We found a strong positive relationship between answer satisfaction and
                            usability satisfaction (Pearson’s <hi rend="italic">r</hi>=0.91,
                                N=54).<note>If the 5-point judgements would not be considered
                                interval data but ordinal data, then Kendall’s τ should be used.
                                This test also indicates a strong positive relationship between the
                                two variables (Kendall’s τ = 0.85, p&lt;0.001).</note> This
                            indicates that usability satisfaction was dependent on answer
                            satisfaction: If the user was not able to find the answer with RemBench,
                            then both the satisfaction with the answer and with RemBench are likely
                            to be low. This might also be one of the causes of the low agreement
                            between two users on the same question: a user who was able to find the
                            answer will be more positive than a user who did not find the
                            answer.</p>

                        <p>From the satisfaction scores per question, it can be deduced which
                            questions are more difficult to find answers to (low satisfaction
                            scores), and which are easier (high satisfaction scores). The lists of
                            most difficult and easiest questions are shown in Table 5. The table
                            confirms that the easier questions are generally closed questions and
                            factoid questions starting with <q>when</q>, <q>where</q>, <q>how
                                long</q>, etc. Many of the difficult questions are the list
                            questions, which require exhaustive searching (<q>find all …</q>, <q>how
                                many …</q>). Figure 6 shows the average answer satisfaction score
                            and average usability satisfaction score for the three question types in
                            our data: closed questions, factoid questions, and list questions.
                            According to the Mann-Whitney U-Test (for ordinal data in independent
                            samples), the difference in answer satisfaction between closed questions
                            and list questions is significant at the 0.05-level (<hi rend="italic"

                            be influenced by developers of a federated search engine that retrieves

                        <p>In order to meet comment 1, functionality was added for searching works
                            by one specific artist by adding a facet <q>Author/artist name</q> in
                            the final version of RemBench. The inconsistency between results for
                            English and Dutch queries (comment 2) confirms our observation in
                            Section 5.2.d that query reformulations are sometimes translations from
                            English from Dutch or from Dutch to English. The inconsistencies in
                            results between the two languages are not easy to solve: The databases
                            contain textual information in both English and Dutch, but not all
                            information is available in both languages. For example, RemDoc contains
                            transcriptions of 17<hi rend="superscript">th</hi>-century Dutch
                            documents together with translations of the documents in modern English,
                            while the modern Dutch translation is not included. Although this is a
                            relevant problem for multi-lingual databases, solving it is beyond the
                            scope of this research, because it requires expansion of the content of
                            the (external) databases. The same holds for comment 3, about finding
                            works of art with specific topics, because indexing depends on the
                            metadata that is available for works of art in RKDartists (see also the
                            work by Yee et al. <ptr target="#yee2003"/>, discussed in Section 2.2).
                            The selection of metadata values for topics in works of art leads to a
                            bias towards the retrieval of relevant works: only the topics that exist
                            as labels in the metadata, and only the works that have been labelled
                            with these topics can in theory be found with a text-based retrieval
                            engine. For example, a painting with a dog that has not been labelled
                            with the topic <q>dog</q>, cannot be found by a text-based retrieval
                            engine for the query <q>dog</q>.</p>
                        <p>Since only topics of works of art that have been described in the
                            metadata can be found, it might be valuable to expand the topical
                            annotation of works of art in future work, for example by crowd sourcing
                                <ptr target="#trant2009"/>. The value of topic annotations for image
                            search in the historical domain has also been pointed out by Choi and
                            Rasmussen <ptr target="#choi2003"/>. They find that subject descriptors
                            that represent the image content were very important for user
                            satisfaction. Thus they recommend: <cit>
                                <quote rend="inline" source="#choi2003">For optimal access,
                                    representations for images should provide access to the topic of
                                    the image and objects within the image, namely, what is
                                    portrayed in the image as well as what the image is
                                    about</quote>
                                <ptr target="#choi2003" loc="508"/>
                            </cit>.</p>
                        <p>Comments numbered 4 - 6 are related to each other. The users often had
                            problems finding the exact answer because they got too many irrelevant
                            results. This resulted in more time needed for finding the answer. The
                            large amount of results was in many cases caused by the presence of the
                            word <q>Rembrandt</q> in the query (e.g. the query <q>Rembrandt dogs</q>
                            for the question <q>Did Rembrandt paint dogs?</q>). For a query with
                            both terms, the search system returns all documents that contain both
                            terms <hi rend="italic">or</hi> one of the two terms. The Boolean
                            operator AND could be helpful here (which is allowed in the Solr query
                            interface, but not used by the participants), requiring that the
                            returned results contain both terms. In the final version of RemBench,
                            discounting of the term weight for the query term <q>Rembrandt</q> was
                            implemented, in order to ensure that for queries with the word
                                <q>Rembrandt</q> and some other word(s), results that contain only
                            the other words (e.g. <q>dog</q>) are ranked higher than results that
                            contain only the word Rembrandt.<note>It should be noted here that if a
                                search system provides good ranking of the results, the Boolean AND
                                operator should not be necessary, because results with both terms
                                present should be ranked higher in the result list than results with
                                one of the two terms. Also, query terms that occur in few documents
                                    (<q>dogs</q>) should be weighted heavier than query terms that
                                occur in many documents (<q>Rembrandt</q>). Although this term
                                characteristic (<q>inverted document frequency</q>) is a component
                                of the ranking algorithm in Solr (see <ref
                                    target="http://www.solrtutorial.com/solr-search-relevancy.html"
                                    >http://www.solrtutorial.com/solr-search-relevancy.html</ref>),
                                it was sometimes difficult for the participants to get the results
                                they wanted for queries with one or more high frequent
                            terms.</note></p>

                    are discussed.</p>

                    <head>6.1. Requirements for a search engine in the art-history domain</head>
                    <p>In order to answer the first research question, the questions asked by
                        Rembrandt researchers, the interactions of the subjects with RemBench and
                        the user satisfaction were analysed (See Section 5), leading to the
                        following conclusions:</p>
                    <list type="ordered">
                        <item>RemBench users enter more queries per session than web search users;
                            the distribution of queries per session is more similar to sessions in
                            digital library search. This reflects the informational nature of the
                            questions in a specific topic domain, as opposed to the high proportion
                            of navigational queries on the web. Still, the average number of queries
                            needed per question is relatively low (2.0), which indicates that the
                            RemBench search interface allows for efficient information
                            seeking.</item>
                        <item>The combination of different source types is highly important in the
                            art history domain. Four databases were combined as four different
                            verticals in the search interface. This was preferred by domain experts,
                            and also highly valued by the participants of the user study. Especially
                            the combination of works of art, primary and secondary sources was
                            considered an important asset of RemBench.</item>
                        <item>Both free-text search and facet filtering were actively used by the
                            observed participants. There were individual differences in the
                            frequency of use of queries and facets: Some users preferred free-text
                            searching, while others had a preference for filtering facets. This
                            finding confirms the value of faceted search interfaces for
                            domain-specific information-seeking tasks. </item>
                        <item>The users appreciated the presence of multi-lingual data (Dutch and
                            English) in the connected databases. However, they were critical about
                            the cross-lingual access to the data. In many cases, they had to try
                            their queries in both English and Dutch in order to get the results that
                            they wanted. This illustrates the challenge of managing databases with
                            multilingual content and shows the importance of cross-lingual
                            information access to multilingual data. </item>
                        <item>A search environment for a highly specific domain (such as Rembrandt)
                            requires domain-dependent treatment of the data and in some cases also
                            of the queries. Domain-specificity requires pre-selection of relevant
                            data from the connected databases (see Section 3). In addition, term
                            discounting for the specific query term <q>Rembrandt</q> had to be
                            implemented, because it was difficult for the participants to get the
                            exact results they wanted for queries containing this high frequent term
                            (see Section 5.3.c). More analysis in future work is required in order
                            to answer the question that arises from the analysis: under what
                            circumstances does a highly specific topic domain require
                            domain-specific re-weighting of query terms, and when are the ordinary
                            term weighting variables (term frequency, inverted document frequency)

                    <head>6.2. Recommendations for the design of a user observation study </head>
                    <p>Previous research has shown that for most usability tests, the proportion of
                        additional usability problems found when adding test users quickly decreases
                        after five users. This was confirmed by the user study: Nine participants
                        were enough to discover all usability issues. The thinking-aloud protocol
                        was successful. When a researcher makes extensive notes, no microphone
                        recordings are necessary. In addition, screen capture was more useful than
                        camera recordings, which provided very little additional information about
                        the behaviour of the user. </p>
                    <p>There is a strong correlation between answer satisfaction and usability
                        satisfaction, and the agreement between two users trying to find the answer
                        to the same question is low. This confirms that information seeking tasks
                        cannot be evaluated independently of usability. This is not necessarily
                        problematic, but should be taken into account in the design of future
                        usability studies for information seeking: The more difficult the task, the
                        lower the users’ judgements of the usability. List questions receive the
                        lowest satisfaction scores (significantly lower than closed questions), and
                        require the most interactions (significantly more than factoid questions). </p>
                    <p>Three limitations of the presented user study should be acknowledged: First,
                        the introduction of an externally imposed information need (a question
                        formulated by someone else) is an efficient way of studying
                        information-seeking behaviour. It implies, however, that the participants
                        were not the <q>owners</q> of the questions. As a result, no strong
                        conclusions can be drawn about user effort (number of queries issued, number
                        of results inspected), because the amount of effort that a user puts into a
                        search task depends on the urgency and importance of his research question –
                        aspects that are unknown for non-owners. In addition, research by
                        Chouldechova and Mease <ptr target="#chouldechova2013"/> has shown that
                        topic owners are better capable of judging the relevance of retrieved
                        results than non-owners. Especially for the questions that required an
                        (exhaustive) search for elements of a list (e.g. <q>list all...</q>, <q>how
                            many...</q>) it was difficult for a user who is not the owner of the
                        information need to judge the completeness of the answer. </p>
                    <p>The second limitation is that the retrieval effectiveness as perceived by the
                        user is limited by the content of the underlying databases. Information that
                        is not contained in the database, such as topical metadata labels for
                        images, cannot be retrieved by the user. In addition to that, users tend to
                        trust the information retrieved and the ranking by the search engine <ptr
                            target="#pan2007"/>: they click on the highest-ranked results. If users
                        have high trust with the search engine, while relevant information is
                        missing from the underlying databases or the relevant information is ranked
                        too low by the search engine, the results found by the users for their
                        research questions are biased <ptr target="#keane2008"/>. This effect is
                        stronger if users do not know what they have <hi rend="italic">not</hi>
                        found. We saw that large individual differences exist in how persevering and
                        critical users are when they try to find the information they need. In
                        future research, this user characteristic should be taken into account: when
                        does a user decide to stop searching, either because he (thinks he) has
                        found the information he needed, or because he gives up on finding the
                        information <ptr target="#baskaya2013"/>? </p>
                    <p>The third limitation of the study is that all participants were students. One
                        risk of this is that the information-seeking behaviour of students differs
                        from the behaviour of (older) researchers <ptr target="#weiler2005"/>.
                        According to Rowlands et al. <ptr target="#rowlands2008"/>, the generation
                        who grew up with Google-style search relies <cit>
                            <quote rend="inline" source="#rowlands2008">heavily on search engines,
                                view rather than read and do not possess the critical and analytical
                                skills to assess the information that they find on the web</quote>
                            <ptr target="#rowlands2008" loc="290"/>
                        </cit>. On the other hand, the authors state that the impact of ICT on this
                        generation should not be overestimated, and that <quote rend="inline"

                        researchers than as ad hoc searchers when they are put in a working context
                        such as the RemBench user study. Future research should address the
                        differences between students and researchers in their information-seeking
                        behaviour.</p>

                <head>7. Conclusion</head>
                <p>A user observation study with RemBench, a domain-specific federated search engine
                    in the art history domain, provided several important insights. First, the study
                    confirmed the importance of different source types (primary and secondary
                    sources, textual and graphical sources) for the art history domain, which is not
                    an atypical domain in the humanities; e.g. archaeology, media studies,
                    historical literary and linguistic studies often work with combinations of
                    textual and graphical sources. We showed that different source types from
                    multiple databases can successfully be combined in a <term>federated
                        search</term> engine. Second, we found that although there are large
                    individual differences in the preferred information seeking style, <term>faceted
                        search</term> is a highly valued functionality. In addition, the study
                    presented in this paper showed that the usability of domain-specific search
                    engines can be evaluated successfully using a thinking-aloud protocol with a
                    small number of participants, but that the measures usability satisfaction
                    depends on the difficulty of the task given to the user.</p>
