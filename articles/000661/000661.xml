			<head>Introduction</head>
			<p>In 2016, the <title rend="italic">Project Endings</title> team, a group of experienced
				digital humanities (DH) scholars, librarians, and programmers at the University
				of Victoria in British Columbia, Canada, was awarded a multi-year grant from the
				Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council (SSHRC) of Canada to explore
				questions around the ending and archiving of DH projects. The overarching goals
				of <title rend="italic">Project Endings</title> are <quote rend="inline">to align the aims of faculty
				researchers producing projects and the archivists who will eventually be
				responsible for curating their work</quote> and <quote rend="inline">to provide practical solutions to
				issues attendant on ending a project and archiving the digital products of
				research, including not only data but also interactive applications and
				web-based publications</quote> <ptr target="#arneil2019"/>.</p>
			<p>From a brief review of SSHRC-funded digital projects conducted between 2000 and
				2009, the <title rend="italic">Project Endings</title> team had learned that many of
				these projects had no visible surviving digital outputs. This motivated us to
				seek hard data about the status of digital projects from other countries and
				other funding programs in order to produce quantitative and qualitative data to
				support future recommendations. The first task of the research aspect of <title
					rend="italic">Project Endings</title> was to conduct a survey, which was sent
				to DH scholars, including faculty members, researchers, programmers, and
				librarians across Canada and around the world, via various DH and library email
				lists. In total, 127 survey responses were received. The survey consisted of 37
				questions in total, and sought information on topics such as project beginning
				and end dates, completion status, respondent’s career stage, project planning
				considerations, institutional support, major tools and technologies used,
				project maintenance, and major obstacles to project preservation. The full list
				of questions can be found online (<ref
					target="https://hcmc.uvic.ca/endings/survey.html"
					>https://hcmc.uvic.ca/endings/survey.html</ref>). Survey results showed
				that more than half of survey respondents had not set an endpoint for their
				projects, and had no long-term plans for project preservation. 38% of
				respondents listed a lack of ongoing funding as the main obstacle they faced in
				preserving their projects long-term, while 33% of respondents listed a lack of
				expertise or poor choices in technology as their main obstacle <ptr target="#arneil2019"/>. Furthermore, as Arneil et al. (<ref target="#arneil2019">2019</ref>) state:</p>
			<cit><quote rend="block">While a reassuringly high 42% of respondents reported that university services
				were responsible for long-term maintenance of the project’s work, an alarming
				45% reported that this responsibility fell to the Principal Investigator or
				nobody, demonstrating either significant vulnerability or great confidence.</quote></cit>
			<p>At the end of the survey, respondents were asked whether they were interested in
				participating in an interview with the <title rend="italic">Project Endings</title>
				team to further elaborate on their responses and to have a more in-depth
				conversation about the issues facing DH work. In our approach to the interview
				process and subsequent analysis, we looked to qualitative methodologies such as
				constructivist grounded theory, narrative inquiry, and phenomenology in order to
				faithfully represent the diverse experiences of interview participants. The
				methodological principles of these approaches align with the collaborative
				nature of <title rend="italic">Project Endings</title> and have allowed us to
				collaboratively co-construct knowledge with research participants. This
				knowledge has been mobilized in a number of practical and tangible ways, such as
				through conference presentations and scholarly publications (e.g., <ptr target="#carlin2018"/>), as well as through the development of toolkits for ending and archiving
				digital projects, which are being made available to the DH community. The
				purpose of this paper is to summarize the methodological foundations of the <title
					rend="italic">Project Endings</title> interviews and to demonstrate how these
				foundations have been reflected in the interviews and subsequent analysis
				conducted by the <title rend="italic">Project Endings</title> team. I will also
				discuss the many ways in which knowledge has been co-constructed by participants
				over the course of the <title rend="italic">Project Endings</title> interviews and
				analysis, as well as through the Endings Symposium in April 2021. Finally, I
				will provide a brief summary of the interview analysis. </p></div>
			<div>
				<head>The <title rend="italic"
					>Project Endings</title> Interviews</head>
			<p>After gathering quantitative data through the survey, we wanted to gather more
				in-depth qualitative data about participants’ experiences around the human and
				technological factors that have contributed to or impeded the completion of
				their digital projects. From the 127 survey responses received, we conducted 25
				semi-structured interviews in the spring and summer of 2018. The interview team
				comprised three <title rend="italic">Project Endings</title> primary investigators
				(PIs) — one from each of three primary areas of expertise (i.e. one faculty
				member, one librarian, and one programmer) — as well as myself (Comeau) as a
				research assistant, mainly for administrative and technical support. All
				interviews except one were conducted via Skype and recorded on a PI’s laptop
				using an external multidirectional microphone in the interview room. One
				interview was conducted in person and recorded on a standalone microphone. Once
				interviewees confirmed their consent to being interviewed and to their
				interviews being recorded, they were invited to describe their project(s) to the
				interview team. Following this initial question, which provided context for the
				interviewee’s narratives, our two main questions were: “In retrospect, what
				would you have done differently to improve the possibilities for
				archiving/preservation?” and “What decisions, plans, and measures proved
				effective and beneficial?” Interviewers then asked follow-up questions based on
				the interviewees’ responses to these initial questions, and often offered
				comments. Each interview was transcribed verbatim in order to facilitate text
				encoding and analysis. Following this transcription, all interviews were encoded
				in TEI-XML (the eXtensible Markup Language of the Text Encoding Initiative)
				using the oXygen XML Editor. Encoding was done to make the interviews machine
				readable and to enable various analysis techniques using different applications,
				as well as to facilitate data archiving. Transcription and encoding of all
				interviews were conducted by myself (Comeau) and Danny Martin, another research
				assistant at the UVic Humanities Computing and Media Centre. </p>
			<p>In line with the overall goals of <title rend="italic">Project Endings</title>, these
				interviews sought the diverse perspectives and experiences of DH scholars in a
				variety of academic roles related to digital projects, including as faculty
				researchers, programmers and developers, archivists, and librarians. The
				questions asked during the interviews were intended to point towards practical
				solutions for ending and archiving digital projects. </p></div>
			<div>
			<head>Methodological Foundations</head>
			<p>In this study, we have followed the principles of constructivist grounded theory,
				narrative inquiry, and phenomenology to conduct the interviews and the
				subsequent analysis. These approaches have influenced our management of the
				research process, our self-location within the research, and our interpretations
				of the perspectives and experiences shared with us. These methodological
				approaches have allowed us to co-construct knowledge in a number of ways, such
				as through narrative over the course of the interviews, collaboratively as a
				team through the process of analyzing the interviews, and through in-depth
				discussions with each other and with fellow DH scholars (previous interviewees)
				at the Endings Symposium in 2021. </p></div>
			<div>
			<head>Constructivist Grounded Theory</head>
			<p>A constructivist grounded theory (CGT) approach <quote rend="inline">aims to locate the research
				participants within the social, cultural, temporal, and situational conditions
				in which they live and to recognize how structural conditions and positions
				affect the researcher and the research process</quote> <ptr target="#charmaz2020" loc="168"/>. In this
				approach, it is important for the researcher to reflect not only on the holistic
				context of participants’ perspectives, but also on their own perspectives and
				positionality within the research. According to <ref target="#coghlan2014">Coghlan and Brydon-Miller (2014)</ref>, <quote rend="inline">positionality refers to the stance or positioning of the researcher in
				relation to the social and political context of the study — the community, the
				organization or the participant group</quote> (628). These contexts influence every stage of
				the research process. The positionality of the researchers includes our
				individual experiences as university-affiliated DH scholars, developers, and
				librarians, as well as our access to institutional resources and support — both
				individually and collectively through <title rend="italic">Project Endings</title> and
				other DH projects.</p>
			<p>CGT recommends the use of interviews as an emergent and collaborative process
				where the interviewer and the interviewee co-construct the research data through
				an <quote rend="inline">exploration of the interviewee’s experiences and perspectives</quote> <ptr target="#charmaz2021" loc="317"/>. In terms of analysis, Charmaz and Thornberg recommend
				using line-by-line coding and memo-writing to determine what lines of data mean
				individually and in connection with each other. These were the primary tools we
				used in analyzing the <title rend="italic">Project Endings</title> interviews. While
				we did not conduct any preliminary coding during the data collection period, as
				Charmaz and Thornberg (2021) recommend, we did reflect on the data after each
				interview and considered how to refine our follow-up questions in subsequent
				interviews. </p>
			<p>One of the main aims of the research interviews was to understand the context of
				participants’ experiences and perspectives on ending and archiving DH projects.
				This research emerged from <title rend="italic">Project Endings</title> PIs’ own
				complex experiences with project endings. The <title rend="italic">Project
					Endings</title> PIs have openly shared their own perspectives and interests
				throughout the research process, and have continually reflected on the <quote rend="inline">social,
				historical, local, and interactional contexts</quote> of both participants’ experiences
				and their own, acknowledging their positionality within the project specifically
				and in the research field more generally <ptr target="#charmaz2021" loc="315"/>. </p></div>
			<div>
			<head>Narrative Inquiry</head>
			<p>A narrative inquiry approach is a collaborative process <ptr target="#butlerkisber2019"/> where
				researchers and participants work together to <quote rend="inline">make sense of experience and
					organise it into a body of practical knowledge</quote> <ptr target="#mertova2020" loc="18–19"/>. As with CGT, an important aspect of a narrative inquiry approach is
				reflexivity, in terms of what perspectives and preconceptions the researchers
				bring to the research process <ptr target="#butlerkisber2019"/>. Using this approach, we have
				been able to share participants’ experiences <quote rend="inline">holistically in all [their]
					complexity and richness</quote> <ptr target="#mertova2020" loc="2"/>, acknowledging that
				the experiences shared with us are situated within specific contexts and that
				our understanding of these experiences can change over time. As <ref target="#butlerkisber2019">Butler-Kisber (2019)</ref> explains, narrative inquiry <quote rend="inline">illustrates the selectivity of
				experience</quote> as iterative and continuous and <quote rend="inline">emphasizes the social and
					contextual aspects of understanding</quote> (4–5).</p>
			<p>This study follows a narrative inquiry approach in a number of ways. The
				interviews, and later the symposium, provided participants with the space to
				share their experiences in a relatively low-pressure environment. Participants
				were asked whether or not they consented to the interview process (both the
				audio recording and transcription thereof) at the beginning of each interview,
				and were given the option of veto-power or full anonymity in terms of how their
				narratives were shared. This allowed participants to speak as freely as they
				wished, particularly about any potentially negative experiences. Through
				narrative, participants were able to represent their experiences in their own
				words, interpreting events that they felt were important to the general topic of
				the interviews — ending and archiving digital projects. </p>
			<p>
				<title rend="italic">Project Endings</title> team members were acquainted with a
				number of the interviewees prior to this project, and as peers and members of
				the DH community, we also share many parallel experiences with the interviewees.
				As an observer more than an active participant in the interviews, I witnessed
				this peer relationship as important to creating trust in the interview process
				and in allowing interviewees to feel safe enough to be honest about their
				experiences and perspectives. <ref target="#mertova2020">Mertova and Webster (2019)</ref> illustrate,
				through educational experience narratives, how interviews allow participants to
				reorder their experiences <quote rend="inline">into a usable past and present, with the aim of
				promoting an understanding of that experience and perhaps providing insights
				into our judgements</quote> (9).</p>
			<p>Not only did the interviews themselves deploy a narrative approach, the analysis
				of the interviews also followed a narrative inquiry approach. The interview
				analysis was a collaborative process between <title rend="italic">Project
					Endings</title> PIs and research assistants; we reflected upon common and
				recurring themes in the interviews. Our analysis was iterative in that our
				interpretation of the interviews as a whole evolved continually as new themes
				emerged. We have collectively developed a narrative of the interview analysis
				and of this research as a whole, and this narrative continues to shift as <title
					rend="italic">Project Endings</title> team members conduct further analyses
				and gain new insights into the data. </p></div>
			<div>
			<head>Phenomenology</head>
			<p>A phenomenological approach to research goes beyond describing experiences
				empirically; it attempts to interpret experiences in order to understand their
				meaning, how they arise, and how they relate to each other <ptr target="#cresswell2007"/> <ptr target="#engelland2020"/> <ptr target="#zahavi2019"/>. According to Hopp (<ref target="#hopp2020">2020</ref>), phenomenology
				<quote rend="inline">is a search for genuine understanding, an attempt to render objects, relations,
					and states of affairs intelligible</quote> (p. <ref target="#hopp2020">243</ref>). <ref target="#zahavi2019">Zahavi (2019)</ref> further
				elaborates, explaining that <quote rend="inline">for many phenomenologists, the task of
				phenomenology is not to describe empirical and factual particularities, but to
				investigate the essential structures characterizing our experiences, their
				correlates, and the connection between the two</quote> (44). </p>
			<p> Similar to CGT and narrative inquiry, research using a phenomenological approach
				often entails <quote rend="inline">in-depth interviewing, preferably over time, and open-ended
				questions that draw out accounts of experience, their descriptions and
				explanations</quote> <ptr target="#butlerkisber2019" loc="4"/>. <ref target="#cresswell2007">Cresswell et al. (2007)</ref>
				explain that in contrast with grounded theory, which gathers participant views
				in order to generate theoretical models, phenomenology <quote rend="inline">describe[s] what all
				participants have in common as they experience a phenomenon</quote> (252). The researcher
				collects data from participants <quote rend="inline">who have experienced the phenomenon and
				develops a composite description of the essence of the experience for all the
				individuals — what they experienced and how they experienced it</quote> <ptr target="#cresswell2007" loc="252–253"/>.<note> This work is ongoing and will result in a final
					journal article on the <title rend="italic">Project Endings</title>
					interviews.</note>
			</p>
			<p>Several authors make a distinction between psychological and hermeneutical
				phenomenology. In psychological phenomenology, researchers employ transcendental
				reduction to set aside their own experiences and preconceptions, become
				essentially <quote rend="inline">spectator[s] to experience</quote> <ptr target="#engelland2020" loc="8"/>, and <quote rend="inline">take a
					fresh perspective of the phenomenon under examination</quote> <ptr target="#cresswell2007" loc="254"/>. According to <ref target="#engelland2020">Engelland (2020)</ref>, <quote rend="inline">the point of the transcendental
				reduction is to step back, [and] to retrace the steps that make experience
				happen</quote> (6). Proponents of this approach argue that it allows researchers to focus
				more on understanding participants’ experiences rather than their own
				interpretations <ptr target="#butlerkisber2019"/>. <ref target="#cresswell2007">Cresswell et al. (2007)</ref> explain
				that while researchers may aim towards entirely <quote rend="inline">bracketing out their views
				before proceeding with the experiences of others</quote> (254), it is rarely achieved
				perfectly. In contrast, hermeneutical phenomenology focuses on interpreting
				lived experiences through the researcher’s lens. As <ref target="#butlerkisber2019">Butler-Kisber (2019)</ref>
				explains, hermeneutical phenomenology <quote rend="inline">move[s] beyond description to
				interpretation where the researcher actively takes a role in explaining
				participant meanings</quote> (3). The use of a phenomenological approach in the <title
					rend="italic">Project Endings</title> interviews sits somewhere between these
				two approaches, though perhaps leaning more towards hermeneutical phenomenology:
				while we have made a point of trying to set aside our own perspectives in order
				to describe and organize interview data accurately, a major aspect of this study
				has been to understand participant narratives as they relate to our own
				experiences as DH scholars. </p></div>
			<div>
			<head>Co-constructing Knowledge</head>
			<p> There are few references in the literature to the co-construction of knowledge as
				an intentional practice, particularly in DH research. Rather, the
				co-construction of knowledge seems to be more often described as a result of
				particular qualitative methodologies, such as narrative inquiry. As such, there
				is no clear consensus on what co-constructing knowledge looks like, since
				qualitative methodologies are used in such wide and varied contexts. However,
				one idea that emerges repeatedly in the literature is the importance of active
				participation by all actors in the research task or process. For example,
				<ref target="#assmuth2015">Assmuth and Lyytimaki (2015)</ref> talk about the importance of
				participation in environmental impact assessments, saying that <quote rend="inline">impact
				assessments serve as tools for co-constructing knowledge for policy-making,
				planning and associated resolution of conflicts</quote> (341–342). The authors also describe an
				open web-platform, called Opasnet, which <quote rend="inline">collects, synthesizes and distributes
				scientific and other factual information,</quote> and where users can <quote rend="inline">[engage in]
				research, store and display data, make and run models, and perform assessments,
				and discuss all of that work in one workspace</quote> <ptr target="#assmuth2015" loc="343"/>. In another example, <ref target="#enloe2021">Enloe et al. (2021)</ref> describe a study they conducted
				where they used photovoice methods — where participants are provided with
				cameras and invited to take photos of places and objects in their lives that
				they connect to a prompt from the researcher — combined with interviews,
				workshops, and field visits, to learn about the needs and priorities of farmers
				in Malawi. This method <quote rend="inline">supported a process of co-constructing agroecological
					knowledge</quote> <ptr target="#enloe2021" loc="1083"/> by <quote rend="inline">provid[ing] a platform through which
				researchers, practitioners, and farmers could learn from each other, identify
				priorities for trainings and research, and determine next steps for generating
				new, locally applicable agroecological strategies</quote> (pp. <ref target="#enloe2021">1098–1099</ref>). These
				examples reflect what <ref target="#pratt2019">Pratt (2019)</ref> describes as the process of
				co-constructing knowledge, which involves <quote rend="inline">bringing together multiple kinds of
				knowledge and multiple perspectives to construct an understanding of research
				phenomena based on a plurality of situated knowledges</quote> (806).</p>
				<p>According to <ref target="#pratt2019">Pratt (2019)</ref>, the co-construction of knowledge is an important aspect
				of public health research, particularly in studies where community-based
				participatory research methods are used and where social justice is a goal of
				the research. In Pratt’s model of knowledge co-construction, researchers and
				participants <quote rend="inline">design and conduct research together in ways that achieve the
				purpose of both sets of actors</quote> and share responsibilities for <quote rend="inline">decision-making
					in all phases of research projects</quote> <ptr target="#pratt2019" loc="806"/>. Pratt does acknowledge,
				however, that there is a range of public engagement within participatory
				research methods, from <quote rend="inline">informing and consultation to power‐sharing strategies
				of partnership</quote> (p. <ref target="#pratt2019">806</ref>).</p>
				<p> In terms of news journalism, <ref target="#conradie2012">Conradie (2012)</ref> explains that <quote rend="inline">interviews
				represent a special form of dialogue in which knowledge is co-constructed
				between two or more participants</quote> and which <quote rend="inline">differs markedly from everyday
				conversations</quote> (499) in a number of ways. For instance, there is generally a power
				difference between interviewers and interviewees, however slight, where the
				interviewer has more control over the interaction and resulting texts. As well,
				participants’ roles in the interview process are governed by particular rules
				and conventions — for instance, interviewers <quote rend="inline">[determine] the topic and duration
				of the discussion</quote> while interviewees <quote rend="inline">respond within the limits already
					demarcated by the [interviewer]</quote> <ptr target="#conradie2012" loc="499"/>. Additionally, all 
				participants understand that the knowledge they co-construct <quote rend="inline">will eventually be
				viewed by the public,</quote> which can influence what information is shared during the
					interview <ptr target="#conradie2012" loc="499"/>. Through the <title rend="italic">Project
					Endings</title> interviews, participants — both interviewers and interviewees
					– co-constructed knowledge by sharing narratives. Much as <ref target="#conradie2012">Conradie (2012)</ref>
				illustrates through news interviews, the roles of the interview participants in
				our research, and in the subsequent symposium, were clearly defined between
				interviewer and interviewee. The methodological approaches listed above
				(constructivist grounded theory, narrative inquiry, and phenomenology) allowed
				us to co-construct knowledge throughout the interview and analysis processes,
				and later through the Endings Symposium, both within our research team and with
				fellow DH scholars as interview and symposium participants. </p></div>
			<div>
			<head>Analyzing the Interviews </head>
			<p>Before analyzing the interviews, the <title rend="italic">Project Endings</title> team
				(including PIs and research assistants) met to establish a basic taxonomy of
				codes to guide the analysis. We discussed the recurring themes we noticed from
				our experiences conducting, transcribing, and reading the interviews, and
				grouped our impressions into twelve broad themes: Data; Documentation; Funding;
				Hosting; Institutional issues; Migration; Project management; Project outputs;
				Rights; Scholarly or academic issues; Storage, backup, and preservation; and
				Team. This taxonomy continued to evolve over the course of the analysis process,
				as each of these twelve broad themes came to include a number of narrower codes.
				We met around a large table, with emergent themes written on slips of paper, and
				grouped them into categories. In total, 200 individual codes were established
				through our analysis of the interviews. See Appendix A for a full summarized
				list of the themes and narrow codes. </p>
			<p> The first few interviews were analyzed through line-by-line coding by Danny
				Martin and myself (Comeau). For inter-coder reliability, we would encode our
				individual analyses separately in XML, and then meet to discuss any
				discrepancies between our analyses, eventually coming to a consensus on the
				final codes. Once we had established a process for conducting the analysis that
				was straightforward and replicable, we demonstrated this process to the rest of
				the <title rend="italic">Project Endings</title> team, after which all team members
				took part in analyzing the remaining interviews. Each interview was
				independently analyzed by two researchers, who then resolved and merged their
				coding choices. In order to facilitate analysis on such an extensive dataset,
					<title rend="italic">Project Endings</title> team member Martin Holmes developed
				a schema to aid in the visualization of our analyses. Figure 1, below,
				illustrates how this schema was used to visualize our analyses, with an example
				from an interview with participant James Cummings. The various colours denote
				the themes of <q>Rights,</q> <q>Storage, backup, and preservation,</q> <q>Funding,</q> <q>Data,</q>
				<q>Institutional Issues,</q> and <q>Documentation.</q></p>

			<p>These interviews and the subsequent analysis led directly to the 2021 Endings
				Symposium. Symposium speakers were selected from the scholars we interviewed in
				2018, and the key issues that emerged from our analysis of the interviews guided
				us in selecting both the symposium speakers and the major topics that would
				guide the symposium discussions. A more in-depth discussion of the interview
				analysis and results will be published in future articles by <title rend="italic"
					>Project Endings</title> team members.</p></div>

			<head>Conclusion</head>
			<p> Knowledge has been co-constructed over the course of the <title rend="italic"
					>Project Endings</title> interviews in several ways. Interviewees shared their
				experiences, and interviewers followed up with questions based on their own
				understandings of the shared narratives, as well as their own experiences. The
				goals of the interviews were clearly laid out ahead of time, as were the
				objectives of <title rend="italic">Project Endings</title> — to develop
				recommendations, guidelines, and tools to help with ending and archiving digital
				projects, from the perspectives of DH scholars, developers, and librarians.
				Knowledge has also been co-constructed by <title rend="italic">Project Endings</title>
				team members through the interview analysis process and the subsequent
				dissemination and mobilization of these analyses. The interview analysis was a
				collaborative process where <title rend="italic">Project Endings</title> team members
				engaged in summarizing, interpreting, and distilling the narratives shared with
				us by other DH scholars. Lastly, knowledge has been co-constructed between
				participants at the Endings Symposium in April 2021 and in subsequent
				publications (such as this special issue). The Endings Symposium panel comprised
					<title rend="italic">Project Endings</title> PIs, research assistants, and
				previous interviewees. During the symposium, participants were invited to
				reflect on their experiences and discuss their perspectives on ending and
				archiving digital projects. Since the symposium took place later in the <title
					rend="italic">Project Endings</title> timeline, participants came to the
				symposium having already been part of the knowledge co-construction process in
				the interview phase. The <title rend="italic">Project Endings</title> research team
				had concluded the TEI-XML encoding of the interviews by this time, and had
				completed the process of analysis through co-construction of categories and
				qualitative coding. Our perspectives had evolved over the course of the project
				and we were able to engage with questions about project endings in deeper ways. </p>
			<p> Methodologically, this study was guided by elements of constructivist grounded
				theory, narrative inquiry, and phenomenology. The <title rend="italic">Project
					Endings</title> interviews, subsequent analysis, and final Endings Symposium
				validated many of the researchers’ own experiences, at the same time as they
				provided new perspectives and allowed us to expand our understanding of the
				issues facing DH scholars with regards to the ending and archiving of digital
				projects. As DH scholars and members of the DH community, <title rend="italic"
					>Project Endings</title> team members are now well positioned to make
				recommendations based on the results of this study.</p></div>
