                  <h2>Abstract</h2>
                  
                  <p>Historically, the study of the digital has been an amorphous undertaking, spanning
                     multiple fields and disciplines and positioning the 
                     digital as a democratic space open to multiple communities and perspectives. Despite
                     this ideology, scholarship, including research on 
                     #transformDH to #BlackDH, has demonstrated the need for greater diversity, equity,
                     and inclusion within the digital humanities. 
                     Specifically, these hashtags have been used to curate diverse scholarship while demonstrating
                     the need to create a scholarship that 
                     focuses on an intersectional understanding of the digital humanities. By drawing on
                     the histories of research and researchers both 
                     within and outside of Black studies, this article will illuminate the means and methods
                     of producing scholarship at this critical 
                     intersection while speaking to the need for greater inclusion of Black feminist, queer,
                     and justice-oriented perspectives.

                  <p>Pushing back against the impetus to add identity to the title of a field or framework
                     in name but not practice, this article refines 
                     the histories and contributions of multiple disciplines and standpoints that should
                     be included and credited when defining the 
                     “Black” in Black digital humanities. Whether sparking hashtag activism and crowdsourcing
                     digital labor to developing new 
                     terminology and fields, Black digital humanities draws on and develops work that is
                     already critically engaged with the intersection 
                     of identity and digital studies in theory and praxis. By focusing on the development
                     of the Black digital humanities and its defining 
                     characteristics, this article will also articulate how the nexus of digital research,
                     activism, and pedagogy offers key interventions 
                     and new directions for both Black studies and the digital humanities.

                  <div class="ptext" id="p1">We are in a critical discursive moment where we can debate the origin story and definition
                     of the Black digital humanities. For 
                     scholars who write at the intersection of identity and the internet, the 21st century
                     has presented several opportunities for critical 
                     reflection and debates on the role of race in digital scholarship. One such reflection
                     is the introduction to the 2022 
                     <cite class="title italic">Social Media and Society</cite> special issue titled “Interrogating Digital Blackness” by 
                     Meredith Clark and Adam Banks. Drawing on Stuart Hall's essay “What is this 
                     Black in Black Popular Culture”, Clark and Banks provide an overview of the many scholars, fields, and 
                     theoretical frameworks that have offered critical perspectives on the role of Black
                     culture and community within the creation of digital 
                     content and platforms [<a class="ref" href="#clark_etal2022">Clark and Banks 2022</a>, 1].

                  <div class="ptext" id="p2">While many academic disciplines are studying this shift towards the web and virtual
                     environments, the digital humanities are 
                     especially well-suited to analyze the impact of technology on culture and communities.
                     In particular, the Black digital humanities 
                     combines multiple disciplines, theoretical perspectives, and research methods to analyze
                     the many past, present, and future instances 
                     when technology has influenced Black culture. Whether through sparking hashtag activism
                     and crowdsourcing digital labor or developing 
                     new theories and terminology, Black digital humanities draws on and develops work
                     critically engaged with the intersection of identity 
                     and digital studies.

                  <div class="ptext" id="p3">Therefore, this article starts by defining digital humanities and my introduction
                     to the field by discussing its critical moments, 
                     characteristics, and debates, from its origins in the humanities to its shift towards
                     quantitative methods and the effort to 
                     #transformDH. Using the research and researchers in Black studies as a reference point,
                     I explore the definition of Black 
                     digital humanities by highlighting professors and programs that produce critical scholarship
                     and speculative thinking at the 
                     intersection of Black studies and digital humanities. To conclude, I call for more
                     projects and research that acknowledge the role of 
                     queer and trans members of the community in discussions of digital culture. Throughout
                     this article, I also cite several examples of 
                     digital humanities scholarship and projects to demonstrate a Black queer and femme
                     approach to reading the field and to show 
                     how #transformDH and #BlackDH have evolved and developed through multiple versions
                     of the field and debates in the digital 
                     humanities.

                  <div class="ptext" id="p4">Before defining “Black” in the Black digital humanities, it is essential to think critically about debates
                     that define the 
                     “digital” in the digital humanities, which preface the critical transformation of the field.
                     Historically, the study of the 
                     digital has been an amorphous undertaking, spanning multiple fields and disciplines
                     and positioning the digital as a democratic space 
                     open to multiple communities and perspectives. Consequently, early digital humanities
                     research focused on the potential that comes with 
                     new and emerging technology. For example, Matthew Kirschenbaum's article “What is Digital Humanities 
                     and What is it Doing in English Departments?” aims to define the digital humanities and explain how computing is used in 
                     disciplines like English. He cites several conferences, organizations, departments,
                     and articles to demonstrate the challenge of 
                     defining the digital humanities due to its diverse fields and perspectives [<a class="ref" href="#kirschenbaum2016">Kirschenbaum 2016</a>, 1–4]. However, he 
                     notes that the field's defining or unifying characteristic is bringing people together
                     by investing in the public humanities, digital 
                     pedagogy, social media, and collaborative work.

                  <div class="ptext" id="p5">Speaking to the project-based nature of the field, Kirschenbaum ends the piece with
                     the assertion that: 
                     <blockquote>
                        <p>The 
                           digital humanities today is about a scholarship (and a pedagogy) that is publicly
                           visible in ways to which we are generally unaccustomed, 
                           a scholarship and pedagogy that are bound up with infrastructure in ways that are
                           deeper and more explicit than we are generally 
                           accustomed to, a scholarship and pedagogy that are collaborative and depend on networks
                           of people and that live an active 24/7 life 
                           online. Isn't that something you want in your English department? [<a class="ref" href="#kirschenbaum2016">Kirschenbaum 2016</a>, 6]</p>
                     </blockquote> 
                     Kirschenbaum proffers the importance of production and education by focusing on “scholarship and 
                     pedagogy” as integral components of the digital humanities. Moreover, it is in this final assertion
                     that Kirschenbaum 
                     captures how many digital humanists were introduced to the field and how that introduction
                     influences how we came to define it. At the 
                     same time that Kirschenbaum was writing about the role of digital humanities in English departments, I found
                     digital 
                     humanities through a college English department. While taking an introductory English
                     course, my knowledge of digital humanities was 
                     encompassed by the book <cite class="title italic">The New Media Reader</cite> and my writing as a Humanities, Arts, Science, and Technology 
                     Advanced Collaboratory (HASTAC) scholar.

                  <div class="ptext" id="p6">Therefore, my perspective of the digital humanities focused on the role the field
                     could play within libraries and museums, as many 
                     digital humanities projects invested in digitizing historical records, developing
                     interactive art and media, and analyzing large datasets 
                     of literary texts. In this sense, the “digital” in digital humanities encompassed the many ways digital tools and technologies 
                     changed humanistic traditions. However, even as my research interests focused on the
                     impact of technology on society, this 
                     English-based approach to digital humanities centered less on lived experience and
                     embodiment and more on linguistic and philosophical 
                     play with born-digital texts. Consequently, I developed the belief that Black identity
                     and technology were separate studies, and it 
                     was not until the publication of the anthology <cite class="title italic">Race After the Internet</cite> that I began to contemplate the 
                     relationship between race and digital media.

                  <div class="ptext" id="p7">This background and introduction also meant that my definition of digital humanities
                     was primarily theoretical and creative. Unlike 
                     the methodological understanding of digital humanities that would later unite scholars
                     in the field, I defined the digital humanities 
                     as a systematic view or standpoint rather than as a methodological toolkit. Like many
                     scholars in English DH, I saw digital humanities 
                     (and being a digital humanist) as taking the perspective that computers and technology
                     could empower people to make critical changes in 
                     society or on a smaller scale in their respective fields and disciplines. However,
                     more than a decade later, the way we think about the 
                     digital humanities has shifted from theorizing about the power of computers and technology
                     towards a more tangible investment in 
                     skills-building. From library and data carpentry to The Humanities and Technology
                     (THAT) Camp, training in digital humanities focuses 
                     less on philosophical discussions of the role of computing within media, culture,
                     and society and more on understanding technical 
                     language and quantitative methods.

                  <div class="counter"><a href="#p8">8</a></div>
                  <div class="ptext" id="p8">In many ways, the term “digital humanist” has aligned the digital humanities as a practice with distinct practitioners who
                     possess 
                     specific skills. These skills usually include coding and data visualization but rarely
                     focus on humanities theory. Therefore, the field 
                     produces “DH practitioners” who are united in their knowledge of what they can do without a shared epistemology
                     that unites the 
                     field around what practitioners think or believe. Although digital humanities is still
                     prevalent in English departments, the focus on 
                     methods has shifted, so what was once viewed as the digitization of the humanities
                     is now quite similar to the humanization of the 
                     sciences. For example, the recent calls for more ethical artificial intelligence or
                     responsible machine learning echo the concerns 
                     digital humanists have always raised, as they focus on the issues and inequalities
                     that can arise from technology adoption and its 
                     influence on society. However, these calls also focus on quantitative big data methods,
                     prioritizing the study of algorithms over 
                     art and culture.

                  <div class="ptext" id="p9">Numerous digital humanists have engaged in methodological critique in response to
                     this practical turn. In 2012, 
                     Kirschenbaum's essay was republished as a chapter in the first edition of <cite class="title italic">Debates in the Digital 
                        Humanities</cite>. This anthology included multiple foundational texts that defined the field and its
                     methods. It also included a 
                     section that focused on critiques of the field. A chapter by Tara McPherson titled “Why are the 
                     Digital Humanities so White? Or Thinking the Histories of Race and Computation” anticipated concerns about the oppressive 
                     algorithmic systems that undergird technology and the role these systems play within
                     our society and academic silos 
                     [<a class="ref" href="#mcpherson2012">McPherson 2012</a>, 139–142]. McPherson's essay also questioned why studying digital tools and technologies 
                     had taken over human-centered inquiry.

                  <div class="ptext" id="p10">Although the digital realm was a place of anonymity and liberation from the social
                     hierarchies and oppressive structures of the 
                     physical world, it has become evident that the digital realm has not generated an
                     entirely new and independent world free from societal 
                     ills. Instead, it has replicated the offline world's issues within the digital domain.
                     As a reflection of its subject of study, the 
                     digital humanities has struggled to address the relationship between identity and
                     inequality in favor of a color-blind approach that 
                     privileges the examination of tools and methods. Even after over a decade, these concerns
                     are still significant for digital 
                     humanities practitioners, leading to demands for change and transformation in the
                     sector regarding social justice issues and the study 
                     of race.

                     online responses to conference panels that question the nature of digital humanities
                     work. Barnett's essay also highlights 
                     several unspoken codes and patterns that influence what and who is considered a part
                     of digital humanities scholarship 
                     [<a class="ref" href="#barnett2014">Barnett 2014</a>, 67–69]. Barnett argues that this differentiation between what is included and what is 
                     excluded in the digital humanities can be expressed through “the conflict between hack versus yack” or making 
                     versus theorizing [<a class="ref" href="#barnett2014">Barnett 2014</a>, 74]. While digital humanities projects showcasing technical skills are well-received
                     
                     in DH spaces, the same acceptance is not given to more critical work. As a result,
                     there is an over-representation of digital 
                     humanities projects and practitioners that do not critically engage with social issues,
                     such as the digital divide or online identity 
                     performance. Referencing the work of #transformDH, Barnett cites scholars such as Moya Bailey, 
                     Amanda Phillips, and Alexis Lothian, who have amplified their critiques of digital humanities scholarship 
                     through various forms of digital activism.

                     “the creation and proliferation of online activism stamped with a hashtag” 
                     [<a class="ref" href="#jackson_etal2020">Jackson, Bailey, and Welles 2020</a>, xxxiii]. Digital or hashtag activism is often used to raise awareness and mobilize large
                     groups 
                     around a cause. In their essay titled “Can Digital Humanities Mean Transformative Critique?”, 
                     Alexis Lothian and Amanda Phillips reflect on the significant contribution of hashtag activism in the

                     The hashtag #transformDH has highlighted the importance of activism and diversity,
                     equity, and inclusion in the field of digital 
                     humanities. This movement has shifted the focus from solely methodological and project-based
                     research to theoretical and community-focused 
                     research. As a result, digital and physical spaces have been created to host these
                     critical conversations. Moreover, the hashtag has been 
                     used to showcase diverse scholarship on various digital platforms, emphasizing the
                     need for an intersectional understanding of the 
                     digital humanities.

                     by Moya Bailey in the essay 
                     “All the Digital Humanists Are White, All the Nerds Are Men, but Some of Us Are Brave”. In this essay, 
                     Bailey responds to the lack of diversity in the field by stating: 
                     <blockquote>
                        <p>The way in which identities both 
                           inform theory and practice in digital humanities have been largely overlooked [and]
                           . . . The move from “margin to centre” offers 
                           the opportunity to engage new sets of theoretical questions that expose implicit assumptions
                           about what and who counts in digital 
                           humanities. [<a class="ref" href="#bailey2011">Bailey 2011</a>, 1]</p>
                     </blockquote> By investigating an otherwise “unexamined identity politics 
                     of whiteness, masculinity, and able-bodiedness”, Bailey shows how the digital humanities replicate many of the same 
                     exclusionary hierarchies as other fields and systems [<a class="ref" href="#bailey2011">Bailey 2011</a>, 1]. Bailey further suggests that 
                     numerous people can be classified as digital humanities practitioners, though their
                     work frequently goes acknowledged within the field. 
                     This is because being situated on the fringe of digital humanities work results in
                     less recognition, as does scholarship that does not 
                     conform to the traditional digital humanities model. However, Bailey points out that we can make more room for scholarship 
                     engaged with identity and digital humanities by looking at the places “where people of color, women, [and] people 
                     with disabilities are already engaged in digital projects” [<a class="ref" href="#bailey2011">Bailey 2011</a>, 2].

                     to the Black digital humanities or #BlackDH. They 
                     suggest that Black digital dumanities scholarship has always been a part of the digital
                     humanities, even when it was not well-received 
                     or clearly understood [<a class="ref" href="#barnett2014">Barnett 2014</a>, 70–73]. However, it was only when more open conversations about intersectionality 
                     and inclusion took place that the field began to take visible form. While understanding
                     digital methods is an integral part of the digital 
                     humanities, it is crucial to acknowledge that some implicit theoretical beliefs and
                     biases undergird that praxis. Therefore, digital 
                     humanities scholars who engage in critical theories of race, gender, sexuality, and
                     many other categories do the work of exploring the 
                     importance of developing both theory and praxis.

                     in the representation and reception of digital 
                     humanities work. Consequently, hashtags can also be used to find Black digital humanities

                     several fields of 
                     study and perspectives that should be defined as Black digital humanities, as well
                     as the new directions that could be sparked moving 
                     forward [<a class="ref" href="#barnett2014">Barnett 2014</a>, 76]. To define Black digital humanities, we must examine two scholarly works that have
                     played 
                     a crucial role in unifying the field and articulating the research and contributions
                     of Black diasporic people in digital humanities. 
                     These works are Kim Gallon's “Making a Case for the Black Digital Humanities” and 
                     Safiya Noble's “Toward a Critical Black Digital Humanities”. These essays provide a framework 
                     for scholars to ask relevant questions, identify key areas of research and discussion,
                     and locate relevant literature.

                  <div class="ptext" id="p19">Building on the work of #transformDH, Professor Kim Gallon argues in her essay “Making a Case for the 
                     Black Digital Humanities” that the Black digital humanities can help reveal the racialized power systems underlying
                     the digital 
                     humanities field and its associated techniques. Gallon believes the Black digital humanities is valuable due to its 
                     standpoint, theories, and methodology. Specifically, Gallon notes that the work of the Black digital humanities is based on 
                     a “technology of recovery” that uses digital tools and technology to humanize Black diasporic people and 
                     recover the artifacts of Black culture [<a class="ref" href="#gallon2016">Gallon 2016</a>, 44].

                     and the critical shift in the digital 
                     humanities, as it urges scholars to analyze not only the racialized frameworks that
                     support technology but also how the technology of 
                     race penetrates every aspect of society, including academic research. By resisting
                     the hidden racism, or what Tara McPherson 
                     describes as the “lenticular logic” that is the basis of most systems, this essay presents the Black digital 
                     humanities as a means of restoring the humanistic perspective of the digital humanities
                     by leveraging the unique viewpoint of Black 
                     community members [<a class="ref" href="#mcpherson2013">McPherson 2013</a>, 25].

                     In the essay, 
                     Noble draws from Kim Gallon and Roopika Risam's essays in <cite class="title italic">Debates in the 
                        Digital Humanities</cite> and incorporates Black feminist theories and Black studies scholarship. Specifically,
                     Noble 
                     writes that “Black studies has a unique role to play in dismembering how we think about humanity
                     and the digital 
                     humanities by extension”. Thus, developing a “black epistemology will generate questions about the 
                     relationship between the racialization of humanity and the digital as power, ultimately
                     fostering new inquiries and deeper understandings 
                     about the human condition” [<a class="ref" href="#noble2019">Noble 2019</a>]. The essay then critiques the institutional structures that support digital 
                     humanities research within the academy while lacking community engagement and social
                     impact outside of it.

                  <div class="ptext" id="p22">Similar to the work of #transformDH and #BlackDH, Noble calls for “DH scholars to engage in the work 
                     of African/Black diaspora studies” and for “African/Black diaspora studies scholars who do not necessarily 
                     align themselves with the digital humanities to contribute to the project of surfacing
                     the intellectual traditions of political economy 
                     and race and gender studies in the field” [<a class="ref" href="#noble2019">Noble 2019</a>, 32]. In doing so, Noble signals the need 
                     for research within the digital humanities that is attentive to issues such as environmental
                     justice and workers' rights, which requires 
                     working with communities and organizations outside of higher education.

                  <div class="ptext" id="p23">Overall, these two essays show how the definition of the Black digital humanities
                     has evolved from interventions made in digital 
                     humanities research to incorporate the field of Black studies and other disciplines
                     that take a sociocultural perspective on the world. 
                     Specifically, Gallon's essay offers a theoretical perspective on the role of Black studies in digital
                     humanities and 
                     technology studies. On the other hand, Noble's essay highlights the structural issues that need to be addressed in the 
                     digital humanities and the type of work that needs to be done within the academy and
                     society. Nevertheless, both essays demonstrate how 
                     the term “Black Digital humanities” can bring together multiple schools of research and scholarship at the intersection
                     of Black 
                     studies and digital studies or ethnic studies and digital humanities.

                  <div class="ptext" id="p24">However, as Moya Bailey writes, there is a need to challenge the “add and stir model of diversity” 
                     [<a class="ref" href="#bailey2011">Bailey 2011</a>, 3]. In other words, creating space for the Black digital humanities requires more than
                     simply adding 
                     Black (i.e., Black studies or scholars) to the digital humanities, which in turn requires
                     us to acknowledge and resist the trend of 
                     “black-washing” academic fields. “Black-washing” refers to the superficial use of Black content or related hashtags to signal 
                     racial solidarity without actually engaging in anti-racism work. For example, during
                     Black History Month, platforms like YouTube and 
                     Netflix create algorithms to recommend Black content to users without addressing how
                     the platform can be complicit in its own racial 
                     biases. We must recognize and push back against “black-washing” in order to truly advance Black digital humanities.</div>

                     to ensure racial justice and equity outside 
                     of profiting from hashtag activism and the current sociopolitical moment? For many
                     Black digital humanists, this means doing research 
                     that is participatory and attentive to data and design justice issues, as well as
                     the concerns that disproportionately affect Black 
                     communities, such as climate change and healthcare equity. Additionally, there is
                     a need for a recuperative recognition of the research 
                     and scholarship produced within Black studies that should fall under the auspices
                     of the digital humanities.

                     scholars bring to the digital humanities is a 
                     historicization of technology through the legacy of Black scholarship and activism.
                     From projects focused on digitizing Black History to 
                     efforts to recognize the speculative design capabilities of historic Black scholarship,
                     recovering the theory and praxis that motivated 
                     abolitionists and academics to imagine a future filled with equity and empowerment
                     is one of the most significant contributions Black 
                     studies brings to the digital humanities. As Jessica Marie Johnson writes in her essay “"Markup 
                     BodiesBlack [Life] Studies and Slavery [Death] Studies at the Digital Crossroads”: 
                     <blockquote>

                           . . . predates digital intervention, drawing on strategies of empowerment, joy, and
                           kinship created out of Black freedom struggles to 
                           facilitate the use of digital tools and create new methodologies, practices, and even
                           ethics for their use.

                     </blockquote> Instead of positioning Black history as solely in the past and digital practice as
                     present- 
                     or future-focused, Johnson complicates our understanding of time and the digital by stating that a “Black 
                     digital practice” could exist well before “digital intervention” [<a class="ref" href="#johnson2018">Johnson 2018</a>].

                  <div class="ptext" id="p30">Understanding time and technology within the context of Black culture is also a key
                     component in exploring the concept of Afrofuturism 
                     and its role in the history of Black studies and Black digital humanities projects.
                     In <cite class="title italic">#identity: Hashtagging Race, 
                        Gender, Sexuality, and Nation</cite>, Grace Gipson cites Yotasha Womack in defining Afrofuturism as 
                     “an intersection of imagination, technology, the future, and liberation” [<a class="ref" href="#gipson2019">Gipson 2019</a>, 84]. 
                     After completing a hashtag analysis of “#Afrofuturism”, Gipson finds that most tweets on the topic depict Afrofuturism 
                     as “an artistic aesthetic, as a tool for critical cultural analysis, as a platform for
                     analyzing the impact of 
                     modernization on cultural production, and as an exploration of Black identity” [<a class="ref" href="#gipson2019">Gipson 2019</a>, 88–89]. Therefore, 
                     the description of Afrofuturism overlaps with definitions of the Black digital humanities
                     because Afrofuturism and the Black digital 
                     humanities are each committed to humanizing Black communities and investigating the
                     socio-cultural dimensions of culture and technology.

                  <div class="ptext" id="p31">In addition, Gipson utilizes the concept of Afrofuturism to discuss “flame-keeping”, or 
                     “acts of preserving cultural productions and a body of knowledge” [<a class="ref" href="#gipson2019">Gipson 2019</a>, 86]. 
                     This method of passing on knowledge is usually seen within historical texts but also
                     in the creation of speculative fiction. Flame-keeping 
                     allows Black creatives share their beliefs about the future, passing on their hopes
                     and dreams for their community to generations that 
                     will be more capable or better positioned to accomplish them. Through examples from
                     individuals such as Sojourner Truth and 
                     Fannie Lou Hamer, Gipson demonstrates how historical figures and texts envisioned Black futures by passing
                     on 
                     the flame of knowledge and intuition. In doing so, Gipson suggests that we should
                     view historical figures and activists of abolition 
                     and civil rights movements as Afrofuturists in their own right.

                  <div class="ptext" id="p32">From this standpoint, there are several moments in Black history where activists and
                     scholars engaged in Afrofuturistic thought. As 
                     Walidah Imarisha writes in the introduction to the book <cite class="title italic">Octavia's Brood: Science Fiction Stories from 
                        Social Justice Movements</cite>, “Whenever we try to envision a world without war, without violence, without prisons,
                     
                     without capitalism, we are engaging in speculative fiction” [<a class="ref" href="#imarisha2015">Imarisha 2015</a>, 3]. Black activists and scholars 
                     can be viewed as the prophets and dreamers who imagined futures where Black people
                     were free citizens — which contextualizes why 
                     Gallon's definition of the Black digital humanities positions the field as a humanizing
                     project. Flame-keeping is 
                     something that activists and Black scholars still do when they imagine and write what
                     Robin Kelley calls 
                     “freedom dreams” for this current moment and the future [<a class="ref" href="#kelley2022">Kelley 2022</a>].

                  <div class="ptext" id="p33">Kara Keeling's book <cite class="title italic">Queer Times, Black Futures</cite> further explores the concepts of flame-keeping and 
                     freedom dreams and by analyzing how speculative imagining has been crucial for Black
                     queer scholars, activists, and creatives. 
                     Keeling advances Kelley's concept of freedom dreams by writing that a “Black radical 
                     imagination recombines the contents of the long arc of Black existence in ways that
                     call forth new relations to all” 
                     [<a class="ref" href="#keeling2019">Keeling 2019</a>, 32–35]. From this perspective, projects that recognize Black queer and trans people in historical
                     
                     records and archives are one example of how radical imagination can shift how we view
                     the lineage of Black existence. Consequently, 
                     many galleries, libraries, archives, and museums (GLAMs) utilize speculative imagining
                     to create more inclusive Black digital humanities 
                     projects. For example, the National Museum of African-American History and Culture (NMAAC) has developed an 
                     in-person and online exhibit focusing on Black LGBTQ+ history during the Harlem Renaissance.
                     Although some artists and creatives openly 
                     identified as part of the LGBTQ+ community, archivists and historians have had to
                     speculate about the identity of others 
                     [<a class="ref" href="#day2023">Day 2023</a>] In this sense, Afrofuturist practices like speculative imagining can be used to digitally
                     reconstruct histories 
                     that are more inclusive of Black queer and trans community members.

                     digital studies conference, Black Thought 2.0. In an 
                     interview for the 2012 conference at Duke University, Mark Anthony Neal is quoted as saying: 
                     
                     <blockquote>
                        <p>Given our rich tradition of public intellectuals, dating back to figures like [Frederick] Douglass and 
                           Sojourner Truth, it just seems as though new media represents another way for black intellectuals
                           to be in the world. 
                           Imagine what W.E.B. [Du Bois] might have done with a Twitter feed? [<a class="ref" href="#duketoday2012">Duke Today Staff 2012</a>]</p>
                     </blockquote> By imagining 
                     W.E.B. Du Bois as a Twitter user, Mark Anthony Neal uses speculative thought to demonstrate how Black 
                     intellectuals were invested in sharing information with public audiences through the
                     latest technologies even before the development of 
                     the Black digital humanities. In the book <cite class="title italic">W.E.B. Du Bois' Data Portraits</cite>, Whitney Battle Baptiste 
                     and Britt Rusert also write about Du Bois' interest in innovation by describing the infographics created for his 
                     sociological work in Atlanta during the 1900 Paris Exhibition. Specifically, the authors write, “The 
                     infographics look back to a history of data visualization in the 19th century deeply
                     connected to the institution of slavery, and the 
                     struggle against it, while looking forward” [<a class="ref" href="#battle-baptiste_etal2018">Battle-Baptiste and Rusert 2018</a>, 98].

                  <div class="ptext" id="p35">Du Bois' visualizations are incredibly precise, even for a 21st-century audience. Although
                     the visualizations are 
                     hand-drawn, they are vibrant and colorful, reminiscent of 21st-century digital projects
                     like Giorgia Lupi and Stefanie 
                     Posavec's “Dear Data” visualizations or other forms of data storytelling [<a class="ref" href="#lupi_etal2016">Lupi and Posavec</a>]. 
                     Therefore, the visualizations anticipated what data and design would look like. Furthermore,
                     they serve as an example of a Black digital 
                     practice that existed before the digital era. Du Bois' interest in speculative fiction is also noteworthy, as it allows 
                     him to effectively use information from the past and present to envision future possibilities
                     in his research

                  <div class="ptext" id="p36">This looking back and looking forward is also described as a method of framing that
                     Du Bois used in the publication of 
                     his scholarship, “[which] presents us with a stunning juxtaposition that points neither to historical
                     progress nor 
                     to the overcoming of the slave past but to the ways, slavery continued quite literally
                     to frame the present” 
                     [<a class="ref" href="#battle-baptiste_etal2018">Battle-Baptiste and Rusert 2018</a>, 18]. As a result, Du Bois' work can be seen as a precursor, or the academic 
                     ancestor, to the type of work we now see in the Black digital humanities. We can follow
                     Du Bois' example by working to 
                     uncover the many ways in which the legacy of slavery continues to frame our understanding
                     of data, science, and technology in the 20th 
                     and 21st centuries.

                     In the essay <cite class="title italic">Say It

                     Rayvon Fouché cites the work of Anthony Walton to describe how part of the legacy of slavery is that 
                     technology and technological systems have historically been used to oppress Black
                     diasporic people 
                     [<a class="ref" href="#fouche2006">Fouché 2006</a>, 639–640]. Even after slavery, even in moments of social progress or technological advancement,
                     any 
                     historical moment in which Black people are framed as data points or as cogs in a
                     machine rather than as individuals is evidence 
                     of history repeating itself.

                  <div class="ptext" id="p38">However, Fouché moves past this understanding of digital technology as a means of oppression by asserting
                     that always 
                     “thinking about the technological control of African Americans . . . strips black people
                     of technological 
                     agency” [<a class="ref" href="#fouche2006">Fouché 2006</a>, 640]. It is essential to acknowledge that Black people have utilized technology to their
                     
                     advantage in various moments throughout history. Although society often considers
                     science and technology as relatively new fields of 
                     study, Black digital humanists acknowledge that this work has existed for a long time.
                     They aim to enhance the narrative of Black 
                     communities beyond deficit narratives because highlighting instances of empowerment,
                     creativity, and community involvement is as 
                     important as addressing histories of oppression.

                  <div class="ptext" id="p39">Fouché uses the term “Black vernacular technological creativity” to demonstrate that Black history and culture 
                     “is rich in historical value and replete with rebellion, resistance, assimilation,
                     and appropriation in forms we

                     In this sense, Fouché's work acts as another critical precursor to the Black digital humanities in American
                     Culture, 
                     as the study of Black culture and communities allows scholars to expand on the past
                     and bring light to the ingenuity of Black digital 
                     practices across multiple moments in time and in places where we do not usually search

                     from which scholars invested in the Black digital

                     “We need to continue to inquire with a critical DH lens tilted toward Black studies,
                     gender studies, ethnic studies, 
                     information studies, media studies, communication, sociology, and science and technology

                     [<a class="ref" href="#noble2019">Noble 2019</a>, 33]. While each of these areas is important, we must also recognize that the inherent
                     
                     interdisciplinarity of Black studies means that many of these areas are also practiced
                     by scholars within the discipline.

                     as a discipline that prioritizes studying communities 
                     and culture without acknowledgement of what the discipline brings to science and technology,
                     there have been several moments where the 
                     study of digital tools and technology has gained traction within Black studies and
                     laid the foundation for Black digital humanities.

                     studies' role in developing Black digital humanities. It also offers some key examples
                     of where scholars can find Black digital 
                     humanities work relevant to the present moment. As Kim Gallon writes, “e-Black studies, black code 
                     studies, and digital blackness” are all examples of conferences and curations where we can see the overlap between
                     the digital 
                     humanities and Black studies [<a class="ref" href="#gallon2016">Gallon 2016</a>, 47].

                  <div class="ptext" id="p44">Beginning with e-Black studies, Abdul Alkalimat and Ronald Bailey's essay “From Black to 
                     eBlack” maps the history of Black studies and how that history positions Black studies as
                     a movement, profession, and network 
                     committed to social change and institutional transformation [<a class="ref" href="#alkalimat_etal2012">Alkalimat and Bailey 2012</a>, 10–11]. This work is continued in 
                     <cite class="title italic">The Digital Black Atlantic</cite>, an edited collection from 2021 that offers one of the most comprehensive 
                     considerations of the intersection of Black studies and the digital humanities. Alkalimat's more recent essay, 
                     “The Sankofa Principle: From the Drum to the Digital” further reflects on the principles underpinning e-Black 
                     studies, including cyberdemocracy, collective intelligence, and information freedom.
                     Cyberdemocracy seeks to overcome the digital divide, 
                     while collective intelligence involves collecting, analyzing, and utilizing intellectual
                     thought. Information freedom, on the other hand, 
                     advocates for unrestricted access to information [<a class="ref" href="#alkalimat2021">Alkalimat 2021</a>, 8]. These theoretical principles are also paired with 
                     methods that help scholars put e-Black studies into practice. For example, Alkalimat traces the development of e-Black 
                     studies from primarily in-person activities, like conferences and courses, to open-access
                     online spaces, including digital projects and 
                     virtual communities [<a class="ref" href="#alkalimat2021">Alkalimat 2021</a>, 12–16].

                  <div class="ptext" id="p45">Building on e-Black studies, there has been a surge in researchers, departments, and
                     organizations that have taken up this call to 
                     consider Black diasporic communities' role in studying information, data, and digital
                     technologies. For example, the present moment has 
                     ushered in several conferences and curations that were explicit in their analysis
                     of the overlap between Black studies and digital 
                     humanities. In contrast to most digital humanities conferences, the Black digital
                     humanities tend to exist within conferences that 
                     center on the unique challenges of being Black online and researching Black communities
                     during the era of digital media and technology. 
                     As I noted in an earlier section of this essay, some notable conferences in the development
                     of the field were Duke 
                     University's Black Thought 2.0 in 2012, followed by Rutger's Digital Blackness Conference in 2016, the 
                     University of Maryland's 2018 conference titled “Intentionally Digital, Intentionally Black”, 
                     and the 2022 “Present Encounters: Digital Humanities Meet Afrofuturism”” symposium hosted by Temple 
                     University Libraries. These conferences were bolstered by digital curations of projects and
                     essays that also spoke to this unique 
                     intersection, as well as the creation of virtual spaces where scholars could converse
                     about this work.

                  <div class="ptext" id="p46">In addition to e-Black studies, digital Blackness, and the <cite class="title italic">Digital Black Atlantic</cite>, it is essential to note 
                     scholars that incorporate the literal and metaphorical study of code in their work.
                     For example, early Black studies and digital 
                     humanities scholarship converged in 2017 when <cite class="title italic">The Black Scholar</cite> published a collection of essays on Black 
                     code studies. In the introduction to the collection, “Black code studies” is defined as “queer, femme, fugitive, 
                     and radical” [<a class="ref" href="#johnson_etal2017">Johnson and Neal 2017</a>, 1]. Therefore, this collection included essays that addressed the need for 
                     work that is queer, feminist, activist, and abolitionist within the digital humanities
                     and Black studies. This wording frames Black code 
                     studies as an essential moment in Black studies and Digital Humanities by breaking
                     out the institutional structures of project-based 
                     digital humanities work and traditional academic inquiry.

                  <div class="ptext" id="p47">Similarly, in the essay “Catching our breath: Critical Race STS and the Carceral Imagination”, 
                     Ruja Benjamin utilizes critical race theory and abolitionist ethics to intervene in science and
                     technology studies. Hence, 
                     Critical race science and technology studies (critical race STS) is closely related
                     to Black code studies and Black digital humanities 
                     due to its investment in radical work that speaks truth to power by openly speaking
                     out against social injustice (e.g., gender inequity, 
                     police brutality, environmental inequality, disability, and health disparity), as

                     of publications on the intersections of 
                     Black feminism and digital studies. Over the years, these publications have focused
                     on the potential of the internet as a space for 
                     activism, community building, and fieldwork. Beginning with Anna Everett's (2004) “On Cyberfeminism 
                     and Cyberwomanism”, which combines Black feminism and womanism with feminist science and technology
                     studies. Specifically, 
                     Everett writes about how Black women use digital tools and technology for community engagement,
                     organizing, and activism 
                     [<a class="ref" href="#everett2004">Everett 2004</a>, 1281–1283]. In contrast, scholars like Tressie McMillan Cottom utilize the terminology 
                     of Black cyberfeminism as an intervention in the subfield of “digital sociology” 
                     [<a class="ref" href="#mcmillancottom2016">McMillan Cottom 2016</a>]. Kishonna Gray also employs the terminology of Black cyberfeminism to study identity 
                     performance within video games and virtual communities [<a class="ref" href="#gray2018">Gray 2018</a>, 285–286]). Most recently, Catherine Knight 
                     Steele's (book titled <cite class="title italic">Digital Black Feminism</cite> encapsulates this history by demonstrating the 
                     importance of centering Black voices in the study of the digital realm and, specifically,
                     centering the lived experience and digital 
                     praxis of Black women and femmes [<a class="ref" href="#steele2021">Steele 2021</a>, 13–15]. However, even as we see more inclusion of Black feminist 
                     scholarship in the digital humanities, a few areas remain where the Black digital
                     humanities could be expanded.

                     that launched #transformDH and the critical turn in digital humanities. For Keeling, queer OS disrupts traditional systems, 
                     from new and emerging media to academic disciplines, by using computational tools
                     and technologies to subvert power dynamics and the

                     and the digital humanities. Queer OS is not only a

                     Wendy Chun's and Beth Coleman's writing on “race as technology”” to think through 
                     how queer OS can be viewed as intersectional and interdisciplinary [<a class="ref" href="#keeling2014">Keeling 2014</a>, 155–156]. Within the Black digital 
                     humanities, I view queer OS as a framework that can be used to demonstrate how to
                     incorporate the intersections of race, gender, and 
                     sexuality into the study of technology and digital culture and the development of
                     more diverse and inclusive scholarship. By outlining 
                     a way to apply the strategies of LGBTQIA+ communities and queer theory to platforms
                     and operating systems, Keeling also uses 
                     queer OS as a reading practice that traces the queering of scholarly texts (and fields)
                     over time.

                  <div class="ptext" id="p51">Like version control in Git, utilizing queer OS allows the user to save different
                     copies or versions of the same project, thereby showing 
                     how theory develops over time. In the university setting, version control is also
                     about doing your due diligence; it is the archive, 
                     the history, or the record of how things were done in the past. Therefore, queer OS
                     helps answer the question of who was involved in 
                     completing specific projects and publications by identifying current projects in process
                     and past projects that should be replicated or 
                     joined together. By taking on these debates in the Black digital humanities, I use
                     this essay to outline the many versions of the field 
                     that have developed over time. From a Black queer and femme perspective, this means
                     noting the spaces where the field leans towards 
                     inclusion and diversity and citing the projects and people that should have more visibility.

                  <div class="ptext" id="p52">Additionally, there are many ways in which #BlackDH scholarship always already operates
                     through a queer and femme digital praxis. In 
                     contrast to a radical politics of inclusivity, in the article “Between Butch/Femme: On the Performance of Race, 
                     Gender, and Sexuality in a YouTube Web Series”, I write about what Roderick Ferguson describes as the 
                     “radical politics of invisibility” that come with queer and femme representations of gender and sexuality 
                     [<a class="ref" href="#day2018">Day 2018</a>, 271]. In many ways, Black queer and femme communities are hidden in plain sight within
                     online and offline 
                     spaces through their unique uses of language and the reliance on shared recognition,
                     witnessing, and standpoint epistemologies to 
                     understand who is and is not included within the community.

                  <div class="counter"><a href="#p53">53</a></div>
                  <div class="ptext" id="p53">This understanding of Black queer and femme politics is also articulated in the book
                     <cite class="title italic">The Witch's Flight</cite>, 
                     where Kara Keeling thinks through the uses of community-based epistemologies by asking: 
                     <blockquote>
                        <p>How can 
                           knowledge be forged and shared without being detected by those with the power to prevent
                           that knowledge from exerting a counter-hegemonic 
                           force? In what ways are subjugated knowledge produced, and how do they survive attempts
                           to incorporate them into dominant regimes of 
                           knowledge and their modes of production? [<a class="ref" href="#keeling2007">Keeling 2007</a>, 7]</p>
                     </blockquote> While many scholars have seen the invisibility of 
                     Black digital humanities as a problem to be solved within the field, there is also
                     radical potential that comes with being hidden in 
                     plain sight within multiple fields, disciplines, and digital projects. For the Black
                     digital humanities in particular, adopting a Black 
                     queer and femme digital praxis means exercising a politics of invisibility that can
                     critique the center of digital humanities scholarship 
                     from the margins while continuing to build a field that centers itself. This “calling out” and “calling in” of the larger 
                     digital humanities field (and even Black studies) can also be likened to the Black
                     queer and femme praxis of reading and throwing 
                     shade.

                  <div class="ptext" id="p54">In the essay “Black Data”, Shaka McGlotten defines reading and throwing shade as 
                     “interpretive and performative black queer practices” [<a class="ref" href="#mcglotten2016">McGlotten 2016</a>, 279]. Within 
                     digital spaces, many Black queer and trans folx use the practice of reading to banter
                     with each other and critique societal structures 
                     that uphold belief systems that oppress the community. This includes but is not limited
                     to racism, sexism, homophobia, transphobia, 
                     ableism, classism, xenophobia, and kink-shaming. Additionally, reading can be general
                     in its directive or aimed at a specific person who 
                     has offended the community. Throwing shade can also be viewed as critiquing the corporate
                     and neocolonial norms of digital media platforms 
                     or academic institutions.

                  <div class="ptext" id="p55">Both online and offline, a read can be as simple as stating the obvious about someone's
                     appearance or activities, while throwing shade 
                     often takes the form of a well-timed insult or quick come-back. Therefore, reading
                     and throwing shade can be viewed as a Black queer and 
                     femme digital praxis that offers Black digital humanities scholarship the tools to
                     call out what McGlotten calls the 
                     “defacement, opacity, and encryption” of technological and institutional systems 
                     [<a class="ref" href="#mcglotten2016">McGlotten 2016</a>, 279]. Engaging in a Black queer and femme digital praxis aligns with important principles
                     of Black 
                     digital humaninities, including a focus on connecting the community, fostering recognition,
                     and experiencing pleasure while engaging in 
                     activism or organizing, and raising awareness through public critique.

                  <div class="ptext" id="p56">Consequently, I use this article to raise awareness about where the Black digital
                     humanities come from and what a more intersectional 
                     #BlackDH can be. While there is already a significant body of research on #BlackDH,
                     I started this article by examining canonical digital 
                     humanities literature to show how the lack of intersectional scholarship in the larger
                     field led to #transformDH and the recognition 
                     and development of Black digital humanities across various disciplines. However, instead
                     of viewing Black digital humanities as existing 
                     on the fringes of DH scholarship, we should recognize that it has found ways to represent
                     and acknowledge its community through digital 
                     praxis, such as conferences, curation, and hashtags like #BlackDH.

                  <div class="ptext" id="p57">As this outline of the crucial moments in the development of the Black digital humanities
                     has shown, the field continues to receive 
                     recognition both within and outside the digital humanities. By analyzing different
                     definitions and debates in #BlackDH, it is evident that 
                     it is a field that encompasses the interdisciplinary nature of Black studies and the
                     methodological prowess of digital humanities. 
                     Therefore, the Black digital humanities contribute significantly to both Black studies
                     and digital humanities by expanding the 
                     possibilities of both fields and promoting more significant investment in data and
                     information science. As a transformative assemblage 
                     of critical work, the Black digital humanities will continue growing and spreading
                     through collaboration, scholarship, pedagogy, and 
                     social networks.
