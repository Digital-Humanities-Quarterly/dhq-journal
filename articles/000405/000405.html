                  <p>Typography, the arrangement and use of type, permeates our visual landscape, from
                     printed pages and digital interfaces to physical environments and interactive
                     experience. Those who study and work in the digital humanities are called upon
                     to make typographic choices everyday, yet few have any training in how to
                     effectively design with type. Over the past several years, I have been involved
                     in several initiatives that seek to help educate digital humanities scholars,
                     technologists and students about the value of information design, including
                     typography. This paper will discuss these experiences and some guiding
                     principles for helping a digital humanities audience understand the basic
                     principles of typography and apply them to their projects and research.

                     display information in new ways, a focus on the interface and information design
                     of these tools is often overlooked. Design education models are often
                     preoccupied with examining teaching methods for educating future professional
                     designers [<a class="ref" href="#pat2013">Pat 2013</a>], while ignoring how to introduce design
                     principles to those outside of traditional design disciplines, including the
                     digital humanities. From word-processing and blog theme customization to data
                     visualization and interface design, those engaged with digital humanities
                     research and teaching activities interact with the visual formatting of
                     text-based information in a variety of contexts. Based on my current research
                     into the role of visual communication and information design in the digital
                     humanities, many digital humanities practitioners, who do not have a formal
                     training in design, are called upon to make typographic choices for their
                     projects, yet do not have a solid understanding about how to make these
                     decisions. This paper will discuss some basic principles of typography as well
                     as the approaches I have taken when teaching these principles in a workshop
                     environment for digital humanities audiences. I will discuss some of the
                     challenges, as well as opportunities, of providing a basic awareness of
                     typography and its significance to design practices in the digital
                     humanities.

                     typographic design, to data visualization and information architecture [<a class="ref" href="#burdick2012">Burdick et al. 2012</a>]. Tools such as Omeka, Tableau or Mapbox help
                     democratize visual presentation while providing existing templates, color
                     palettes, and typographic styles that limit the amount of information design

                     on future implications for typography in digital environments. I was introduced
                     to the digital humanities by a colleague in theatre history who needed an
                     interface designer to collaborate on a web-based historical timeline tool. After
                     what felt like a crash course in current digital humanities practices and
                     discourse, I attended a THATCamp in 2012 and offered a session entitled, “Where are all the artists and designers?” (<a href="http://amypapaelias.com/thatcampne2012/wherearealltheartists.html" onclick="window.open('http://amypapaelias.com/thatcampne2012/wherearealltheartists.html'); return false" class="ref">http://amypapaelias.com/thatcampne2012/wherearealltheartists.html</a>).

                     NEH-funded Institute for Advanced Topics in the Digital Humanities, hosted at
                     the Roy Rosenzweig Center for History and New Media at George Mason University
                     that brought together twelve participants from diverse fields to create a
                     digital humanities tool in 5 days. As the sole graphic designer on the team, it
                     was clear that working with a designer helped many of the humanities-based
                     participants understand the value design can bring to digital projects [<a class="ref" href="#croxall2013">Croxall 2013</a>]. Designers and design principles can play a positive
                     role within the context of digital humanities scholarship and public projects,
                     yet participation and knowledge is limited.

                     we notice something that glaringly doesn’t. The way type is arranged and
                     information is organized impacts audience comprehension and engagement, both in
                     print and in digital forms. Within the field of information design, typography
                     functions as a visual system for organizing and structuring text-based content

                     author / publisher has traditionally separated these tasks: research and writing
                     and publishing and distribution. With the possibilities of self-publishing
                     digital projects, the division between writing-designing-disseminating becomes
                     blurred. Digital humanities research and public projects rely on a host of tools
                     and applications that allow for some customization but most practitioners put
                     little emphasis on the basic principles of typographic design. We may assume
                     that the typographic choices already set forth within these tools and
                     applications are satisfactory without considering better alternatives. We may
                     accept that the typography of digital scholarship projects is sufficient to the
                     user’s experience without understanding basic typographic principles.

                     Oliver Reichenstein, designer and founder of Information Architects, wrote a
                     popular essay entitled, “Web Design is 95%
                     Typography”
                     [<a class="ref" href="#reichenstein2016">Reichenstein 2016</a>]. In the essay, he concurs with web designer
                     Cameron Moll that text on the web should be treated as “a user interface”
                      [<a class="ref" href="#moll2016">Moll 2016</a>], and that information designers are doing the work of traditional
                     typographers (setting type in preparation for a printing job), but perhaps
                     without the proper knowledge or training. Ten years later, and despite the great
                     wave of browser support for web fonts, responsive design [<a class="ref" href="#marcotte2011">Marcotte 2011</a>] and countless resources for typography on the web,
                     the implementation of typographic principles within digital scholarship remains
                     limited. Good typography helps give form to an argument, and an awareness of
                     typographic principles applied to digital environments is paramount.

                     workshop was inspired by the book, <cite class="title italic">Typography for
                        Lawyers</cite>, by Matthew Butterick [<a class="ref" href="#butterick2015">Butterick 2015</a>]. Both a

                     profession that is intimately involved in document typesetting with little
                     concern, historically, for best practices. The workshop was held at the Fordham
                     Graduate Center in Manhattan and attracted 15 participants. Workshop attendees
                     included librarians, humanities graduate students, instructional technologists
                     and web developers, with a wide range of technical skill levels and personal
                     goals. With only 2 hours, the workshop was divided into four parts:

                     <div class="ptext" id="p11">We have more typefaces available for use in digital projects than ever
                        before. Selecting a typeface can feel like a daunting task, whether limited
                        to our font menus or searching distributors or foundries. When choosing a
                        typeface for a specific project, we want to make sure we are choosing fonts
                        that have a full character set with necessary accents, punctuation and
                        numerals, including extended language support. While it is popular to
                        criticize Comic Sans for its overuse and playful, childish feel, it is a
                        useful example for discussing how to begin talking about the visual tone we
                        are trying to set with our typeface selection. In the workshop, I ask
                        attendees to pick a typeface like they are choosing an outfit: what’s the
                        occasion? How are you feeling? What is the weather like? An appropriate
                        typeface choice is relative to the content. Next, I go over some basic type
                        classifications (including serif, sans, decorative, script, etc.), which can
                        help when searching for typefaces. Body text, display text, UI text, and
                        tabular data are each different kinds of content where certain typefaces may
                        work better than others [<a class="ref" href="#brown2018">Brown 2018</a>]. Typefaces with obvious,
                        visual personality (like Comic Sans) generally only work for very specific
                        situations and are not the best choice when the reader is trying to absorb
                        complex information. I give an example of Source Sans by Paul J. Hunt,
                        Adobe’s first open source typeface. Source Sans is a large type family with
                        many different styles (from very light to very heavy and italic of all of
                        these weights). I use Source Sans in a lively type specimen I created, to
                        show that even a simple, sans-serif typeface can feel playful but still
                        related by using multiple weights from the same type family.

                        throughout (it’s all italic), the same weight of the typeface and the same
                        size. In some cases, we are striving for an even reading experience (think
                        long paragraphs of text). However, what happens when we take that same
                        phrase and incorporate contrast, in size, weight and style?

                        Sans. In digital projects, levels of visual hierarchy are absolutely crucial
                        to the display of complex information, especially on the web. Hierarchy is
                        already built into our web-based projects (HTML tags &lt;p&gt;, &lt;h1&gt;,
                        &lt;a&gt;) and style sheets allow us to customize these elements through

                        interest. It is a natural inclination to want to “fill the
                        page” with content but in fact, our eyes and brains appreciate
                        it when there are ample amounts of margins and negative space to give a

                        width of the screen. There is negative space between the lines of text, but
                        it is quite monotonous and doesn’t do much to give a needed visual pause as
                        we are reading. I then show the same paragraph, this time presenting the
                        text with a shorter line length and more uneven negative space on the page.
                        There is now less space between the line, so that most of the negative space
                        is relegated to the right side of the screen. Even though it is
                        approximately the same amount of space, it is far more dynamic and easier to
                        read. I also show how I divided the space using a very simple three column
                        grid. A grid is a powerful and fairly simple way to organize information.
                        Establishing grid guidelines helps make decisions that will make your
                        content easier to read.

                        simple (a menu, a large full window image, a caption), we discovered that
                        there are over 10 different typographic treatments on that one screen. We
                        discussed how the size, color, typeface selection, alignment and spacing of
                        each treatment affects one another and how deliberate these decisions are in
                        order to make the page feel “simple”. The more
                        information we add (scrolling down on the site, we discover paragraphs,
                        columns, maps, and other content), the more we begin to identify the
                        relationships between each of these decisions regarding hierarchy, typeface
                        selection, contrast and negative space. The ability to explain not only
                        whether something works but why it works, is a skill that can be cultivated
                        through practice and exposure. These questions help frame a valuable

                        tools for experimenting with typography on the web. Participants were able
                        to practice basic principles of typographic hierarchy through contrasts of
                        weight and styles, within the browser. TypeCast is a web-based tool that
                        allows the user to test typefaces in the browser. For the purposes of this
                        workshop, it worked as a simple way to experiment with typographic hierarchy
                        in context. As of 2018, TypeCast, while still available online, is no longer
                        being supported. This remains a challenge of teaching with free, online
                        tools: maintenance and long-term availability of the tool can shift
                        overnight. A longer workshop with more time for setting up HTML pages and

                     Because the workshop was offered to a wide range of people and skill sets, it

                     especially for educational or research contexts with limited budgets, can feel
                     quite complicated and came up in our discussions. As with any digital product,
                     it is important for users to read the end user license agreement if purchasing a
                     font from a foundry or distributor. Attendees were also interested in talking
                     about how to find design collaborators on campus. Creating collaborative
                     projects with design faculty and students has challenges and rewards. This
                     requires time and planning, and clear expectations for all responsibilities, in
                     order to develop successful collaborations. Questions arose about digital labor
                     and fair compensation for work being done by students. A longer or separate
                     workshop topic dealing with professional and practical concerns would be
                     suitable for the audiences.

                  <div class="ptext" id="p22">When introducing basic typography principles to audiences beyond designers, we
                     must consider the range of practitioners who engage in information design
                     activities: researchers, scholars, developers and professionals. Short workshops
                     on typography for digital humanities audiences can provide a general overview of
                     best practices and demonstrate the value of typography as an important part of
                     creating a visually engaging experience in digital projects. Web-based tools
                     allow participants to experiment and test some basic principles related to
                     typeface selection, hierarchy of information and visual contrast. Exposure to
                     the complexity of typographic choices may encourage digital humanities scholars
                     to include trained designers as collaborators earlier on in project development.
                     Longer workshops, with time for discussion on professional practice and
                     licensing, would ultimately benefit digital humanities researchers and
                     professionals who seek ways to embed typographic best practices into their
                     projects.
