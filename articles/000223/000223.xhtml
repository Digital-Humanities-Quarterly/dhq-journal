                  <p>This article describes a new method for inferring the gender
                     of personal names using large historical datasets. In
                     contrast to existing methods of gender prediction that treat
                     names as if they are timelessly associated with one gender,
                     this method uses a historical approach that takes into
                     account how naming practices change over time. It uses
                     historical data to measure the likelihood that a name was
                     associated with a particular gender based on the time or
                     place under study. This approach generates more accurate
                     results for sources that encompass changing periods of time,
                     providing digital humanities scholars with a tool to
                     estimate the gender of names across large textual
                     collections. The article first describes the methodology as
                     implemented in the <a class="ref" href="https://github.com/ropensci/gender" onclick="window.open('https://github.com/ropensci/gender'); return false">gender</a>

                        programming language</a>. It goes on to apply the
                     method to a case study in which we examine gender and
                     gatekeeping in the American historical profession over the
                     past half-century. The gender package illustrates the
                     importance of incorporating historical approaches into
                     computer science and related fields.<a class="noteRef" href="#d4e179">[1]</a>

                     used digital analysis to study linguistic styles of male and

                     machine-readable datasets and digital texts brings with it a
                     vast trove of material with which to study gender. Much
                     more, however, can still be done. To better equip humanities
                     researchers to take full advantage of digital sources, we
                     have developed a methodology that infers gender from one of
                     the most common features of humanities datasets: personal
                     names.

                  <div class="ptext" id="p2">As the digital archive grows larger and larger, researchers
                     have not only been able to access information that
                     <em class="emph">is</em> there, but to infer information that
                     <em class="emph">isn’t</em> there. Topic modeling, for example,
                     has been used to uncover underlying trends across a century
                     of academic articles in literary studies [<a class="ref" href="#goldstone2014">Goldstone 2014</a>]. Can researchers similarly use
                     personal names to infer information about individual people?
                     After all, personal names appear across a wide range of
                     sources in the humanities: literary characters in stories
                     and novels, authorship information in archival metadata, or
                     individuals mentioned by historical newspapers and magazine
                     articles. Authors, characters, or historical actors are the
                     sorts of people who stand at the analytical center of
                     humanities scholarship, and their names provide a way to infer additional information
                     about
                     them.<a class="noteRef" href="#d4e241">[2]</a></div>

                  <div class="ptext" id="p3">One of the basic pieces of information researchers can infer
                     from a personal name is the gender of that individual:
                     "Jane Fay," for instance, is likely a woman, while
                     her brother "John Fay" is likely a man. A computer
                     program can infer their respective genders by looking up
                     "Jane" and "John" in a dataset that
                     matches names to genders. But this approach runs into a
                     problem: the link between gender and naming practices, like
                     language itself, is not static. What about Jane and John
                     Fay’s sibling, Leslie? If Leslie was born in the past sixty
                     years, chances are good that Leslie would be their sister.
                     But if the three siblings were born in the early twentieth
                     century, chances are good that Leslie would be their
                     brother. That is because the conventional gender for the
                     name Leslie switched over the course of one hundred years.
                     In 1900 some 92% of the babies born in the United States who
                     were named Leslie were classified as male, while in 2000
                     about 96% of the Leslies born in that year were classified
                     as female.

                     problem" is not an especially pressing one. There are
                     a variety of tools that use current databases of names. <a class="ref" href="https://genderize.io/" onclick="window.open('https://genderize.io/'); return false">Genderize.io</a>, for
                     instance, predicts the gender of a first name from the user
                     profiles of unnamed social media sites [<a class="ref" href="#genderize">Genderize.io n.d.</a>]. A film scholar analyzing male and
                     female characters in a database of modern American
                     television shows might use Genderize.io to accurately
                     predict the gender of these characters, including Leslie
                     Fay. But researchers studying a longer timespan need to take
                     into account the changing nature of naming practices. If
                     that same film scholar wanted to compare the characters of
                     modern television shows to characters during the silent film
                     era, existing tools like Genderize.io would misidentify
                     Leslie Fay’s gender in the earlier screenplays. Other names
                     used in the United States such as Madison, Morgan, Sydney,
                     and Kendall, have also flipped their gender over the past
                     century and would similarly be misidentified. The prevalence
                     of changes in the gender of names in the last half of the
                     twentieth century implies that gendered lists of names drawn
                     from contemporary data are anachronistic and so of limited
                     use for datasets that encompass changing periods of
                     time.<a class="noteRef" href="#d4e282">[3]</a></div>

                     think of themselves as historians. Anyone studying a period
                     longer than a few years, or anyone studying a group whose
                     demographics do not match the groups used by a contemporary
                     tool such as Genderize.io will also encounter this problem.
                     A literary scholar studying a corpus of poems from the
                     mid-twentieth century might wish to compare the stanza
                     structures of male and female poets. Existing tools based on
                     contemporary data risks misidentifying these writers, many
                     of whom were born (and named) more than a century prior to
                     the creation of these modern name datasets. This problem
                     will only increase with growing life expectancies: as of
                     2012, the average American lifespan was nearly seventy-nine
                     years — more than enough time for naming practices to change
                     quite dramatically between a person’s birth and death [<a class="ref" href="#worldbank2014">World Bank 2014-</a>]. Predicting gender from first
                     names therefore requires a method that takes into
                     account change over time.

                  <div class="ptext" id="p6">Our solution to the "Leslie problem" is to create a
                     software package that combines a predictive algorithm with
                     several historical datasets suitable to various times and
                     regions. The algorithm calculates the proportion of male or
                     female uses of a name in a given birth year or range of
                     years. It thus can provide not only a prediction of the
                     gender of a name, but also a measure of that prediction’s
                     accuracy. For example, our program predicts that a person
                     named Leslie who was born in 1950 is female, but reports a
                     low level of certainty in that prediction, since just 52
                     percent of the babies named Leslie born in the United States
                     in 1950 were girls and 48 percent were boys. These
                     probabilities help a user determine what level of certainty
                     is acceptable for predicting the gender of different
                     names.

                     limitations, in particular its dependency on a state-defined
                     gender binary. Inferring gender from personal names is a
                     blunt tool to study a complex subject. Gender theorists and
                     feminist scholars have spent decades unpacking the full
                     range of meanings behind gender as an analytical concept,
                     including the fluid relationship between biological sex and
                     gender identity [<a class="ref" href="#butler1990">Butler 1990</a>], [<a class="ref" href="#butler1993">Butler 1993</a>]. On its own, our method has
                     little to say about crucial topics such as the
                     intersectionality of gender with race, class, and power, the
                     lives of transgender people, or what the categories
                     "male" or "female" mean in any given
                     historical and social context [<a class="ref" href="#crenshaw1991">Crenshaw 1991</a>]
                     [<a class="ref" href="#mccall2005">McCall 2005</a>]. The leap from datasets that
                     contain records of sex at birth to gender has rightly been
                     critiqued by scholars [<a class="ref" href="#posner2015">Posner 2015</a>], [<a class="ref" href="#westbrook2015">Westbrook and Saperstein 2015</a>]. The tool cannot reflect how
                     an individual person self-identifies and how gender shapes
                     their lived experience, since it relies on large datasets
                     created by state agencies such as the U.S. Census Bureau.
                     Much like the state’s definition of racial categories,
                     governments impose a gender binary in their data collection
                     that says more about existing power structures than the ways
                     in which people self-identify. [<a class="ref" href="#brubaker2000">Brubaker and Cooper 2000</a>, 14–17], [<a class="ref" href="#pascoe2009">Pascoe 2009</a>], [<a class="ref" href="#canaday2011">Canaday 2011</a>], [<a class="ref" href="#landrum2014">Landrum 2014</a>].
                     When using the predictions provided by this method, users
                     must judge for themselves how they reflect the social and
                     cultural practices of the time and place under study.

                  <div class="ptext" id="p13">The most significant problem with the Kantrowitz names corpus
                     and thus the NLTK implementation is that it assumes that
                     names are timeless. As pointed out above, this makes the
                     corpus problematic for historical purposes. Furthermore
                     the Kantrowitz corpus includes other oddities which make it
                     less useful for research. Some names such as Abby are
                     overwhelmingly female and some such as Bill are
                     overwhelmingly male, but the corpus includes them as both
                     male and female. The Kantrowitz corpus contains only 7,576
                     unique names, a mere 8.3% of the 91,320 unique names in a
                     dataset provided by the Social Security Administration and
                     2.23% of the 339,967 unique names in the census records
                     provided in the Integrated Public Use Microdata Series
                     (IPUMS) USA dataset. There are therefore many names that it
                     cannot identify. Assuming for the moment that our method
                     provides more accurate results, we estimate that 4.74%
                     percent of the names in the Kantrowitz corpus are classified
                     as ambiguous when a gender could be reasonably predicted
                     from the name, that 1.24% percent of the names are
                     classified as male when they should be classified as female,
                     and that 1.82% are classified as female when they should be
                     classified as male. This error rate is a separate concern
                     from the much smaller size of the Kantrowitz
                     corpus.<a class="noteRef" href="#d4e412">[8]</a></div>

                  <div class="ptext" id="p14">We mention the Kantrowitz name corpus as implemented in NLTK
                     because the Natural Language Toolkit is rightly regarded as
                     influential for scholarship. Its flaws for predicting
                     gender, which are a minor part of the software’s total
                     functionality, are also typical of the problems with most
                     other implementations of gender prediction algorithms. The
                     Genderize.io API is, for example, a more sophisticated
                     implementation of gender prediction than the NLTK algorithm.
                     Besides predicting male or female for gender, it also
                     reports the proportion of male and female names, along with
                     a count of the number of uses of the name on which it is
                     basing its prediction. Genderize.io will also permit the user
                     to customize a prediction for different countries, which is
                     an important feature. Genderize.io reports that its "database contains 142848 distinct names
                     across 77 countries and 85 languages."
                     Genderize.io is unsuitable for historical work, however, because it is
                     based only on contemporary data. According to the
                     documentation for its API, "it utilizes
                     big datasets of information, from user profiles across
                     major social networks." It would be anachronistic
                     to apply these datasets to the past, and Genderize.io
                     provides no functionality to filter results chronologically
                     as it does geographically. In addition, Genderize.io does
                     not make clear exactly what comprises the dataset and how it
                     was gathered, which keeps scholars from interrogating the
                     value of the source [<a class="ref" href="#genderize">Genderize.io n.d.</a>].<a class="noteRef" href="#d4e426">[9]</a></div>

                     strong tradition of being friendly to scholarship. It was
                     originally created for statistics and many of its core
                     contributors are academics; it provides facilities for

                     rigorous set of standards to ensure the quality of packages
                     contributed. R has a number of language features, such as
                     data frames, which permit easy manipulation of
                     data.<a class="noteRef" href="#d4e478">[11]</a> In particular, R
                     permits the publication of packages containing data

                     the gender package. The gender package is affiliated with
                     <a class="ref" href="http://ropensci.org/" onclick="window.open('http://ropensci.org/'); return false">rOpenSci</a>, an

                     provided code review, publicity, and an infrastructure to
                     support the project. Finally, our method is in principle
                     extensible to other languages, such as Python, should other

                     since often a person cannot be associated with an exact
                     date. It is especially important that the algorithm take
                     into account any biases in the data to formulate more
                     accurate predictions. Development of the R package has had
                     two primary aims. The first is to abstract the predictive
                     algorithm to the simplest possible form so that it is usable
                     for a wide range of historical problems rather than
                     depending on the format of any particular data set. The
                     second has been to provide as many datasets as possible in
                     order for users to tailor the algorithm’s predictions to
                     particular times and places.

                     gender in every year beginning with 1880 and ending with
                     2012. The SSA list includes any name which was used more
                     than five times in a given year, thereby capturing all but
                     the most infrequently used names from each year. The
                     description "baby names" provided by the SSA is a
                     serious misnomer. When Social Security became available
                     during the New Deal, its first beneficiaries were adults
                     past or near retirement age. The dataset goes back to 1880,
                     the birth year for a 55 year-old adult when Social Security
                     was enacted. Even after 1935, registration at birth for
                     Social Security was not mandatory until 1986. As we will
                     demonstrate below, the way in which the data was gathered
                     requires an adjustment to our predictions of gender.<a class="noteRef" href="#d4e516">[13]</a></div>

                        as the probability we calculated above for just 1935,
                        but our method also returns the figures it used to
                        calculate those probabilities: 1,067 instances of
                        "Sidney" in 1935 versus 10,110 total instances
                        for the decade as a whole.

                        this bias is unclear, though we speculate that it is

                        in 1935 than it is today. Since women tend to live
                        longer than men, they were overrepresented in Social
                        Security applications.

                        make predictions for years from 1790 to 1930 (which
                        avoids the "bubble" in the SSA data)
                        and that they use the SSA dataset for years after
                        1930.<a class="noteRef" href="#d4e689">[19]</a> Second, we have built in a

                        <span class="monospace">gender()</span> function. If we assume that
                        the secondary sex ratio (that is, the ratio of male to
                        female births) in any given year does not deviate from

                     how the method can reveal hidden patterns within large
                     textual collections. In a 2005 report for the American
                     Historical Association, Elizabeth Lunbeck acknowledged
                     "a sea change in the [historical]
                     profession with respect to gender" before going
                     on to describe the limits to this change for female
                     historians, who face ongoing personal discrimination, lower
                     salaries, and barriers to securing high-ranking positions.
                     Lunbeck’s report drew in part on a survey of 362 female
                     historians that produced a rich source of responses
                     detailing the entrenched and multi-faceted challenges facing
                     women in the profession [<a class="ref" href="#lunbeck2005">Lunbeck 2005</a>]. What
                     follows is a quantitative supplement to Lunbeck’s analysis
                     that uses our program to analyze gender representation
                     amongst historians across a much larger scale and a much
                     longer time period. We study one of the bedrocks of the
                     historical profession — scholarly research — and focus on
                     two types of output: the dissertation and the monograph.
                     Although women have achieved rough parity with men in terms
                     of the number of completed dissertations, female historians
                     continue to face an unequal playing field in the monographic
                     landscape. Applying our method to the pages of the <cite class="title italic">American Historical Review</cite> reveals
                     a persistent and significant gap in the number of
                     male-authored and female-authored books reviewed by one of
                     the field’s premier academic journals.

                     transition out of the training phase of the historical
                     profession. To identify how many women and men completed
                     PhD-level training in history each year, we used data
                     supplied by ProQuest for roughly eighty thousand PhD

                     might have been born, assuming that a historian was between
                     25 and 45 years old when completing their dissertation. With
                     this temporal information, we were able to infer their
                     gender and chart how the larger representation of women and

                     proportion of male and female dissertation
                     authors. The proportion of dissertations written by women
                     has steadily increased over the past half-century, a change
                     that began in the late 1960s and continued through the early
                     2000s. Since that point, the proportion of dissertations
                     written by women has largely plateaued at a few percentage

                     scholarship produced by an academic historian. The second
                     usually centers on the writing of an academic monograph to
                     be read and evaluated by their peers. These monographs
                     remain the "coin of the realm" for many historians, and
                     the value of that coin often depends on it being reviewed in

                      [<a class="ref" href="#americanhistoricalreview">American Historical Review n.d.</a>]. The <cite class="title italic">AHR</cite> is not only one
                     of the widest-ranging journals in the profession, it is also
                     the oldest; the journal has been publishing continuously
                     since 1895. The range, scope, longevity, and reputation of
                     the <cite class="title italic">AHR</cite> makes it an ideal proxy

                     other historians in positions of power are taking it
                     seriously. Even if it garners a negative review, the fact
                     that it appears in the journal at all is a measure of the
                     fact that the profession’s gatekeepers have deemed it
                     important enough to review. It is precisely this
                     professional gatekeeping dimension that we can analyze using
                     the gender package: are books by men more likely to be
                     reviewed then books by women, and if so, how much more
                     likely?

                     inferred the gender of the authors of these books, which we
                     could in turn use to plot the proportion of female and male
                     authors over time. The temporal trajectory of gender
                     representation in the journal’s reviews roughly resembles
                     that of history dissertations: women began making inroads in
                     the late 1960s and continued to make steady gains over the
                     next four decades. By the twenty-first century, the

                     is, unfortunately, far from alone. Many of the profession’s
                     most prestigious annual honors go to drastically more men
                     than women. As of 2015, the Pulitzer Prize for History has
                     been awarded to exactly two female historians in the past
                     twenty years [<a class="ref" href="#pulitzerprizes2014">The Pulitzer Prizes: History 2014</a>]. The

                     most obvious cases of gender inequity in the historical
                     profession. Overt discrimination still exists, but inequity
                     operates in ways that are far more cloaked and far more
                     complex, making them difficult to recognize and remedy. They
                     take the form of subconscious bias that subtly weakens the
                     assessment of work done by female historians, whether in a
                     seminar paper or a job application. Moreover, gender
                     discrimination frequently intersects with other kinds of
                     racial and socioeconomic inequity that erects even higher
                     barriers in women’s careers [<a class="ref" href="#townsend2008">Townsend 2008</a>].
                     Gendered family dynamics add another layer of challenges for
                     women: a 2011 survey by the American Historical Association
                     revealed that female historians dedicated substantially more
                     time to child and elder care than their male colleagues,
                     leaving them with less time for the kind of academic
                     research that the profession rewards most highly [<a class="ref" href="#townsend2012">Townsend 2012</a>]. All of these factors combine
                     and amplify each other to contribute to the gender gap in

                     The hidden, murky, and systemic dimensions of gender

                     imperative for reasearchers.

                  <div class="ptext" id="p45">Finally, we used the gender package to reveal some of the
                     subtler ways in which gender iniquity operates in the
                     historical profession. After inferring the gender of book
                     authors reviewed by the <cite class="title italic">AHR</cite>, we
                     were also able to infer the gender of the reviewers
                     themselves. This led us to two findings. First, the story is
                     much the same for reviewers as it is for authors: more than
                     twice as many men as women appear as reviewers in the
                     journal. This is important because reviewers for the <cite class="title italic">AHR</cite> garner a certain degree of
                     prestige from their work — perhaps not to the same prestige as
                     winning a Pulitzer Prize, but prestige nonetheless. To
                     become a reviewer, one must possess a PhD or equivalent
                     degree and have published at least one book-length
                     manuscript [<a class="ref" href="#americanhistoricalreview">American Historical Review n.d.</a>]. <cite class="title italic">AHR</cite> reviewers are understood to
                     have sufficient experience and command over a given
                     sub-field to evaluate the merits and weaknesses of a new
                     contribution to that literature. Being a reviewer for the
                     journal is, in many ways, a proxy for expertise. When there
                     are twice as many male "experts" as female
                     "experts" appearing in the <cite class="title italic">AHR</cite> it imbues our understanding of what
                     constitutes historical expertise and who possesses it.

                  <div class="ptext" id="p46">The second finding we arrived at when examining the gender of
                     <cite class="title italic">AHR</cite> reviewers was a better
                     understanding of who reviews which book authors. Once again,
                     the methodology reveals patterns that we might suspect but
                     tend to stay hidden from direct sight. About three times as
                     many men as women write reviews of male-authored books in
                     the <cite class="title italic">AHR</cite>. For female-authored
                     books, the ratio of female-to-male reviewers is closer to
                     50/50. In short, women are far more likely to write reviews
                     of other women, while men tend to gravitate more towards
                     male authors — who are, of course, already over-represented in

                     reviewers help illustrate the ways in which gender inequity
                     in the profession is so insidious. It is not always an overt
                     case of deciding to award a prestigious prize to a male
                     historian; it can be as seemingly innocuous as deciding to
                     write a book review of a male author’s book. Countless
                     individual actions like these constitute the core
                     relationships that knit together the profession, and too
                     often these tiny actions benefit men more than women:
                     chairing a panel of mostly male historians, taking on a new
                     male advisee, or assigning mostly male-authored books on a
                     syllabus. On their own they might appear benign — one might
                     argue that male historians simply happen to be interested in
                     similar research topics — but in aggregate they contribute
                     to a broader professional landscape that puts female
                     historians at a disadvantage.

                     more than twice as likely to be written by a man than a
                     woman. This disparity is put into even sharper relief when
                     set against the much smaller gender gap between female and
                     male historians who complete dissertations. Women might be
                     getting hired at comparable rates to men, but discriminatory
                     gatekeeping remains alive and well in the profession. The

                     deal with the problem of incompleteness and scarcity within
                     their sources. Our method uses <em class="emph">abundant</em>
                     existing datasets to infer additional information from
                     <em class="emph">scarce</em> datasets. Its major contribution is
                     to incorporate a historical method, one that takes into
                     account how gendered naming practices have changed over
                     time. This temporal approach provides much improved results
                     over simpler, anachronistic, or ahistorical lookup methods.
                     The gender package is, of course, far from perfect. By
                     relying on historical datasets collected by state agencies,
                     it reinforces a gender binary and larger power structure

                     complexity and discovery. Its reliance on a male/female
                     binary dampens the complexity of gender identity while
                     simulatenously pointing towards new discoveries about gender
                     within large textual collections. Its use of historical
                     datasets helps its users uncover patterns where they were
                     previously unknown, providing further grist to the mill of
                     more traditional methods. Furthermore, the gender package is
                     entirely open-source, and we have provided detailed
                     documentation for its code and underlying data so that those
                     who wish to build upon it can modify the package
                     accordingly. For instance, future researchers might compile
                     datasets of names that move beyond the gender binary imposed
                     by government agencies. They could then incorporate these
                     datasets into the gender package, replacing "male" and
                     "female" designations with a much wider spectrum of
                     potential gender identities.

                     methodological need. As of November 2015, the gender package
                     has been downloaded more than 80,000 times and continues to
                     be downloaded about 19,000 times per month. It has also been
                     incorporated as a pedagogical tool within digital humanities courses [<a class="ref" href="#jockers2014b">Jockers 2014b</a>].<a class="noteRef" href="#d4e1002">[24]</a>
                     Researchers have used it to uncover instances gender
                     inequity in a range of different areas, from biases in
                     students’ teaching evaluations to the disparities between
                     attendees and authors at the annual Digital Humanities
                     Conference [<a class="ref" href="#schmidt2015">Schmidt 2015</a>], [<a class="ref" href="#weingart2015">Weingart 2015</a>]. These implementations
                     illustrate the value of the method. Its major intervention
                     is to algorithmically infer gender in textual sources in a
                     way that takes into account change over time. Rather than
                     trying to shoehorn existing computer science methods to fit
                     humanities research, the gender package reverses this
                     traditional disciplinary relationship. It uses a humanistic
                     starting point — the historical relationship between gender
                     and naming practices — to contribute a new method to
                     data analysis.

                  dealing with personal information raises important
                  ethical issues for digital humanists, particularly in
                  light of the revelations about domestic spying at the
                  NSA brought forth by Edward Snowden in 2013. [<a class="ref" href="#weingart2014">Weingart 2014</a>] Kieran Healy has used
                  network analysis to demonstrate how researchers can
                  infer information from datasets while also touching on
                  the troubling ethical issue of surveillance [<a class="ref" href="#healy2013">Healy 2013</a>].

               <div class="endnote" id="d4e282"><span class="noteRef">[3]</span>In general, names tend to shift from being
                  predominantly male to being predominantly female; the
                  shift rarely happens in the other direction. In general,
                  names that transition from male to female also became
                  increasingly popular over time. For example, the name
                  Madison changed from male to female quite suddenly after
                  1985. Whereas before it had been an infrequently used
                  male name, after 1985 it skyrocketed in popularity and
                  by the early 2000s was one of the ten most frequently
                  used names for baby girls. Broadly speaking, in the late
                  twentieth century Americans girls became increasingly
                  more likely than American boys to receive a
                  "trendy" name, and once that name
                  was associated with women it was unlikely to be given to
                  male babies. The few exceptions, such as "Jan",
                  have a different causal mechanism. We speculate that Jan
                  as an English name is female but that Jan as a
                  Scandinavian name is male. Because the name has remained
                  relatively uncommon, other causes besides changing
                  gender preferences can explain the change.
