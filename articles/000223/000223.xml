                <p>This article describes a new method for inferring the gender
                    of personal names using large historical datasets. In
                    contrast to existing methods of gender prediction that treat
                    names as if they are timelessly associated with one gender,
                    this method uses a historical approach that takes into
                    account how naming practices change over time. It uses
                    historical data to measure the likelihood that a name was
                    associated with a particular gender based on the time or
                    place under study. This approach generates more accurate
                    results for sources that encompass changing periods of time,
                    providing digital humanities scholars with a tool to
                    estimate the gender of names across large textual
                    collections. The article first describes the methodology as
                    implemented in the <ref target="https://github.com/ropensci/gender">gender</ref>
                    package for the <ref target="https://www.r-project.org/">R
                        programming language</ref>. It goes on to apply the
                    method to a case study in which we examine gender and
                    gatekeeping in the American historical profession over the
                    past half-century. The gender package illustrates the
                    importance of incorporating historical approaches into
                    computer science and related fields.<note>Please see the

                <head>Introduction: The <q>Leslie Problem</q></head>
                <p>The analytical category of gender has transformed humanities
                    research over the past half-century, and, more recently,
                    widespread digitization has opened up opportunities to apply
                    this category to new sources and in new ways. Initiatives
                    like the <ref target="http://www.artsrn.ualberta.ca/orlando/">Orlando
                        Project</ref>, the <ref target="http://idhmc.tamu.edu/poetess/">Poetess
                        Archive</ref>, and the <ref target="http://www.wwp.northeastern.edu/">Women Writers
                        Project</ref> have done crucial work to recover the
                    voices of female authors and writers <ptr target="#orlandoproject"/>
                    <ptr target="#poetessarchive"/>, <ptr target="#womenwritersproject"/>. Other scholars have
                    used digital analysis to study linguistic styles of male and
                    female playwrights or representations of gendered bodies in
                    European fairytales <ptr target="#argamon2009"/>, <ptr target="#weingart2013"/>. The proliferation of
                    machine-readable datasets and digital texts brings with it a
                    vast trove of material with which to study gender. Much
                    more, however, can still be done. To better equip humanities
                    researchers to take full advantage of digital sources, we
                    have developed a methodology that infers gender from one of
                    the most common features of humanities datasets: personal
                    names.</p>
                <p>As the digital archive grows larger and larger, researchers
                    have not only been able to access information that
                        <emph>is</emph> there, but to infer information that
                        <emph>isn’t</emph> there. Topic modeling, for example,
                    has been used to uncover underlying trends across a century
                    of academic articles in literary studies <ptr target="#goldstone2014"/>. Can researchers similarly use
                    personal names to infer information about individual people?
                    After all, personal names appear across a wide range of
                    sources in the humanities: literary characters in stories
                    and novels, authorship information in archival metadata, or
                    individuals mentioned by historical newspapers and magazine
                    articles. Authors, characters, or historical actors are the
                    sorts of people who stand at the analytical center of
                    humanities scholarship, and their names provide a way to infer additional information about
                        them.<note>The availability of large-scale datasets
                        dealing with personal information raises important
                        ethical issues for digital humanists, particularly in
                        light of the revelations about domestic spying at the
                        NSA brought forth by Edward Snowden in 2013. <ptr target="#weingart2014"/> Kieran Healy has used
                        network analysis to demonstrate how researchers can
                        infer information from datasets while also touching on
                        the troubling ethical issue of surveillance <ptr target="#healy2013"/>.</note></p>
                <p>One of the basic pieces of information researchers can infer
                    from a personal name is the gender of that individual:
                        <q>Jane Fay,</q> for instance, is likely a woman, while
                    her brother <q>John Fay</q> is likely a man. A computer
                    program can infer their respective genders by looking up
                        <q>Jane</q> and <q>John</q> in a dataset that
                    matches names to genders. But this approach runs into a
                    problem: the link between gender and naming practices, like
                    language itself, is not static. What about Jane and John
                    Fay’s sibling, Leslie? If Leslie was born in the past sixty
                    years, chances are good that Leslie would be their sister.
                    But if the three siblings were born in the early twentieth
                    century, chances are good that Leslie would be their
                    brother. That is because the conventional gender for the
                    name Leslie switched over the course of one hundred years.
                    In 1900 some 92% of the babies born in the United States who
                    were named Leslie were classified as male, while in 2000
                    about 96% of the Leslies born in that year were classified
                    as female.</p>
                <figure>

                    <graphic url="resources/images/figure01.png"/>
                </figure>
                <p>For those working on contemporary subjects, the <q>Leslie
                        problem</q> is not an especially pressing one. There are
                    a variety of tools that use current databases of names. <ref target="https://genderize.io/">Genderize.io</ref>, for
                    instance, predicts the gender of a first name from the user
                    profiles of unnamed social media sites <ptr target="#genderize"/>. A film scholar analyzing male and
                    female characters in a database of modern American
                    television shows might use Genderize.io to accurately
                    predict the gender of these characters, including Leslie
                    Fay. But researchers studying a longer timespan need to take
                    into account the changing nature of naming practices. If
                    that same film scholar wanted to compare the characters of
                    modern television shows to characters during the silent film
                    era, existing tools like Genderize.io would misidentify
                    Leslie Fay’s gender in the earlier screenplays. Other names
                    used in the United States such as Madison, Morgan, Sydney,
                    and Kendall, have also flipped their gender over the past
                    century and would similarly be misidentified. The prevalence
                    of changes in the gender of names in the last half of the
                    twentieth century implies that gendered lists of names drawn
                    from contemporary data are anachronistic and so of limited
                    use for datasets that encompass changing periods of
                        time.<note>In general, names tend to shift from being
                        predominantly male to being predominantly female; the
                        shift rarely happens in the other direction. In general,
                        names that transition from male to female also became
                        increasingly popular over time. For example, the name
                        Madison changed from male to female quite suddenly after
                        1985. Whereas before it had been an infrequently used
                        male name, after 1985 it skyrocketed in popularity and
                        by the early 2000s was one of the ten most frequently
                        used names for baby girls. Broadly speaking, in the late
                        twentieth century Americans girls became increasingly
                        more likely than American boys to receive a
                            <soCalled>trendy</soCalled> name, and once that name
                        was associated with women it was unlikely to be given to
                        male babies. The few exceptions, such as <q>Jan</q>,
                        have a different causal mechanism. We speculate that Jan
                        as an English name is female but that Jan as a
                        Scandinavian name is male. Because the name has remained
                        relatively uncommon, other causes besides changing
                        gender preferences can explain the change.</note></p>

                <p>The <q>Leslie problem</q> is not just for researchers who
                    think of themselves as historians. Anyone studying a period
                    longer than a few years, or anyone studying a group whose
                    demographics do not match the groups used by a contemporary
                    tool such as Genderize.io will also encounter this problem.
                    A literary scholar studying a corpus of poems from the
                    mid-twentieth century might wish to compare the stanza
                    structures of male and female poets. Existing tools based on
                    contemporary data risks misidentifying these writers, many
                    of whom were born (and named) more than a century prior to
                    the creation of these modern name datasets. This problem
                    will only increase with growing life expectancies: as of
                    2012, the average American lifespan was nearly seventy-nine
                    years — more than enough time for naming practices to change
                    quite dramatically between a person’s birth and death <ptr target="#worldbank2014"/>. Predicting gender from first
                    names therefore requires a method that takes into
                    account change over time.</p>
                <p>Our solution to the <q>Leslie problem</q> is to create a
                    software package that combines a predictive algorithm with
                    several historical datasets suitable to various times and
                    regions. The algorithm calculates the proportion of male or
                    female uses of a name in a given birth year or range of
                    years. It thus can provide not only a prediction of the
                    gender of a name, but also a measure of that prediction’s
                    accuracy. For example, our program predicts that a person
                    named Leslie who was born in 1950 is female, but reports a
                    low level of certainty in that prediction, since just 52
                    percent of the babies named Leslie born in the United States
                    in 1950 were girls and 48 percent were boys. These
                    probabilities help a user determine what level of certainty
                    is acceptable for predicting the gender of different
                    names.</p>
                <p>Researchers who use this method need to be fully aware of its
                    limitations, in particular its dependency on a state-defined
                    gender binary. Inferring gender from personal names is a
                    blunt tool to study a complex subject. Gender theorists and
                    feminist scholars have spent decades unpacking the full
                    range of meanings behind gender as an analytical concept,
                    including the fluid relationship between biological sex and
                    gender identity <ptr target="#butler1990"/>, <ptr target="#butler1993"/>. On its own, our method has
                    little to say about crucial topics such as the
                    intersectionality of gender with race, class, and power, the
                    lives of transgender people, or what the categories
                        <q>male</q> or <q>female</q> mean in any given
                    historical and social context <ptr target="#crenshaw1991"/>
                    <ptr target="#mccall2005"/>. The leap from datasets that
                    contain records of sex at birth to gender has rightly been
                    critiqued by scholars <ptr target="#posner2015"/>, <ptr target="#westbrook2015"/>. The tool cannot reflect how
                    an individual person self-identifies and how gender shapes
                    their lived experience, since it relies on large datasets
                    created by state agencies such as the U.S. Census Bureau.
                    Much like the state’s definition of racial categories,
                    governments impose a gender binary in their data collection
                    that says more about existing power structures than the ways
                    in which people self-identify. <ptr target="#brubaker2000" loc="14–17"/>, <ptr target="#pascoe2009"/>, <ptr target="#canaday2011"/>, <ptr target="#landrum2014"/>.
                    When using the predictions provided by this method, users
                    must judge for themselves how they reflect the social and
                    cultural practices of the time and place under study.</p>
                <p>Imperfect as it is, this method nevertheless gives digital
                    humanities scholars a much-needed tool to study gender in
                    textual collections. We have made the method as transparent
                    and flexible as possible through the inclusion of
                    probability figures. This makes the underlying data visible
                    to users and allows them the opportunity to interrogate the
                    assumptions that come with it. When used thoughtfully, this
                    method can infer additional information about individuals
                    who stand at the heart of humanities scholarship, providing
                    another way to see and interpret sources across large scales
                    of analysis.</p>
                <p>The remainder of this article is divided into two sections.
                    First, we describe our method in more detail, outline its
                    advantages over existing methods, and explain how to use it.
                    Second, we apply the method to a case study of gatekeeping
                    in the historical profession in order to demonstrate its
                    usefulness for humanities scholars.</p>

                <head>I. The Method</head>
                <p>Why do scholars need a method for inferring gender that
                    relies on historical data? Let’s start with a comparison.
                    One existing method for predicting gender is available in
                    the <ref target="http://www.nltk.org/">Natural Language
                        Toolkit</ref> for the Python programming language <ptr target="#bird2009" loc="Chapter 2"/>.<note>Chapter 6 of
                            <ptr target="#bird2009"/> also describes a method of
                        predicting gender from the last letter of the name, but
                        this example is given for the sake of explaining
                        supervised classification and not as an end in itself,
                        so we do not have reason to address this as a historical
                        method.</note> The NLTK is an influential software
                    package for scholarship because it provides an extraordinary
                    range of tools for analyzing natural language.<note><ptr target="#bird2009"/> has been cited 812 times
                        according to <ref target="https://goo.gl/yX87uV">Google
                            Scholar</ref>. Because in the humanities (unlike in
                        other fields) the practice of citing software essential
                        to performing scholarly analysis is regrettably rare,
                        even nonexistent, such metrics are difficult to
                        determine. Yet searching journals such as <title rend="italic">Digital Humanities Quarterly</title>
                        and the <title rend="italic">Journal of Digital
                            Humanities</title> reveals that natural language
                        processing, for which the NLTK is the foremost
                        implementation, is one of the key methodologies of the
                        digital humanities.</note> Included in the NLTK are two
                    lists of male and female names created by the computer
                    scientist Mark Kantrowitz with assistance from Bill
                        Ross.<note> The <ref target="http://www.cs.cmu.edu/afs/cs/project/ai-repository/ai/areas/nlp/corpora/names/0.html">original lists of names</ref> are available at the
                        website of the computer science department at Carnegie
                        Mellon University, and the NLTK implementation is
                        described in its <ref target="http://www.nltk.org/howto/corpus.html">documentation</ref>.</note> These lists include
                    7,576 unique names. Using the Kantrowitz names corpus in the
                    NLTK, one could look up a name like Jane or John and find
                    out whether it is male or female.</p>
                <p>The Kantrowitz corpus provides the list of names.<note>The
                        examples below is drawn from our gender package which
                        implements the Kantrowitz dataset for sake of
                        comparison, though its use is not recommended for actual
                        research. The gender package combines the Kantrowitz
                        corpus’s two lists into a single list, identifying names
                        that are ambiguous because they appear on both lists as
                            <q>either</q>.</note>
                    <eg>
                   
                   genderdata::kantrowitz
                    ## Source: local data frame [7,579 x 2]
                    ##
                    ##            name     gender

                    ## 6        abbott       male
                    ## 7          abby     either

                </p>
                <p>One can then easily write a function which looks up the
                    gender of a given name. <eg>
                    
                    gender ("abby", method = "kantrowitz")
                   
                   ## $name
                    ## [1]   "abby"
                    ## 
                    ## $gender
                    ## [1]   "either"</eg>
                </p>
                <p>The most significant problem with the Kantrowitz names corpus
                    and thus the NLTK implementation is that it assumes that
                    names are timeless. As pointed out above, this makes the
                    corpus problematic for historical purposes. Furthermore
                    the Kantrowitz corpus includes other oddities which make it
                    less useful for research. Some names such as Abby are
                    overwhelmingly female and some such as Bill are
                    overwhelmingly male, but the corpus includes them as both
                    male and female. The Kantrowitz corpus contains only 7,576
                    unique names, a mere 8.3% of the 91,320 unique names in a
                    dataset provided by the Social Security Administration and
                    2.23% of the 339,967 unique names in the census records
                    provided in the Integrated Public Use Microdata Series
                    (IPUMS) USA dataset. There are therefore many names that it
                    cannot identify. Assuming for the moment that our method
                    provides more accurate results, we estimate that 4.74%
                    percent of the names in the Kantrowitz corpus are classified
                    as ambiguous when a gender could be reasonably predicted
                    from the name, that 1.24% percent of the names are
                    classified as male when they should be classified as female,
                    and that 1.82% are classified as female when they should be
                    classified as male. This error rate is a separate concern
                    from the much smaller size of the Kantrowitz
                        corpus.<note>This error rate was calculated using the
                        Social Security Administration database, assuming a
                        range of years between 1932 and 2012, which is the
                        default setting within the gender package. Of course,
                        the error rate would fluctuate for different time
                        periods and regions.</note></p>
                <p>We mention the Kantrowitz name corpus as implemented in NLTK
                    because the Natural Language Toolkit is rightly regarded as
                    influential for scholarship. Its flaws for predicting
                    gender, which are a minor part of the software’s total
                    functionality, are also typical of the problems with most
                    other implementations of gender prediction algorithms. The
                    Genderize.io API is, for example, a more sophisticated
                    implementation of gender prediction than the NLTK algorithm.
                    Besides predicting male or female for gender, it also
                    reports the proportion of male and female names, along with
                    a count of the number of uses of the name on which it is
                    basing its prediction. Genderize.io will also permit the user
                    to customize a prediction for different countries, which is
                    an important feature. Genderize.io reports that its <quote rend="inline" source="#genderize">database contains 142848 distinct names
                        across 77 countries and 85 languages.</quote>
                    Genderize.io is unsuitable for historical work, however, because it is
                    based only on contemporary data. According to the
                    documentation for its API, <quote rend="inline" source="#genderize">it utilizes
                        big datasets of information, from user profiles across
                        major social networks.</quote> It would be anachronistic
                    to apply these datasets to the past, and Genderize.io
                    provides no functionality to filter results chronologically
                    as it does geographically. In addition, Genderize.io does
                    not make clear exactly what comprises the dataset and how it
                    was gathered, which keeps scholars from interrogating the
                    value of the source <ptr target="#genderize"/>.<note>Quotations are taken from the <ref target="https://genderize.io/">Genderize.io

                <p>R and Python are two of the most commonly used languages for
                    data analysis. Surveys and analysis of usage
                    point out the growth of R and the continuing popularity of
                    Python for data science generally, and scholars are
                    producing guides to using these languages for historical or
                    humanities research <ptr target="#programminghistorian"/>,
                        <ptr target="#arnold2015"/>, <ptr target="#jockers2014a"/>. Yet Python’s existing packages for gender prediction all
                    implement a method similar to the NLTK or
                        Genderize.io.<note> These Python libraries include <ref target="https://pypi.python.org/pypi/estimate.gender/0.4">estimate.gender</ref>, <ref target="https://github.com/SteelPangolin/genderize">
                            genderize</ref>, and <ref target="https://github.com/block8437/gender.py">gender.py</ref></note> The only other R package for
                    gender prediction, <ref target="https://cran.rstudio.com/web/packages/genderizeR/">genderizeR</ref>, uses the Genderize.io API. Thus two
                    of the most popular data analysis languages used in the
                    digital humanities currently have no satisfactory method for
                    predicting gender from names for historical and humanities
                    research.</p>
                <p>To that end we have created the <ref target="https://github.com/ropensci/gender">gender</ref>
                    package for R which includes both a predictive algorithm and
                    an associated <ref target="https://github.com/lmullen/gender-data-pkg">genderdata</ref> package containing various historical
                    datasets. This R implementation is based on an <ref target="https://github.com/cblevins/Gender-ID-By-Time">earlier Python implementation</ref> by <ref target="http://www.cameronblevins.org/">Cameron
                        Blevins</ref> and <ref target="http://www.conncoll.edu/directories/emeritus-faculty/bridget-baird/">Bridget Baird</ref>.</p>
                <p>We have chosen the R programming language for several reasons. The R language is open-source, so it is freely
                    available to scholars and students. The language has a
                    strong tradition of being friendly to scholarship. It was
                    originally created for statistics and many of its core
                    contributors are academics; it provides facilities for
                    citing packages as scholarship. <ref target="https://cran.r-project.org/">CRAN</ref> (the
                    Comprehensive R Archive Network) offers a central location
                    for publishing R packages for all users. These include a
                    rigorous set of standards to ensure the quality of packages
                    contributed. R has a number of language features, such as
                    data frames, which permit easy manipulation of
                        data.<note>The gender package depends especially on <ptr target="#rcoreteam2015"/>, <ptr target="#wickham2014"/>.</note> In particular, R
                    permits the publication of packages containing data
                    alongside packages containing code — a crucial feature for
                    the gender package. The gender package is affiliated with
                        <ref target="http://ropensci.org/">rOpenSci</ref>, an
                    initiative that supports reproducible research and open data
                    for scientists using R. The rOpenSci advisory board has
                    provided code review, publicity, and an infrastructure to
                    support the project. Finally, our method is in principle
                    extensible to other languages, such as Python, should other
                    scholars choose to do so.</p>
                <p>Inferring gender from names depends on two things. First, it
                    requires a suitable (and suitably large) dataset for the
                    time period and region under study. Unsurprisingly such
                    datasets are almost always gathered in the first instance by
                    governments, though their compilation and digitization may
                    be undertaken by scholarly researchers. Second, it depends
                    on a suitable algorithm for estimating the proportion of
                    male and female names for a given year or range of years,
                    since often a person cannot be associated with an exact
                    date. It is especially important that the algorithm take
                    into account any biases in the data to formulate more
                    accurate predictions. Development of the R package has had
                    two primary aims. The first is to abstract the predictive
                    algorithm to the simplest possible form so that it is usable
                    for a wide range of historical problems rather than
                    depending on the format of any particular data set. The
                    second has been to provide as many datasets as possible in
                    order for users to tailor the algorithm’s predictions to
                    particular times and places.</p>
                <p>The gender package currently uses several datasets which make
                    it suitable for studying the United States from the first
                    federal census in 1790 onwards. The first dataset contains
                    names of applicants for Social Security and is available
                    from <ref target="https://www.data.gov/">Data.gov</ref>
                    <ptr target="#socialsecurityadministration2014a"/>. The
                    second dataset contains names gathered in the decennial
                    censuses and is available from the IPUMS-USA (Integrated
                    Public Use Microdata Series) service from the Minnesota
                    Population Center at the University of Minnesota <ptr target="#ruggles2010"/>.</p>
                <p>The Social Security Administration (SSA) <ref target="http://catalog.data.gov/dataset/baby-names-from-social-security-card-applications-national-level-data">Baby Names</ref> dataset was created as a result of the
                    Social Security Act of 1935 during the New Deal.<note> The
                        Social Security Administration also provides a related
                        dataset which contains the names of applicants broken
                        down by state and year since 1910 <ptr target="#socialsecurityadministration2014b"/>.</note> This dataset contains a list of first names
                    along with how many times each name was assigned to each
                    gender in every year beginning with 1880 and ending with
                    2012. The SSA list includes any name which was used more
                    than five times in a given year, thereby capturing all but
                    the most infrequently used names from each year. The
                    description <q>baby names</q> provided by the SSA is a
                    serious misnomer. When Social Security became available
                    during the New Deal, its first beneficiaries were adults
                    past or near retirement age. The dataset goes back to 1880,
                    the birth year for a 55 year-old adult when Social Security
                    was enacted. Even after 1935, registration at birth for
                    Social Security was not mandatory until 1986. As we will
                    demonstrate below, the way in which the data was gathered
                    requires an adjustment to our predictions of gender.<note>
                        Shane Landrum has studied the history of birth
                        registration in the United States <ptr target="#landrum2014"/>. It is well-known among
                        American historians that the Social Security Act was
                        written to exclude farmworkers as a means of also
                        excluding African Americans. In examining the dataset we
                        have not found any reason to believe that this policy
                        noticeably skewed the prediction of gender from
                        names.</note></p>
                <p>The IPUMS-USA dataset, contributed by <ref target="http://benschmidt.org/">Benjamin Schmidt</ref>,
                    contains records from the United States decennial census
                    from 1790 to 1930. This dataset includes the birth year and
                    numbers of males and females under the age of 62 for all the
                    years in that range. This data has been aggregated by <ref target="https://usa.ipums.org/usa/">IPUMS</ref> at the
                    University of Minnesota and is released as a sample of the
                    total census data. Unlike the SSA dataset, which includes a
                    100% sample for every name reported to the Social Security
                    Administration and used more than five times, the IPUMS data
                    contains 5% or 10% samples of names from the total census
                    data. Because the <code>gender()</code> function relies on
                    proportions of uses of names, rather than raw counts of
                    people with the names, the sampling does not diminish the
                    reliability of the function’s predictions <ptr target="#ruggles2010"/>.</p>
                <p>The gender package also features a dataset from the <ref target="https://www.nappdata.org/napp/">North Atlantic
                        Population Project</ref>. This dataset includes names
                    from Canada, Great Britain, Germany, Iceland, Norway, and
                    Sweden from 1801 to 1910.<note> The North Atlantic
                        Population Project, which is a project of the Minnesota
                        Population Center, also includes data for the United
                        States of America, but we have excluded it since
                        IPUMS-USA and the SSA dataset is more suitable when
                        focusing on that country alone.</note> The SSA, IPUMS,
                    and NAPP datasets (and any future datasets to be added to
                    the package) all have the same simple tabular format.<note>
                        The format of this data departs from the more generally
                        desirable <q>tidy data</q> framework proposed by Hadley
                        Wickham for performance reasons. By keeping the data in
                        a <q>wider</q> format instead of a tidy format as
                        defined by Wickham, the function is able to make its
                        predictions faster <ptr target="#wickham2014"/>.</note>
                    The columns contain the <code>name</code>,
                    <code>year</code>, and number of <code>female</code> and
                        <code>male</code> uses of that name in a particular
                    year. This simple format makes it possible to extend the
                    package to include any place and time period for which there
                    is suitable data.<note> We welcome such contributions at the

                <p>Our method for predicting gender is best understood through a
                    series of examples. First we will use it to predict the
                    gender of a single name in order to demonstrate a simplified
                    version of the inner workings of the function. We will then
                    apply it to a small sample dataset to show how a researcher
                    might use it in practice.</p>
                <div>
                    <head>Example #1: A Sample Name</head>
                    <p>The method for predicting gender from a name using the
                        package’s datasets is simple. Let’s begin by assuming
                        that we want to predict the gender of someone named
                        Sidney who was born in 1935 using the Social Security
                        Administration dataset. Because the dataset contains a
                        list of names for each year, we can simply look up the
                        row for Sidney in 1935. Using the <ref target="https://github.com/hadley/dplyr">dplyr</ref>
                        package for R, which provided a grammar for data
                        manipulation, this can be expressed with the action
                            <q>filter</q>: <eg>
                     
                     genderdata::ssa_national %&gt;%
                        filter(name == "sidney", year == 1935)
                    
                     ## Source: local data frame [1 x 4]
                     ## 
                     ##        name  year female  male
                     ## 1     sidney 1935  93     974</eg>
                    </p>
                    <p>Thus, according to the Social Security Administration,
                        there were 974 boys and 93 girls named Sidney born in
                        1935. We can add another command to calculate the
                            <emph>proportion</emph> of females and males
                            (<q>mutate</q> in the vocabulary of the <ref target="https://github.com/hadley/dplyr">dplyr</ref>
                        package) rather than raw numbers. <eg>
                            
                       
                       genderdata::ssa_national %&gt;%
                           filter(name == "sidney", year == 1935) %&gt;%
                         mutate(proportion_female = female / (male + female),
                                proportion_male = 1 - proportion_female)
                         
                         ## Source: local data frame [1 x 6]
                         ## 
                         ##     name year female male proportion_female  proportion_male
                         ## 1 sidney 1935     93  974        0.08716026        0.9128397
                        </eg>
                    </p>
                    <p>In other words, there is an approximately 91.3% percent
                        chance that a person born in 1935 named Sidney was male.
                        In 2012, for comparison, there was an approximately
                        60.7% percent chance that a person born named Sidney was
                            female.<note>The gender package makes no effort to
                            combine alternative spellings for names, such as
                            Sidney and Sydney, since we think it is better to
                            treat those as separate names. For instance,
                            although they are homophones, Geri is predominately
                            a female name, and Gerry is predominately a male
                            name.</note></p>
                    <p>The method is only slightly more complex if we do not
                        know the exact year when someone was born, as is often
                        the case for historical data. Suppose we know that
                        Sidney was born in the 1930s but cannot identify the
                        exact year of his or her birth. Using the same method as
                        above we can look up the name for all of those years. <eg>

                    <p>Next we can sum up the male and female columns

                        decade. <eg>

     mutate(proportion_female = female / (male + female),

                    </p>
                    <p>In other words, for the decade of the 1930s, we can
                        calculate that there is a 93.2% percent chance that a
                        person named Sidney was male. This is roughly the same
                        as the probability we calculated above for just 1935,
                        but our method also returns the figures it used to
                        calculate those probabilities: 1,067 instances of
                            <q>Sidney</q> in 1935 versus 10,110 total instances
                        for the decade as a whole.</p>

                    <head>Example #2: A Sample Dataset</head>
                    <p>The method’s real utility stems from being able to
                        process larger datasets than a single name. Let’s use,
                        for example, a hypothetical list of editors from a
                        college newspaper to illustrate how a researcher might
                        apply it to their own data. The package’s prediction
                        function allows researchers to choose which reference
                        datasets they would like to use and the range of years
                        for making their predictions. <eg>

                    <p>By taking into account the year of birth, we find that
                        four of our six names were likely male, whereas we might
                        otherwise have predicted that all six were female. We
                        also now know the approximate likelihood that our
                        predictions are correct: at least 80% for all of these
                        predictions.</p>
                    <p>It is also possible to use a range of years for a dataset
                        like this. If our list of editors contained the year in
                        which the person served on the newspaper rather than the
                        birth year, we could make a reasonable assumption that
                        their ages were likely to be between 18 and 24. We could
                        then calculate a minimum and a maximum year of birth for
                        each, and run the prediction function on that range for
                        each person. The exact code to accomplish these types of
                        analysis can be found in the <ref target="https://cran.rstudio.com/web/packages/gender/vignettes/predicting-gender.html">vignette for the gender package</ref>.</p>
                    <p>As previously mentioned, the history of how the Social
                        Security Administration collected the data affects its
                        validity. Specifically, because the data extends back to
                        1880 but the first applications were gathered after
                        1935, the sex ratios in the dataset are skewed in the
                        years before 1930. For example, this dataset implies
                        that thirty percent of the people born in 1900 were
                        male.</p>

                    </figure>
                    <p>It is extremely improbable that nearly seventy percent of
                        the people born in 1900 were female.<note>We are
                            grateful to Ben Schmidt for drawing out attention to
                            this phenomenon.</note> Exactly why the dataset has
                        this bias is unclear, though we speculate that it is
                        because the applicants for Social Security in the early
                        years of the program were approaching retirement age,
                        which was set much closer to the average life expectancy
                        in 1935 than it is today. Since women tend to live
                        longer than men, they were overrepresented in Social
                        Security applications.</p>
                    <p>The solution to this problem is two-fold. First, we
                        recommend that researchers use the IPUMS-USA dataset to
                        make predictions for years from 1790 to 1930 (which
                        avoids the <soCalled>bubble</soCalled> in the SSA data)
                        and that they use the SSA dataset for years after
                            1930.<note>The IPUMS-USA dataset includes only
                            apparently random fluctuations in the gender ratio
                            in any given year.</note> Second, we have built in a
                        correction to the SSA dataset when using the
                            <code>gender()</code> function. If we assume that
                        the secondary sex ratio (that is, the ratio of male to
                        female births) in any given year does not deviate from
                            <code>0.5</code> (that is, equality), it is possible
                        to calculate a correction factor for each year or range
                        of years to even out the dataset. We apply this
                        correction factor automatically when using the SSA
                        dataset.</p>

                <head>II. Measuring Gatekeeping in the Historical
                    Profession</head>
                <p>A case study that relies on the gender package illustrates
                    how the method can reveal hidden patterns within large
                    textual collections. In a 2005 report for the American
                    Historical Association, Elizabeth Lunbeck acknowledged
                        <quote rend="inline" source="#lunbeck2005">a sea change in the [historical]
                        profession with respect to gender</quote> before going
                    on to describe the limits to this change for female
                    historians, who face ongoing personal discrimination, lower
                    salaries, and barriers to securing high-ranking positions.
                    Lunbeck’s report drew in part on a survey of 362 female
                    historians that produced a rich source of responses
                    detailing the entrenched and multi-faceted challenges facing
                    women in the profession <ptr target="#lunbeck2005"/>. What
                    follows is a quantitative supplement to Lunbeck’s analysis
                    that uses our program to analyze gender representation
                    amongst historians across a much larger scale and a much
                    longer time period. We study one of the bedrocks of the
                    historical profession — scholarly research — and focus on
                    two types of output: the dissertation and the monograph.
                    Although women have achieved rough parity with men in terms
                    of the number of completed dissertations, female historians
                    continue to face an unequal playing field in the monographic
                    landscape. Applying our method to the pages of the <title rend="italic">American Historical Review</title> reveals
                    a persistent and significant gap in the number of
                    male-authored and female-authored books reviewed by one of
                    the field’s premier academic journals.</p>
                <p>We begin with the history dissertation, often the defining
                    scholarly output of a historian’s early career. The
                    completion of a dissertation marks a standardized moment of
                    transition out of the training phase of the historical
                    profession. To identify how many women and men completed
                    PhD-level training in history each year, we used data
                    supplied by ProQuest for roughly eighty thousand PhD
                    dissertations completed in the United States between 1950
                    and 2012.<note>ProQuest’s dataset does not permit us to
                        limit dissertations just to dissertations produced in
                        history departments. These dissertations include
                        dissertations <emph>about</emph> history. For a
                        justification of this approach, see a <ref target="http://lincolnmullen.com/research/history-dissertations/">series of blog posts</ref> exploring the dataset.
                        The American Historical Association’s dataset of
                        dissertations relies on reporting from departments and
                        does not have the chronological range of the ProQuest
                        data. Nevertheless, applying the same method to the
                        AHA’s dataset does not provide any reason for thinking
                        that the proportion of authorship by gender over time is
                        substantially different when limited to just history

                        2014.</note> Our program used the year a historian
                    completed
                    his or her dissertation to estimate a period for when they
                    might have been born, assuming that a historian was between
                    25 and 45 years old when completing their dissertation. With
                    this temporal information, we were able to infer their
                    gender and chart how the larger representation of women and
                    men changed year-by-year.</p>

                    <graphic url="resources/images/figure04.png"/>
                </figure>
                <p>Another way to examine this trend is to ignore changes in the
                       absolute number of dissertations produced
                    each year and to instead look at changes in the
                        proportion of male and female dissertation
                    authors. The proportion of dissertations written by women
                    has steadily increased over the past half-century, a change
                    that began in the late 1960s and continued through the early
                    2000s. Since that point, the proportion of dissertations
                    written by women has largely plateaued at a few percentage
                    points below the proportion written by men. Female
                    historians have achieved something approaching parity with
                    male historians in terms of how many women and men complete
                    dissertations each year.</p>

                <p>But the dissertation is only the first major piece of
                    scholarship produced by an academic historian. The second
                    usually centers on the writing of an academic monograph to
                    be read and evaluated by their peers. These monographs
                    remain the <q>coin of the realm</q> for many historians, and
                    the value of that coin often depends on it being reviewed in
                    academic journals. To study the role of gender in monograph
                    reviews, we turn to one of the leading journals in the
                    historical profession: the <title rend="italic">American
                        Historical Review</title>, the flagship journal of the
                    American Historical Association. The <title rend="italic">AHR</title> publishes roughly one thousand total book
                    reviews spread across five issues each year, covering (in
                    its own words) <cit>
                        <quote rend="inline" source="#americanhistoricalreview">every major field of historical
                            study</quote>
                        <ptr target="#americanhistoricalreview"/>
                    </cit>. The <title rend="italic">AHR</title> is not only one
                    of the widest-ranging journals in the profession, it is also
                    the oldest; the journal has been publishing continuously
                    since 1895. The range, scope, longevity, and reputation of
                    the <title rend="italic">AHR</title> makes it an ideal proxy
                    to study how professional gatekeeping operates in relation
                    to gender.</p>
                <p>A few caveats are in order. First, a book that is never
                    reviewed by the <title rend="italic">AHR</title> may still
                    go on to have a significant impact on the profession.
                    Second, a book’s appearance in the <title rend="italic">AHR</title> is not necessarily correlated with the
                        quality of the book, as the
                    journal prints negative reviews as well as positive ones.
                    Nevertheless, when a book appears in the <title rend="italic">AHR</title> it serves as a signal that
                    other historians in positions of power are taking it
                    seriously. Even if it garners a negative review, the fact
                    that it appears in the journal at all is a measure of the
                    fact that the profession’s gatekeepers have deemed it
                    important enough to review. It is precisely this
                    professional gatekeeping dimension that we can analyze using
                    the gender package: are books by men more likely to be
                    reviewed then books by women, and if so, how much more
                    likely?</p>
                <p>Scraping the table-of-contents of every issue of the <title rend="italic">American Historical Review</title> results
                    in a dataset of close to 60,000 books reviewed by the
                    journal since it began publication in 1895. Our program then
                    inferred the gender of the authors of these books, which we
                    could in turn use to plot the proportion of female and male
                    authors over time. The temporal trajectory of gender
                    representation in the journal’s reviews roughly resembles
                    that of history dissertations: women began making inroads in
                    the late 1960s and continued to make steady gains over the
                    next four decades. By the twenty-first century, the
                    proportion of female authors reviewed in the <title rend="italic">AHR</title> had more than tripled.</p>
                <figure>
                    <head>Authors of books reviewed in the AHR by gender</head>
                    <graphic url="resources/images/figure06.png"/>
                </figure>
                <p>But a closer look shows substantial differences between the
                    proportion of women as the authors of history dissertations
                    and the proportion of women appearing in the <title rend="italic">AHR</title> as the authors of reviewed
                    books. Although both have trended upwards since the 1970s,
                    the slope of that line was a lot steeper for dissertations
                    than it was for the <title rend="italic">AHR</title>. Female
                    historians have very nearly closed the gap in terms of newly
                    completed dissertations, but the glass ceiling remains much
                    lower in terms of getting reviewed by the discipline’s
                    leading academic journal. The long-term gains made by female
                    doctoral students do not carry over into the pages of the
                        <title rend="italic">American Historical Review</title>,
                    where male monograph authors continue to outnumber female
                    authors by a factor of nearly 2 to 1.<note> The chart below
                        includes only authors whose gender we successfully
                        inferred; it does not include authors of unknown gender
                        as in the previous charts.</note></p>

                <p>Not every historian wants or seeks a career path that neatly
                    moves from writing a dissertation to authoring a monograph

                    each of these subsequent stages represents a winnowing

                    fewer women than men go through the initial stage of writing
                    a history dissertation. But by the final round of
                    gatekeeping — a monograph reviewed in the <title rend="italic">AHR</title> — the gender gap grows until
                    there are little more than half as many women as men. The
                        <title rend="italic">American Historical Review</title>
                    is, unfortunately, far from alone. Many of the profession’s
                    most prestigious annual honors go to drastically more men
                    than women. As of 2015, the Pulitzer Prize for History has
                    been awarded to exactly two female historians in the past
                    twenty years <ptr target="#pulitzerprizes2014"/>. The
                    Bancroft Prize in American History has been awarded to
                    almost five times as many male historians as female
                    historians over that same period <ptr target="#bancroftprize"/>.</p>
                <p>Examples like the Pulitzer and Bancroft Prizes are only the
                    most obvious cases of gender inequity in the historical
                    profession. Overt discrimination still exists, but inequity
                    operates in ways that are far more cloaked and far more
                    complex, making them difficult to recognize and remedy. They
                    take the form of subconscious bias that subtly weakens the
                    assessment of work done by female historians, whether in a
                    seminar paper or a job application. Moreover, gender
                    discrimination frequently intersects with other kinds of
                    racial and socioeconomic inequity that erects even higher
                    barriers in women’s careers <ptr target="#townsend2008"/>.
                    Gendered family dynamics add another layer of challenges for
                    women: a 2011 survey by the American Historical Association
                    revealed that female historians dedicated substantially more
                    time to child and elder care than their male colleagues,
                    leaving them with less time for the kind of academic
                    research that the profession rewards most highly <ptr target="#townsend2012"/>. All of these factors combine
                    and amplify each other to contribute to the gender gap in
                    the historical profession on display in the pages of the
                        <title rend="italic">American Historical Review</title>.
                    The hidden, murky, and systemic dimensions of gender
                    inequity makes methods like the gender package all the more
                    imperative for reasearchers.</p>
                <p>Finally, we used the gender package to reveal some of the
                    subtler ways in which gender iniquity operates in the
                    historical profession. After inferring the gender of book
                    authors reviewed by the <title rend="italic">AHR</title>, we
                    were also able to infer the gender of the reviewers
                    themselves. This led us to two findings. First, the story is
                    much the same for reviewers as it is for authors: more than
                    twice as many men as women appear as reviewers in the
                    journal. This is important because reviewers for the <title rend="italic">AHR</title> garner a certain degree of
                    prestige from their work — perhaps not to the same prestige as
                    winning a Pulitzer Prize, but prestige nonetheless. To
                    become a reviewer, one must possess a PhD or equivalent
                    degree and have published at least one book-length
                    manuscript <ptr target="#americanhistoricalreview"/>. <title rend="italic">AHR</title> reviewers are understood to
                    have sufficient experience and command over a given
                    sub-field to evaluate the merits and weaknesses of a new
                    contribution to that literature. Being a reviewer for the
                    journal is, in many ways, a proxy for expertise. When there
                    are twice as many male <q>experts</q> as female
                        <q>experts</q> appearing in the <title rend="italic">AHR</title> it imbues our understanding of what
                    constitutes historical expertise and who possesses it.</p>
                <p>The second finding we arrived at when examining the gender of
                        <title rend="italic">AHR</title> reviewers was a better
                    understanding of who reviews which book authors. Once again,
                    the methodology reveals patterns that we might suspect but
                    tend to stay hidden from direct sight. About three times as
                    many men as women write reviews of male-authored books in
                    the <title rend="italic">AHR</title>. For female-authored
                    books, the ratio of female-to-male reviewers is closer to
                    50/50. In short, women are far more likely to write reviews
                    of other women, while men tend to gravitate more towards
                    male authors — who are, of course, already over-represented in
                    the <title rend="italic">AHR</title>.</p>

                <p>The findings related to <title rend="italic">AHR</title>
                    reviewers help illustrate the ways in which gender inequity
                    in the profession is so insidious. It is not always an overt
                    case of deciding to award a prestigious prize to a male
                    historian; it can be as seemingly innocuous as deciding to
                    write a book review of a male author’s book. Countless
                    individual actions like these constitute the core
                    relationships that knit together the profession, and too
                    often these tiny actions benefit men more than women:
                    chairing a panel of mostly male historians, taking on a new
                    male advisee, or assigning mostly male-authored books on a
                    syllabus. On their own they might appear benign — one might
                    argue that male historians simply happen to be interested in
                    similar research topics — but in aggregate they contribute
                    to a broader professional landscape that puts female
                    historians at a disadvantage.</p>
                <p>One 2013 analysis of 2,500 recent history PhDs found that
                        <cit><quote rend="inline" source="#wood2013">gender played little role in
                        employment patterns across particular professions and
                        industries</quote>
                    <ptr target="#wood2013"/></cit>. Our own analysis reveals a
                    different story, at least in terms of getting a book
                    reviewed in the field’s most prestigious journal. The <title rend="italic">American Historical Review</title>
                    continues to publish twice as many reviews of male-authored
                    books as female-authored books, and those same reviews are
                    more than twice as likely to be written by a man than a
                    woman. This disparity is put into even sharper relief when
                    set against the much smaller gender gap between female and
                    male historians who complete dissertations. Women might be
                    getting hired at comparable rates to men, but discriminatory
                    gatekeeping remains alive and well in the profession. The
                    gender package is one more tool to uncover those
                    practices.</p>

                <head>Conclusion</head>
                <p>The digital turn has made large datasets widely available,
                    yet in the midst of abundance many humanists continue to
                    deal with the problem of incompleteness and scarcity within
                    their sources. Our method uses <emph>abundant</emph>
                    existing datasets to infer additional information from
                        <emph>scarce</emph> datasets. Its major contribution is
                    to incorporate a historical method, one that takes into
                    account how gendered naming practices have changed over
                    time. This temporal approach provides much improved results
                    over simpler, anachronistic, or ahistorical lookup methods.
                    The gender package is, of course, far from perfect. By
                    relying on historical datasets collected by state agencies,
                    it reinforces a gender binary and larger power structure
                    that obscures how people may identify themselves and how
                    they experience the world. To borrow a phrase from Miriam
                    Posner, the gender package does not necessarily meet the
                        <cit><quote rend="inline" source="#posner2015">radical, unrealized potential of
                        digital humanities</quote>
                    <ptr target="#posner2015"/></cit>. We agree with this line of
                    critique, but we don’t think it should deter researchers
                    from using our method. While such critiques point out
                    genuine problems, they also seldom contain concrete
                    proposals that can be practically implemented in
                    historically oriented research.<note> Discussing the problem
                        of gender/sex binaries in large corpora, Penelope Eckert
                        argues that <quote rend="inline" source="#eckert2012">binary sex-class gets
                            us pretty far</quote> and that <quote rend="inline" source="#eckert2012">at the moment</quote> she is pessimistic <cit>

                <p>The gender package makes a pragmatic trade-off between
                    complexity and discovery. Its reliance on a male/female
                    binary dampens the complexity of gender identity while
                    simulatenously pointing towards new discoveries about gender
                    within large textual collections. Its use of historical
                    datasets helps its users uncover patterns where they were
                    previously unknown, providing further grist to the mill of
                    more traditional methods. Furthermore, the gender package is
                    entirely open-source, and we have provided detailed
                    documentation for its code and underlying data so that those
                    who wish to build upon it can modify the package
                    accordingly. For instance, future researchers might compile
                    datasets of names that move beyond the gender binary imposed
                    by government agencies. They could then incorporate these
                    datasets into the gender package, replacing <q>male</q> and
                        <q>female</q> designations with a much wider spectrum of
                    potential gender identities.</p>
                <p>As it currently stands, the gender package meets an important
                    methodological need. As of November 2015, the gender package
                    has been downloaded more than 80,000 times and continues to
                    be downloaded about 19,000 times per month. It has also been
                   incorporated as a pedagogical tool within digital humanities courses <ptr target="#jockers2014b"/>.<note>The download counts
                        reflect statistics as of November 30, 2015, and come from
                        the <ref target="http://cran-logs.rstudio.com/">download

                    Researchers have used it to uncover instances gender
                    inequity in a range of different areas, from biases in
                    students’ teaching evaluations to the disparities between
                    attendees and authors at the annual Digital Humanities
                    Conference <ptr target="#schmidt2015"/>, <ptr target="#weingart2015"/>. These implementations
                    illustrate the value of the method. Its major intervention
                    is to algorithmically infer gender in textual sources in a
                    way that takes into account change over time. Rather than
                    trying to shoehorn existing computer science methods to fit
                    humanities research, the gender package reverses this
                    traditional disciplinary relationship. It uses a humanistic
                    starting point — the historical relationship between gender
                    and naming practices — to contribute a new method to
                    data analysis.</p>
