                <p>Three years after his death Friedrich Kittler’s impact on the Humanities and
                    Media Studies remains a topic of interest to scholars worldwide. The
                    intellectual challenges presented by his theoretical work, however, are now
                    complemented by the practical and archival difficulties of dealing with his
                    personal digital legacy. How are we to preserve, survey and index the complex
                    data collection Kittler bequeathed to the German Literature Archive in Marbach
                    in the shape of old computers and hard drives? How are the Digital Humanities to
                    handle the archive of one of its most important forefathers? To address these
                    questions, the presentation will first focus on the estate itself and then
                    describe the design and development of the "Indexer", a tool for the initial
                    indexing of technical information. Two especially problematic aspects are the
                    sheer mass of files (more than 1.5 million) and Kittler's idiosyncratic
                    organization, both of which serve to make conventional content evaluation very
                    difficult. Here, the "Indexer" has proven to be a powerful tool. Finally, a case
                    study using the indexer's web interface will enable us to tackle the question:
                    When and to what purpose did Friedrich Kittler acquire a computer?</p>

                <head>Forerunner</head>

                <p>In summer of 1992, still holding the chair of <title rend="quotes">New German
                        Literature</title> at the Ruhr University Bochum, Friedrich Kittler
                    announced a weekly colloquium for advanced students <title rend="quotes"
                        >Literature and Computer Sciences I</title>, followed by <title
                        rend="quotes">Literature and Computer Sciences II</title> the next semester.
                    Later, at the Humboldt University in Berlin where his chair was called <title
                        rend="quotes">History and Aesthetics of Media</title>, until his retirement
                    in 2008, Kittler customarily dedicated two of his eight-hour teaching load to
                    computer studies. <title rend="quotes">Graphic programming in C</title> in
                    summer of 1994 actually started out as a <soCalled>crash course</soCalled>
                    <ptr target="#kittler1994"/> in basic knowledge of the von-Neumann design and
                    the language C. The curriculum went on to Assembler-classes. In the mid 1990s
                    the courses served to get a Silicon Graphics workstation into operation. (This
                    worked out for some of his students, not for Kittler.) <term>Computer
                        acoustics</term> was addressed by the end of the nineties.<note>Kittler’s
                        lectures and seminars are listed in <ptr target="#kittler2010"/>.</note> At
                    least officially, since there was no rigid syllabus. Instead, each participant
                    would bring up what he (there seldom was a she) was working on, e.g. developing
                    maze-solving algorithms inspired by Claude Shannon’s toys, Markov chains for a
                    Mind Reading Machine or a card indexer <ptr target="#krajewski2011" loc="35–36"
                    />. Kittler’s own long term interest was in raytracing and radiosity, two
                    alternative procedures for generating computer graphics. Raytracing algorithms
                    calculate paths and angles of light beams resulting in the pixel-by-pixel
                    buildup of brilliant hyper realistic pictures; radiosity algorithms calculate
                    diffuse reflections from various objects resulting in a growing luminosity
                    within a given picture. Whereas the mathematics involved in raytracing operate
                    with the laws of light reflection and refraction known since antiquity and
                    elaborated by differential calculus in the 17th century, radiosity is based on
                    the cosine law Johann Heinrich Lambert formulated in his <title rend="italic"
                        >Photometria</title> (1760) and on 19th century thermodynamics. The <foreign
                        xml:lang="it">gaia scienza</foreign> fostered by Kittler comprehended the
                    history of computing as it began long before the computer was invented.</p>
                <p>What started out as a major call to all of his graduating, graduated, and
                    post-doc students to fight the notorious <soCalled>computer
                        illiteracy</soCalled> which Kittler generally blamed the Humanities for,
                    soon shrank to a small elitist circle. As Markus Krajewski, one of the happy
                    few, summarizes, <cit>
                        <quote rend="inline" source="#krajewski2011">Kittler wanted to establish a
                            real computer literacy. And our group was both the justifying nucleus of

                <p>Within the broad field of intersections between Computer Sciences and Humanities
                    comprised by the Digital Humanities today, Kittler’s teachings may well grant
                    him the title of a forefather. However, there is a certain restriction. Kittler
                    did not take part in the development of any of the fabulous tools that today
                    make Digital Humanities a flourishing interdisciplinary research field. Even
                    worse: From a media-theoretical viewpoint Kittler’s notorious statement <quote
                        rend="inline" source="#kittler1992">There Is No Software</quote>
                    ultimately questions DH’s right to exist. From a practical viewpoint, however,
                    in 1992, he seems to have pronounced another call of Cassandra’s. The <quote
                        rend="inline" source="#kittler1992">postmodern Tower of Babel</quote>,
                    e.g. the hierarchy of software layers operating like one-way functions without
                    the possibility of tracing their operations back or down to the hardware <ptr
                        target="#kittler1992" loc="221"/>; <ptr target="#kittler1991a" loc="210–211"
                    /> has piled up higher and higher. What in the early 1990s was analyzed as the
                    cryptography of programming languages, today has escalated in digital objects
                    and services, cloud-networking and distributed processing. Still, there is no
                    working around Kittler’s bottom line, that is to say that Turing’s paper machine
                    set the <cit>

                    </cit> and all hardware design still is von Neumann-architecture.<note>Another

                        <ptr target="#feigelfeld2015"/>. What is important to note here is Kittler’s
                    paradox of denouncing the non-existence of software while passionately producing
                    it. It leads to the question of what kind of computer literacy he aimed at. The
                    answer is not encouraging. Since Turing, as Kittler repeatedly praised him for,
                    was the last programmer to prefer reading machine out-put in 0s and 1s to
                    decimal computations <ptr target="#kittler1992" loc="223"/>, the next level
                    within the grasp of an ordinary human brain is assembly language, which only
                    uses commands that correspond to the machine’s code instructions. The closeness
                    to the hardware comes at the price of an increasing loss of portability (this is
                    why, for ordinary use, C or C++ were okay). Kittler’s cure hardly seems
                    recommendable today. Anyone who has ever been attracted to give up one’s
                    humanity and become a machine will have to face that the hardware development
                    ever more expands underneath the aforesaid Tower. Raytracing and Radiosity
                    algorithms, for example, nowadays are implemented or <q>sunk–in</q><note>The
                        German word <foreign xml:lang="de">versenkt</foreign> (<q>sunk-in</q>) is
                        Kittler’s term for implemented or hidden technology. Programs <q>sunk-in</q>
                        hardware process more efficiently, but, at the same time, are put out of
                        reach <ptr target="#kittler2001"/>.</note> chips.</p>
                <p>In the end, Kittler’s relevance for Digital Humanities may be the role of a
                    daunting godfather.<note>For further discussion of Kittler and the Digital
                        Humanities see <ptr target="#niebisch2015"/>. Niebisch points out that
                        Kittler’s lack of interest in the Internet puts him at distance to Digital
                        Humanities. Indeed, Kittler’s <quote rend="inline" source="#kittler2006b"
                            >hardware-fetishism</quote> or hardware-dependency literally cut a link
                        to today’s research infrastructure. As to the Internet, his statements came
                        up rather grumpily, with the decisive exception of the operating system
                        Linux as <cit><quote rend="inline" source="#kittler2006b">one of (its) most

                    Digital Humanities might be, not as a scattered field of applied studies
                    amending the toolbox of the <soCalled>old</soCalled> Humanities, but as an
                    academic discipline with a programmatic approach in its own right, there is
                    constant reference to Kittler. Interestingly, the clue here is his habilitation
                    treatise on literature <title rend="italic">Discourse Networks 1800 /
                        1900</title>. In the afterword to the second edition, Kittler defines the
                    term as <cit>
                        <quote rend="inline" source="#kittler1990a">the network of technologies and
                            institutions that allow a given culture to select, store, and process

                    </cit>. While this definition surely offers a common ground, the question arises
                    whether <quote rend="inline" source="#liu2004">updating Friedrich

                <p>Considering the gap between today’s digital culture and Kittler’s media theory,
                    the latter seems to be <quote rend="inline" source="#pias2011">in need of
                        historiography,</quote> as Claus Pias recently ascertained. To provide an
                    epistemological account of Kittler's theory the task of historians has to start
                    with <cit>

                        <ptr target="#pias2011" loc="32"/>
                    </cit>. These, in Pias’ discourse analysis, come down to the personal computer,
                    itself being a product of the American hacker’s movement of the 1970s. In the
                    1980s the hacker’s culture of bricolage and hands-on reached its peak and came
                    to a historical closing as the hardware spread all over the desks of Western
                    homes. The <soCalled>hacker</soCalled> turned into <soCalled>a historical
                        figure.</soCalled><note><cit>
                            <quote rend="inline" source="#pias2011">Kittler’s understanding of his
                                programming coincides with this figure of the hacker and aligns
                                itself with it</quote>
                            <ptr target="#pias2011" loc="40"/>
                        </cit>. This suggested identification seems to be enough to describe
                        Kittler’s programming activities as <soCalled>hacking.</soCalled> To my
                        knowledge, Kittler never wrote a hack. There was a plan once to design an
                        operating system, which never got any further than the first thought <ptr
                            target="#kittler2008" loc="65–66"/>. The archival evidence of this is to
                        be found in <ptr target="#kittler1990b"/>.</note> While Kittler, according
                    to Pias, played around with the personal computer just like innumerous teenagers
                    did at the time, he was unique in that he was able to conceptualize it. In the
                    computer he found the logical and material inherent or built-in media theory
                        <ptr target="#pias2011" loc="38–40"/>.</p>
                <p>Finally, in Kittler’s doings Pias sees a <quote rend="inline" source="#pias2011"
                        >coupling of the personal computer and the habilitation, that is hacking
                        around on the one hand, and producing a theory of literature and media on
                        the other.</quote> Hence, Kittler’s <cit>
                        <quote rend="inline" source="#pias2011"><title rend="italic">Discourse

                    </cit>. This is a tempting thought or at least a tempting wording – but it is
                    utterly wrong. Pias simply forgot to ask the question that Matthew Kirschenbaum
                    posed via Twitter: <quote rend="inline" source="#undocumented">Do we know when Friedrich

                <p>According to the records in the German Literature Archive in Marbach, as the
                    following Indexer model research will show, Kittler purchased his first PC in
                    1989. The writing of <title rend="italic">Discourse Networks</title>, however,
                    was finished in December 1981.<note>A four page typoscript by Kittler (Bestand

                            target="#hiller2015"/>. According to the list mentioned above, Kittler’s
                        first essay on Turing (<title rend="quotes">Das Gespenst im Computer. Alan
                            Turing und die moderne Kriegsmaschine</title>) was written in August
                        1984. A German edition of Turing’s works edited together with Bernhard
                        Dotzler was published in 1987 (Alan M. Turing, <title rend="italic"

                        Selected writings by Shannon were edited together with Peter Berz, David

                    be more to the point to reverse Pias’ suggestion. Rather, the theory shaped the <cit>

                    </cit>. But that would be only half way true.</p>
                <p>In 2008, Kittler claimed in an interview that in his life, he <quote
                        rend="inline" source="#kittler2008">whizzed through the whole media
                        history and picked up everything.</quote> He lists books, typewriters,
                    radios, gramophones, Super-8 films, and a Moog-style monophonic synthesizer and
                    a <soCalled>Harmonizer</soCalled> (i.e. a digital pitch-shifting device) he
                    built himself. The latter he actually refers to as <q>computers</q>, since in
                    the end he started using Intel processor-chips.<note>For Kittler’s synthesizer

                        have presented an approach to reading the becoming of a media theory out of
                        the circuits of Kittler’s modular synthesizer. Currently they are preparing
                        an online-publication of Kittler’s synthesizer circuits and circuit
                        diagrams. They also will edit a selection as part of Kittler’s <title

                    There was the <q>farewell to the analogue.</q> Before he took up his chair in

                <p>Though Kittler’s self-disclosures have to be dealt with carefully, this one
                    cannot be neglected since the German Literature Archive keeps the material
                    testimonies. Regarding Kittler’s own media practice, historiography has the
                    chance to match hundreds of thoroughly typed papers e.g. to <title rend="quotes"
                        >The Mechanized Philosopher</title>, various file card systems to <title

                    analysis on the basis of paper work will no longer be sufficient. So historians
                    are lucky that the challenges posed by Kittler’s digital legacy have been met by
                    the archive and by a new tool genuine to Digital Humanities. When in the near
                    future, the Indexer will be available for public research it will provide an
                    indispensable access to an exemplary case where the theory and the praxis of
                    media unfold upon each other.</p>

                    computer shape Kittler’s media theory in the 1990s? And what was his
                        <soCalled>hacking</soCalled> about? The first clue might be in the following
                    model research.</p>

                <p>To tackle the question as to when Friedrich Kittler began working with a personal
                    computer, the Indexer’s simplest and statistically most reliable search option
                    is to look for modification times.<note>The Indexer offers a search option for
                        creation times, too. These, however, are not reliable as they depend on
                        storage devices. The accuracy of modification times has been tested by
                        comparing dates of text files to other documents, such as calendars,
                        letters, etc.</note> A query for the years 1980 to 1988 will not lead to a
                    single file created by Kittler, whereas among the 774 results of
                        <term>modification time</term>: <q>1989</q> there is a considerable number
                    (Figure 1).</p>

                </figure>

                <p>The first entry is the word-file <title rend="quotes">realnot.txt</title>
                    containing notes to the essay <title rend="quotes">Real Time Analysis, Time Axis
                        Manipulation</title>, first published in 1990 (the corresponding word file
                    is <title rend="quotes">realtime.txt</title> which was modified 1990-07-21). The
                    next one, <title rend="quotes">info.txt</title>, does not belong to an essay by
                    Kittler, but is a Microsoft word 5.0 manual’s appendix. Word-files can be
                    identified as Kittler's simply because the texts bear the author’s name and can
                    be matched with publications. Altogether there are 83 files corresponding to six
                    essays. This finding neatly concurs with the inventory of typed papers in the
                    German Literature Archive. So far we can conclude that in the summer of 1989
                    Kittler swapped his typewriter for a word processor.</p>
                <p>Running through <term>modification time 1989</term> leads to another finding:
                    Kittler’s first hardware no longer persists. Though <title rend="quotes"
                        >realnot.txt</title> stems from the hard drive partition
                        <code>hd04_p01</code>, which actually formed part of Kittler’s last
                    computer, the path <code>root/texte_89-99/kittler/89</code> reveals that it got
                    there via a back-up device. The one in question here is an optical disk, but for
                    the largest part, the files of 1989 originate from floppy disks. Unfortunately,
                    there is still a considerable amount of floppies not ingested in the Indexer
                    yet. Although in these floppies’ listings no file by Kittler prior to 1989 can
                    be identified, the Indexer’s current ingest cannot deliver sufficient
                        proof.<note> Most of the 300 5.25" floppies which were subsequently
                        delivered to the GLA in the summer of 2014 contain commercial software as
                        can be judged from the index of the metadata. There are, however, some items
                        of interest. Floppy 352 contains a full set of c-libraries, dating from
                        February 1989, and among it a HELLO.C. One could conclude that Kittler
                        started programming in C around that date, but until these data are ingested
                        and can be examined, this remains a speculation.</note></p>
                <p>At any rate, a machine can only deliver the data it is fed with, so the year 1989
                    has to be counterchecked by philological evidence. Here, the Indexer offers a
                    full text search. Key words may be sampled from the interview cited above. In
                    2008 Kittler recalls that the first computer hardware his students in Bochum
                        <quote rend="inline" source="#kittler2008">forced upon</quote> him was a

                <p>To learn more about this document we have to consult the metadata (Figure 3).
                    There are 22 copies in 6 different versions growing from 164 kilobyte in 1993 to
                    259 kilobyte in 1999. In the Indexer’s first testing phase, when I collocated
                    Kittler’s papers to files, I asked Jürgen Enge if there was a way to eliminate
                    binary-identical copies. He declined my request instantly, because <quote
                        rend="inline" source="#private">in two years from now, you will ask me: ‘how often
                        did Kittler save a particular file?’</quote> It didn’t take that long, for
                    today, I think it is an interesting piece of information, that <title
                        rend="quotes">machine.txt</title> was saved 22 times, itinerating through
                    all hardware upgrades, from hard drive to floppy to hard drive to optical disk
                    to hard drive.</p>
                <p>Another four copies appear by the Indexer’s auto-complete function when the file
                    name is being entered. In 2000 under the operating system Linux, <title
                        rend="quotes">maschine.txt</title> was converted into <title rend="quotes"
                        >maschine.lat</title> and last modified in 2003, where the history of this
                    file ends. It seems rare, though, that after so many back-ups Kittler should
                    have ended his computer journal then. Another look at the metadata tells that
                        <title rend="quotes">maschine.lat</title> was deposited in a directory
                    called <code>info</code>.</p>

                        >komment</title> was last saved on August 18th 2011. While this is the
                    definite end of Kittler’s personal computer history, for a full documentation we
                    have to go back to its beginnings in 1989.</p>
                <p>In the Indexer, files are retained and available in their original formatting,
                    nested metadata included. Converting an old MS-DOS Word document into a modern
                    format discloses the metadata (Figure 5).</p>

                <p>The file <title rend="quotes">KRITIK.TXT</title> is still retrievable (Figure 6).
                    Compared to its successor it lacks in terms of systematics. There are no
                    headlines, and less exact dates. Post-March, for 1989, there is a single, but
                    very precise date. On August 11th, 22.00 hours a <soCalled>fatal error</soCalled> occurred during compiling a C-code called
                        <title rend="quotes">TRIGMARK.C</title>. We will come back to it. For the
                    current state of evidence, <title rend="quotes">KRITIK.TXT</title> is the first
                    trace of Kittler’s use of a word processor.</p>
                <p>Specialists may decide whether it is worthwhile to analyze the hundreds of
                    kilobytes or pages Kittler’s computer journals amount to.<note>As Heinz Werner
                        Kramksi told me, these files are astonishingly similar in structure to the
                        sys-doc mails the group of Scientific Data Processing at the German
                        Literature Archive, Marbach uses to document analytical work on hard- and
                        software.</note> For now it is enough to get an idea from the filenames.
                    When in 1989 Kittler engaged with a universal machine in form of the personal
                    computer, his critique was harsh. The 486-machine deserved to be named as such,
                    though it was still under review. Even though further hardware upgrades resulted
                    in more contentment, the sober Linux-style commenting surely is due to the
                    operating system.</p>
                <p>In terms of a <soCalled>Kittler-Philology</soCalled> or historiography, the files
                    of the early 1990s are a source code for Kittler’s essays <title rend="quotes"
                        >There is No Software</title> or <title rend="quotes">Protected
                    Mode</title>. There, Kittler alludes to <quote rend="inline"
                        source="#kittler1991a">the good old times</quote> when <quote
                        rend="inline" source="#kittler1991a">even literary critics could do

                        target="#kittler1991a" loc="209"/>. From today’s perspective, these essays
                    themselves date back to the good old times when even a professor of media
                    studies could scrutinize the hard- and software he worked with. If these days
                    are gone, the corresponding files offer a singular insight into an interesting
                    time slot in the history of the personal computer.</p>

                    009</title>. Unfortunately, this one is defective and the content most probably
                    lost. The remaining metadata, however, provide a good deal of information, since
                        <title rend="quotes">floppy 009</title> is the first backup collection of
                    C-codes dating from February 1993 down to July 1989.</p>

                <p>As it turns out, <title rend="quotes">TRIGMARK.C</title> belongs to a set of
                    C-codes (Figure 7). Its full title <title rend="quotes">Trigramm Markov</title>

                    be codes for digrams and unigrams, too. <title rend="quotes">DIGMARK.C</title>,

                        >floppy 009</title> as they were modified in 1989 and 1990. For higher
                    n-grams we would have to scan various data volumes, including the latest
                    hardware partitions. There, <title rend="quotes">markov.c</title> as Kittler’s
                    Markov-generator was named, can be found, too.</p>
                <p>These codes give the first testimonies of Kittler’s personal computer-based study
                    of Markov-chains, the core, one might say, of Digital Humanities, since they
                    constitute computer-based text analysis. Kittler’s interest, though, rested on
                    the central role they play in Claude Shannon’s information theory.<note>From
                        here the study of Markov chains as it was pursued in Kittler’s seminars may

                        rend="quotes">MANDMEM.C</title> and so forth. All of them orbit around Julia
                    and Mandelbrot sets, the famous modules of fractal geometry, which were very
                    much in vogue in the early 1990s. In respect to what happens to mathematics once
                    it is fed into a computer, they are a classic as well.</p>
                <p>The functions developed by Gaston Julia by the end the First World War (and later
                    on by Benoît Mandelbrot), the mathematician could only conceive in his head and
                    later on put down on paper in form of formulas. All the iterations it takes to
                    decide if a value takes off to infinity or if it stays within certain limits are
                    beyond the limits of human brains, but are the essential task of computers. The
                    difference makes an eye catcher in well-known computer generated
                        pictures.<note>For a comprehensive depiction on Mandelbrot, see <ptr

                <p>Many of these files were saved on further non-corrupted back-ups and can be
                        examined.<note>As regards to codes, the question of authorship seems inept,
                        but there is an archival interest as to which codes are typed out by
                        Kittler, which he came up with by himself or which are foreign altogether.
                        Traces of Kittler’s <q>authorship</q> are discernable by the
                        idiosyncratically abbreviated German file names, by comments in slashes and,
                        indeed, by style. Some come with a documentation, e.g. <title rend="quotes"
                            >ROESSLER.C</title>’s source is <code>/*Becker/Dörfler, 76+291*/</code>,
                        probably Karl-Heinz Becker’s and Michael Dörfler’s <title rend="italic"
                            >Dynamical Systems and Fractals</title> (1989). Further single remnants
                        from 1989, saved only once on floppy 009, Kittler might have considered not
                        worth keeping and tending. The file names of a group dating from July 1989
                        give the idea of tentative steps: <title rend="quotes">EINFALT.C</title>,
                            <title rend="quotes">EINFOUR.C</title>, <title rend="quotes"
                            >EINHILB.C</title>, <title rend="quotes">EININT.C</title>, <title
                            rend="quotes">EINPFT.C</title>, etc. It’s highly speculative, but I
                        would read: <q>Euler in Fourier</q>, <q>Euler in Hilbert</q> or simply <q>e
                            in Hilbert</q>.</note> The group can easily be completed with specimens
                    derivable from different volumes, again up to the latest hardware. Some soon
                    became part of Kittler’s long-term raytracing-project, and at the same time,
                    were tended as individual little programs for different purposes. So it is not
                    surprising, that choosing one of them, <title rend="quotes">EULER.C</title>,
                    yields to 21 results. The modification-times range from September 1990 to July
                    2011 (Figure 10).</p>

                <p>The code lines only ask for wanted iterations and give out the calculated values.
                    All mathematics is up to a function called <q>feul</q>, processed in <title
                        rend="quotes">FEUL.ASM</title>. That is to say, the high-level programming
                    language is for the interface, the low-level programming language is for higher
                    mathematics.</p>
                <p>This measure has benefits, as Kittler repeatedly insisted. It speeds up
                    processing, reduces compiler and interpreter actions and induces a more elegant
                    style of encoding. Above all, it testifies a true computer literacy, because
                    assembler only uses the commands that are implemented on the processor chip.
                    Still, there is another point, which might be of epistemological interest,
                    too.</p>
                <p>Unfortunately, <title rend="quotes">FEUL.ASM</title>, together with most of
                    Kittler’s 1990s-assembler codes, has not been ingested in the Indexer

                        may indicate that these are apprentice pieces. There is a <title
                            rend="quotes">HELLO.ASM</title> saved on 1990-07-06, which hints to a
                        date as to when Kittler started computer programming in assembler. He was
                        familiar with assembler code instructions since the days of his
                        Harmonizer.</note> In terms of file history, it was soon replaced by <title
                        rend="quotes">EULER.ASM</title> and, under the operations systems Unix and
                    later on Linux, by <title rend="quotes">euler.s</title>. Instead of the early
                        <title rend="quotes">FEUL.ASM</title>
                    <title rend="quotes">euler.s</title> from 1998 may serve an example of Kittler’s
                    most tended collection of functions written in assembly language.</p>

                <p>In <title rend="quotes">euler.s</title> two types of mathematical notation face
                    each other (Figure 12). In the first lines the equation behind <code>/*</code>
                    is <q>commented out</q>. This is for human intelligence only. It remains pure
                    text inert for the program to be generated. In the lines below, the assembler
                    routine breaks it down into pieces, into simple operations like load, add,
                    change, jump, etc. that will deal with the 8 registers of the processor’s
                    floating point unit. Step-by-step, 56 lines of commands (each with the three
                    terms of command, source, destination) re-write the elegant expression Euler and
                    his successor Lorenzo Mascheroni have formulated. Further reading is the task of
                    machines, but on this language level still within the reach of human
                    literacy.</p>
                <p>It would not be so in case of Euler’s formula being re-written in high-level C.
                    The translation into assembler instructions would be up to a compiler, and the
                    thereby automatically generated code would become long-winded and cumbersome,
                    hardly intelligible for human readers. Literacy and numeracy involve style.</p>
                <p>Finally, during the debugging process – while the program is running – the
                    computing operations can be followed step-by-step. At the risk of giving a too
                    personal testimonial, to my experience Kittler was enthralled with debugging. It
                    provided a grasp of mathematics <foreign xml:lang="la">in actu</foreign>.</p>
                <p>For the purpose of this paper, codes have been treated as text, which of course
                    is a peculiar way to look at them. Another and more adequate way is to deal with
                    Kittler’s codes in their own media – editors, compilers, debuggers. In other
                    words, what is required is a study of Kittler’s programs in action.<note>A

                <head>Conclusion</head>
                <p>This first overview of Kittler’s programming shows that exploring mathematics was
                    its genuine purpose. More precisely, it selected some branches of mathematics
                    close to the history or theory of computing. Marchov chains, via information
                    theory, form part of the media archeology of computers themselves. Fractal
                    geometry belongs to the theory of numbers and computability. The concept of
                    functions and the differential calculus, developed from the 18th century
                    onwards, Kittler regarded as the most powerful part of science mapping the
                    outlines of technology. Since there is no Platonic heaven, not even for
                    mathematics, media history’s task lays in deciphering and describing its
                    languages and notation systems as the basis of ideas. The condition of modern
                    technology depends on how the tools the history of mathematics bequeathed us
                    with are processed. They have to pass through the gates of Turing’s 0s and 1s
                    and emerge as programs or digital tools.</p>
                <p>The personal computer, I may conclude, was Kittler’s medium to <quote
                        rend="inline" source="#kittler2006b">upload mathematics.</quote> To him, the relevance
                    of such an undertaking was out of question. <cit>
                        <quote rend="inline" source="#kittler2006b">Without the discovery of partial
                            differentiation equations, no single modern chip or radio receiver or
                            transmitter could either be conceived or constructed</quote>
                        <ptr target="#kittler2006b" loc="34"/>
                    </cit>. The same holds true for the mathematics of the Internet or of smart
                    phone apps, although these fields did not lay within Kittler’s interest.
                    Instead, his study turned to the history of numbers and algorithms. This way of
                    thinking could not be but inspired by computers. <quote rend="block"
                        source="#kittler1999a">Evidently, computer graphics and computer music
                        'first and foremost' continue the modern traditions of linear perspective
                        and tempered scale. They automatize in the shape of algorithms certain
                        regularities that from a historical point of view are contingent
                        achievements of European cultural history rather than natural matters of
                        course. The obvious question – albeit rarely posed – is therefore which
                        mathematical and technological junctures lead to these algorithms that the
                        19th century subsequently proceeded into rigid mechanical hardware (film,
                        phonography, gramophones, etc.) and the 20th century into programmable
                        software? <ptr target="#kittler1999a" loc="143"/></quote>.</p>
                <p>Coming back to the question which effect did the use of the personal computer
                    have on Kittler’s media theory, perhaps too blunt an answer would be that it was
                    sublated. <q>Thinking</q> or <q>understanding</q> media requires mathematical
                    information. In the late 1990s a research program evolved to capture <cit>

                    </cit>. This endeavor, finally, led Kittler to ancient Greece where he listened
                    to the call of the Sirens and never returned. Of his last mammoth project <title
                        rend="italic">Music and Mathematics</title>, which was supposed to span from
