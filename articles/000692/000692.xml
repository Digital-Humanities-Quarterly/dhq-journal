                    First, it explores tool criticism as a response to instrumentalism in the

                    Concretely, it discusses two critical making–inspired workshops in which

                <head>Introduction</head>

                <p>The digitalization and datafication of all aspects of our cultural practices and
                    social interactions have created new opportunities for research. Thanks to
                    easy-to-use data analysis tools and digital infrastructures, even those
                    humanities scholars who lack programming skills can work with large-scale
                    empirical datasets in order to disclose patterns and correlations within them.
                    Although empirical research trends have existed throughout the history of the
                    humanities <ptr target="#bod2013"/>, these recently emergent possibilities have
                    revived an empiricist attitude among some humanities scholars schooled in more
                    critical and interpretive traditions. This development has strengthened the
                    position of those who have long thought that the humanities needed more
                        <q>objective</q> means of inquiry to better substantiate their interpretive
                    claims. It has been argued, however, that some of the interpretive humanistic
                    tradition's strengths have been relinquished as a result. As Drucker and
                    Svensson note, scholars engaged in digital projects sometimes leave their
                    critical sensibilities behind: <quote rend="inline">such projects can
                        demonstrate more positivism than the positivism we often (and sometimes
                        erroneously) associate with science and technology</quote>
                    <ptr target="#drucker-svensson2016" loc="par. 9"/>. The problem, in part, stems
                    from the fact that the assumptions and concepts of the computational methods
                    embedded in tools, often derived from the empirical sciences, are generally left
                    unscrutinized <ptr target="#dobson2019" loc="6"/>. These tools become the stage
                    of <quote rend="inline">an encounter between two sets of epistemic traditions –
                        hermeneutic and empirical</quote>
                    <ptr target="#masson2017" loc="28"/> and raise questions about methodology. </p>
                <p> Prompted by this <quote rend="inline">methodological moment</quote> (Scheinfeldt
                    in <ptr target="#rieder-rohle2017" loc="210"/>) within the humanities, there has
                    been a call for <q>tool criticism,</q> as it has been termed (<ptr
                        target="#koolen2019"/>
                    <ptr target="#vanes2018"/> and <ptr target="#vanes2021"/>, <ptr
                        target="#vangeenen2020"/>). These authors have drawn attention to the need
                    for digital humanists to critically reflect on the impact of their research
                    tools, which have computational methods embedded within them, on knowledge
                    production. Rather than as mere instruments, these tools are envisioned as a set
                    of conditions; their affordances are at once enabling and constraining
                    practices. The proposal that our research tools are caught up in the epistemic
                    process is not new <ptr target="#baird2004"/>
                    <ptr target="#latour-woolgar1986"/>. However, as a result of the computational
                    turn and the proliferation of easy-to-use tools for data analysis and
                    visualisation, there is a need to put the matter back on the agenda of the
                    humanities and encourage further discussion on digital methodologies. Tool
                    criticism takes part in a response to the call for a third-wave digital
                    humanities that develops a programme of criticism with regard to the
                    computational <ptr target="#berry2011"/>, but in its desire to incorporate the
                    knowledge and concepts mobilized by software into this reflection <ptr
                        target="#rieder-rohle2017"/>, it moves the discussion forward.</p>
                <p> In this paper I seek to make tool criticism a bit more concrete. To do so I
                    explore tool criticism as a response to instrumentalism in the digital
                    humanities and proposes it to be part of what a critical digital humanities
                    does. Subsequently, I explore it as a practice, and in practice. More
                    specifically, I discuss two critical making–inspired workshops in which
                    participants analysed the affordances of digital tools and infrastructures and
                    engaged with their underlying assumptions and values. The first workshop
                    approached <quote rend="inline">games-as-tools</quote>
                    <ptr target="#werning2020"/>. Participants modified a card game, playing with
                    its material and mechanical constraints in order to argue with its claims and
                    assumptions. The second workshop, drawing on the concept of <quote rend="inline"
                        >digital infrapuncture</quote>
                    <ptr target="#verhoeven2016"/>, asked participants to examine digital
                    infrastructure in terms of capacity and care. They first identified pain and
                    stress in a chat environment, caused by the norms and values embedded in the
                    design of the infrastructure (e.g. the platform discriminates against or even
                    excludes certain users and practices). The participants then designed bots that
                    intervened and offered relief in the system. Finally, reflection on the sort of
                    tool criticism performed in the workshops enables an exploration of the critical
                    and reflective attitude required of digital humanities scholars when conducting
                    research with computational tools and digital infrastructures. </p>

                <head>Against Instrumentalism</head>

                <p>Research in the digital humanities is supported by many different computational
                    tools and digital infrastructures. Examples of such tools include Excel,
                    Tableau, Python, Google NGram Viewer, ImagePlot and the Digital Methods
                    Initiative Issue Crawler. Whereas tools are often used individually or by small
                    teams and are oriented towards solving particular tasks, infrastructures work on
                    a larger scale and combine multiple functions and applications. Infrastructures
                    can be defined as <quote rend="inline">the relationships, interactions and
                        connections between people, technologies, and institutions (that help data
                        flow and be useful</quote>
                    <ptr target="#parsons2015"/>. Examples of digital infrastructures relevant to
                    digital humanities research include Getty, DBpedia, Europeana, DARIAH, and HuNi.
                    A challenge in working with tools and infrastructures is that they have
                    heterogenous development, funding and use contexts. These are all factors that
                    impact their stability and appropriateness for research aims (see <ptr
                        target="#vanes2021"/> ).</p>
                <p> The computational turn has created a flood of empirical data, which can now be
                    wrangled with in many easy-to-use tools. In the humanities we currently
                    encounter a <quote rend="inline">renewed positivist dream</quote> in which
                    computational tools are applied uncritically <ptr target="#dobson2019" loc="3"
                    />. In an earlier contribution to this journal, Drucker and Svensson find that
                        <quote rend="inline">[h]umanists continue to be seduced by tools to whose
                        workings they give limited attention, so they execute their projects (e.g.
                        in network analysis software) without knowing how the results were
                        generated</quote>
                    <ptr target="#drucker-svensson2016" loc="par. 9"/> . This phenomenon has also
                    been labelled <quote rend="inline">blunt instrumentalism</quote>
                    <ptr target="#tenen2016"/>. Here computational tools, are treated as transparent
                    and neutral. Their affordances and embedded methods, though exercising an impact
                    on the epistemological process, are not critically analysed. </p>
                <p> Patrik Svensson underscores the instrumental tendencies in the humanities,
                    pointing to the propensity of <quote rend="inline">think[ing] about
                        infrastructure as placeless, immaterial, and neutral</quote>
                    <ptr target="#svensson2015" loc="349"/>. He puts forth the view that our tools
                    and infrastructures in fact embody <quote rend="inline">ways of perceiving,
                        interrogating, and enacting the world</quote>
                    <ptr target="#svensson2015" loc="342–43"/>. To avoid being governed by a
                    scientific and engineering paradigm that now dominates the design of digital
                    infrastructures, Svensson suggests that humanities scholars ought to become more
                    involved in building. This way, models of infrastructure can be developed that
                    are based on the humanities' own needs and desires (see also <ptr
                        target="#drucker2012"/>). </p>
                <p> Inspired by Lev Manovich's assertion that a prototype <emph>is</emph> a theory,
                    Alan Galey and Stan Ruecker <ptr target="#galey-ruecker2010"/> propose that
                    experimental digital prototypes can contain arguments. They state that <quote
                        rend="inline">digital artifacts have meaning, not just utility</quote>, and
                    argue that these efforts should be considered peer-reviewable forms of research.
                    Allington et al. <ptr target="#allington2016"/>, however, have been critical of
                    the idea that the building of computational tools can be a substitute for
                    scholarly writing. They point out how Computer Science departments have never
                    awarded PhD degrees on the basis of programming competence alone. Relevant to
                    our discussion here is the idea that tools can embody the perspectives of their
                    makers. However, it is important to point out that the assumptions and values in
                    tools are not necessarily always the product of intent. </p>
                <p> Responding to the concerns about instrumentalism, Mathieu Jacomy, one of the
                    developers of Gephi, lashes out at academics. In a blog post he makes the
                    following plea: <cit><quote rend="block">Please stop summarizing your detailed
                            argumentation down to <q>tools influence us because of presuppositions
                                built into them.</q> Nobody stuffed your tool. That is not how it
                            works. Most tool makers do not really know what they are doing – they
                            just experiment. They do not try to influence you – they probably do not
                            care about you.</quote>

                    </cit></p>

                <p>Jacomy goes on to argue that tools arrive as <term>accidents</term> and not as
                        <quote rend="inline">the Trojan horses of methodological

                    <ptr target="#jacomy2020" loc="np"/>. While not every affordance of a tool is
                    intentional or connected to the implementation of methods (some can, for
                    instance, concern functionality), he overlooks how all choices reflect a
                    particular perspective, contain certain assumptions and have implications for
                    how knowledge is ultimately produced. </p>
                <p> Against the background of instrumentalism, Drucker and Svensson find there is
                    insufficient attention to the material support of knowledge production and that
                    this should be addressed by the critical sensibilities of humanities scholars
                        <ptr target="#drucker-svensson2016"/>. They examine <quote rend="inline"
                        >middleware</quote> as a concept enabling attention to be paid to <quote
                        rend="inline">the ways tools <emph>structure our arguments</emph> or

                    emphasis). Looking at what I have emphasized here in italics, an important
                    differentiation is made between the basic affordances of tools and the

                        target="#schaefer2011" loc="56"/>. Not only then do tools embed methods,
                    Drucker and Svensson here point to the importance of analysing the material
                    properties that enable and constrain use and influence the biases and
                    assumptions behind them. The popular network visualisation and analysis software
                    package Gephi, for instance, lacks the ability to trace the history of
                    modifications made to network visualisations (see <ptr target="#vangeenen2020"

                <head>Tool Criticism as Critical Digital Humanities</head>

                <p>In light of a more general criticism charging that the digital humanities tend to
                    be anti-interpretive (Allington et al., 2016), there have been calls for a
                        <quote rend="inline"><emph>critical</emph></quote> digital humanities (<ptr
                        target="#berry2011"/>
                    <ptr target="#berry-fagerjord2017"/>
                    <ptr target="#dobson2019"/>) which incorporates critical and interpretive
                    traditions into the digital humanities. Conducting tool criticism, raising
                    questions about how our computational tools are caught up in the epistemic
                    process, needs to be part of what a critical digital humanities (CDH) does. Tool
                    criticism is necessary particularly because these tools often bear assumptions
                    and concepts derived from the empirical sciences (<ptr target="#drucker2012"
                        loc="85–86"/>
                    <ptr target="#dobson2019" loc="6"/>). </p>
                <p> David M. Berry has argued for the strengthening of a programme of criticism
                    around the computational <ptr target="#berry2011"/>. However, in the view of
                    Rieder and Röhle, a concentration on <q>the digital</q> and the understanding of
                    code with regard to the scrutiny of computational tools would be short-sighted
                        <ptr target="#rieder-rohle2017" loc="118"/>. Such a focus emphasizes
                    programming as a required skillset but overlooks the concepts and knowledges
                    that are mobilized in the use of these tools (cf. <ptr target="#dobson2019"/>.
                    Likewise, Dennis Tenen explains that <quote rend="inline">[j]ust applying the
                        tool or even <q>learning to code</q> alone was therefore insufficient for
                        making sense of the results. What could help me, then, and what is only now
                        beginning to surface in DH literature is a critical conversation about
                        methodology</quote>
                    <ptr target="#tenen2016" loc="85"/>. In raising questions about computational
                    tools and their embedded computational methods, these scholars share an interest
                    in tool criticism discussions about digital methodologies in the humanities. </p>
                <p> The use of tools and infrastructure in humanities research requires that these
                    tools, and the researcher's relation to them, be made a site of critical
                    analysis – which is to say, that they demand tool criticism. As we have defined
                    it elsewhere, tool criticism concerns <cit><quote rend="block">the critical
                            inquiry into digital tools and how they are used for various purposes
                            within the research process. It reviews the qualities of the tool in
                            light of, for instance, research activities, and it reflects on how the
                            tool (e.g., its data source, working mechanisms, anticipated use,
                            interface, and embedded assumptions) affects the user, the research
                            process and output, and its reliance on the user's training. <ptr
                                target="#vanes2021" loc="52"/>.</quote></cit></p>
                <p> Central to this notion is a critical and reflexive attitude towards the tools
                    used to create knowledge. Inspired by reflection-in-action <ptr
                        target="#schoen1983"/>, tool criticism involves continuous
                        <emph>interaction</emph> rather than the exercise of detached judgement from
                    a distance. It is important, then, to reflect on the choices made in
                        <emph>using</emph> the tools. This also explains why critical
                    making–inspired workshops are used in this paper to explore tool criticism as
                    practice, in practice. Tool criticism helps bring the traditional critical and
                    interpretive strengths of humanities scholarship back into focus within digital
                    humanities scholarship (cf. <ptr target="#dobson2019"/>). It recognizes that
                    tools are socio-technical constructions and are never simply a means of
                    facilitating certain outcomes. They possess certain affordances and also reflect
                    the worldviews of their makers. </p>
                <p> As mentioned earlier, Drucker and Svensson have argued the importance of paying
                    attention to how the material features of tools support knowledge production
                        <ptr target="#drucker-svensson2016"/>. This is equally relevant in relation
                    to our <emph>digital</emph> or computational tools. In the 1980s and '90s the
                    digital was seen as virtual and as existing outside material constraints. This
                    popular discourse was misleading. Paul Dourish, in examining the material
                    dimension of software and digital information, exhibits an interest in the
                    materialities of information – <quote rend="inline">those properties of
                        representations and formats that constrain, enable, limit, and shape the
                        ways in which those representations can be created, transmitted, stored,
                        manipulated, and put to use – properties like their heft, size, fragility,
                        and transparency</quote>
                    <ptr target="#dourish2017" loc="6"/>. In addition, software is always
                        <q>in-material</q> due to its being embedded in physical data carriers <ptr
                        target="#vandenboomen2009" loc="9"/>. Importantly, the material properties
                    of tools and infrastructures exert influence on what, and how, they enable us to
                    know. </p>
                <p> One term used to capture the complexity of tools and their function with respect
                    to a more encompassing methodology is <q>the stack.</q> It is defined as <quote
                        rend="inline">the interlinked and dependent layers of tools and abstractions
                        that make up any contemporary computational application or procedure</quote>
                    <ptr target="#dobson2019" loc="x"/> . Reflecting on the Natural Language
                    Toolkit, Tenen explains, <quote rend="inline">Each level of abstraction in the
                        movement from statistical methods, to Python code, to graphical user
                        interface introduces its own set of assumptions, compromises, and
                        complications</quote>
                    <ptr target="#tenen2016" loc="85–86"/>. In addition to computational tools,
                    digital infrastructures are used in research. These are intricate networks of
                    relations that come into being as a system. Linking these issues back to the
                    problem of instrumentalism, the conception of these tools as transparent is
                    misguided because tools reflect methodological issues and because they have
                    material properties with epistemological implications. </p>

                <head>Critical making–inspired workshops</head>
                <p> The two workshops discussed in this paper seek to promote <emph>tool criticism
                        thinking</emph> as a means of demonstrating the importance of <quote

                    <ptr target="#dobson2019" loc="6"/> when humanities students and scholars engage
                    in computational research. These workshops can be understood as experiments in
                    what Matt Ratto has popularized as critical making and oscillates between
                    building and reflection. In critical making workshops, participants build
                    prototypes as a way of conceptual exploration. These prototypes <quote

                    <ptr target="#ratto2011" loc="253"/>. This emphasis on the workshop process and
                    the exchange that emerges rather than on a final product differentiates this
                    sort of activity from <quote rend="inline">critical technical practice</quote>

                <p> Most of the external funding for DH projects has been directed toward
                    tool-building rather than interpretive work <ptr target="#dobson2019" loc="15"
                    />. This crux of tension in the digital humanities between intellectual labour
                    on the one hand and making and practice on the other has often been captured in
                    the catchphrase <q>more hack, less yack</q>. The split was epitomized when
                    Stephen Ramsay, in <title rend="quotes">Who's In and Who's Out</title>,
                    provocatively stated that digital humanities scholars need to learn how to code
                    and build things <ptr target="#ramsay2011"/>. The present paper's premise is
                    that this opposition is misinformed and unproductive, as <quote rend="inline"
                        >the humanities is both/and</quote>
                    <ptr target="#nowviskie2016"/>. The critical making–informed workshops discussed
                    here, in combining building and theorizing, equally reject such a binary. They
                    underscore that the building of tools is/should be linked to theorisation.
                    However, to explore these workshops here, is not to make an argument for the
                    need to learn how to build things, but acknowledges that engaging in tool
                    criticism requires a basic understanding of the biases and assumptions of the
                    tools/infrastructure being used.</p>
                <p> Concerns over instrumentalism noted have also sparked debates as to the
                    particular skills and literacies needed in the digital humanities. Some thinkers
                    have argued that digital humanities scholars need to learn how to code (<ptr
                        target="#rushkoff2010"/>
                    <ptr target="#ramsay2011"/>
                    <ptr target="#galloway2016"/>), whereas others have warned that teaching
                    students to program is time-consuming, detracts from the development of critical
                    thinking <ptr target="#fuchs2017"/>, and may foster a <quote rend="inline">false
                        sense of mastery</quote> over the technology <ptr target="#chun2013"/>.
                    Importantly, Rieder and Röhle <ptr target="#rieder-rohle2017"/> find that the
                    teaching of programming proficiency does not mean that the concepts and
                    techniques employed in digital tools are clarified. The use of Gephi, for
                    instance, would require an understanding of graph theory or sociometry. As
                    Rieder explains in his recent book, <cit><quote rend="block"> But beyond
                            attributions of sometimes very broad properties to <q>the digital</q>

                            social sciences still rarely venture more deeply into the intellectual

                            developers invent and draw on to design the forms, functions and
                            behaviors that constitute technical objects and infrastructures.</quote>
                        <ptr target="#rieder2020" loc="81–82"/>.</cit> Commenting on the idea of a
                    critical code studies, Rieder questions whether this type of <quote

                    even be possible for humanities scholars <ptr target="#rieder2020" loc="98"
                    />.</p>
                <p>How, then, can humanities scholars who use computational tools and
                    infrastructures critically engage with them? To answer this question the work of
                    Ben Schmidt proves useful. He suggests that, in order to understand algorithms,
                    it is important to grasp the transformations they bring about <ptr
                        target="#schmidt2016"/>. To demonstrate the usefulness of his proposal,
                    Schmidt discusses the debate between Annie Swafford and Matt Jockers over
                    Jockers' <title rend="italic">Syuzhet</title> package that explores plots
                    through sentiment analysis. Schmidt explains, <quote rend="inline">[t]he default
                        smoothing in the <title rend="italic">Syuzhet</title> package assumes [...]
                        the start of every book has an emotional valence that continues the
                        trajectory of its final sentence</quote>. This function might be useful for
                    the study of sitcom episodes, which tend to be cyclical in nature, but he finds
                    it is less suitable for novels. Essentially, Schmidt proposes an engagement with
                    the basic logics and principles of algorithms and an assessment of their
                    suitability for the research at hand. </p>
                <p> Schmidt's suggestion is certainly more attainable for digital humanities
                    scholars than the deep engagement with the intellectual and material domains of
                    technicality proposed by Rieder. His approach facilitates critical evaluation of
                    tools and infrastructures, yet it should not be interpreted as an excuse to
                    remain entirely uneducated about the concepts and methods at stake (for a basic
                    understanding is certainly needed!). Schmidt's argument, however, needs to be
                    extended as a tool is more than an algorithm. In other words, digital humanists
                    should reflect on how a computational tool, the entirety of its stack, performs
                    transformations and impacts knowledge production which includes inquiry into the

                    of questions related to all the levels of abstraction. In terms of critical
                    reflectivity, this is also what I had hoped to explore with the participants of
                    the workshops. Prior to the workshops we introduced them to the notion of tool
                    criticism, discussing its definition and purpose. During the workshops, when the
                    participants tried to put it in practice, it became apparent what it entailed
                    and demands of users and where its challenges lie. </p>

                    <head>Playable datasets</head>
                    <p>Stefan Werning, a colleague at Utrecht University, has been organizing
                        playable data workshops for several years now (see <ptr
                            target="#werning2020"/>). These sessions have focused on exploring
                        small/mid-sized datasets through card games. Participants play with the
                        mechanisms and parameters of a card game as a means to facilitate new ways
                        of calculating, sorting and ranking the underlying data sets (i.e. expressed
                        in numbers, colours, identities etc.). These mechanics operate similarly to
                        a layout algorithm like ForceAtlas2 in Gephi in that they need to fit the
                        structure of the data at hand, but also distinctly (re)frame the types of
                        insights that may be derived from the dataset <ptr target="#werning2020"/>. </p>
                    <p>The playable data workshops centred on game co-creation, which can be
                        understood as a type of critical making. As Odendaal and Zavala (2018)
                        explain, <quote rend="inline">a physical game can help players make sense of
                            something abstract and hidden and that is consequently excluded from
                            public discussion</quote>
                        <ptr target="#odendaal-zavala2018" loc="np"/>. Although existing
                        perspectives on critical (board/card) game-making are focused on games
                        regarded as products, Glas et al. developed a technique called <quote
                            rend="inline">discursive game design</quote>
                        <ptr target="#glas2020"/>. Here game co-creation becomes an ongoing critical
                        conversation. Specifically, following Galey and Ruecker, the approach
                        proposes a trajectory of iterations involving a prototype. Each iteration
                        then developed represents a statement about the argument and a consideration
                        of alternative paths. </p>

                    <p>The workshops drew on Nathan Altice's view of the playing card as a
                            <q>platform</q> According to Altice, <quote rend="inline">cards are
                            platforms too. Their <q>hardware</q> supports particular styles,
                            systems, and subjects of play while stymying others</quote>
                        <ptr target="#altice2014"/>. Altice goes on to explain how a game's design
                        is influenced by the cards' five main characteristics or affordances:
                        planar, uniform, ordinal, spatial and textural. Having two opposing sides
                        allows for concealment and the uneven distribution of information among
                        players; the game operates as a surface for images, text and art. The
                        uniformity of the cards allows them to be stacked and reordered as a deck.
                        This affordance introduces elements of chance and assures fairness.
                        Moreover, cards are ordinal, allowing them to be counted, ranked, and
                        sorted. They also occupy space, meaning that the cards' arrangement in a
                        particular order can have significance. Also, cards are textural, designed
                        to be handled (e.g., shuffling, dealing, cutting, etc.) and require
                        proximity to one another. In short, Altice clarifies the ways that cards
                        impose material and mechanical restraints. As Werning puts it, the playful
                        datasets workshops treated games-as-tools. As such, observations about games
                        can be extended to thinking about how computational tools are impacted by
                        design choices.</p>
                    <p>In December 2019, within the context of our teaching the research master
                        course <title rend="quotes">Data-driven tools and methods</title> for 15
                        students within Media and Culture Studies at the Faculty of Humanities, I
                        collaborated with Werning on a Playable Datasets workshop. In the workshop
                        we incorporated tool criticism, as a reflective perspective taken up by the
                        participants. Specifically, students were instructed to explore the
                            <emph>mechanical</emph> and <emph>material</emph> constraints of a game
                        we provided them and to make a series of modifications to it. For the
                        workshop Werning had developed the <title rend="quotes">App
                            Publisher</title> game using a dataset containing metadata from almost
                        10,000 apps from the Google Play Store.<note><p>It was based on a dataset
                                scraped and shared via Kaggle by Lavanya Gupta.</p></note> Using
                        nanDECK, he had converted a sample dataset from the Google Play Store into
                        customizable playing cards.<note><p>Cf. <ptr
                                    target="http://www.nand.it/nandeck/"/></p></note> The game was
                        about the political economy of app publishing. Following the discursive game
                        design approach, the game served as a starting point for subsequent
                        modifications initiated by the students. In other words, they were asked to
                            <emph>argue</emph> with the values and assumptions of the prototype in
                        front of them. </p>

                    <div>
                        <head> Reflections</head>
                        <p>Three main observations can be made about the workshop that are relevant
                            to the aims of this paper. First, participants realized that making a
                            game prototype entails <emph>a whole chain of tools</emph> including
                            Excel, nanDeck and Google Play API. They realized how each step in the
                            process of making a prototype had involved the making of choices and the
                            following of certain procedures. They had worked with Excel to
                                <q>clean</q> the dataset<note><p>In the course they had read the
                                    article by <ptr target="#rawson-munoz2019"/> about how the
                                    notion of ‘cleaning’ proposes an underlying correct order of
                                    data. As such, they were primed to think also about the impact
                                    of this on knowledge production.</p></note> and with nanDECK to
                            design the cards. They struggled with the limitations imposed by only
                            having access to the data made available through the Google Play Store
                            API service, which restricted the scope of potential games they could
                            make. Students raised questions about the meaning of the data, which
                            they determined was multivalent (e.g., they mean something different to
                            Google than to the maker or players of the original prototype) and thus
                            dependent on the position from which one asked such questions. The
                            workshop also made explicit how data and tools were intertwined. The
                            tools they worked with determined the data that was available to scrape
                            (Google Play Store API) and how it could be manipulated (Excel and
                            nanDECK). The game mechanisms, in turn, provided ways of exploring the
                            dataset and influenced how the data were understood. In arguing with the
                            game prototype the students experienced first-hand how <quote

                                together, cannot be easily separated and appropriated for other

                            <ptr target="#loukissas2019" loc="104"/>.</p>
                        <p>Second, the workshop participants struggled in having to make and to
                            critically reflect as part of a single process. They started out rather
                            upbeat, pinpointing which assumptions about the app marketplace were
                            embedded in the original game prototype. Tasked with making their own
                            prototype based on the existing dataset, however, they struggled. They
                            needed to learn how to work with various tools, but this effort took too
                            much time and hindered their ability to <emph>think</emph> about their
                            process. Only afterwards, when preparing their presentation, did they
                            start to grasp the implications of their decisions and how their options
                            had been framed by their tools. The session's time constraints minimized
                            critical work in favour of results. Asking and attending to questions
                            about approach, methods, and goals would certainly have slowed the
                            process down – but, we should stress, moving slowly doesn't have to be
                            experienced as something negative. Berry and Fagerjord have suggested
                            that critical work in digital humanities projects can function as a
                                <quote rend="inline"><emph>productive</emph> slowdown</quote>
                            <ptr target="#berry-fagerjord2017" loc="143"/>. The experienced
                            challenge of combining critical reflection and building was, in the end,
                            primarily a limitation of how the workshop had been designed. New
                            iterations could consider more time and space for engagement. </p>
                        <p>One team presented a short meme-based video made by student Daniël Everts
                            on trying to engage with and reflect on nanDECK with the help of the
                            software's 169-page manual.<note><p>The video was later posted to
                                    YouTube on January 7, 2020: <ptr
                                        target="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGKdNYSjTHk"
                                /></p></note> The video's humor centres on the protagonist scrolling
                            endlessly through the manual (two days later, three weeks later) on
                            their computer. Finally, they push a large Spok (sic!) button, whereupon
                            the fictional<emph> Star Trek</emph> Vulcan enters the room and,
                            contrary to his famous hyperrationalism, repeatedly smashes the computer
                            with his fist. Frustrations over the steep learning curves of
                            computational tools are ever more frequently encountered when we are
                            teaching practical data skills in our programme. The limitations
                            experienced here were more about the <q>remediation</q> of analogue
                            cards. Students implicitly reflected on the affordances of cards,
                            earlier discussed in relation to Altice, in giving form to the games
                            they developed. Werning and I also discussed whether we should have
                            given them paper, scissors, and pens to design their game. Now they
                            worked within the parameters of what was possible in code, which the
                            students needed to learn on the fly.</p>
                        <p>The frustration with the nanDECK manual points to the gap between
                                <emph>transparency and explainability</emph>. In other words, making
                            the workings of a tool transparent does not mean that the user
                                <emph>understands</emph> how and why it works the way it does.
                            Transparency is, for instance, often pursued by sharing the code of
                            software. Again, many people may lack to knowledge to comprehend and
                            interpret it. Explainability would entail that how the software tool
                            works is made interpretable to the user, explained in such a manner that
                            they grasp its underlying concepts and models. The workshop furthermore
                            raised the question as to <emph>how much</emph> the students needed to
                            understand of the tool and what needed to be addressed in their
                            discussion of the prototype they had made. Rather organically, they let
                            go of the idea that they had to understand all the minute details of the
                            tools and began focusing more on <q>transformations</q> to address the
                            values and assumptions of the game prototypes.</p>
                        <p> Lastly, the workshop's participants spent a lot of time fine-tuning
                            their prototype with an eye to its usability, concerning themselves with
                            matters such as the legibility of fonts and images on the cards. Here,
                            they aligned with the approaches of the HCI community, which stress
                                <quote rend="inline"> efficient completion of tasks</quote> and are
                            oriented towards transparency and clarity <ptr target="#drucker2013"
                                loc="par. 34"/>. This orientation produced the impression that the
                            game provides a window onto the underlying data and presents certainty
                            about the apps and their relations. Interestingly, the participants
                            could have used ambiguity to reflect the complexity of the app
                            marketplace. Their choices, by contrast, demonstrated the appeal and
                            persuasiveness of using simple categories, measures, and
                            representational forms. In short then, the students seemingly favoured
                                <q>clean</q> and unambiguous data and interfaces. This observation
                            points to the importance of consideration for one's own ontological and
                            epistemological assumptions.</p>

                        by another workshop. Cristina Cochior and Manetta Berends, both
                        researchers/designers active in the Netherlands, designed and led the <title

                        hosted in June 2020 by <title rend="italic">Datafied Society</title>, the
                        research group I coordinate at Utrecht University.<note><p>This workshop has
                                since been developed as an online module to stimulate tool criticism
                                thinking with short video contributions from Deb Verhoeven, Seda
                                Gürses and Andreas Hepp: <ptr

                                /></p></note> It was attended by eight participants, primarily PhD
                        candidates, most of which had some basic programming skills. The workshop
                        was preceded by a lecture in which Deb Verhoeven discussed digital
                        infrapuncture, a concept she initially introduced in an opening keynote for
                        the 2016 Digital Humanities at Oxford Summer School (see <ptr
                            target="#verhoeven2016"/>). Like Svensson, Verhoeven is also concerned
                        with the fact that most research infrastructures in DH do not reflect
                        humanistic goals. She proposed <q>digital infrapuncture</q> as a new model
                        for digital humanities infrastructure. The concept draws from the work of
                        Manuel de Sola-Morales on urban acupuncture and Steven Jackson's (2014)
                        essay <title rend="quotes">Rethinking Repair</title>. As Verhoeven
                        explained, it combines the word infrastructure and acupuncture and is a way
                        of exploring how small-scall infrastructure interventions can transform
                        larger contexts. Rather than building new infrastructures, digital
                        infrapuncture looks to relieve systemic pressure, which she termed
                            <q>hurt,</q> through these interventions. Verhoeven's work responds to
                        scholarly conversations on the need to reconsider big data humanities
                        infrastructure in terms of capacity and care cf. <ptr
                            target="#nowviskie2015"/>. In the workshop presentation she proposed
                            <emph>agency</emph>, <emph>impact</emph>, and <emph>power</emph> as key
                        conceptual axes on which current research infrastructures can be rethought
                        and rebuilt. These conceptual axes were considered and discussed during the
                        group discussion when identifying and tackling identified <q>hurt.</q></p>
                    <p>Verhoeven's introduction to digital infrapuncture was followed by a short
                        lecture by Cochior, in which she explored <q>Bot Logic</q> as a framework
                        through which to understand bots' impact (their affective and effective
                        forces alike). The workshop's aim was to devise bots in chat protocols that
                        would intervene in the logics of the platform, creating small interventions
                        that overhaul the notion of structure itself and offer relief. The workshop
                        consisted of five parts: (a) brainstorming chat protocols, (b) identifying
                        where it hurts, (c) designing a bot to puncture and deflate stress, (d)
                        scripting how the bot acts upon the infrastructure, and finally (e) group
                        discussion. I briefly reflect on the process and on outcomes involving two
                        teams as a means to fleshing out what tool criticism actually entails in
                        practice. </p>
                    <p>The first team, a duo of which I was part, focused on critique of the
                        neoliberal university on Twitter in the Netherlands. We considered the
                        Matthew effect of accumulated advantage as well as related questions of
                        visibility and voice in academia. We thought about ways that bots could be
                        used to amplify academics with few Twitter followers, but settled on another
                        hurt, namely that caused by the hierarchies of visibility for political
                        inaction in the Netherlands on issues pertaining to the neoliberalization of
                        universities. To amend this hurt, we proposed a bot that would tweet posts
                        with hashtags such as #WOinActie (a community of employees and students in
                        the Netherlands protesting the neoliberalization of the university) directed
                        to the Minister of Education, Culture and Science. Another team picked the
                        open-source decentralized social network Mastodon and contemplated ways of
                        countering radical voices on the Mastodon timelines. They came up with a bot
                        that supported the coverage of a range of perspectives on a topic. It would
                        identify a post's topic and compare it to the entries in a categorized
                        database, in order to then counter it with an article offering a different
                        perspective on that topic. </p>

                        <head>Reflections</head>
                        <p>The workshop prompted a series of questions relevant to tool criticism.
                            These queries centred on issues concerning the distribution of
                                <emph>agency</emph> among users, bots, and
                            platforms/infrastructures, as well as with <emph>scale</emph> and
                                <emph>interconnections</emph> relating to questions of impact. In
                            terms of agency, we knew that a bot tweeting at the Minister of
                            Education, Culture and Science would immediately be muted or blocked,
                            which got us thinking about whether we could actually
                                <emph>intervene</emph> on the platform. Was this possible, or are
                            bots merely a means to <emph>augment</emph>? And if so, should
                            augmentation be seen as a form of intervention? It seemed that what the
                            bot would be doing was more akin to what Michel de Certeau calls
                            tactics. As he explains, <quote rend="inline">[t]he space of a tactic is
                                the space of the other. Thus it must play on and with a terrain
                                imposed on it and organized by the law of a foreign power</quote>
                            <ptr target="#decerteau1984" loc="37"/>. In other words, the bot would
                            simply be acting within the environment as defined by the platform's own
                            given strategies. In fact, Andreas Hepp proposes that bots are often
                                <quote rend="inline">media in media</quote>
                            <ptr target="#hepp2020" loc="10"/>. Based on platforms such as Facebook
                            and Twitter, they simply <q>act upon</q> these platforms. In other
                            words, they intervene <emph>on</emph> rather than <emph>in</emph> the
                            infrastructure. The latter possibility would require access – signalling
                            uneven power relations - which we would never have. Questions were thus
                            raised about the platform's ownership and how certain affordances
                            reflected its purpose and the level of involvement of the audience.</p>
                        <p>The Mastodon team, with their bot, wanted to stimulate impartial coverage
                            of news topics. They were critical of their own proposal to do so but
                            formulated valuable reflections on <emph>scale</emph> and
                                <emph>interventions</emph>. Plantin et al. argue that digital
                            technologies have contributed to a <q>platformization</q> of
                            infrastructures and an <q>infrastructuralization</q> of platforms. As
                            they explain, platforms and infrastructures are both structures that
                            underlie and support a system or organization, <quote rend="inline">but
                                they differ in scale and scope</quote>
                            <ptr target="#plantin2018" loc="299"/> They characterize the former with
                            terms such as <quote rend="inline">centrally designed and
                                controlled</quote>, <quote rend="inline">modular frameworks</quote>,
                            and <quote rend="inline">small scales and scopes</quote>; the latter are
                            described by terms and phrases like <quote rend="inline">widely
                                accessible</quote>, <quote rend="inline">heterogeneous systems and
                                networks</quote>, and <quote rend="inline">essential
                                services</quote>
                            <ptr target="#plantin2018"/>. Van Dijck et al. explain that in North
                            America and Europe, Alphabet-Google, Facebook, Microsoft, Amazon, and
                            Apple provide infrastructural services on which many other apps and
                            platforms are built. The services of these tech companies are integrated
                            into many websites, enabling the collection of user data across the Web
                            and various apps <ptr target="#vandijck2018" loc="15"/>. Such complex
                            interdependencies are also present in the digital infrastructures used
                            for research. These relations, and the implications of their
                            dependencies, need to be considered in the analysis of how research
                            infrastructure shapes the research process. They prompt important
                            questions about agency, impact and power. </p>
                        <p> In addition to scale, the Mastodon team reflected with the workshop
                            participants on the impact of the bot's interventions. We realized that
                            the proposed bot might actually thwart the ideals of impartial coverage
                            by giving attention to positions not supported by credible evidence.
                            Regardless of whether or not the bot could work, it was interesting to
                            think through the larger impact it might exert. Specifically, we
                            discussed what had happened when representatives of social media
                            platforms fact-checked against Wikipedia. In these cases, the hurt
                            (i.e., the dissemination of fake news) had simply been displaced and
                            travelled elsewhere: users started falsifying Wikipedia entries to
                            prevent posts from being classified as fake. This phenomenon reminded us
                            of the observations that systems are often interrelated and that
                            interventions in one place might extend further than anticipated.
                            Similar to our thinking about a Twitter neoliberal academia bot, the
                            question arose as to where <q>the</q> critical location of intervention
                            is situated and whether we had the requisite access to intervene in such
                            a space. </p>

                <head>Conclusions</head>
                <p> In this paper, two critical making–inspired workshops were used as a springboard
                    to unpack tool criticism and explore the types of reflections it brings to the
                    fore. Our tools and infrastructures, it was underscored, require critical
                    attention as they are not neutral actants in knowledge production. The workshops
                    helped make explicit the thinking that tool criticism entails and the challenges
                    that digital humanities scholars should confront when using tools and
                    infrastructures. The critical modality in which such scholars have traditionally
                    been trained should be directed towards their computational tools and
                    infrastructures in the digital humanities.</p>
                <p> The workshops underscored the complex network of <emph>relations</emph> between
                    human and non-human actors that come into being and enact agency. Understanding
                    tools is also a question of grasping their relation to users, and it requires
                    the ability to treat them not as objects but as <quote rend="inline">a set of
                        conditions, structured relations, that allow certain behaviours, actions,
                        readings, events to occur</quote>
                    <ptr target="#drucker2013" loc="par. 31"/>. This idea was the conception at the
                    centre of the workshops. Tool criticism is a continuous process of thinking and
                    acting <emph>with</emph> tools. From earlier workshops we had learned that
                    teaching participants the basics of programming would require a lot more time.
                    In the bots and infrapuncture this enactment had therefore been substituted with
                    a scripting exercise. While this was obviously not the same activity,
                    participants were nonetheless asked to <q>run their code</q> and consider how
                    the bot would work in practice. During the playable datasets workshop in
                    particular we noticed that participants struggled to move between making the
                    game prototype and engaging in critical reflection on their process. Although
                    critical work takes time, there should nonetheless be reflection on one's
                    approach, methods, and the goals of the tools being used. This insight supports
                    Berry and Fagerford's call for a productive slowdown in research projects. </p>
                <p> Moreover, the workshops brought to light that we often use not only
                        <emph>a</emph> tool but rather a <emph>chain</emph> of tools. This
                    observation underscores Dobson's argument that criticism needs to be implemented
                    throughout the entirety of the research process (not just in relation to its
                    results). Alternatively, researchers may use digital infrastructure that relies
                    on or is interwoven with other tools or infrastructures. These interact with and
                    co-define the inputs and outputs. It also became apparent that a focus on the
                    transformations brought about by tools – rather than getting lost in the details
                    about how they function – was sufficient for conversations to ensue about their
                    assumptions and values. However, here the participants of both workshops were
                    somewhat at an advantage in their already having affinity with the Humanities. </p>
                <p> As seen in the workshops, tool criticism thinking raises questions about impact,
                    access and establishes relations of power and links to ownership. The tools we
                    use are often appropriated from other disciplines or taken from other
                    institutional and commercial contexts. More specifically, tool criticism prompts
                    a series of questions. Who made it? For who (not)? With what purpose? Such
                    questions are not unfamiliar as they are, for instance, grounded in traditional
                    source criticism <ptr target="#koolen2019"/>. However, enthusiasm for <q>big
                        data</q> research in the humanities, necessitates these are revisited and
                    updated. The workshops surfaced questions that engage explicitly with the
                    materiality of the tools that play a role in transforming the data we work with.
                    These include: What assumptions and values are established through its
                    affordances and implemented in the design? Can we examine and adapt the
                    underlying code? What is the impact of different settings and parameters
                    (materials and mechanics). What happens when we use this set of rules instead of
                    some other? How would certain decisions change how we interpret the underlying
                    data? Here the relation between tool and research also proved of importance:
                    What are my own assumptions and values?</p>
                <p> What complicates the aim of tool criticism in answering these questions is that
                    these computational tools are often easy-to-use and thus <emph>seem</emph>
                    transparent and neutral. Furthermore, tools are complex and dynamic in that they
                    not only consist of interlinked and dependent layers but are also networked with
                    other human and non-human actors (including underlying data sets). Criticism is
                    contingent not only on questions of <emph>access</emph> to the <q>black
                        boxes</q> (e.g., code and algorithms, models and strategies) but also on the
                    subsequent ability to make sense of it. The nanDECK tutorial was a powerful
                    reminder that transparency is not enough for users to understand the stakes -
                    its biases and assumptions - of using the tool. It demands that users of tools
                    become more informed and literate about the building blocks of these
                    technologies. </p>
                <p> While our initial definition of tool criticism (<ptr target="#vanes2018"/>
                    <ptr target="#vanes2021"/>) addressed the fact that our computational tools
                    contain values and assumptions pertaining embedded concepts and methods that
                    should be subject to scrutiny, we failed to extend our inquiry to include
                    concerns related to capacity and care. Here, books such as <title>Data
                        Feminism</title> (2020) by Catherine D'Ignazio and Lauren F. Klein, with its
                    seven principles of data feminism <ptr target="#dignazio-klein2020"/>, and
                        <title>All Data Are Local</title> by Yanni Alexander Loukissas <ptr
                        target="#loukissas2019"/> might prove useful. Concerns for data justice as
                    well have been expressed in relation to automated tools by Virginia Eubanks in
                        <title rend="italic">Automating Inequality</title> (2019) <ptr
                        target="#eubanks2019"/> and Safiya Noble in <title rend="italic">Algorithms
                        of Oppression</title> (2018) <ptr target="#noble2018"/>. By incorporating
                    such concerns into the questions we raise about our research and the tools and
                    infrastructures we employ, tool criticism becomes an important component of
                    digital <emph>humanities</emph> scholarship. </p>
                <p>Engaging in tool criticism is, as the participants of these critical
                    making-inspired workshops experienced, no simple task. It needs to be part and
                    parcel of the research process, necessitates a slowing down and an eagerness to
                    learn about the basic principles of the tool. For humanities scholars in
                    particular, this sort of criticism requires discussions not just about
                    methodology but also about ethics and care. New research tools and
                    infrastructures for the humanities should consider questions of access and
                    agency in local contexts. Workshops of the sort discussed here are a modest step
                    to help raise awareness of the fact that computational tools are not neutral and
                    that a lot of interpretive acts are involved in working with them. Moreover, the
                    insights and reflections generated in these workshops can help formulate the
                    type of questions that we need to be asking about computational tools in digital
                    humanities research and beyond and surface issues that we need to collectively
                    address. </p>
