                scholars when working with computational tools and digital infrastructures. First,
                it explores tool criticism as a response to instrumentalism in the digital
                humanities and proposes it to be part of what a critical digital humanities does.
                Second, it analyses tool criticism as practice, in practice. Concretely, it
                discusses two critical making–inspired workshops in which participants explored the
                affordances of digital tools and infrastructures and their underlying assumptions
                and values. The first workshop focused on &apos;games-as-tools&apos; <ptr
                    target="#werning2020"/>. Participants in the workshop engaged with the
                constraints, material and mechanical, of a card game by making modifications to it.
                In the second workshop, drawing on the concept of &apos;digital infrapuncture&apos;
                    <ptr target="#verhoeven2016"/>, participants examined digital infrastructure in
                terms of capacity and care. After first identifying &apos;hurt&apos; in a chat
                environment, they then designed bots to intervene in that hurt and offer relief. </dhq:abstract>

                <head>Introduction</head>

                <p>The digitalization and datafication of all aspects of our cultural practices and
                    social interactions have created new opportunities for research. Thanks to
                    easy-to-use data analysis tools and digital infrastructures, even those
                    humanities scholars who lack programming skills can work with large-scale
                    empirical datasets in order to disclose patterns and correlations within them.
                    Although empirical research trends have existed throughout the history of the
                    humanities <ptr target="#bod2013"/>, these recently emergent possibilities have
                    revived an empiricist attitude among some humanities scholars schooled in more
                    critical and interpretive traditions. This development has strengthened the
                    position of those who have long thought that the humanities needed more
                    &apos;objective&apos; means of inquiry to better substantiate their interpretive
                    claims. It has been argued, however, that some of the interpretive humanistic
                    tradition&apos;s strengths have been relinquished as a result. As Drucker and
                    Svensson note, scholars engaged in digital projects sometimes leave their
                    critical sensibilities behind: <cit><quote rend="inline">such projects can
                            demonstrate more positivism than the positivism we often (and sometimes
                            erroneously) associate with science and technology</quote>
                        <ptr target="#drucker-svensson2016" loc="par. 9"/></cit>. The problem, in
                    part, stems from the fact that the assumptions and concepts of the computational
                    methods embedded in tools, often derived from the empirical sciences, are
                    generally left unscrutinized <ptr target="#dobson2019" loc="6"/>. These tools
                    become the stage of <cit><quote rend="inline">an encounter between two sets of
                            epistemic traditions – hermeneutic and empirical</quote>
                        <ptr target="#masson2017" loc="28"/></cit> and raise questions about
                    methodology. </p>
                <p> Prompted by this <cit><quote rend="inline">methodological moment</quote>
                            (<dhq:citRef>Scheinfeldt in <ptr target="#rieder-röhle2017" loc="210"
                            /></dhq:citRef>)</cit> within the humanities, there has been a call for
                    &apos;tool criticism&apos;, as it has been termed (<ptr target="#koolen2019"/>
                    <ptr target="#vanes2018"/> and <ptr target="#vanes2021"/>, <ptr
                        target="#vangeenen2020"/>). These authors have drawn attention to the need
                    for digital humanists to critically reflect on the impact of their research
                    tools, which have computational methods embedded within them, on knowledge
                    production. Rather than as mere instruments, these tools are envisioned as a set
                    of conditions; their affordances are at once enabling and constraining
                    practices. The proposal that our research tools are caught up in the epistemic
                    process is not new <ptr target="#baird2004"/>
                    <ptr target="#latour-woolgar1986"/>. However, as a result of the computational
                    turn and the proliferation of easy-to-use tools for data analysis and
                    visualisation, there is a need to put the matter back on the agenda of the
                    humanities and encourage further discussion on digital methodologies. Tool
                    criticism takes part in a response to the call for a third-wave digital
                    humanities that develops a programme of criticism with regard to the
                    computational <ptr target="#berry2011"/>, but in its desire to incorporate the
                    knowledge and concepts mobilized by software into this reflection <ptr
                        target="#rieder-röhle2017"/>, it moves the discussion forward.</p>
                <p> In this paper I seek to make tool criticism a bit more concrete. To do so I
                    explore tool criticism as a response to instrumentalism in the digital
                    humanities and proposes it to be part of what a critical digital humanities
                    does. Subsequently, I explore it as a practice, and in practice. More
                    specifically, I discuss two critical making–inspired workshops in which
                    participants analysed the affordances of digital tools and infrastructures and
                    engaged with their underlying assumptions and values. The first workshop
                    approached <cit><quote rend="inline">games-as-tools</quote>
                        <ptr target="#werning2020"/></cit>. Participants modified a card game,
                    playing with its material and mechanical constraints in order to argue with its
                    claims and assumptions. The second workshop, drawing on the concept of
                            <cit><quote rend="inline">digital infrapuncture</quote>
                        <ptr target="#verhoeven2016"/></cit>, asked participants to examine digital
                    infrastructure in terms of capacity and care. They first identified pain and
                    stress in a chat environment, caused by the norms and values embedded in the
                    design of the infrastructure (e.g. the platform discriminates against or even
                    excludes certain users and practices). The participants then designed bots that
                    intervened and offered relief in the system. Finally, reflection on the sort of
                    tool criticism performed in the workshops enables an exploration of the critical
                    and reflective attitude required of digital humanities scholars when conducting
                    research with computational tools and digital infrastructures. </p>

                <p>Research in the digital humanities is supported by many different computational
                    tools and digital infrastructures. Examples of such tools include Excel,
                    Tableau, Python, Google NGram Viewer, ImagePlot and the Digital Methods
                    Initiative Issue Crawler. Whereas tools are often used individually or by small
                    teams and are oriented towards solving particular tasks, infrastructures work on
                    a larger scale and combine multiple functions and applications. Infrastructures
                    can be defined as <cit><quote rend="inline">the relationships, interactions and
                            connections between people, technologies, and institutions (that help
                            data flow and be useful</quote>
                        <ptr target="#parsons2015"/></cit>. Examples of digital infrastructures
                    relevant to digital humanities research include Getty, DBpedia, Europeana,
                    DARIAH, and HuNi. A challenge in working with tools and infrastructures is that
                    they have heterogenous development, funding and use contexts. These are all
                    factors that impact their stability and appropriateness for research aims
                        (<dhq:citRef>see <ptr target="#vanes2021"/>
                    </dhq:citRef>).</p>
                <p> The computational turn has created a flood of empirical data, which can now be
                    wrangled with in many easy-to-use tools. In the humanities we currently
                    encounter a <quote rend="inline">renewed positivist dream</quote> in which
                    computational tools are applied uncritically <ptr target="#dobson2019" loc="3"
                    />. In an earlier contribution to this journal, Drucker and Svensson find that
                            <cit><quote rend="inline">[h]umanists continue to be seduced by tools to
                            whose workings they give limited attention, so they execute their
                            projects (e.g. in network analysis software) without knowing how the
                            results were generated</quote>
                        <ptr target="#drucker-svensson2016" loc="par. 9"/>
                    </cit>. This phenomenon has also been labelled <cit><quote rend="inline">blunt
                            instrumentalism</quote>
                        <ptr target="#tenen2016"/></cit>. Here computational tools, are treated as
                    transparent and neutral. Their affordances and embedded methods, though
                    exercising an impact on the epistemological process, are not critically
                    analysed. </p>
                <p> Patrik Svensson underscores the instrumental tendencies in the humanities,
                    pointing to the propensity of <cit><quote rend="inline">think[ing] about
                            infrastructure as placeless, immaterial, and neutral</quote>
                        <ptr target="#svensson2015" loc="349"/></cit>. He puts forth the view that
                    our tools and infrastructures in fact embody <cit><quote rend="inline">ways of
                            perceiving, interrogating, and enacting the world</quote>
                        <ptr target="#svensson2015" loc="342-43"/></cit>. To avoid being governed by
                    a scientific and engineering paradigm that now dominates the design of digital
                    infrastructures, Svensson suggests that humanities scholars ought to become more
                    involved in building. This way, models of infrastructure can be developed that
                    are based on the humanities&apos; own needs and desires (<dhq:citRef>see also
                            <ptr target="#drucker2012"/></dhq:citRef>). </p>
                <p> Inspired by Lev Manovich&apos;s assertion that a prototype <emph rend="italic"
                        >is</emph> a theory, Alan Galey and Stan Ruecker <ptr
                        target="#galey-ruecker2010"/> propose that experimental digital prototypes
                    can contain arguments. They state that <cit><quote rend="inline">digital
                            artifacts have meaning, not just utility</quote></cit>, and argue that
                    these efforts should be considered peer-reviewable forms of research. Allington
                    et al. <ptr target="#allington2016"/>, however, have been critical of the idea
                    that the building of computational tools can be a substitute for scholarly
                    writing. They point out how Computer Science departments have never awarded PhD
                    degrees on the basis of programming competence alone. Relevant to our discussion
                    here is the idea that tools can embody the perspectives of their makers.
                    However, it is important to point out that the assumptions and values in tools
                    are not necessarily always the product of intent. </p>
                <p> Responding to the concerns about instrumentalism, Mathieu Jacomy, one of the
                    developers of Gephi, lashes out at academics. In a blog post he makes the
                    following plea: <cit><quote rend="block">Please stop summarizing your detailed
                            argumentation down to “tools influence us because of presuppositions
                            built into them&quot;. Nobody stuffed your tool. That is not how it
                            works. Most tool makers do not really know what they are doing – they
                            just experiment. They do not try to influence you – they probably do not
                            care about you.</quote>
                        <ptr target="#jacomy2020" loc="np"/>
                    </cit></p>

                <p>Jacomy goes on to argue that tools arrive as <term>accidents</term> and not as
                            <cit><quote rend="inline">the Trojan horses of methodological
                            imperialists</quote>
                        <ptr target="#jacomy2020" loc="np"/></cit>. While not every affordance of a
                    tool is intentional or connected to the implementation of methods (some can, for
                    instance, concern functionality), he overlooks how all choices reflect a
                    particular perspective, contain certain assumptions and have implications for
                    how knowledge is ultimately produced. </p>
                <p> Against the background of instrumentalism, Drucker and Svensson find there is
                    insufficient attention to the material support of knowledge production and that

                    assumptions behind them. The popular network visualisation and analysis software
                    package Gephi, for instance, lacks the ability to trace the history of

                <p>In light of a more general criticism charging that the digital humanities tend to
                    be anti-interpretive (Allington et al., 2016), there have been calls for a

                    interpretive traditions into the digital humanities. Conducting tool criticism,
                    raising questions about how our computational tools are caught up in the
                    epistemic process, needs to be part of what a critical digital humanities (CDH)
                    does. Tool criticism is necessary particularly because these tools often bear
                    assumptions and concepts derived from the empirical sciences (<ptr

                <p> David M. Berry has argued for the strengthening of a programme of criticism
                    around the computational <ptr target="#berry2011"/>. However, in the view of
                    Rieder and Röhle, a concentration on &apos;the digital&apos; and the
                    understanding of code with regard to the scrutiny of computational tools would
                    be short-sighted <ptr target="#rieder-röhle2017" loc="118"/>. Such a focus
                    emphasizes programming as a required skillset but overlooks the concepts and
                    knowledges that are mobilized in the use of these tools (<dhq:citRef>cf. <ptr
                            target="#dobson2019"/></dhq:citRef>. Likewise, Dennis Tenen explains

                            surface in DH literature is a critical conversation about

                        <ptr target="#tenen2016" loc="85"/></cit>. In raising questions about
                    computational tools and their embedded computational methods, these scholars
                    share an interest in tool criticism discussions about digital methodologies in
                    the humanities. </p>
                <p> The use of tools and infrastructure in humanities research requires that these
                    tools, and the researcher&apos;s relation to them, be made a site of critical
                    analysis – which is to say, that they demand tool criticism. As we have defined
                    it elsewhere, tool criticism concerns <cit><quote rend="block">the critical
                            inquiry into digital tools and how they are used for various purposes
                            within the research process. It reviews the qualities of the tool in
                            light of, for instance, research activities, and it reflects on how the
                            tool (e.g., its data source, working mechanisms, anticipated use,
                            interface, and embedded assumptions) affects the user, the research
                            process and output, and its reliance on the user&apos;s training. <ptr

                <p> Central to this notion is a critical and reflexive attitude towards the tools
                    used to create knowledge. Inspired by reflection-in-action <ptr
                        target="#schön1983"/>, tool criticism involves continuous <emph
                        rend="italic">interaction</emph> rather than the exercise of detached
                    judgement from a distance. It is important, then, to reflect on the choices made
                    in <emph rend="italic">using</emph> the tools. This also explains why critical
                    making–inspired workshops are used in this paper to explore tool criticism as
                    practice, in practice. Tool criticism helps bring the traditional critical and
                    interpretive strengths of humanities scholarship back into focus within digital
                    humanities scholarship (<dhq:citRef>cf. <ptr target="#dobson2019"
                    /></dhq:citRef>). It recognizes that tools are socio-technical constructions and
                    are never simply a means of facilitating certain outcomes. They possess certain
                    affordances and also reflect the worldviews of their makers. </p>
                <p> As mentioned earlier, Drucker and Svensson have argued the importance of paying
                    attention to how the material features of tools support knowledge production
                        <ptr target="#drucker-svensson2016"/>. This is equally relevant in relation
                    to our <emph rend="italic">digital</emph> or computational tools. In the 1980s
                    and &apos;90s the digital was seen as virtual and as existing outside material
                    constraints. This popular discourse was misleading. Paul Dourish, in examining
                    the material dimension of software and digital information, exhibits an interest
                    in the materialities of information – <cit><quote rend="inline">those properties
                            of representations and formats that constrain, enable, limit, and shape
                            the ways in which those representations can be created, transmitted,
                            stored, manipulated, and put to use – properties like their heft, size,
                            fragility, and transparency</quote>
                        <ptr target="#dourish2017" loc="6"/></cit>. In addition, software is always
                    &apos;in-material&apos; due to its being embedded in physical data carriers <ptr
                        target="#vandenboomen2009" loc="9"/>. Importantly, the material properties
                    of tools and infrastructures exert influence on what, and how, they enable us to
                    know. </p>
                <p> One term used to capture the complexity of tools and their function with respect
                    to a more encompassing methodology is &apos;the stack&apos;. It is defined as
                            <cit><quote rend="inline">the interlinked and dependent layers of tools
                            and abstractions that make up any contemporary computational application
                            or procedure</quote>
                        <ptr target="#dobson2019" loc="x"/>
                    </cit>. Reflecting on the Natural Language Toolkit, Tenen explains, <cit><quote
                            rend="inline">Each level of abstraction in the movement from statistical
                            methods, to Python code, to graphical user interface introduces its own

                        <ptr target="#tenen2016" loc="85-86"/></cit>. In addition to computational
                    tools, digital infrastructures are used in research. These are intricate
                    networks of relations that come into being as a system. Linking these issues
                    back to the problem of instrumentalism, the conception of these tools as
                    transparent is misguided because tools reflect methodological issues and because
                    they have material properties with epistemological implications. </p>

                <head>Critical making–inspired workshops</head>
                <p> The two workshops discussed in this paper seek to promote <emph rend="italic"
                        >tool criticism thinking</emph> as a means of demonstrating the importance
                    of <cit><quote rend="inline">methodological awareness and self-critique</quote>
                        <ptr target="#dobson2019" loc="6"/></cit> when humanities students and
                    scholars engage in computational research. These workshops can be understood as
                    experiments in what Matt Ratto has popularized as critical making and oscillates
                    between building and reflection. In critical making workshops, participants
                    build prototypes as a way of conceptual exploration. These prototypes

                    process and the exchange that emerges rather than on a final product
                    differentiates this sort of activity from <cit><quote rend="inline">critical

                <p> Most of the external funding for DH projects has been directed toward
                    tool-building rather than interpretive work <ptr target="#dobson2019" loc="15"
                    />. This crux of tension in the digital humanities between intellectual labour
                    on the one hand and making and practice on the other has often been captured in
                    the catchphrase &quot;more hack, less yack&quot;. The split was epitomized when
                    Stephen Ramsay, in &quot;Who&apos;s In and Who&apos;s Out&quot;, provocatively
                    stated that digital humanities scholars need to learn how to code and build
                    things <ptr target="#ramsay2011"/>. The present paper&apos;s premise is that
                    this opposition is misinformed and unproductive, as <cit><quote rend="inline"
                            >the humanities is both/and</quote>
                        <ptr target="#nowviskie2016"/></cit>. The critical making–informed workshops
                    discussed here, in combining building and theorizing, equally reject such a
                    binary. They underscore that the building of tools is/should be linked to
                    theorisation. However, to explore these workshops here, is not to make an
                    argument for the need to learn how to build things, but acknowledges that
                    engaging in tool criticism requires a basic understanding of the biases and
                    assumptions of the tools/infrastructure being used.</p>
                <p> Concerns over instrumentalism noted have also sparked debates as to the
                    particular skills and literacies needed in the digital humanities. Some thinkers
                    have argued that digital humanities scholars need to learn how to code (<ptr
                        target="#rushkoff2010"/>
                    <ptr target="#ramsay2011"/>
                    <ptr target="#galloway2016"/>), whereas others have warned that teaching
                    students to program is time-consuming, detracts from the development of critical
                    thinking <ptr target="#fuchs2017"/>, and may foster a <cit><quote rend="inline"
                            >false sense of mastery</quote></cit> over the technology <ptr
                        target="#chun2013"/>. Importantly, Rieder and Röhle <ptr
                        target="#rieder-röhle2017"/> find that the teaching of programming
                    proficiency does not mean that the concepts and techniques employed in digital
                    tools are clarified. The use of Gephi, for instance, would require an
                    understanding of graph theory or sociometry. As Rieder explains in his recent
                    book, <cit><quote rend="block"> But beyond attributions of sometimes very broad

                            still rarely venture more deeply into the intellectual and material
                            domains of technicality that hardware and software developers invent and
                            draw on to design the forms, functions and behaviors that constitute
                            technical objects and infrastructures.</quote>
                        <ptr target="#rieder2020" loc="81-82"/>.</cit> Commenting on the idea of a
                    critical code studies, Rieder questions whether this type of <cit><quote
                            rend="inline">meaningful and context-aware reading</quote></cit> of code
                    would even be possible for humanities scholars <ptr target="#rieder2020"
                        loc="98"/>.</p>
                <p>How, then, can humanities scholars who use computational tools and
                    infrastructures critically engage with them? To answer this question the work of
                    Ben Schmidt proves useful. He suggests that, in order to understand algorithms,
                    it is important to grasp the transformations they bring about <ptr
                        target="#schmidt2016"/>. To demonstrate the usefulness of his proposal,
                    Schmidt discusses the debate between Annie Swafford and Matt Jockers over
                    Jockers&apos; <title rend="italic">Syuzhet</title> package that explores plots
                    through sentiment analysis. Schmidt explains, <cit><quote rend="inline">[t]he
                            default smoothing in the <title rend="italic">Syuzhet</title> package

                            continues the trajectory of its final sentence</quote></cit>. This
                    function might be useful for the study of sitcom episodes, which tend to be
                    cyclical in nature, but he finds it is less suitable for novels. Essentially,
                    Schmidt proposes an engagement with the basic logics and principles of
                    algorithms and an assessment of their suitability for the research at hand. </p>
                <p> Schmidt&apos;s suggestion is certainly more attainable for digital humanities
                    scholars than the deep engagement with the intellectual and material domains of
                    technicality proposed by Rieder. His approach facilitates critical evaluation of
                    tools and infrastructures, yet it should not be interpreted as an excuse to
                    remain entirely uneducated about the concepts and methods at stake (for a basic
                    understanding is certainly needed!). Schmidt&apos;s argument, however, needs to
                    be extended as a tool is more than an algorithm. In other words, digital
                    humanists should reflect on how a computational tool, the entirety of its stack,
                    performs transformations and impacts knowledge production which includes inquiry
                    into the methods <ptr target="#dobson2019" loc="156 footnote 9"/>. It requires
                    the posing of questions related to all the levels of abstraction. In terms of
                    critical reflectivity, this is also what I had hoped to explore with the
                    participants of the workshops. Prior to the workshops we introduced them to the
                    notion of tool criticism, discussing its definition and purpose. During the
                    workshops, when the participants tried to put it in practice, it became apparent
                    what it entailed and demands of users and where its challenges lie. </p>

                <head>Playable datasets</head>
                <p>Stefan Werning, a colleague at Utrecht University, has been organizing playable
                    data workshops for several years now (<dhq:citRef>see <ptr target="#werning2020"
                        /></dhq:citRef>). These sessions have focused on exploring small/mid-sized
                    datasets through card games. Participants play with the mechanisms and
                    parameters of a card game as a means to facilitate new ways of calculating,
                    sorting and ranking the underlying data sets (i.e. expressed in numbers,
                    colours, identities etc.). These mechanics operate similarly to a layout
                    algorithm like ForceAtlas2 in Gephi in that they need to fit the structure of
                    the data at hand, but also distinctly (re)frame the types of insights that may

                <p>The playable data workshops centred on game co-creation, which can be understood
                    as a type of critical making. As Odendaal and Zavala (2018) explain, <cit><quote
                            rend="inline">a physical game can help players make sense of something
                            abstract and hidden and that is consequently excluded from public

                        <ptr target="#odendaal-zavala2018" loc="np"/></cit>. Although existing
                    perspectives on critical (board/card) game-making are focused on games regarded
                    as products, Glas et al. developed a technique called <cit><quote rend="italic"
                            >discursive game design</quote>
                        <ptr target="#glas2020"/></cit>. Here game co-creation becomes an ongoing
                    critical conversation. Specifically, following Galey and Ruecker, the approach
                    proposes a trajectory of iterations involving a prototype. Each iteration then
                    developed represents a statement about the argument and a consideration of
                    alternative paths. </p>

                <p>The workshops drew on Nathan Altice&apos;s view of the playing card as a
                    &quot;platform&quot; According to Altice, <cit><quote rend="inline">cards are
                            platforms too. Their &apos;hardware&apos; supports particular styles,
                            systems, and subjects of play while stymying others</quote>
                        <ptr target="#altice2014"/></cit>. Altice goes on to explain how a
                    game&apos;s design is influenced by the cards&apos; five main characteristics or
                    affordances: planar, uniform, ordinal, spatial and textural. Having two opposing
                    sides allows for concealment and the uneven distribution of information among
                    players; the game operates as a surface for images, text and art. The uniformity
                    of the cards allows them to be stacked and reordered as a deck. This affordance
                    introduces elements of chance and assures fairness. Moreover, cards are ordinal,
                    allowing them to be counted, ranked, and sorted. They also occupy space, meaning
                    that the cards&apos; arrangement in a particular order can have significance.
                    Also, cards are textural, designed to be handled (e.g., shuffling, dealing,
                    cutting, etc.) and require proximity to one another. In short, Altice clarifies
                    the ways that cards impose material and mechanical restraints. As Werning puts
                    it, the playful datasets workshops treated games-as-tools. As such, observations
                    about games can be extended to thinking about how computational tools are
                    impacted by design choices.</p>
                <p>In December 2019, within the context of our teaching the research master course
                        <title rend="quotes">Data-driven tools and methods</title> for 15 students
                    within Media and Culture Studies at the Faculty of Humanities, I collaborated
                    with Werning on a Playable Datasets workshop. In the workshop we incorporated
                    tool criticism, as a reflective perspective taken up by the participants.
                    Specifically, students were instructed to explore the <emph rend="italic"
                        >mechanical</emph> and <emph rend="italic">material</emph> constraints of a
                    game we provided them and to make a series of modifications to it. For the
                    workshop Werning had developed the &apos;App Publisher&apos; game using a
                    dataset containing metadata from almost 10,000 apps from the Google Play
                            Store.<note><p>It was based on a dataset scraped and shared via Kaggle
                            by Lavanya Gupta.</p></note> Using nanDECK, he had converted a sample
                    dataset from the Google Play Store into customizable playing cards.<note><p>Cf.
                                <ptr target="http://www.nand.it/nandeck/"/></p></note> The game was
                    about the political economy of app publishing. Following the discursive game
                    design approach, the game served as a starting point for subsequent
                    modifications initiated by the students. In other words, they were asked to
                        <emph rend="italic">argue</emph> with the values and assumptions of the
                    prototype in front of them. </p>
          
            <div>
                <head> Reflections</head>
                <p>Three main observations can be made about the workshop that are relevant to the
                    aims of this paper. First, participants realized that making a game prototype
                    entails <emph rend="italic">a whole chain of tools</emph> including Excel,
                    nanDeck and Google Play API. They realized how each step in the process of
                    making a prototype had involved the making of choices and the following of
                    certain procedures. They had worked with Excel to &apos;clean&apos; the
                            dataset<note><p>In the course they had read the article by <ptr
                                target="#rawson-muñoz2019"/> about how the notion of ‘cleaning’
                            proposes an underlying correct order of data. As such, they were primed
                            to think also about the impact of this on knowledge
                        production.</p></note> and with nanDECK to design the cards. They struggled
                    with the limitations imposed by only having access to the data made available
                    through the Google Play Store API service, which restricted the scope of
                    potential games they could make. Students raised questions about the meaning of
                    the data, which they determined was multivalent (e.g., they mean something
                    different to Google than to the maker or players of the original prototype) and
                    thus dependent on the position from which one asked such questions. The workshop
                    also made explicit how data and tools were intertwined. The tools they worked
                    with determined the data that was available to scrape (Google Play Store API)
                    and how it could be manipulated (Excel and nanDECK). The game mechanisms, in
                    turn, provided ways of exploring the dataset and influenced how the data were
                    understood. In arguing with the game prototype the students experienced
                    first-hand how <cit><quote rend="inline">Specific data sets and algorithms,
                            designed to work together, cannot be easily separated and appropriated
                            for other ends</quote>
                        <ptr target="#loukissas2019" loc="104"/>.</cit></p>
                <p>Second, the workshop participants struggled in having to make and to critically
                    reflect as part of a single process. They started out rather upbeat, pinpointing
                    which assumptions about the app marketplace were embedded in the original game
                    prototype. Tasked with making their own prototype based on the existing dataset,
                    however, they struggled. They needed to learn how to work with various tools,
                    but this effort took too much time and hindered their ability to <emph
                        rend="italic">think</emph> about their process. Only afterwards, when
                    preparing their presentation, did they start to grasp the implications of their
                    decisions and how their options had been framed by their tools. The
                    session&apos;s time constraints minimized critical work in favour of results.
                    Asking and attending to questions about approach, methods, and goals would
                    certainly have slowed the process down – but, we should stress, moving slowly
                    doesn&apos;t have to be experienced as something negative. Berry and Fagerjord
                    have suggested that critical work in digital humanities projects can function as
                    a <cit><quote rend="inline"><emph rend="italic">productive</emph>
                            slowdown</quote>
                        <ptr target="#berry-fagerjord2017" loc="143"/></cit>. The experienced
                    challenge of combining critical reflection and building was, in the end,
                    primarily a limitation of how the workshop had been designed. New iterations
                    could consider more time and space for engagement. </p>
                <p>One team presented a short meme-based video made by student Daniël Everts on
                    trying to engage with and reflect on nanDECK with the help of the
                    software&apos;s 169-page manual.<note><p>The video was later posted to YouTube
                            on January 7, 2020: <ptr
                                target="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGKdNYSjTHk"/></p></note>
                    The video&apos;s humor centres on the protagonist scrolling endlessly through
                    the manual (two days later, three weeks later) on their computer. Finally, they
                    push a large Spok (sic!) button, whereupon the fictional<emph rend="italic">
                        Star Trek</emph> Vulcan enters the room and, contrary to his famous
                    hyperrationalism, repeatedly smashes the computer with his fist. Frustrations
                    over the steep learning curves of computational tools are ever more frequently
                    encountered when we are teaching practical data skills in our programme. The
                    limitations experienced here were more about the &apos;remediation&apos; of
                    analogue cards. Students implicitly reflected on the affordances of cards,
                    earlier discussed in relation to Altice, in giving form to the games they
                    developed. Werning and I also discussed whether we should have given them paper,
                    scissors, and pens to design their game. Now they worked within the parameters
                    of what was possible in code, which the students needed to learn on the fly.</p>
                <p>The frustration with the nanDECK manual points to the gap between <emph
                        rend="italic">transparency and explainability</emph>. In other words, making
                    the workings of a tool transparent does not mean that the user <emph
                        rend="italic">understands</emph> how and why it works the way it does.
                    Transparency is, for instance, often pursued by sharing the code of software.
                    Again, many people may lack to knowledge to comprehend and interpret it.
                    Explainability would entail that how the software tool works is made
                    interpretable to the user, explained in such a manner that they grasp its
                    underlying concepts and models. The workshop furthermore raised the question as
                    to <emph rend="italic">how much</emph> the students needed to understand of the
                    tool and what needed to be addressed in their discussion of the prototype they
                    had made. Rather organically, they let go of the idea that they had to
                    understand all the minute details of the tools and began focusing more on
                    &apos;transformations&apos; to address the values and assumptions of the game
                    prototypes.</p>
                <p> Lastly, the workshop&apos;s participants spent a lot of time fine-tuning their
                    prototype with an eye to its usability, concerning themselves with matters such
                    as the legibility of fonts and images on the cards. Here, they aligned with the
                    approaches of the HCI community, which stress <cit><quote rend="inline">
                            efficient completion of tasks</quote></cit> and are oriented towards
                    transparency and clarity <ptr target="#drucker2013" loc="par. 34"/>. This
                    orientation produced the impression that the game provides a window onto the
                    underlying data and presents certainty about the apps and their relations.
                    Interestingly, the participants could have used ambiguity to reflect the
                    complexity of the app marketplace. Their choices, by contrast, demonstrated the
                    appeal and persuasiveness of using simple categories, measures, and
                    representational forms. In short then, the students seemingly favoured
                    &apos;clean&apos; and unambiguous data and interfaces. This observation points
                    to the importance of consideration for one&apos;s own ontological and
                    epistemological assumptions.</p>

                <p>To further explore tool criticism thinking, I also discuss insights prompted by
                    another workshop. Cristina Cochior and Manetta Berends, both
                    researchers/designers active in the Netherlands, designed and led the <title
                        rend="quotes">bots and digital infrapuncture</title> online workshop hosted
                    in June 2020 by <title rend="italic">Datafied Society</title>, the research
                    group I coordinate at Utrecht University.<note><p>This workshop has since been
                            developed as an online module to stimulate tool criticism thinking with
                            short video contributions from Deb Verhoeven, Seda Gürses and Andreas
                            Hepp: <ptr
                                target="https://bots-as-digital-infrapunctures.dataschool.nl/"
                        /></p></note> It was attended by eight participants, primarily PhD
                    candidates, most of which had some basic programming skills. The workshop was
                    preceded by a lecture in which Deb Verhoeven discussed digital infrapuncture, a
                    concept she initially introduced in an opening keynote for the 2016 Digital
                    Humanities at Oxford Summer School (<dhq:citeRef>see <ptr
                            target="#verhoeven2016"/></dhq:citeRef>). Like Svensson, Verhoeven is
                    also concerned with the fact that most research infrastructures in DH do not
                    reflect humanistic goals. She proposed &apos;digital infrapuncture&apos; as a
                    new model for digital humanities infrastructure. The concept draws from the work
                    of Manuel de Sola-Morales on urban acupuncture and Steven Jackson&apos;s (2014)
                    essay <title rend="quotes">Rethinking Repair</title>. As Verhoeven explained, it
                    combines the word infrastructure and acupuncture and is a way of exploring how
                    small-scall infrastructure interventions can transform larger contexts. Rather
                    than building new infrastructures, digital infrapuncture looks to relieve
                    systemic pressure, which she termed &apos;hurt,&apos; through these
                    interventions. Verhoeven&apos;s work responds to scholarly conversations on the
                    need to reconsider big data humanities infrastructure in terms of capacity and
                    care <dhq:citeRef>cf. <ptr target="#nowviskie2015"/></dhq:citeRef>. In the
                    workshop presentation she proposed <emph rend="italic">agency</emph>, <emph
                        rend="italic">impact</emph>, and <emph rend="italic">power</emph> as key
                    conceptual axes on which current research infrastructures can be rethought and
                    rebuilt. These conceptual axes were considered and discussed during the group
                    discussion when identifying and tackling identified &apos;hurt&apos;.</p>
                <p>Verhoeven&apos;s introduction to digital infrapuncture was followed by a short
                    lecture by Cochior, in which she explored &apos;Bot Logic&apos; as a framework
                    through which to understand bots&apos; impact (their affective and effective
                    forces alike). The workshop&apos;s aim was to devise bots in chat protocols that
                    would intervene in the logics of the platform, creating small interventions that
                    overhaul the notion of structure itself and offer relief. The workshop consisted
                    of five parts: (a) brainstorming chat protocols, (b) identifying where it hurts,
                    (c) designing a bot to puncture and deflate stress, (d) scripting how the bot
                    acts upon the infrastructure, and finally (e) group discussion. I briefly
                    reflect on the process and on outcomes involving two teams as a means to
                    fleshing out what tool criticism actually entails in practice. </p>
                <p>The first team, a duo of which I was part, focused on critique of the neoliberal
                    university on Twitter in the Netherlands. We considered the Matthew effect of
                    accumulated advantage as well as related questions of visibility and voice in
                    academia. We thought about ways that bots could be used to amplify academics
                    with few Twitter followers, but settled on another hurt, namely that caused by
                    the hierarchies of visibility for political inaction in the Netherlands on
                    issues pertaining to the neoliberalization of universities. To amend this hurt,
                    we proposed a bot that would tweet posts with hashtags such as #WOinActie (a
                    community of employees and students in the Netherlands protesting the
                    neoliberalization of the university) directed to the Minister of Education,
                    Culture and Science. Another team picked the open-source decentralized social
                    network Mastodon and contemplated ways of countering radical voices on the
                    Mastodon timelines. They came up with a bot that supported the coverage of a
                    range of perspectives on a topic. It would identify a post&apos;s topic and
                    compare it to the entries in a categorized database, in order to then counter it
                    with an article offering a different perspective on that topic. </p>
           
            <div>
                <head>Reflections</head>
                <p>The workshop prompted a series of questions relevant to tool criticism. These
                    queries centred on issues concerning the distribution of <emph rend="italic"
                        >agency</emph> among users, bots, and platforms/infrastructures, as well as
                    with <emph rend="italic">scale</emph> and <emph rend="italic"
                        >interconnections</emph> relating to questions of impact. In terms of
                    agency, we knew that a bot tweeting at the Minister of Education, Culture and
                    Science would immediately be muted or blocked, which got us thinking about
                    whether we could actually <emph rend="italic">intervene</emph> on the platform.
                    Was this possible, or are bots merely a means to <emph rend="italic"
                        >augment</emph>? And if so, should augmentation be seen as a form of
                    intervention? It seemed that what the bot would be doing was more akin to what
                    Michel de Certeau calls tactics. As he explains, <cit><quote
                            rend="inline">[t]he space of a tactic is the space of the other. Thus it
                            must play on and with a terrain imposed on it and organized by the law
                            of a foreign power</quote>
                        <ptr target="#decerteau1984" loc="37"/></cit>. In other words, the bot would
                    simply be acting within the environment as defined by the platform&apos;s own
                    given strategies. In fact, Andreas Hepp 
                    proposes that bots are often <cit><quote rend="inline">media in media</quote> <ptr target="#hepp2020" loc="10"/></cit>. Based
                    on platforms such as Facebook and Twitter, they simply &apos;act upon&apos;
                    these platforms. In other words, they intervene <emph rend="italic">on</emph>
                    rather than <emph rend="italic">in</emph> the infrastructure. The latter
                    possibility would require access – signalling uneven power relations - which we
                    would never have. Questions were thus raised about the platform&apos;s ownership
                    and how certain affordances reflected its purpose and the level of involvement
                    of the audience.</p>
                <p>The Mastodon team, with their bot, wanted to stimulate impartial coverage of news
                    topics. They were critical of their own proposal to do so but formulated
                    valuable reflections on <emph rend="italic">scale</emph> and <emph rend="italic"
                        >interventions</emph>. Plantin et al. argue that digital technologies
                    have contributed to a &apos;platformization&apos; of infrastructures and an
                    &apos;infrastructuralization&apos; of platforms. As they explain, platforms and
                    infrastructures are both structures that underlie and support a system or
                    organization, <cit><quote rend="inline">but they differ in scale and
                            scope</quote>
                        <ptr target="#plantin2018" loc="299"/></cit> They characterize the former
                    with terms such as <cit><quote rend="inline">centrally designed and
                            controlled</quote></cit>, <cit><quote rend="inline">modular
                            frameworks</quote></cit>, and <cit><quote rend="inline">small scales and
                            scopes</quote></cit>; the latter are described by terms and phrases like
                    &apos;widely accessible&apos;, &apos;heterogeneous systems and networks&apos;,
                    and &apos;essential services&apos; <ptr target="#plantin2018"/>. Van Dijck et
                    al. explain that in North America and Europe, Alphabet-Google, Facebook,
                    Microsoft, Amazon, and Apple provide infrastructural services on which many
                    other apps and platforms are built. The services of these tech companies are
                    integrated into many websites, enabling the collection of user data across the
                    Web and various apps <ptr target="#vandijck2018" loc="15"/>. Such complex
                    interdependencies are also present in the digital infrastructures used for
                    research. These relations, and the implications of their dependencies, need to
                    be considered in the analysis of how research infrastructure shapes the research
                    process. They prompt important questions about agency, impact and power. </p>
                <p> In addition to scale, the Mastodon team reflected with the workshop participants
                    on the impact of the bot&apos;s interventions. We realized that the proposed bot
                    might actually thwart the ideals of impartial coverage by giving attention to
                    positions not supported by credible evidence. Regardless of whether or not the
                    bot could work, it was interesting to think through the larger impact it might
                    exert. Specifically, we discussed what had happened when representatives of
                    social media platforms fact-checked against Wikipedia. In these cases, the hurt
                    (i.e., the dissemination of fake news) had simply been displaced and travelled
                    elsewhere: users started falsifying Wikipedia entries to prevent posts from
                    being classified as fake. This phenomenon reminded us of the observations that
                    systems are often interrelated and that interventions in one place might extend
                    further than anticipated. Similar to our thinking about a Twitter neoliberal
                    academia bot, the question arose as to where &apos;the&apos; critical location
                    of intervention is situated and whether we had the requisite access to intervene
                    in such a space. </p>

                <head>Conclusions</head>
                <p> In this paper, two critical making–inspired workshops were used as a springboard
                    to unpack tool criticism and explore the types of reflections it brings to the
                    fore. Our tools and infrastructures, it was underscored, require critical
                    attention as they are not neutral actants in knowledge production. The workshops
                    helped make explicit the thinking that tool criticism entails and the challenges
                    that digital humanities scholars should confront when using tools and
                    infrastructures. The critical modality in which such scholars have traditionally
                    been trained should be directed towards their computational tools and
                    infrastructures in the digital humanities.</p>
                <p>
                The workshops underscored the complex
                    network of <emph rend="italic">relations</emph> between human and non-human
                    actors that come into being and enact agency. Understanding tools is also a
                    question of grasping their relation to users, and it requires the ability to
                    treat them not as objects but as <cit><quote rend="inline">a set of conditions,
                            structured relations, that allow certain behaviours, actions, readings,
                            events to occur</quote>
                        <ptr target="#drucker2013" loc="par. 31"/></cit>. This idea was the
                    conception at the centre of the workshops. Tool criticism is a continuous
                    process of thinking and acting <emph rend="italic">with</emph> tools. From
                    earlier workshops we had learned that teaching participants the basics of
                    programming would require a lot more time. In the bots and infrapuncture this
                    enactment had therefore been substituted with a scripting exercise. While this
                    was obviously not the same activity, participants were nonetheless asked to
                    &apos;run their code&apos; and consider how the bot would work in practice.
                    During the playable datasets workshop in particular we noticed that participants
                    struggled to move between making the game prototype and engaging in critical
                    reflection on their process. Although critical work takes time, there should
                    nonetheless be reflection on one&apos;s approach, methods, and the goals of the
                    tools being used. This insight supports Berry and Fagerford&apos;s call for a
                    productive slowdown in research projects. 
                    </p><p>
                    Moreover, the workshops brought to
                    light that we often use not only <emph rend="italic">a</emph> tool but rather a
                        <emph rend="italic">chain</emph> of tools. This observation underscores
                    Dobson&apos;s argument that criticism needs to be implemented throughout the
                    entirety of the research process (not just in relation to its results).
                    Alternatively, researchers may use digital infrastructure that relies on or is
                    interwoven with other tools or infrastructures. These interact with and
                    co-define the inputs and outputs. It also became apparent that a focus on the
                    transformations brought about by tools – rather than getting lost in the details
                    about how they function – was sufficient for conversations to ensue about their
                    assumptions and values. However, here the participants of both workshops were
                    somewhat at an advantage in their already having affinity with the Humanities. </p>
                <p> As seen in the workshops, tool criticism thinking raises questions about impact,
                    access and establishes relations of power and links to ownership. The tools we
                    use are often appropriated from other disciplines or taken from other
                    institutional and commercial contexts. More specifically, tool criticism prompts
                    a series of questions. Who made it? For who (not)? With what purpose? Such
                    questions are not unfamiliar as they are, for instance, grounded in traditional
                    source criticism <ptr target="#koolen2019"/>. However, enthusiasm for &apos;big
                    data&apos; research in the humanities, necessitates these are revisited and
                    updated. The workshops surfaced questions that engage explicitly with the
                    materiality of the tools that play a role in transforming the data we work with.
                    These include: What assumptions and values are established through its
                    affordances and implemented in the design? Can we examine and adapt the
                    underlying code? What is the impact of different settings and parameters
                    (materials and mechanics). What happens when we use this set of rules instead of
                    some other? How would certain decisions change how we interpret the underlying
                    data? Here the relation between tool and research also proved of importance:
                    What are my own assumptions and values?</p>
                <p> What complicates the aim of tool criticism in answering these questions is that
                    these computational tools are often easy-to-use and thus <emph rend="italic"
                        >seem</emph> transparent and neutral. Furthermore, tools are complex and
                    dynamic in that they not only consist of interlinked and dependent layers but
                    are also networked with other human and non-human actors (including underlying
                    data sets). Criticism is contingent not only on questions of <emph rend="italic"
                        >access</emph> to the &apos;black boxes&apos; (e.g., code and algorithms,
                    models and strategies) but also on the subsequent ability to make sense of it.
                    The nanDECK tutorial was a powerful reminder that transparency is not enough for
                    users to understand the stakes - its biases and assumptions - of using the tool.
                    It demands that users of tools become more informed and literate about the
                    building blocks of these technologies. </p>
                <p> While our initial definition of tool criticism (<ptr target="#vanes2018"/>
                    <ptr target="#vanes2021"/>) addressed the fact that our computational tools
                    contain values and assumptions pertaining embedded concepts and methods that
                    should be subject to scrutiny, we failed to extend our inquiry to include
                    concerns related to capacity and care. Here, books such as <title>Data
                        Feminism</title> (2020) by Catherine D&apos;Ignazio and Lauren F. Klein, with its seven principles of data feminism <ptr
                            target="#dignazio-klein2020"/>,
                    and <title>All Data Are Local</title> by Yanni Alexander Loukissas <ptr
                        target="#loukissas2019" /> might prove useful. Concerns for data justice as
                        well have been expressed in relation to automated tools by Virginia Eubanks
                        in <title rend="italic">Automating Inequality</title> (2019) <ptr
                            target="#eubanks2019"/> and Safiya Noble in <title rend="italic"
                            >Algorithms of Oppression</title> (2018) <ptr target="#noble2018"/>. By
                        incorporating such concerns into the questions we raise about our research
                        and the tools and infrastructures we employ, tool criticism becomes an
                        important component of digital <emph rend="italic">humanities</emph>
                        scholarship.
                        </p>
                <p>Engaging in tool criticism is, as the participants of these
                        critical making-inspired workshops experienced, no simple task. It needs to
                        be part and parcel of the research process, necessitates a slowing down and
                        an eagerness to learn about the basic principles of the tool. For humanities
                        scholars in particular, this sort of criticism requires discussions not just
                        about methodology but also about ethics and care. New research tools and
                        infrastructures for the humanities should consider questions of access and
                        agency in local contexts. Workshops of the sort discussed here are a modest
                        step to help raise awareness of the fact that computational tools are not
                        neutral and that a lot of interpretive acts are involved in working with
                        them. Moreover, the insights and reflections generated in these workshops
                        can help formulate the type of questions that we need to be asking about
                        computational tools in digital humanities research and beyond and surface
                        issues that we need to collectively address.
