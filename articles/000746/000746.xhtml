                  <p>Digitization has traditionally been viewed as a method of preservation and accessibility
                     facilitation. This definition has resulted in 
                     a sense that objectives of sustainability are somehow built into the process of digitization,
                     allowing institutions to not thoroughly 
                     or systematically consider what digitization and digitized collections are, how to
                     ensure access over time, and how these groupings 
                     of digital files relate to larger collection management. This paper redefines digitization
                     as part of collections development, a 
                     broader set of processes with a long history within archival institutions. This definition
                     allows for the use of 
                     Michel-Rolph Trouillot's framework for understanding historical production, placing digitization within
                     an ongoing 
                     process that shapes access to and thus alters the historical record. The paper calls
                     for a queering of the understanding of archival 
                     sustainability to enable the use of paradata in the development of digital archival
                     description practices. This approach demands an 
                     understanding of archive collections as shifting and overlapping processes that interact
                     with one another to form the malleable 
                     boundaries of what a cultural heritage institution calls its Archives.

                  <div class="ptext" id="p1">Nicholson Baker's <cite class="title italic">Double Fold</cite>, a popular history decrying libraries' destruction of physical 
                     historical newspapers in favor of technified copies, felt like a lone digitization
                     sceptic's jeremiad when it was published in 2002. Then, 
                     digitization was seen as a solution for the physical archive's vulnerability, a way
                     of tearing down the institutional silos that 
                     circumscribe research, and a method of saving individual institutions loads of money.
                     There were socio-political and economic reasons for 
                     this initial positivism. Those working at feminist cultural heritage institutions
                     were perhaps particularly prone to see digitization as a 
                     low-cost opportunity to integrate women and gender issues into the broad sweep of
                     historical memory 
                     [<a class="ref" href="#withers_2015">Withers 2015</a>, 136]. However, as a raft of newer studies have demonstrated, the fates of the physical
                     archive and the 
                     digital archive are interwoven [<a class="ref" href="#pierce_2021">Pierce 2021</a>], digital materials are interpretations of complex physical materials, not 
                     simple copies [<a class="ref" href="#bj%C3%B6rk_2015">Björk 2015</a>], and digital documents and systems are far from invulnerable to deterioration and
                     obsolescence 
                     [<a class="ref" href="#decker_2020">Decker 2020</a>].

                  <div class="ptext" id="p2">There is still little research on digital collection lifecycle(s) that often include
                     rounds of digitization, database construction and 
                     upkeep, metadata application and restructuring, and material and database decay and
                     retirement. Cultural heritage institutions must 
                     understand and plan for these lifecycles if they want to construct sustainable digital
                     and physical collections, especially because the 
                     research grants that often fund the construction of databases rarely budget for digital
                     archive maintenance and thus do not require a full 
                     description of how this maintenance will occur [<a class="ref" href="#edmond_morselli_2020">Edmond and Morselli 2020</a>]. Further, it is difficult to plan for emerging 
                     requirements. Examples abound, from institutions that must retroactively assess their
                     digitized collections to align them with the FAIR 
                     principles, to current drives to translate controlled vocabularies into linked data.
                     What if digitization is a multiplication rather than 
                     a mitigation of the archive's or archivists' habitual problems with sustainability?
                     </div>

                  <div class="ptext" id="p3">This article will address the early 2000s planning for and construction of the image
                     database at KvinnSam, the National 
                     Resource Library for Gender Research in Sweden, as well as the subsequent reassessments and potential futures of the 
                     database. The main question to be answered is: How can sustainability for digitized
                     archival collections be defined if we understand 
                     archival collections as ongoing processes rather than static assemblages of documents?
                     In order to answer this question, the article 
                     utilizes Michel-Rolph Trouillot's framework for the construction of history to periodize and analyze KvinnSam's 
                     photographic database as process: 
                     <blockquote>
                        <p>Silences enter the process of historical production at four crucial moments: the 
                           moment of fact creation (the making of sources); the moment of fact assembly (the
                           making of archives); the moment of fact retrieval (the 
                           making of narratives); and the moment of retrospective significance (the making of
                           history in the final instance). 
                           [<a class="ref" href="#trouillot_2015">Trouillot 2015</a>, 26]</p>
                     </blockquote>KvinnSam initially digitized around 1,000 photographs, a fraction of its 
                     photographic archival material. Since then, academic research, digitization techniques,
                     and KvinnSam itself have developed in 
                     different directions, rendering the selection, description, and technical infrastructure
                     underlying the image database less sustainable. 
                     Understanding turning points in this process and planning for material collection
                     and migration practices is critical to the development 
                     of long-term sustainable practices.

                  <div class="ptext" id="p4">Research on the digitization of photographs is particularly useful in uncovering and
                     thinking critically about issues with digitization 
                     and sustainability. As recent scholarship has established, visual representations
                     played an outsized role on the history and trajectory of 
                     many historical developments, including the campaign for women's suffrage [<a class="ref" href="#lange_2020">Lange 2020</a>], a campaign that has laid the basis 
                     for many of KvinnSam's most used archival collections. Visual materials are also very popular on the web,
                     increasing the 
                     chances that a wider public learns about topics like suffrage and becomes interested
                     in the physical archive from whence these images come 
                     [<a class="ref" href="#lesy_2020">Lesy 2020</a>] [<a class="ref" href="#vestberg_2013">Vestberg 2013</a>]. Further, institutions far more well-resourced than KvinnSam have 
                     focused on photographs as long neglected, chronically under-documented, often disorganized
                     or subject to unique organization logics, and 
                     particularly vulnerable to physical deterioration — all issues that digitization can
                     alleviate [<a class="ref" href="#arnold_et_al_2017">Arnold et al. 2017</a>].

                  <div class="ptext" id="p5">Given all of these digitization positives, it is not strange that many institutions
                     including KvinnSam initially prioritized 
                     digitization of photographic material. Here, it is worth thinking about the history
                     of digitization and its role in the preservation of 
                     materials. Photographs are sensitive to light, to moisture, to fingertips, to use.
                     They are constantly changing within the archives, 
                     losing definition and color, interacting chemically with the materials around them
                     if they have not been stored individually in acid-free 
                     folders. Photographs embody the continuous change that characterizes archives, especially
                     feminist and queer archives, even as 
                     “the archives” have become a metaphor for and symbol of stable, stagnant documentation [<a class="ref" href="#mckinney_2020">McKinney 2020</a>, 191-193].

                  <div class="ptext" id="p6">Digitization is not necessarily a tool that photographic scholars would include in
                     sustainable photo preservation practices. The 
                     materiality of photography is considered central to some scholars, including photography
                     archive theorist Joanna Sassoon; for 
                     these scholars, digitization strips these materials of their functional meaning [<a class="ref" href="#sassoon_2004">Sassoon 2004</a>, 210]. Photographs also 
                     present unique problems. Katheryn Earle's analysis of a fashion photo digitization project highlights disorganization, the
                     
                     lack of labels, and the need to re-group photographs by theme and create contextual
                     information that facilitates interpretation of these 
                     materials [<a class="ref" href="#earle_2017">Earle 2017</a>, 51]. In other words, digitization is potentially reductive and most certainly highly
                     resource 
                     intensive.

                  <div class="ptext" id="p7">This is an area in need of a more nuanced understanding of sustainable preservation,
                     which can provide ground for best practices 
                     development for local institutions with varying resources and collections. There is
                     little consensus about how to define 
                     “sustainability” within the context of digital humanities projects [<a class="ref" href="#edmond_morselli_2020">Edmond and Morselli 2020</a>]. This is not surprising; 
                     there is little consensus about how to define sustainability more generally, though
                     the term is used regularly within a variety of 
                     institutional contexts. Further, what counts as “digital humanities” infrastructure is constantly evolving, resulting in the baking 
                     in of digital competencies into cultural heritage jobs [<a class="ref" href="#smiley_2019">Smiley 2019</a>]. As a result, papers like Alex Poole's 
                     which examines the “conceptual ecology of digital humanities” use the term 
                     “sustainability” extensively but in a multitude of disparate and somewhat unconnected ways.

                     heritage, treating documents as singular,

                     is little discussion of sustainability and collections, 
                     though digitization of select materials implies the creation of entirely new digital
                     contexts — archives, perhaps? — for documents. In 
                     general, scholars like Wolfgang Ernst contrast digital collections with physical collections, depicting the former as dynamic
                     
                     and the latter as static [<a class="ref" href="#ernst_2013">Ernst 2013</a>]. Yet some scholarship has demonstrated that digitization shifts and changes the 
                     physical archive, sometimes resulting in better description or different organization
                     [<a class="ref" href="#arnold_et_al_2017">Arnold et al. 2017</a>], or, conversely, 
                     in the destruction of physical materials [<a class="ref" href="#baker_2002">Baker 2002</a>]. Further, digitization can potentially produce vast quantities of 
                     metadata that are more reusable and sustainable than the digital files themselves

                     Numerous scholars have demonstrated that digital projects about and by women and other

                     In the context of archives, discussions of sustainability have centered on democratizing
                     access and providing opportunities for 
                     participation in the construction and content of archives. Yet the work of the Lesbian Herstory Archives illustrates the ways 
                     in which histories of description constitute representation and are imperiled as digitization
                     demands “clean” data

                     This literature, in its emphasis on “good enough” approaches, also reframes sustainability as an insufficient end goal in and of  
                     itself. The real goal is sustainable access for communities whose need for information

                        — as a response to both 
                        user demand and general pressures within the cultural heritage sector that related
                        digitization to an institution's status as 
                        up-to-date. The earliest project focused on digitization of historic women's newspapers,
                        due to popular demand and the declining physical 
                        quality of these materials. Images were chosen as the second digitization project,
                        for these same reasons. Digitization would also solve 
                        issues of findability for photographic materials. Librarians would no longer have
                        to search for images within the physical 
                        KvinnSam collections, where photographs were (and still are) under-described and thus difficult
                        to find 
                        [<a class="ref" href="#kvinnsam_2001a">KvinnSam 2001a</a>]. In this sense, the library and archives followed the “mass digitization” 
                        imperative described by Thylstrup, an imperative that created a sense that KvinnSam needed to catch up with 
                        other institutions [<a class="ref" href="#thylstrup_2018">Thylstrup 2018</a>]. KvinnSam librarians thus chose materials that had received heavy use or 
                        were related to regularly researched topics, questions, and people [<a class="ref" href="#backlund_sjodahl_2001">Backlund and Sjödahl 2001</a>].

                        can be read as both the creation of sources and 
                        fact assembly according to Trouillot's model. These sets of early choices made some materials very easily accessible,
                        
                        thereby rendering less accessible materials almost invisible. KvinnSam's digitized periodicals are far from complete or even 
                        representative of its physical collection of periodicals. Further, this initial stage
                        of digitization established a set of themes and 
                        material types that would continue to be prioritized in the following decades. These
                        unwritten rules for what was important enough to 
                        digitize border on the third stage of Trouillot's framework, the creation of narratives. And crucially, the moment of fact 
                        creation was built upon past use, or historiography — a looping of the process of
                        historical creation for which Troillot 
                        does not really account. This looping, the consistent impact of historiography on
                        digitization practices, is poorly accounted for in 
                        studies of digitization, representation, and access.

                        options seemed too expensive, not suited to 
                        photographic documents, not suited to KvinnSam's subject word indexing system, or difficult to upgrade 
                        [<a class="ref" href="#kvinnsam_2001f">KvinnSam 2001f</a>]. Further, the database was constructed both beside and as an integrated part of themed
                        historical portals 
                        designed to present basic women's history grounded in the history contained within
                        KvinnSam's archival collections. The 
                        interwoven nature of these digital projects would then influence the trajectory of
                        the image database.

                        within the digital infrastructure of a chronically 
                        underfunded institution. However, housing the database also meant that KvinnSam clearly owned their digitized materials,

                        use (and re-use) of collections. The approach taken by KvinnSam followed the trend
                        of digitizing "canon" materials that has characterized digitization since its inception,
                        basing definitions of the canon in past women’s history research. Indeed, researcher
                        use characterizes the whole of KvinnSam’s current website, formalized in the institution’s
                        provision of historical portals that centered a research generation’s focus on the
                        "waves" of feminist activism - a structuring device that is currently viewed as problematic
                        and limiting as well as generative (Reger 2017). While boxing in digitization decisions,
                        a ready-made portal also meant that these materials could be linked to a preexisting
                        historical context, in a sense taking the place of a finding aid in terms of situating
                        the materials within historical processes. What is missing from Trouillot’s story
                        is perhaps the larger national superstructures that box in the behavior of cultural
                        heritage institutions. The initial count of 2,000 digitizable images shrank to around
                        1,000 by the time the database was fully realized, largely due to a questions of ownership
                        and copyright. The construction of digital materials and a database occurred outside
                        of KvinnSam, however.</div>

                        to begin using Alvin<a class="noteRef" href="#d4e589">[4]</a>, a multi-institutional database for digital and digitized cultural heritage materials,
                        which went live in the mid-2010s. The platform was developed and is maintained by
                        software engineers at Uppsala University. Adoption of Alvin represents a turning point.
                        Because Alvin was seen as more modern, more flexible, and, crucially, less resource
                        intensive, KvinnSam personnel decided to upload all digitized materials there. But
                        the materials from the image database mean something different in Alvin, where they
                        intermingle with digitized material and finding aids for archives from a variety of
                        Swedish cultural heritage institutions. The digitized photographs from the database
                        can no longer be read together - neither search functionality in Alvin nor metadata
                        facilitates finding the initial digitized photo collection as a group.</div>

                     <div class="ptext" id="p31">The shift to Alvin instigated a period of stagnancy for the image database. For the
                        last several years, KvinnSam has updated materials in Alvin instead of attending to
                        the bespoke database. This shift in attention resulted from a long wait for a new
                        interface and website that will not include the database, largely for two reasons:
                        (1) it is presumed that the database cannot be cleanly integrated into a new website
                        and (2) staff have not updated material and metadata there regularly, increasing the
                        amount of work that would be needed to move and integrate the database. In the meantime,
                        materials are occasionally removed from the database or Alvin, due to copyright concerns.
                        Meanwhile new digitized materials are uploaded in Alvin rather than in the photography
                        database. In both cases, subject words have not been updated, even if the subject
                        word list has undergone change. Because KvinnSam has created archives without recognizing
                        that it has created archives, there is no clear contextual information that can hold
                        the archive together and assist with its migration.</div>
                     
                     <div class="counter"><a href="#p32">32</a></div>
                     <div class="ptext" id="p32">Migration has also led to some problems with archival representation. As noted, Alvin
                        contains both archival finding aids – descriptions of entire archival collections
                        that is often dozens of pages long and contain provenance information, chronological
                        data, and description of the items in each physical box – and individual digitized
                        items from these collections. This diversity may eventually allow for interlinking
                        that will provide needed archival context for digitized materials. But this interlinking
                        is not yet fully developed. Further, many institutions, KvinnSam included, upload
                        their finding aids as attached documents, which are not searchable via the Alvin search
                        function. This hinders future development of platform design that provides users with
                        clear information about where digitized materials come from and how representative
                        they are of much larger physical archives. Last, Alvin covers multiple institutions,
                        all of which use the platform differently. This broader diversity means that the diversity
                        of description within KvinnSam’s own collections, produced through multiple generations
                        of description, digitization, and platforming, are not as visible as they might otherwise
                        be.</div>

                     <div class="ptext" id="p33">The shift to Alvin is a turning point for another reason - using the platform clarified
                        issues with KvinnSam’s use of and responsibility for archival data and metadata, a
                        responsibility that was assumed with library materials but never really implemented
                        for archival collections. Currently, KvinnSam staff are focused on metadata for archives
                        - both finding aids and digitized/born digital materials - as a central plank in the
                        creation of future archival findability. A sustainable filing and preservation strategy
                        is now seen as a fundamental building block for the creation of a more sustainable
                        photograph database. The compilation of materials will also allow KvinnSam personnel
                        to establish which tags will be more useful in day-to-day image work, which includes
                        planning for future digitization and the creation of digital exhibitions that showcase
                        KvinnSam materials, competencies, and services. The creation of this alternate system
                        of images and metadata is designed to supplement rather than erase or displace the
                        previous classificatory system applied to individual images, which reflects the history
                        of terminological shifts within Swedish women’s and gender research (for descriptions
                        of a similar approach at the Lesbian Herstory Archives, see McKinney 2020).</div>

                     <div class="ptext" id="p34">In addition, new digitization is planned but organized very differently than this
                        first push. Instead, KvinnSam is working in a more project-based way that is less
                        concerned with copyright and more concerned with sustainable practices that have been
                        built up since construction of the initial image database. These practices include
                        a focus on (1) usability in multiple digital environments (for a new webpage, in digital
                        exhibitions, etc.); (2) to create new access points for underused collections and
                        materials; and (3) more focus on physical material sustainability, with the potential
                        for more focus on damaged, fragile, and/or underdescribed materials. It is likely
                        that the current image database will be retired when KvinnSam’s new webpage goes live,
                        with its contents republished in various locations in the new website, embedding the
                        legacy of the database in the digital infrastructure of KvinnSam while at the same

                     a “digital imperative,” or assumption “that digitization is a necessary, inherently
                     progressive process archives must carry out to stay relevant and preserve their holdings”
                     (p. 159). What KvinnSam’s experience with its image database demonstrates is that
                     reliance on digital infrastructures – whether in-house or outsourced – places materials
                     at risk of disappearing or being rendered unusable due to poor organizational practices.
                     Yet this risk was only visible at the turning point when materials were moved between
                     platforms. Platforms multiply the number of organizational and technical skills required
                     by an institution, rather than relieving librarians and archivists of work. Investment
                     in expensive platforms also refocuses work towards digitized materials. And digital
                     access renders the role and work of archivists invisible to researchers.</div>

                     and their sustainability while (often temporarily) extending accessibility of some
                     documents. Digitization makes it clear that Trouillot’s framework is not linear, and
                     that the making of narratives and history affect already constructed sources and archives,
                     altering them and their accessibility and use over time. In KvinnSam’s case, sustainability
                     is more profitably linked to the construction and use of paradata in the development
                     of digital archival description practices. Taking the role of history-making into
                     account, sustainability should be linked more to transparency and a willingness to
                     see digitized materials not as copies but as extensions of physical collections, affected
                     by conditions of provenance and collection development.</div>

                     – not just digitized items – is crucial for cultural heritage institutions and archival
                     researchers. Good, structured organizational practices are dependent on resources,
                     broadly defined. The multiple definitions of sustainability within digital humanities
                     literature confuse a point – that financial, infrastructural, and intellectual aspects
                     of institutional health are intertwined. Institutions and centers with unstable or
                     chronically limited funding are most at risk for landing in this kind of disorganization.
                     During many years with a smaller staff, KvinnSam did not work particularly actively
                     with its archival holdings. Maintenance of digital materials is built on the maintenance
                     of physical archival resources – one cannot happen without the other (Arnold, Maples,
                     Tilton &amp; Wexler 2017). Arguments that digitization will result in preservation of
                     physical materials are simplistic at best and misleading at worst. Certainly, digitization
                     can be integrated into a larger preservation strategy, but digitization is not de
                     facto preservation. Sustainable practices must view digital and physical collections
                     and practices as a whole.</div>

                     institution must define precisely what it is sustaining while also remaining attuned
                     to the fact that all archives have lifecycles. Digitization is a process that creates
                     collections somewhere in-between new and old, physical and digital – these are collections
                     characterized by their contingency (Pierce 2021). What the periodization of KvinnSam’s
                     image database demonstrates is the centrality of platforms in determining what materials
                     are digitized, how they are digitized, and what is considered appropriate description.
                     As Johanna Drucker (2014) has argued, “Most information visualizations are acts of
                     interpretation masquerading as presentation” (p. 10). Institutions need to acknowledge
                     this structuring when they start using new platforms. Each new platform or database
                     means new collection development, because archival materials are defined by their
                     interrelationships and larger contexts (Bak 2012). Each new platform also means shared
                     responsibility and a reliance on collaboration. This sounds good, and such collective
                     work can be highly beneficial. But “the whole” becomes very difficult to define in
                     these instances. What is a collection in digital environments? When and how are the
                     stages of digitization affecting the production of history? How can the ongoing process
                     of digital collection development be made visible to researchers?</div>

                  <div class="ptext" id="p39">With digitization, archivists, researchers, and “traditional” archives run the risk
                     of losing a sense of what an archive actually is and where the boundaries of their
                     own collections are. The rhetoric and logics of digitization and digital tools push
                     archivists towards a conflation of “information management” with archiving (Thylstrup
                     2018). This is not necessarily a problem, as DM Withers (2015) notes; how we understand
                     and define an archive must and should shift as the technologies of its organization
                     and description change. But change is hard and often viewed as a disruption of rather
                     than development in archival practices. The splitting of digitization and collection
                     management work between archival and IT departments means that collection custody
                     is divided, resulting in a porous archival boundary. The multiplication of platforms
                     and the transfer of digitized materials from across digital spaces upsets long held
                     practices concerning the multiplicity of documents within collections (institutions
                     often define a maximum number of copies to be kept) and collection-based description

                     project, rather than a central part of collections development. This perspective places
                     digitized collections outside the process of archiving and history-making that defines
                     physical collections management. The sense of archival abundance that many members
                     of the public, academics, and cultural heritage institutions have obscures the fact
                     that most archival documents are not and will never be online, as well as overlooking
                     the issue of representation and continuous maintenance that characterize all collections,
                     including digital ones. Platform multiplication contributes to the multiplication
                     of a few digitized documents, making them seem more multitudinous than they are and
                     veiling them with an aura of representativeness (Odumosu 2020). Digitization choices
                     matter and need to be visible; these choices are integral to the sustainability of
                     collections housed within databases, which in turn has repercussions for the sustainability
                     of the larger project of history-making. Each new platform is a new “moment of fact
                     assembly” in the words of Trouillot (2015), creating new silences in the historical
                     record.</div>

                     collections both at individual institutions and within a broader Archive. The image

                     moments, are not singular but can recur over time, as sources are made and unmade,
                     collections constructed and then deconstructed. Digital materials support arguments
                     that archives are never stable, that archives might best be viewed as processes and
                     sets of ever-shifting relationships (Lee 2012; Pierce 2021). Archivists shuffle and
                     relabel and add materials, documents deteriorate or are rendered unusable, new accessions

                     The migration of collections from platform to platform makes this need clear. In the
                     case of KvinnSam, the initial collection context did not travel with the collection
                     of photographs. When the new website for KvinnSam is built, the suffrage portal that
                     provided historical context for the collection will disappear along with the original
                     database, leaving a set of items with historical archival connections – materials
                     from the only women’s and gender library and archives institution in Scandinavia –
                     dispersed in Alvin. Further, information about selection and a summary of the collection
                     will disappear, leaving materials unmoored from the provenance information that gives
                     these documents their archival weight, ensures the archival transparency central to
                     feminist archivy, and offers entryways into Swedish women’s and gender history.</div>

                     archival body,” a queering of the Archive suggested by Jamie Ann Lee. Accepting instability
                     as a natural part of collections with shifting identities – identities that now exist
                     across the physical/digital divide – requires new methods that allow for descriptive
                     multiplicity. Lee (2017) phrases this as a need to “understand and represent the dynamic
                     (un)becomings” embedded in archival collections (p. 1). Lee’s Queer/ed Archival Methodology
                     centers archives as multitudinous processes. In the case of KvinnSam, an archiving
                     of both the database and portals that provided context for database materials must
                     be considered together, as processes that are part of both the history of Swedish
                     women’s history and the history of KvinnSam. Description of these collection-processes

                     "authenticity" of digitized documents (for this debate, see Mak 2012). Archival finding
                     aids are defined by the Society of American Archivists (n.d.) as "a description that
                     typically consists of contextual and structural information about an archival resource"
                     that establishes the material’s provenance and historical authenticity. Scholarship

                     level of description. Documentation of broken links and removal of documents due to
                     rights issues, item additions, and the capture and archiving of digital environments
                     is important; if digitized documents are to be used as historical evidence, their

                     these silences into their understanding of historical evidence and process. At the
                     same time, these collections would also offer opportunities to digitize underdescribed

                     materials that exist, hidden, in the corners of archives. Further, collections-level
                     description provides opportunities for integrating archival and researcher interpretations

                     silences that are created in the process of building archives are central to history-making.
                     Digitized collections actively resist silences, which leads researchers to assume
                     that online databases offer a kind of completeness that they most often do not. These

                     focuses just as much on "collection" as "digitized." This approach fits with scholarship
                     on archiving photographs and the preservation of photographic meaning as multitudinous
                     and contextual. Joan Schwartz (1995) argues, in this vein, that if a photograph’s
                     meaning is, as many have argued, grounded in context, “each use must be understood
                     as distinct, though sometimes interrelated” interpreting the existence of a photograph
                     across institutions as not “duplication” or “waste” but “as the logical outcome of
                     the appropriation and re-appropriation of a photograph with fixed content and physical
                     configuration into different functional contexts with the attendant transformation
                     of a single image into multiple documents” (p. 52). Questions of sustainability in
                     this context must understand collections development as non-neutral and constitutive
                     of histories via processes of selection and collection construction, maintenance,
                     and even decay. Critical to this model of digitized archival sustainability is a continual

                     the digital imperative. These circumstances demonstrate the non-linear, iterative

                     of trends, see Ries &amp; Palkó 2019). Yet these institutions are sitting on digital archives
                     where experimentation can take place. By going through KvinnSam’s own born-digital
                     archives, staff can develop a policy and set of sustainable practices for other born
                     digital archives. The treatment of born-digital archives as requiring fundamentally
                     different practices that will need independent development contributes to the sense
                     that the physical archive is stable. Digitized archival collections offer an in-betweenness
                     that may be highly generative.</div>

                  <div class="ptext" id="p51">Discussions of sustainability in archives have centered on participatory and democratic
                     processes that integrate publics into the process of description (Jochumsen, Johnston
                     &amp; Vårheim 2023). But there is little consideration of what these processes actually
                     mean across kinds of archival institutions and how technological know-how factors
                     into these methods of opening up archives. Cait McKinney (2020) argues that “technologies
                     evolve along with understandings of gender and sexuality” (p. 191). Through the lens
                     of queer/ed archives, practitioners might understand digitized collections as fluid
                     archival bodies, grounded in particular physical historical contexts but also open
                     to “ongoing worldmaking” (Lee 2017) that may not yet be visible to archivists. Within
                     this framework, it might be easier to see how the shifting of materials and descriptions
                     of these materials from one digital environment to another is part of the process
                     of historical production. This movement constitutes a rhythm that defines archives.
                     Sustainability of digitized collections depends on understanding their unmoored nature
                     and role in history-making and building this indeterminateness into collections development
                     and description from the beginning.</div>
