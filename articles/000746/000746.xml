                  <p>Rachel Pierce has a PhD in gender and women's history and an MLIS in library and information science. Her research 
                     interests are grounded in a background as a women's and gender historian. She is also interested in photography, 
                     digitalization, and archives. These interests have led to research on the development of feminism within political 
                     institutions, gendered political journalism during the Cold War, and how gender, sex, sexuality, race, and class can 
                     be expressed in descriptive metadata for cultural heritage materials. She has also studied the relationships between 
                     digital and physical iterations of archives, with a focus on how classification and description systems do or do not 
                     articulate the relations between physical and digital materials and collections.

         <dhq:abstract>
           <p>Digitization has traditionally been viewed as a method of preservation and accessibility facilitation. This definition has resulted in 
              a sense that objectives of sustainability are somehow built into the process of digitization, allowing institutions to not thoroughly 
              or systematically consider what digitization and digitized collections are, how to ensure access over time, and how these groupings 
              of digital files relate to larger collection management. This paper redefines digitization as part of collections development, a 
              broader set of processes with a long history within archival institutions. This definition allows for the use of 
              <name>Michel-Rolph Trouillot</name>'s framework for understanding historical production, placing digitization within an ongoing 
              process that shapes access to and thus alters the historical record. The paper calls for a queering of the understanding of archival 
              sustainability to enable the use of paradata in the development of digital archival description practices. This approach demands an 
              understanding of archive collections as shifting and overlapping processes that interact with one another to form the malleable 
              boundaries of what a cultural heritage institution calls its Archives.

            <p>This articles demonstrates that the sustainability of digitized collections depends on understanding their unmoored nature 
               and role in history-making, meaning that their indeterminateness should thus be built into collections development and 
               description from the beginning.

          <head>Introduction: Digitization and the Preservation of Women’s and Gender Archives?</head>
            <p>A popular history decrying libraries' destruction of physical historical newspapers in favor of technified copies, <name>Nicholson 
               Baker</name>'s <title rend="italic">Double Fold</title> felt like a lone digitization sceptic's jeremiad when it was published in 2002.  
               Then, digitization was seen as a solution for the physical archive's vulnerability, a way of tearing down the institutional silos that 
               circumscribe research, and a method of saving individual institutions loads of money. There were socio-political and economic reasons for 
               this initial positivism. Those working at feminist cultural heritage institutions were perhaps particularly prone to see digitization as a 
               low-cost opportunity to integrate women and gender issues into the broad sweep of historical memory 
               <ptr target="#withers_2015" loc="136"/>. However, as a raft of newer studies have demonstrated, the fates of the physical archive and the 
               digital archive are interwoven <ptr target="#pierce_2021"/>, digital materials are interpretations of complex physical materials, not 
               simple copies <ptr target="#björk_2015"/>, and digital documents and systems are far from invulnerable to deterioration and obsolescence 
               <ptr target="#decker_2020"/>.
            </p>
            <p>There is still little research on digital collection lifecycle(s) that often include rounds of digitization, database construction and 
               upkeep, metadata application and restructuring, and material and database decay and retirement. Cultural heritage institutions must 
               understand and plan for these lifecycles if they want to construct sustainable digital and physical collections, especially because the 
               research grants that often fund the construction of databases rarely budget for digital archive maintenance and thus do not require a full 
               description of how this maintenance will occur <ptr target="#edmond_morselli_2020"/>. Further, it is difficult to plan for emerging 
               requirements. Examples abound, from institutions that must retroactively assess their digitized collections to align them with the FAIR 
               principles, to current drives to translate controlled vocabularies into linked data. What if digitization is a multiplication rather than 
               a mitigation of the archive's or archivists' habitual problems with sustainability?
            </p>
            <p>This article will address the early 2000s planning for and construction of the image database at <name>KvinnSam</name>, the <name>National 
               Resource Library for Gender Research</name> in <name>Sweden</name>, as well as the subsequent reassessments and potential futures of the 
               database. The main question to be answered is: How can sustainability for digitized archival collections be defined if we understand 
               archival collections as ongoing processes rather than static assemblages of documents? In order to answer this question, the article 
               utilizes <name>Michel-Rolph Trouillot</name>'s framework for the construction of history to periodize and analyze <name>KvinnSam</name>'s 
               photographic database as process: <quote rend="block">Silences enter the process of historical production at four crucial moments: the 
               moment of fact creation (the making of sources); the moment of fact assembly (the making of archives); the moment of fact retrieval (the 
               making of narratives); and the moment of retrospective significance (the making of history in the final instance). 
               <ptr target="#trouillot_2015" loc="26"/></quote><name>KvinnSam</name> initially digitized around 1,000 photographs, a fraction of its 
               photographic archival material. Since then, academic research, digitization techniques, and <name>KvinnSam</name> itself have developed in 
               different directions, rendering the selection, description, and technical infrastructure underlying the image database less sustainable. 
               Understanding turning points in this process and planning for material collection and migration practices is critical to the development 
               of long-term sustainable practices.

          <head>Literature Review: <quote rend="inline">Recovery Projects</quote>, Photography, and Sustainability</head>
            <p>Research on the digitization of photographs is particularly useful in uncovering and thinking critically about issues with digitization 
              and sustainability. As recent scholarship has established, visual representations played an outsized role on the history and trajectory of 
              many historical developments, including the campaign for women's suffrage <ptr target="#lange_2020"/>, a campaign that has laid the basis 
              for many of <name>KvinnSam</name>'s most used archival collections. Visual materials are also very popular on the web, increasing the 
              chances that a wider public learns about topics like suffrage and becomes interested in the physical archive from whence these images come 
              <ptr target="#lesy_2020"/> <ptr target="#vestberg_2013"/>. Further, institutions far more well-resourced than <name>KvinnSam</name> have 
              focused on photographs as long neglected, chronically under-documented, often disorganized or subject to unique organization logics, and 
              particularly vulnerable to physical deterioration — all issues that digitization can alleviate <ptr target="#arnold_et_al_2017"/>.
            </p>
            <p>Given all of these digitization positives, it is not strange that many institutions including <name>KvinnSam</name> initially prioritized 
               digitization of photographic material. Here, it is worth thinking about the history of digitization and its role in the preservation of 
               materials. Photographs are sensitive to light, to moisture, to fingertips, to use. They are constantly changing within the archives, 
               losing definition and color, interacting chemically with the materials around them if they have not been stored individually in acid-free 
               folders. Photographs embody the continuous change that characterizes archives, especially feminist and queer archives, even as 
               <q>the archives</q> have become a metaphor for and symbol of stable, stagnant documentation <ptr target="#mckinney_2020" loc="191–193"/>.
            </p>
            <p>Digitization is not necessarily a tool that photographic scholars would include in sustainable photo preservation practices. The 
               materiality of photography is considered central to some scholars, including photography archive theorist <name>Joanna Sassoon</name>; for 
               these scholars, digitization strips these materials of their functional meaning <ptr target="#sassoon_2004" loc="210"/>. Photographs also 
               present unique problems. <name>Katheryn Earle</name>'s analysis of a fashion photo digitization project highlights disorganization, the 
               lack of labels, and the need to re-group photographs by theme and create contextual information that facilitates interpretation of these 
               materials <ptr target="#earle_2017" loc="51"/>. In other words, digitization is potentially reductive and most certainly highly resource 
               intensive.
            </p>
            <p>This is an area in need of a more nuanced understanding of sustainable preservation, which can provide ground for best practices 
               development for local institutions with varying resources and collections. There is little consensus about how to define 
               <q>sustainability</q> within the context of digital humanities projects <ptr target="#edmond_morselli_2020"/>. This is not surprising; 
               there is little consensus about how to define sustainability more generally, though the term is used regularly within a variety of 
               institutional contexts. Further, what counts as <q>digital humanities</q> infrastructure is constantly evolving, resulting in the baking 
               in of digital competencies into cultural heritage jobs <ptr target="#smiley_2019"/>. As a result, papers like <name>Alex Poole</name>'s 
               examine the <quote rend="inline">conceptual ecology of digital humanities</quote> and use the term 
               <quote rend="inline">sustainability</quote> extensively but in a multitude of disparate and potentially conflicting ways.
            </p>
            <p>Scholarly discussions of digitization and material sustainability individualize cultural heritage, treating documents as singular, 
               remixable items whose use in digital environments can replace physical use. There is little discussion of sustainability and collections, 
               though digitization of select materials implies the creation of entirely new digital contexts — archives, perhaps? — for documents. In 
               general, scholars like <name>Wolfgang Ernst</name> contrast digital collections with physical collections, depicting the former as dynamic 
               and the latter as static <ptr target="#ernst_2013"/>. Yet some scholarship has demonstrated that digitization shifts and changes the 
               physical archive, sometimes resulting in better description or different organization <ptr target="#arnold_et_al_2017"/>, or, conversely, 
               in the destruction of physical materials <ptr target="#baker_2002"/>. Further, digitization can potentially produce vast quantities of 
               metadata that are more reusable and sustainable than the digital files themselves <ptr target="#scheltjens_2023"/>.
            </p>
            <p>Financial sustainability is often discussed separately from other kinds of project sustainability. However, these questions are 
               particularly critical for institutions looking to ensure access to material illuminating the lives of understudied groups like women. 
               Numerous scholars have demonstrated that digital projects about and by women and other historically disenfranchised groups have shorter 
               lifespans than other similar projects, in part because the institutions and groups devoted to women's and gender issues have less 
               well-secured budgets.<note>See <ptr target="#boyles_2018"/>. For a history of the underfinancing of <q>recovery projects</q> within 
               literary studies, see <ptr target="#earhart_2015" loc="62–89"/>.</note> This situation has particular consequences for visual materials, 
               an underused, under-described, and yet plentiful kind of source for archival researchers interested in the interwoven nature of women's 
               public and private lives <ptr target="#katz_2019"/>.
            </p>
            <p>In addition, sustainability is rarely connected to issues of representation that are so key to the theorization of historical materials. 
               In the context of archives, discussions of sustainability have centered on democratizing access and providing opportunities for 
               participation in the construction and content of archives. Yet the work of the <name>Lesbian Herstory Archives</name> illustrates the ways 
               in which histories of description constitute representation and are imperiled as digitization demands <q>clean</q> data 
               <ptr target="#mckinney_2020" loc="195–202"/>. Literature on archives and intersectional, care-conscious labor are imperative here, key to 
               reframing sustainability as a multipronged process requiring the long-term preservation of materials, their histories of description, and 
               their housing institutions, composed of both infrastructures and personnel <ptr target="#caswell_2021"/> <ptr target="#harris_2022"/>. 
               This literature, in its emphasis on <q>good enough</q> approaches, also reframes sustainability as an insufficient end goal in and of  
               itself. The real goal is sustainable access for communities whose need for information is imperative for their political and social 
               visibility and viability <ptr target="#mckinney_2020" loc="202–203"/>.
            </p>
            <p>Digitalization and its sustainability have repercussions for the <q>assembly work</q> of history-making detailed in 
               <name>Michel-Rolph Trouillot</name>'s seminal <title rend="italic">Silencing the Past</title> (1995), which notes: 
               <quote rend="block">Archives assemble. Their assembly is not limited to a more or less passive act of collecting. Rather, it is an active 
               act of production that prepares facts for historical intelligibility […] They are the institutionalized sites of mediation between the 
               sociohistorical process and the narrative about that process. <ptr target="#trouillot_2015" loc="52"/></quote>This approach requires that 
               we see archives as non-static, in constant dialogue with researchers, archivists, and other archives, digital and physical alike. 
               Sustainability must be defined within this context, where the continuous production of historical knowledge is done by researchers 
               toggling between past scholarship and the current state of archives, when access points are now almost exclusively digital.

          <head>Research Questions</head>
            <p>The main research question for this article is as follows:</p>
            <p>How can sustainability for digitized archival collections be defined if we understand archival collections as ongoing processes rather 
               than static assemblages of documents?</p>
            <p>An answer to the main research question will be built on answers to the following sub-questions, which involve a historical 
               reconstruction based on internal documentation from the initial construction and continued maintenance of <name>KvinnSam</name>'s image 
               database.

               important to note, however, that my employment began in September 2022, long after the majority of the history covered in this 
               article.
            </p>
            <p>The kind of documentation studied here is often referred to as paradata. This concept has been used in a variety of contexts, but within 
               digitization, <name>Dahlström</name> and <name>Hansson</name> define paradata as documentation that covers <quote rend="inline">the 
               process of digitizing and curating artefacts and documents, and the decisions made during a digitization project</quote> 
               <ptr target="#dahlstrom_hansson_2019" loc="6"/>. Though their work is largely interested in library digitization, their reasoning mirrors 
               archival studies scholarship on digital and digitized collections in its focus on materials documenting collection-level decisions, from 
               appraisal <ptr target="#anderson_eaton_schwartz_2015"/> to description <ptr target="#yeo_2015"/> to platforming 
               <ptr target="#zhang_2012"/>. Such materials are important because they could provide long-term context for digitized documents like 
               <name>KvinnSam</name>'s photographs as they are moved from one digital environment to another, are transferred to new formats, and/or 
               become obsolete.
            </p>
            <p>Periodization of the database using these materials is a historical method that focuses on chronologizing and identifying turning points 
               when work on or approaches to the database shift. This is a qualitative approach that focuses on textual material as a reflection of 
               contemporary decision-making, with incompleteness of that documentation itself a sign of the rhythms of work with the database. Though 
               <name>Samantha Thrift</name> has characterized this emphasis on rhythms and turning points as fundamental to research on women's 
               movements <ptr target="#thrift_2011"/>, it is useful in analyses like this one, where the identification of thematic rhythms can be used 
               to problematize the assumption that databases exist in three clearly delineated phases: construction, existence/maintenance, and 
               retirement/archiving, an existence that only overlaps with the lives of physical archives in the first phase, during digitization of the 
               documents that will populate the database.
            </p>
            <p>Documentation will be used to retrace the history of the image database with a focus on identifying (1) circumstances in which the 
               physical and digital archives were considered together and (2) circumstances in which sustainability was a central question for 
               <name>KvinnSam</name> personnel. These emphases are choices; the construction of a historical periodization involves centering some 
               conversations and issues and silencing other aspects of the past, as <name>Trouillot</name>'s seminal work demonstrates. Following 
               <name>Trouillot</name>'s deconstruction of history's ever-evolving production and the creation of historical silences that history 
               entails <ptr target="#trouillot_2015"/>, the image database and questions of sustainability will then be placed in conversation with 
               questions of history as a construction with roots in the building and organization of archival materials that become (always incomplete) 
               historical fact through their archival status and subsequent availability and use in the writing of history.

          <head><name>KvinnSam</name>'s Image Database: A History and a Periodization</head>
            <p><name>KvinnSam</name> is <name>Sweden</name>'s <name>National Resource Library for Gender Research</name>. The organization, founded in 
               1958 by three women, consists of both a library and archives, and throughout its history <name>KvinnSam</name> has sought to make women's 
               and gender research and history more findable and accessible to researchers and the broader public <ptr target="#losman_1984"/>. The 
               library has traditionally functioned as a major player in defining what counts as women's and gender research within <name>Sweden</name> 
               through the creation and application of classification systems and the creation of archival collections that center women and gender as 
               researchable subjects, all the while reacting to what these categories mean by following contemporary scholarship.

            <div>
              <head>Turning Point 1: Digitization</head>
                <p><name>KvinnSam</name> began digitizing materials in the early 2000s — the first identified turning point — as a response to both 
                   user demand and general pressures within the cultural heritage sector that related digitization to an institution's status as 
                   up-to-date. The earliest project focused on digitization of historic women's newspapers, due to popular demand and the declining physical 
                   quality of these materials. Images were chosen as the second digitization project, for these same reasons. Digitization would also solve 
                   issues of findability for photographic materials. Librarians would no longer have to search for images within the physical 
                   <name>KvinnSam</name> collections, where photographs were (and still are) under-described and thus difficult to find 
                   <ptr target="#kvinnsam_2001a"/>. In this sense, the library and archives followed the <quote rend="inline">mass digitization</quote> 
                   imperative described by <name>Thylstrup</name>, an imperative that created a sense that <name>KvinnSam</name> needed to catch up with 
                   other institutions <ptr target="#thylstrup_2018"/>. <name>KvinnSam</name> librarians thus chose materials that had received heavy use or 
                   were related to regularly researched topics, questions, and people <ptr target="#backlund_sjodahl_2001"/>.
                </p>
                <p>Despite the sense of catch-up embedded in this process, the stage of early digitization can be read as both the creation of sources and 
                   fact assembly according to <name>Trouillot</name>'s model. These sets of early choices made some materials very easily accessible, 
                   thereby rendering less accessible materials almost invisible. <name>KvinnSam</name>'s digitized periodicals are far from complete or even 
                   representative of its physical collection of periodicals. Further, this initial stage of digitization established a set of themes and 
                   material types that would continue to be prioritized in the following decades. These unwritten rules for what was important enough to 
                   digitize border on the third stage of <name>Trouillot</name>'s framework, the creation of narratives. And crucially, the moment of fact 
                   creation was built upon past use, or historiography — a looping of the process of historical creation that <name>Troillot</name>'s model  
                   does not address. This looping, the consistent impact of historiography on digitization practices, is poorly accounted for in 
                   studies of digitization, representation, and access.

            <div>
              <head>Turning Point 2: Platform Choice</head>
                <p>A small working group at <name>KvinnSam</name> was formed, and the group's two members conducted a series of study visits to digitizing 
                   institutions, largely within <name>Sweden</name> <ptr target="#kvinnsam_2001b"/> <ptr target="#kvinnsam_2001c"/>. This working group 
                   attempted to think strategically about the future needs of <name>KvinnSam</name> and future technological advancements that might render 
                   obsolete the collection under digitization or change the ways that patrons search for photographic materials 
                   <ptr target="#kvinnsam_2001d"/>. Planning was, however, tightly restricted by both technological siloing and resource limitations. 
                   Database technologies available to <name>KvinnSam</name> in the early 2000s were often constructed with other kinds of materials in mind. 
                   Five different database infrastructures were under discussion during this period, and several were discarded as options because they were 
                   only appropriate for museum materials or bibliographic information <ptr target="#kvinnsam_2001e"/>.
                </p>
                <p>After an initial investigation, the working group decided to prioritize the construction of a bespoke database that could function as a 
                   part of the institution's own digital infrastructure, largely because other external options seemed too expensive, not suited to 
                   photographic documents, not suited to <name>KvinnSam</name>'s subject word indexing system, or difficult to upgrade 
                   <ptr target="#kvinnsam_2001f"/>. Further, the database was constructed both beside and as an integrated part of themed historical portals 
                   designed to present basic women's history grounded in the history contained within <name>KvinnSam</name>'s archival collections. The 
                   interwoven nature of these digital projects would then influence the trajectory of the image database.
                </p>
                <p>This decision marked a second turning point, narrowing some options while expanding others and, in effect, creating the guidelines for 
                   new archives in digital environments. The choice positioned these digitized documents within the digital infrastructure of a chronically 
                   underfunded institution. However, housing the database also meant that <name>KvinnSam</name> clearly owned their digitized materials, 
                   cementing them as located within <name>Swedish</name> women's history, as defined by the broader <name>KvinnSam</name> website. As noted, 
                   extensive portals with key themes from women's history were constructed alongside the image database, and this co-design facilitates 
                   searches based in predetermined themes emerging from women's history: suffrage, peace, education, work, and the modern women's 
                   movement. A separate database also presents the photographs as a searchable, coherent collection <ptr target="#kvinnsam_2001a"/> 
                   <ptr target="#backlund_sjodahl_2001"/>.

              <head>Turning Point 3: Selection for Inclusion</head>
                <p>Selection can also be viewed as a turning point that narrowed the digitized collection, the online image of <name>KvinnSam</name>'s 
                   archival holdings, and <name>KvinnSam</name>'s definition of Swedish women's history. These decisions were not determined in a vacuum; 
                   rather, selection choices were affected by <name>KvinnSam</name>'s preexisting understanding and periodization of history combined with 
                   concerns about legality <ptr target="#kvinnsam_2001a"/>. The initial choice to focus on materials from the suffrage movement in 
                   <name>Sweden</name> — bridging the turn of the 20th century — stemmed from the presence of many known photographs in the archives 
                   (meaning there was enough metadata to describe individual items), researcher and journalist demand for these items, and a belief that 
                   they were less likely to suffer from confusing rights issues <ptr target="#backlund_sjodahl_2001"/>.
                </p>
                <p>The group settled on a set of prioritized metadata that reinforced these foci: names of persons, locations, chronological information, 
                   activities, and clothing. These choices were built out of the thesaurus that constitutes one of the bases of <name>KvinnSam</name>'s 
                   work, a woman-centered subject word list that supplements the Swedish subject word thesaurus <ptr target="#kvinnsam_2001a"/> 
                   <ptr target="#backlund_sjodahl_2001"/>. As previous research has shown, the keywords focus on personal and organizational names, years, 
                   places, professional positions, and events, alongside clothing descriptions and other user demands that reflect documented 
                   non-researcher interests in historical fashion <ptr target="#pierce_2021"/>. These keywords can provide a comparatively representative 
                   blend of public and private information, approximating some of the messiness of documents contained by the physical archives 
                   <ptr target="#pierce_2023"/>.
                </p>
                <p>This process fits with <name>Trouillot</name>'s depiction of history-making, which includes researcher use (and re-use) of collections. 
                   The approach taken by <name>KvinnSam</name> followed the trend of digitizing <q>canon</q> materials that has characterized digitization 
                   since its inception, with definitions of the cannon based on past women's history research. Indeed, researcher use characterizes the 
                   whole of <name>KvinnSam</name>'s current website, formalized in the institution's provision of historical portals that centered a 
                   research generation's focus on the <q>waves</q> of feminist activism — a structuring device that is currently viewed as problematic and 
                   limiting as well as generative <ptr target="#reger_2017"/>. While boxing in digitization decisions, a ready-made portal also meant that 
                   these materials could be linked to a preexisting historical context, in a sense taking the place of a finding aid in terms of situating 
                   the materials within historical processes. What is missing from <name>Trouillot</name>'s story is perhaps the larger national 
                   superstructures that box in the behavior of cultural heritage institutions. The initial count of 2,000 digitizable images shrank to 
                   around 1,000 by the time the database was fully realized, largely due to a questions of ownership and copyright. The construction of 
                   digital materials and a database occurred outside of <name>KvinnSam</name>, however. A digitization team at the library performed the 
                   digitization, and <name>KvinnSam</name> staff added metadata to these items. This division of labor meant that staff did not directly 
                   control their materials, which put them in a unique position. Nor was <name>KvinnSam</name> directly involved in database construction 
                   <ptr target="#backlund_sjodahl_2001"/>.

              <head>Turning Point 4: Shifting Databases</head>
                <p>This database was maintained until the <name>Humanities Library</name> at the university agreed to begin using Alvin<note>Alvin is 
                   located at 
                   <ref target="https://www.alvin-portal.org/alvin/home.jsf?dswid=1558">https://www.alvin-portal.org/alvin/home.jsf?dswid=1558</ref> 
                   (accessed 4 January 2024).</note>, a multi-institutional database for digital and digitized cultural heritage materials that was 
                   developed and is maintained by software engineers at <name>Uppsala University</name>. Adoption of Alvin, which went live in the 
                   mid-2010s, represents a turning point. The platform was seen as more modern, more flexible, and, crucially, less resource intensive for 
                   <name>KvinnSam</name> (though the library system pays a large fee as the leading consortium member), leading <name>KvinnSam</name> 
                   personnel to upload all digitized materials to Alvin. However, the materials from the image database mean something different in Alvin, 
                   where they intermingle with other digitized materials and finding aids for archives from a variety of Swedish cultural heritage 
                   institutions. As a result, the digitized photographs from the <name>KvinnSam</name> database can no longer be read together; neither 
                   Alvin's search functionality nor <name>KvinnSam</name>'s metadata facilitate finding the initial digitized photo collection as a group.
                </p>
                <p>The shift to Alvin initiated a period of stagnancy for the image database. For the last several years, <name>KvinnSam</name> has updated 
                   materials in Alvin rather than attending to the bespoke database. This shift in attention is the result of a long wait for a new 
                   interface, including a new website that will not include the database, largely for two reasons: (1) it is presumed that the database 
                   cannot be cleanly integrated into a new website, and (2) staff have not regularly updated materials and metadata in the database, 
                   increasing the amount of work that would be needed to move and integrate it into a new website. Materials are occasionally removed from 
                   the database or Alvin due to copyright concerns, and new digitized materials are uploaded in Alvin rather than in the photography 
                   database. In both cases, subject words have not been updated, even if the subject word list has undergone change. Because 
                   <name>KvinnSam</name> has created archives without recognizing that it has created archives, there is no clear contextual information 
                   that can hold the archive together and assist with its migration.
                </p>
                <p>Migration has also led to some problems with archival representation. As noted, Alvin contains both archival finding aids (i.e., 
                   descriptions of entire archival collections that are often dozens of pages long and contain provenance information, chronological data, 
                   and descriptions of the items in each physical box) and individual digitized items from these collections. This diversity may eventually 
                   allow for interlinking that will provide needed archival context for digitized materials, but this feature is not yet fully developed. 
                   Further, many institutions, <name>KvinnSam</name> included, upload their finding aids as attached documents, which are not searchable 
                   via the Alvin search function. This hinders future development of platform design that provides users with clear information about where 
                   digitized materials come from and how representative they are of much larger physical archives. Lastly, Alvin covers multiple 
                   institutions, all of which use the platform differently. This broader diversity means that the similarly diverse descriptions within  
                   <name>KvinnSam</name>'s own collections, which were produced through multiple generations of description, digitization, and platforming, 
                   are not as visible as they might otherwise be.
                </p>
                <p>The shift to Alvin is a turning point for another reason: using the platform clarified issues with <name>KvinnSam</name>'s use of and 
                   responsibility for archival data and metadata, a responsibility that was assumed with library materials but never really implemented for 
                   archival collections. Currently, <name>KvinnSam</name> staff are focused on metadata for archives — both finding aids and digitized or 
                   born-digital materials — as a central plank in the creation of future archival findability. A sustainable filing and preservation strategy is 
                   now seen as a fundamental building block for the creation of a more sustainable photograph database. The compilation of materials will 
                   also allow <name>KvinnSam</name> personnel to establish which tags will be more useful in day-to-day image work, which includes planning 
                   for future digitization and the creation of digital exhibitions that showcase <name>KvinnSam</name> materials, competencies, and 
                   services. The creation of this alternate system of images and metadata is designed to supplement rather than erase or displace the 
                   previous classificatory system applied to individual images, which reflects the history of terminological shifts within Swedish women's 
                   and gender research (for descriptions of a similar approach at the <name>Lesbian Herstory Archives</name>, see 
                   <ptr target="#mckinney_2020"/>).
                </p>
                <p>In addition, new digitization efforts are planned but organized very differently than was this first push. <name>KvinnSam</name> 
                   is currently working in a more project-based method that is less concerned with copyright and more concerned with sustainable practices 
                   that have been built up since the construction of the initial image database. These practices include a focus on (1) usability in 
                   multiple digital environments (for a new webpage, in digital exhibitions, etc.); (2) the creation of new access points for underused 
                   collections and materials; and (3) physical material sustainability, with the potential for more attention to damaged, fragile, and/or 
                   underdescribed materials. It is likely that the current image database will be retired when <name>KvinnSam</name>'s new webpage goes 
                   live, with its contents republished in various locations on the new website, embedding the legacy of the database in the digital 
                   infrastructure of <name>KvinnSam</name> while at the same time potentially making that past invisible to users.

               relevant and preserve their holdings</quote> <ptr target="#mckinney_2020" loc="159"/>. What <name>KvinnSam</name>'s experience with its 
               image database demonstrates is that reliance on digital infrastructures — whether in-house or outsourced — places materials at risk of 
               disappearing or being rendered unusable due to poor organizational practices. Yet this risk was only visible at the turning point when 
               materials were moved between platforms. Platforms multiply the number of organizational and technical skills required by an institution, 
               rather than relieving librarians and archivists of work. Investment in expensive platforms also refocuses work towards digitized materials, 
               and digital access renders the role and work of archivists invisible to researchers.
            </p>
            <p>The development of <name>KvinnSam</name>'s digital and physical photographic archives complicates <name>Trouillot</name>'s framework given 
               that digitization alters the physical and digital archives and their sustainability while (often temporarily) extending accessibility of some 
               documents. Digitization makes it clear that <name>Trouillot</name>'s framework is not linear and that the making of narratives and history 
               affects already constructed sources and archives, altering them and their accessibility and use over time. In <name>KvinnSam</name>'s case, 
               sustainability is more profitably linked to the construction and use of paradata in the development of digital archival description 
               practices. Taking the role of history-making into account, sustainability should be linked more to transparency and a willingness to see 
               digitized materials not as copies but as extensions of physical collections, affected by conditions of provenance and collection development.
            </p>
            <p>A comprehensive and forward-looking preservation strategy that encompasses all materials — not just digitized items — is crucial for 
               cultural heritage institutions and archival researchers. Good, structured organizational practices are dependent on resources, broadly 
               defined. The multiple definitions of sustainability within digital humanities literature obscure the fact that financial, infrastructural, 
               and intellectual aspects of institutional health are intertwined. Institutions and centers with unstable or chronically limited funding are 
               most at risk for landing in this kind of disorganization. During its many years with a smaller staff, <name>KvinnSam</name> did not work 
               particularly actively with its archival holdings. Maintenance of digital materials is built on the maintenance of physical archival 
               resources; one cannot happen without the other <ptr target="#arnold_et_al_2017"/>. Arguments that digitization will result in the 
               preservation of physical materials are simplistic at best and misleading at worst. Certainly, digitization can be integrated into a larger 
               preservation strategy, but digitization is not de facto preservation. Sustainability requires viewing digital and physical collections 
               alongside practices as a whole.
            </p>
            <p>An issue is defining the <q>whole</q> — in order to generate sustainable practices, an institution must define precisely what it is 
               sustaining while also remaining attuned to the fact that all archives have lifecycles. Digitization is a process that creates collections 
               somewhere in between new and old, physical and digital; these are collections characterized by their contingency 
               <ptr target="#pierce_2021"/>. What the periodization of <name>KvinnSam</name>'s image database demonstrates is the centrality of platforms 
               in determining what materials are digitized, how they are digitized, and what is considered appropriate description. As <name>Johanna 
               Drucker</name> has argued, <quote rend="inline">Most information visualizations are acts of interpretation masquerading as 
               presentation</quote> <ptr target="#drucker_2014" loc="10"/>. Institutions need to acknowledge this structuring when they start using new 
               platforms. Each new platform or database means new collection development, because archival materials are defined by their interrelationships 
               and larger contexts <ptr target="#bak_2016"/>. Each new platform also means shared responsibility and a reliance on collaboration. This 
               sounds good, and such collective work can be highly beneficial. But the <q>whole</q> becomes very difficult to define in these instances. 
               What is a collection in digital environments? When and how are the stages of digitization affecting the production of history? How can the 
               ongoing process of digital collection development be made visible to researchers?
            </p>
            <p>With digitization, archivists, researchers, and <q>traditional</q> archives run the risk of losing a sense of what an archive actually is 
               and where the boundaries of their own collections are. The rhetoric and logics of digitization and digital tools push archivists towards a 
               conflation of <quote rend="inline">information management</quote> with archiving <ptr target="#thylstrup_2018"/>. This is not necessarily a 
               problem, as <name>D.M. Withers</name> notes; how we understand and define an archive must and should shift as the technologies of its 
               organization and description change <ptr target="#withers_2015"/>. But change is difficult and it is often viewed as a disruption of rather 
               than a development in archival practices. The splitting of digitization and collection management work between archival and IT departments 
               means that collection custody is divided, resulting in a porous archival boundary. The multiplication of platforms and the transfer of 
               digitized materials from across digital spaces upsets long-held practices concerning the multiplicity of documents within collections 
               (as institutions often define a maximum number of copies to be kept) and collection-based description practices focused on provenance and 
               original order.
            </p>
            <p>As a result, digitization is often viewed as an adjacent service or a time-bound development project, rather than a central part of 
               collections development. This perspective places digitized collections outside the process of archiving and history-making that defines 
               physical collections management. The sense of archival abundance held by many members of the public, academics, and cultural heritage 
               institutions obscures the fact that most archival documents are not and will never be online, as well as the issue of representation and 
               continuous maintenance that characterizes all collections, including digital ones. Platform multiplication contributes to the multiplication 
               of a few digitized documents, making them seem more multitudinous than they are and veiling them with an aura of representativeness 
               <ptr target="#odumosu_2020"/>. Digitization choices matter and need to be visible; these choices are integral to the sustainability of 
               collections housed within databases, which in turn has repercussions for the sustainability of the larger project of history-making. Each 
               new platform is a <quote rend="inline">moment of fact assembly</quote>, in the words of <name>Trouillot</name>, creating new silences in 
               the historical record <ptr target="#trouillot_2015"/>.
            </p>
            <p>In order to assure the sustainability of digitized collections from these institutions and thereby women's and gender history, digital 
               collections must be considered as discrete but interconnected archival collections within a system of physical and digital collections  
               both at individual institutions and within a broader Archive. The <name>KvinnSam</name> image database demonstrates that the making of 
               sources and archives, those first two history-making moments, are not singular but can recur over time as sources are made and unmade, 
               collections constructed and then deconstructed. Digital materials support arguments that archives are never stable, that archives might best 
               be viewed as processes and sets of ever-shifting relationships <ptr target="#lee_2017"/> <ptr target="#pierce_2021"/>. Archivists shuffle 
               and relabel and add materials, documents deteriorate or are rendered unusable, and new accessions reframe pre-existing collections.
            </p>
            <p>Digitization adds, in this reading, another layer to this processual archive — digital collections must be integrated into a broader system 
               of collections management that includes collection description to ensure archival and historical sustainability. The migration of 
               collections from platform to platform makes this need clear. In the case of <name>KvinnSam</name>, the initial collection context did not 
               travel with the collection of photographs. When the new website for <name>KvinnSam</name> is built, the suffrage portal that provided 
               historical context for the collection will disappear along with the original database, leaving a set of items with historical archival 
               connections — materials from the only women's and gender library and archives institution in <name>Scandinavia</name> — dispersed in Alvin. 
               Further, the summary of and selection information for the collection will disappear, leaving materials unmoored from the provenance 
               information that gives these documents their archival weight, ensures the archival transparency central to feminist archivy, and offers 
               entryways into Swedish women's and gender history.
            </p>
            <p>There are opportunities to rethink archival description by reframing archives as <quote rend="inline">the archival body</quote>, a queering 
               of the Archive suggested by <name>Jamie Ann Lee</name>. Accepting instability as a natural part of collections with shifting identities — 
               identities that now exist across the physical/digital divide — requires new methods that allow for descriptive multiplicity. 
               <name>Lee</name> phrases this as a need to <quote rend="inline">understand and represent the dynamic (un)becomings</quote> embedded in 
               archival collections <ptr target="#lee_2017" loc="1"/>. <name>Lee</name>'s <quote rend="inline">Queer/ed Archival Methodology</quote> centers 
               archives as multitudinous processes <ptr target="#lee_2017"/>. For <name>KvinnSam</name>, an archiving of both the database and the portals 
               that provided context for database materials must be considered together, as processes that are part of both the history of Swedish women's 
               history and the history of <name>KvinnSam</name>. Description of these collection processes requires understanding collections as constantly 
               overlapping and shifting, in need of levels of description that ensure transparency and make visible collection boundaries that influence 
               interpretation and the writing of history.
            </p>
            <p>Here, existing paradata detailed in the results can help in the creation of finding aids for digital/digitized collections that move away 
               from chronic debates about the <q>authenticity</q> of digitized documents (for this debate, see <ptr target="#mak_2012"/>). Archival finding 
               aids are defined by the <name>Society of American Archivists</name> as <quote rend="inline">a description that typically consists of 
               contextual and structural information about an archival resource</quote> that establishes the material's provenance and historical 
               authenticity <ptr target="#saa_n.d."/>. Scholarship on finding aids for digital collections has focused on born-digital collections 
               <ptr target="#ruest_fritz_milligan_2022"/>, but digitized groupings of documents are also in need of this level of description. Documentation 
               of broken links and removal of documents due to rights issues, item additions, and the capture and archiving of digital environments is 
               important; if digitized documents are to be used as historical evidence, their creation, management, and use over time must be considered 
               <ptr target="#owens_padilla_2021"/>.
            </p>
            <p>Description at the collection level provides flexibility. Information about collection creation and management would help users to 
               understand digital archival silences — materials lacking description that have simply been labelled <q>photo, unknown woman</q> and the 
               absence of materials from certain collections that have rights holds — and integrate these silences into their understanding of historical 
               evidence and process. At the same time, these collections would also offer opportunities to digitize underdescribed documents and describe 
               them as a group, making it easier to digitize the less well-researched materials that exist, hidden, in the corners of archives. Further, 
               collections-level description provides opportunities for integrating archival and researcher interpretations of materials, rectifying 
               problems that scholars have identified with, for example, queering the archives <ptr target="#freeman_2023"/>.
            </p>
            <p>For users, digitization and the lack of visible archival structure for digitized collections can result in a failure to see these the 
                boundaries of archives and archival collections as important. This is dangerous; as <name>Troillot</name> notes, collection boundaries and 
                the silences that are created in the process of building archives are central to history-making. Digitized collections actively resist 
                silences, which leads researchers to assume that online databases offer a kind of completeness that they most often do not. These materials 
                are instead the result of decisions based in available technical options, a digitization imperative, limited resources, previous researcher 
                use, and readily available metadata/access within the physical archives themselves. Current research points to the usefulness of paradata 
                for <q>upcycling</q> historical data, a more sustainable approach to historical research in digital archives that also centers the labor of 
                historical construction <ptr target="#scheltjens_2023"/>.
            </p>
            <p>An answer to the question of how to define sustainability for digitized collections focuses just as much on <q>collections</q> as 
               <q>digitized</q>. This approach fits with scholarship on archiving photographs and the preservation of photographic meaning as multitudinous 
               and contextual. In this vein, <name>Joan Schwartz</name> asserts that if a photograph's meaning is, as many have argued, grounded in context, 
               <quote rend="inline">each use must be understood as distinct, though sometimes interrelated</quote> <ptr target="#schwartz_1995" loc="52"/>. 
               Thus, a photograph that simultaneously exists across multiple institutions should not be interpreted as 
               <quote rend="inline">duplication</quote> or <quote rend="inline">waste</quote> but <quote rend="inline">as the logical outcome of the 
               appropriation and re-appropriation of a photograph with fixed content and physical configuration into different functional contexts with the 
               attendant transformation of a single image into multiple documents</quote> <ptr target="#schwartz_1995" loc="52"/>. Questions of 
               sustainability in this context must understand collections development as non-neutral and constitutive of histories via processes of 
               selection and collection construction, maintenance, and even decay. Critical to this model of digitized archival sustainability is a 
               continual questioning of digitization and digital collection-building, given the resource intensiveness and historical world-making that 
               such practices involve.

          <head>Conclusion: Sustainability for Women's and Gender History Materials</head>
            <p>The particular multiplicities and systematic fragility, or unsustainability, of collections of digitized gender and women's archival 
               materials, as observed by <ptr target="#boyles_2018"/>, affects historical production at each and every one of <name>Trouillot</name>'s four 
               moments. The (un)sustainability of digital collections development is closely tied to the resources allocated for collections development 
               and description over time; institutions that have trouble finding the resources to process and describe their physical collections will have 
               trouble dealing with digital collections development in a systematic way. Digitized collections often emerge when a sudden influx of funding 
               appears, frequently because of ongoing research in a particular area combined with the digital imperative. These circumstances demonstrate 
               the non-linear, iterative nature of history-making, as archives evolve alongside research, each affecting the other. Making this 
               relationship visible to archivists and researchers alike is critical for the sustainability of digitized collections.
            </p>
            <p>Digital and digitized collections are not simply an addition to an older set of collections development. They require a careful system of 
               curation and collection description that most institutions and researchers have not considered at length. Institutions need to consider the 
               fact that database creation is in itself archival collections development, a process that requires the creation of description that 
               elaborates upon the relationships between collection items and establishes the historical provenance of the collection as an ever-shifting 
               whole. Researchers must interrogate the boundaries and absences created in the process of digitizing some things and not others at 
               particular points in time, with particular resources at hand, and with particular goals in mind. Here, supplying paradata that makes visible 
               the boundaries of and silences within digitized and born-digital collections is critical. This data can hold materials together when they 
               inevitably must be migrated, and it offers researchers a historical dataset that has clearer usage value because of its more concrete 
               provenance.
            </p>
            <p>There is an interesting contrast here between how <name>KvinnSam</name> understood digitization and the development of digitized collections 
               and how the institution understands the eventual acquisition and management of born-digital archives. Archives, libraries, and museums in 
               <name>Sweden</name> are preparing with some trepidation for the eventual influx of born-digital archives. It is no accident that the few 
               experiments in e-archives have centered on well-known men; women's and gender archives are constantly placed in a position where they feel 
               they must catch up to international trends (for an overview of trends, see <ptr target="#ries_palko_2019"/>). Yet these institutions are 
               sitting on digital archives where experimentation can take place. By going through <name>KvinnSam</name>'s own born-digital archives, staff 
               can develop a policy and set of sustainable practices for other born-digital archives. The treatment of born-digital archives as requiring 
               fundamentally different practices that will need independent development contributes to the sense that the physical archive is stable. 
               Digitized archival collections offer an in-betweenness that may be highly generative.
            </p>
            <p>Discussions of sustainability in archives have centered on participatory and democratic processes that integrate publics into the process of 
               description <ptr target="#jochumsen_johnston_varheim"/>. But there is little consideration of what these processes actually mean across 
               different kinds of archival institutions and how technological know-how factors into these methods of opening up archives. <name>Cait 
               McKinney</name> argues that <quote rend="inline">technologies evolve along with understandings of gender and sexuality</quote> 
               <ptr target="#mckinney_2020" loc="191"/>. Through the lens of queer/ed archives, practitioners might understand digitized collections as 
               fluid archival bodies, grounded in particular physical historical contexts but also open to <quote rend="inline">ongoing worldmaking</quote> 
               that may not yet be visible to archivists <ptr target="#lee_2017"/>. Within this framework, it might be easier to see how the shifting of 
               materials and descriptions of these materials from one digital environment to another is part of the process of historical production. This 
               movement constitutes a rhythm that defines archives. Sustainability of digitized collections depends on understanding their unmoored nature 
               and role in history-making and building this indeterminateness into collections development and description from the beginning.
