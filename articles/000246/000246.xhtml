                  <p>Humanistic uses of digital technologies opened up new ways to think about,
                     communicate, and discuss historical research. The common use of digital tools to
                     visually represent ancient cultures and sites, however, has also introduced new
                     issues. For example, critics have argued that digital visualisations, largely
                     synonymous with reconstruction in 3D models, often attempt to represent a
                     photorealistic-artificial vision of the past, and may often prove to be a way to
                     communicate history to a large(r) audience [<a class="ref" href="#forte1997">Forte and Siliotti 1997</a>]. Against
                     this backdrop, this article will discuss precisely how technology may help
                     immerse researchers into historically situated life, and radically advance
                     historical research. Adding to related criticisms of ocularcentric traditions of
                     knowledge production, we contribute to this stream of research by arguing that
                     contemporary visual representations of the past often concentrate on visual
                     representations and seemingly maintain antiquity as a sanitised
                     historio-cultural ideal [<a class="ref" href="#westin2012">Westin 2012</a>]
                     [<a class="ref" href="#tziovas2014">Tziovas 2014</a>]. This article seeks to demonstrate the potential of
                     digital humanities to move beyond mere representations on screen and to mobilize
                     other senses (specifically sound) as a historically situated component for
                     research. For this purpose, we focus on the abstract principles and overall
                     methodology for a recreation of the experience of sounds in the Roman
                     amphitheatre.

                        That all our knowledge begins with experience there can be

                        awakened into exercise otherwise than by means of objects which affect our
                        senses, and partly of themselves produce representations, partly rouse our
                        powers of understanding into activity, to compare, to connect, or to
                        separate these, and so to convert the raw material of our sensuous
                        impressions into a knowledge of objects, which is called experience.

               <div class="ptext" id="p1">Epistemologies in the Humanities often draw upon Platonist frames of thought, the
                  noumenal and the phenomenal, largely canonizing the former as essential in
                  scientific outcomes, and disdaining the latter. Indeed, the noumenal (world known
                  by
                  intellect) is considered superior<a class="noteRef" href="#d4e212">[1]</a> to the phenomenal realm, the material, physical world of immediate
                  sensory perception [<a class="ref" href="#howes2005">Howes 2005</a>]. Experiencing phenomena as the
                  initiating act towards examination, analysis and scholarly reflection is widely used
                  in concrete scientific research, such as chemistry, mathematics, and physics.
                  Experiencing as methodology has been particularly iterated by Emmanuel Kant, the
                  early modern philosopher who is responsible for synthesizing both waves of
                  rationalism and empiricism in modern epistemology.<a class="noteRef" href="#d4e227">[2]</a> Kant, in an attempt to explain the relationship between reason,
                  scientific explanation and human experience, argued that our experiences are
                  structured by necessary features of our minds. In his view, the mind shapes and
                  structures experience so that, on an abstract level, all human experience shares
                  certain essential structural features. Beyond such essentialist assumptions of
                  knowledge production, we here argue that experiential and sensory arrangements
                  mediated by digital tools may be used to advance and diversify the study of
                  humanities, specifically the variability of historically situated human life.

               <div class="ptext" id="p2">Technology has opened up new ways to communicate and discuss historical research,
                  often through conceptual recreation, with vision acting as the primary sense for
                  engagement and reflection. A widely used method is <em class="emph">visualizations</em>.
                  This, often intellectually refined methodology may provide the means to communicate
                  history to a large(r) audience, in a situated space (cultural heritage exhibitions,
                  museums, scholarly installations on display) or online (see <a class="ref" href="http://romereborn.frischerconsulting.com" onclick="window.open('http://romereborn.frischerconsulting.com'); return false">Rome Reborn</a> for
                  example). The introduction of technology as both a lens and a methodology, however,
                  has introduced new issues. Visualizations are often synonymous with a
                  photorealistic-artificial ideal about the past [<a class="ref" href="#forte1997">Forte and Siliotti 1997</a>] as they
                  often concentrate on visual representations and seemingly maintain antiquity as a

                  [<a class="ref" href="#tziovas2014">Tziovas 2014</a>]. While visualisations may facilitate an understanding
                  of movement in (currently musealised) spaces or urban planning and architecture,
                  they are, in their majority, deprived of other senses, beyond vision.<a class="noteRef" href="#d4e248">[3]</a>

                  sounds in the Roman amphitheatre as a case study. Our aim is to demonstrate how

               <div class="ptext" id="p4">That the study of senses has escaped our point of espial for centuries, it could,
                  to
                  an extent, be connected to deeper epistemological problems regarding the relative
                  value of scientific and humanistic modes of knowledge creation [<a class="ref" href="#smithies2014">Smithies 2014</a>]. In this article, we aim to target this issue and
                  explore how Digital Humanities could facilitate a study of the senses in context and
                  promote a more immersive and multifarious comprehension of historically situated
                  life. Our case study is Roman entertainment, because of the challenges it entails
                  for research. Our primary and raw data have their own limitations. Most
                  amphitheatres are currently musealised monuments, inclusive of the soundscapes that
                  spring from their surrounding environment, thus, out of their
                  "original" context. Second, ancient narratives are composed
                  by an upper echelon of literate Roman citizens, so the voices of microhistory
                  (slaves, women, entertainers) are absent in our account of the Roman empire, making
                  it partial. Later receptions of antiquity (especially during the 18th century) have
                  been vastly re-iterated as idealized, thus blurring our contemporary understanding
                  further. Recent research has delved more into micro-historic societal concepts, and
                  consequently concluded that previous interpretations suffer from historically
                  restricted assumptions, the outcome of adopting hierarchically stratified categories
                  of analysis. If ancient performance is instead seen as a popular means to project
                  concepts of identity, a sensory discourse may aid scholars in capturing and
                  articulating the complex societal dynamics in a Graeco-roman backdrop.

               <div class="ptext" id="p5">The Roman amphitheatre as a material, architectural structure and a monument is
                  present in the areas surrounding the Mediterranean sea, from North African countries
                  to Asia Minor to continental Europe. The diversity of cultures composing the Roman
                  empire seem to have adopted Roman spectacle as a form of popular entertainment. It
                  has been argued that Rome was an "oral and aural" society
                  <span class="error"><a class="ref" href="#toner2014">#toner2014</a></span>. Buildings, especially Roman amphitheatres,
                  were designed to accommodate a live event, a spectacle that was inclusive of the
                  sensory experience: it incorporated sound, smell, and movement. Latin and Greek
                  texts describing this experience were originally read out loud to a largely
                  illiterate population. To enhance the texts’ vividness, authors often used the
                  rhetorical devise of <span class="foreign i">ekphrasis</span>, an evocative style
                  of narrative that aimed to stimulate the senses, often simultaneously - in a
                  <span class="foreign i">synaesthetic</span> manner. Synaesthesia is known
                  generally as the condition for those who experience one kind of sensory stimulus
                  simultaneously as another, most commonly sounds with colours. A broader definition
                  of synaesthesia has been the "blending of all senses experienced by all readers,
                  synaesthetes or not"
                   [<a class="ref" href="#butler2013">Butler and Purves 2013</a>]. By discussing the possibilities and problems of (a) digital recreation(s) of
                  historically situated sound, this article aims to show how technology may help us
                  not only redress the nexus of societal and cultural practices in relation to more
                  immediate, pre-industrial forms of entertainment, but also provoke new questions
                  about the popular rendering of antiquity within contemporaneity. Therefore, we
                  hereby argue that historical accuracy, as a methodological criterion in the study
                  of
                  ancient performance, should be discarded in favour of experiential analogy. The
                  noumenal then transforms from one "archetypal" ideal to a
                  variation of experiences.

                  ideals of accuracy, and to give us further insight into the lifeworld of antiquity.
                  In particular, we examine how digital sound engineering can be used to re-enact the
                  ancient experience of Roman entertainment. To address this question we suggest the
                  incorporation of sound studies within the field of historical studies, and
                  specifically a combination of text mining and archaeoacoustics: the study of the
                  sonic experience of archaeological sites via digital acoustic modelling [<a class="ref" href="#blesser2006">Blesser and Salter 2006</a>]
                  [<a class="ref" href="#eneix2014">Eneix 2014</a>]. In so doing, we show that by using simple programmes for
                  digital modelling of sounds scholars can readily layer audio onto the primarily
                  visual components of conventional digital prototypes. However, we also show that
                  soundscapes modelled around monuments are not enough: to understand Roman culture
                  we
                  must acknowledge sensory experience as ephemeral, therefore variable and
                  historically situated.

                  in archaeology, the proposed approach blends narrative with archaeoacoustic
                  techniques to turn attention from sensory accuracy to experiential analogy. This

                     language and through sensory encounter. For example, the "mind the gap" message in the London underground brings to mind a
                     particular context - that of a European metropolis and its sites. That in itself
                     creates further connotations — technology, trade, traffic, and rush hour, to
                     name but some. All these concepts are separate parts of the material culture of
                     London and in a way, they come together in human consciousness in order to
                     denote the very identity of the city, a sonic reflection of its life within its
                     community. Similarly, in the Roman world, sound, community, and cultural
                     identity intersected and culminated in a particular type of building — the Roman
                     amphitheatre.

                     experiences beyond the oft-fetishized visual. How then can digital technologies
                     advance the study of the senses experience in antiquity? While any cityscape is
                     composed by a spectrum of sensory cues, we here focus on sound. Thanks to modern
                     digital equipment and software, sound can be more easily, reliably and

                     been quick to adopt digital technologies (databases, electronic field surveys
                     and mapping) into its research methodologies [<a class="ref" href="#nygren2014">Nygren et al. 2014</a>]. The
                     majority of practical archaeologists now routinely include the use of digital

                     life, as there is already a basis of measurement (and standards) – a metrology –
                     for attending to the acoustic qualities of places and things. These studies have
                     been carried out in the last few decades in relation to prehistoric sites [<a class="ref" href="#watson1999">Watson and Keating 1999</a>] and Greek and Roman monuments (see [<a class="ref" href="#avgerinou2014">Avgerinou and Dreni 2014</a>, 233–42] and <span class="error"><a class="ref" href="#debertolis2014">#debertolis2014</a></span> respectively). These studies show that digital technology
                     could be used to capture the acoustic qualities of a particular site. They
                     estimate and simulate qualities of sound in physical spaces such as
                     reverberation, or decay time, and so forth (see <span class="error"><a class="ref" href="#gade2006">#gade2006</a></span>).
                     However, they never move beyond providing a soundscape, and towards a sensory

                     ancient sites is commonly achieved via digital sound modelling programs such as
                     ODEON and CATT-Acoustic™. The ODEON software is developed for simulating the
                     complex acoustics of buildings in a site. Given the geometry and surface
                     properties of a particular space, the acoustics can be predicted, illustrated
                     and listened to. To estimate the acoustic experience ODEON uses the image-source
                     method, virtually building a room combined with ray tracing, in order to map the
                     path of sound through pixels in an image plane and simulating the effects of its
                     encounters with virtual objects, for example the audience, or the very
                     material/surface of the building. Through such techniques ODEON and similar
                     software allows scholars to recreate sound experiences in both indoor and
                     outdoor areas with complicated geometry, such as Roman amphitheatres. Operating
                     in a similar way to ODEON, CATT-Acoustic™ is typically used for acoustics

                     soundscape, there are also related scholarly challenges to address within any
                     archaeoacoustic inquiry. The most significant scholarly challenge is that
                     archaeoacoustics involves recording and recreating the full array of sounds,
                     which has many permutations in any given scenario. This creates a methodological
                     problem. Archaeoacoustic studies cannot be carried out in controlled laboratory
                     situations like acoustics proper. Any study or recreation of sound should thus
                     be operated within the interpretative paradigm of social and humanistic
                     research. There are several parameters that affect how accurately we may
                     comprehend the Roman perception of sounds. The average aural ability within
                     preindustrial settings varied a lot from ours, since our contemporary sensory
                     perception is now affected by stereo and quadraphonic sound; whatever
                     measurements we make, the results may be deceptive [<a class="ref" href="#avgerinou2014">Avgerinou and Dreni 2014</a>, 240]; yet they may, overall, facilitate the grasping of a more
                     conceptual construction of the multisensory experience of the Roman
                     amphitheatre, as long as one bears in mind these implications and
                     limitations.

                     within ancient sites, archaeoacoustics is a more complicated subject of study
                     than acoustics proper. To begin with, sound modelling techniques are often
                     designed with other purposes in mind. For example, in building acoustics, which
                     provides the basis of archaeoacoustic inquries, lower parts of the frequency
                     range are often ignored as they are not as disruptive for the contemporary human
                     brain that is used to quadraphonic sound. There are further technical challenges
                     that researchers of sound ought to take into consideration, such as the
                     immobility and fragility of standard acoustics equipment. Other issues
                     encountered in acoustically focused archaeological studies is that one must use
                     a variety of practices, noting atmospheric variables such as temperature,
                     pressure and wind conditions. Due to these challenges, it is often necessary to
                     involve acousticians with experience of working with a plethora of conditional
                     parameters. Overall, acoustic techniques appropriate for archaeological contexts
                     are a work in progress [<a class="ref" href="#till2014">Till 2014</a>, 28].

                     experiential potentials of multisensory prototypes of ancient sites but this is
                     challenging in and of itself. Primary sources concerning the sensory experience
                     of Roman entertainment vary chronologically and geographically, indicating the
                     importance of space and place for the constitution of experience. Although most
                     narratives are rich in sensory detail, some authors privilege particular senses
                     over others: Martial’s descriptions have a tendency to be tactile, Seneca
                     favours sounds and smells, whilst Juvenal focuses on noise and sordid sensations
                     [<a class="ref" href="#larmour2007">Larmour 2007</a>]
                     [<a class="ref" href="#betts2011">Betts 2011</a>, 129–30]. By contrast, Cicero favours sight, as
                     does Plautus (Cicero <cite class="title italic">On the Orator</cite> 2.357; Plautus
                     <cite class="title italic">The Two Bacchises</cite> 1023). Given the abundance of
                     sensory information in narrative, deeper examinations of the sensory sphere in
                     antiquity may offer key insights into the fine nuances of historical social
                     life.

                     representing events within the entire sensory spectrum and, consequentially,
                     further affects how senses mingle and mix. This form of synaesthesia is also
                     present in many of the primary sources that detail the importance of
                     entertainment for Roman life <span class="error"><a class="ref" href="#toner2014">#toner2014</a></span>.
                     Accordingly, there is a need for methodological approaches that can also make
                     use of this kind of "synaesthetic" quality of narratives to
                     provide more holistic understandings of the experiences of Roman life, by
                     reflecting its individual details.<a class="noteRef" href="#d4e516">[5]</a> Synaesthetic narratives appear in a variety of authors and
                     contexts. Ancient narratives of Roman spectacle are of particular interest to
                     this inquiry, as they often seem to blur all the senses, (including vision)
                     evoking them in quick succession. For example, in the heart of these
                     multisensory events, there are typically questions of light and darkness,
                     elaborate backdrops as well as special effects, which seem to engage all the
                     senses almost simultaneously (Cic. <cite class="title italic">Verr.</cite> 2.158 and
                     141 for decoration in the forum during the Roman games, SHA <cite class="title italic">Car.</cite> 19). Caligula, for instance, held night-time performances that
                     lit up the whole city (Suet. <cite class="title italic">Cal</cite>.18; Tac. <cite class="title italic">Ann.</cite> 14.20-1; <span class="foreign i">cf.</span>
                     Suet. <cite class="title italic">Dom.</cite> 4) and naturally, as in a preindustrial
                     society torches and fire would be used, thus involving the sound of fire and the
                     smell of smoke. The Roman games also began with a ritual sacrifice, which
                     involved the sound of fire, the vision blurred by smoke as well as the burning
                     of incense and the roasting of the sacrificial meat.<a class="noteRef" href="#d4e546">[6]</a> Sounds may then be
                     described as separate entities in a text without necessarily being referred to
                     as sound. Take for example Suetonius’ description of Caligula’s nighttime
                     activities (<cite class="title italic">Gaius</cite> 18), where the sound of the fire
                     of the torches would have to be reconstructed separately from simultaneous songs
                     or compositions for musical instruments (improvisational or not), and then
                     arranged together.

                  <div class="ptext" id="p22">In this way, narratives about Roman spectacle contain a variety of sounds yet
                     mingled with other senses. Aside from the sound of fire, there was also music,
                     mostly horns and trumpets, sometimes even a multitude of flutes (SHA <cite class="title italic">Car.</cite> 19). We know of specific events and how these
                     emphasise different sounds for the sake of narrative; Cicero is specific about
                     the screams of victims: "An effective training for the ear
                     in the endurance of pain and death" (Cic. <cite class="title italic">Tusc.</cite> 2.20.46). There is also information about the slaying of 100
                     lions on the spot at Probus’ games, an event that generated loud roars that
                     sounded "as loud as thunder" (SHA <cite class="title italic">Brob.</cite> 19). The description of sounds also involves the
                     use of tools: metal whips, hot irons, and chains to drive both animals and
                     humans: "there was noise everywhere produced by the
                     equipment of death; here a sword was being sharpened, there someone was
                     heating metal plates, here rods where produces, there whips… the trumpets
                     were blaring with funereal sound… everywhere there was wounds, moans and
                     gore, you could only see danger" (ps.-Quint. <cite class="title italic">Decl</cite>. 9.6). Narratives regarding the sensory experience of the
                     Roman spectacle intermingle smell, sound, movement, and vision in quick
                     succession; there is both multiplicity as well as concurrency of sensory
                     experiences. The reader (or audience) who came to experience the Roman spectacle
                     sensed as well as envisioned, therefore experience should be viewed as a
                     totality of sensory elements and should be reiterated as such. Recreating this
                     sensory paroxysm by digital means, from <em class="emph">narrative ekphrasis</em> to
                     <em class="emph">digital ekphrasis</em>, poses further challenges. As illustrated,
                     the isolation of soundscapes needs to take into consideration words that are
                     beyond mere descriptions of sound. The abundance and complexity of sensory
                     information in Greek and Latin texts is without a doubt; yet synaesthetic
                     prototyping has not yet been conceived of as an option for 3D models. To begin
                     with, the digital as lens is a relatively young tool, let alone methodology.
                     While 3D modelling is continuously evolving, technologies of sound as a live and
                     experiential enactment is a very recent field, currently restricted to sound and
                     the film industry (see Auro3D at <a class="ref" href="http://www.galaxystudios.com/sound/" onclick="window.open('http://www.galaxystudios.com/sound/'); return false">http://www.galaxystudios.com/sound/</a>) with no further (read academic)
                     publications yet considered. Beyond academia, popular culture, in the form of
                     the film and television industry, has tried to recreate the experience of the
                     arena involving both image and sound, but normally falls into the discipline of
                     reception studies with minimum attention placed on how technology may affect our
                     understanding of antiquity. These issues in connection with user experience with
                     one medium (image) over the other (sound) is perhaps the culprit. If we are to
                     reconstruct the sounds of the arena we may not be able to recreate every aspect
                     of sound in its entirety, but we may use specific, thematically selected
                     narratives to illustrate a point with reference to a specific sound effect. The
                     section below attempts a methodology for a practical application of these
                     issues.

                  <div class="ptext" id="p23">This section presents a conceptual framework and methodology intended to help
                     scholars to address the complexity that inevitably characterises sensory
                     narrative about Roman entertainment. This "synaesthetic
                     prototyping" involves two distinct but interrelated cycles of
                     analysis. The first step is to undertake a thorough review of the Graeco-Roman
                     literature which references Roman entertainment. Special attention should be
                     paid to words that denote sensory elements, specifically those related to sound.
                     The second step draws on recent methodological research in the digital
                     humanities in order to creatively fill in gaps of knowledge and demonstrates
                     that sound can be metaphorically "mapped" onto digital
                     (visual) prototypes through the use of modern sound engineering schemes and
                     tables. This process allows sensory experiences of ancient sites to be further
                     explored through what can be described as imaginative fabrication. Synaesthetic
                     prototyping is based on the premise that there is an audience/reader accessing
                     the text, and that the narration of the experience has a sensory impact on them.
                     It allows scholars to make use of available technological tools in order that
                     through their digital recreation they may study sound in antiquity through a
                     sonic <em class="emph">digital ekphrasis</em>.

                     Consequently, there is a need for methodological approaches and outputs (such as
                     multisensory 3D models) that can make use of this kind of
                     "synaesthetic" quality of narratives in order that they
                     might provide more holistic understandings of the experiences of Roman
                     life.<a class="noteRef" href="#d4e621">[7]</a> Unfortunately, the technology is currently not fit for the
                     purpose: sound can be modelled in a way that other sensory data cannot. So, for
                     the purpose of this section, synaesthetic prototyping will focus on sounds
                     described in Graeco-Roman literature, and attempt to arrange them according to
                     their impact on the audience. In order to recreate and explore the possibilities
                     of sensory experience in context, a deeper reading is required. The reader reads
                     in order to sense, but s/he does not necessarily separate senses from one
                     another <span class="error"><a class="ref" href="#toner2014">#toner2014</a></span>, and this creates difficulties for
                     scholars seeking to mine texts for sensory data. The sounds we retrieve from
                     texts may have been meant to be imagined, especially in the case of Roman
                     spectacle. Thus, the isolation of soundscapes needs to take into consideration
                     words that are beyond mere descriptions of sound. Recreating this sensory
                     paroxysm by digital means, taking us from <em class="emph">narrative ekphrasis</em> to
                     <em class="emph">digital ekphrasis</em>, is the primary challenge that the
                     methodology herein proposed seeks to address. Although it is impossible to
                     recreate <em class="emph">every</em> aspect of the amphitheatre’s soundscape, but it is
                     possible to extract specific sound effects. Take for example the sounds of
                     hissing and applause described in a passage from Plutarch which refers to a
                     specific event in the Roman arena in 67 BCE:

                  <div class="ptext" id="p25">How can we appreciate the experience of hissing and applause as situated in this
                     particular historical and cultural setting? A synaesthetic understanding of
                     narrative experience implies that we can examine this question by reading the
                     sensory expressions together. Stated differently, we can begin to map out the
                     social significance of hissing by relating it to other sensory material in the
                     passages where applause occurs. By investigating these relations further, we can
                     deepen our understanding of the function of hissing, but also start to reflect
                     on nuances and varied forms of use of the same sound. That is, we trace a
                     particular sound through its appearance in a greater sensory ensemble. Through
                     such sensory investigation within the texts’ rhetorical <em class="emph">ekphrasis</em>
                     we can begin to critically examine what hissing actually entailed rather than
                     what hissing may have sounded like (the audio signals). This in turn allows for
                     a situated (re)making of the experience of hearing hissing and applause within
                     3D models. In this instance, hissing entailed that the majority of the audience
                     disapproved of Otho’s appearance. Plutarch does not state which of the two
                     classes persevered in their manifestation of feelings, but it is likely that the
                     equestrians were wealthier (since they could afford a horse) and perhaps fewer
                     in number. In any case, in spite of given hierarchies within the Roman empire,
                     the reaction of the audience and the sound it reproduced, confirm our
                     understanding of spectacle as a place and an occasion were political actors and
                     ideologies were exposed and (often) openly criticized - a form of social media/
                     popular culture of the past.

                     modes of listening, which is a technique that aims to facilitate the conceptual
                     creation of sound by engineers. Since 1995 our ability to identify and recreate
                     sounds has been influenced by the awareness of multiple modes of listening.
                     Chion (1994) was the first to introduce a more comprehensive scheme for modes of
                     listening.<a class="noteRef" href="#d4e676">[10]</a> Tuuri,
                     Mustonen and Pirhonen [<a class="ref" href="#tuuri2007">Tuuri et al. 2007</a>, 15–17)] advanced Chion’s
                     mode of listening into a table that contained and explained eight categories of
                     framing: two Pre-conscious modes, Reflexive (causing reflexing responses) and
                     Connotative (evoking freely formed associations); three Source-oriented sounds,
                     Causal (identifying cause), Empathetic (state of mind or intentions) and
                     Functional (purpose of sound); two Context-oriented sounds, Semantic
                     (symbolic/conventional meanings) and Critical (importance for the situation);
                     and a reduced sound (describing properties of the sound). The order of modes
                     implicates their level of the audiences’ cognitive abstraction from low to high
                     and can thus help conceptualise a soundscape which may help convey the
                     experience of the <span class="foreign i">ludi</span> (Table 1).

                     Pre-conscious sounds, such as background noise created by a crowd, can be
                     estimated from architectural and other evidence for the amphitheatre. The
                     cultural connotations are denoted through the sounds of hissing and applause;
                     from the context we understand that one sound is disapproving, whereas the other
                     is approving. The sounds of hissing and applause are also reflexive and causal:
                     they trigger one another. Each sound originates from a particular area of the
                     amphitheatre, an acoustic reflection of social status which is based on the
                     seating positions of equestrians and people. But how can we better understand
                     these sounds of hissing and applause beyond their being mere signals or binary
                     emotions? How does extraction of these sounds from Plutarch’s text enable
                     reconstruction of ancient events in contemporary digital media? If our goal is
                     to translate the sounds from classical literature into a digital form, isolating
                     a sound and conceptualising its level of cognition in sequence can indeed only
                     be done with a provisional use in mind. This process offers only glimpses of the
                     experience of Roman spectacle in its spatial and cultural contexts, and only
                     hints at the importance these sounds may have held for the audience (and indeed
                     the performers). Consequently, even if we manage to recreate the sound
                     accurately, the contemporary reception or experience of that sound may not be
                     the same – this cultural specificity of sensory experience is one of the
                     challenges, but also one of the attractions, of sensory archaeologies <span class="error"><a class="ref" href="#hamilakis2014">#hamilakis2014</a></span>.

                  <div class="ptext" id="p47">When combined with contemporary understandings and models of the acoustic
                     properties of the Roman spectacle, narratives such as the Plutarch extract
                     discussed here can be used to facilitate our comprehension of a variety of
                     performative and communicative activities, both between audience and
                     performance, and among spectators. Once we delve more deeply into our sources
                     for their sensory data, as in the soundscape illustrated in Table 1, we see that
                     the audience certainly held a strong sensory position within the Roman
                     amphitheatre, and that was critical to the effects of entertainment (what
                     Hamilakis describes as "affective"
                      <span class="error"><a class="ref" href="#hamilakis2014">#hamilakis2014</a></span>. The crowd was involved in an intense physical and verbal participation
                     and interaction: hissing, approving, disapproving and clapping. Once we
                     reconstruct these sensory scenarios we are engaged in an iterative process of
                     reconfiguration and conversation; then reflection begins. This process of
                     exploring the various configurations and alternative possibilities is what we
                     term as "synaesthetic prototyping".

                     entailment of sound within a specific screen environment and tried to match this
                     with real sounds (weather, fire, hissing, applause, the sound of weapons) that
                     evokes the contemporary equivalent. Since there is the risk that looking for the
                     semiotics of sound could lead one into exclusively non-audio territory we took
                     into consideration that a signifier (sound) can be discarded as an arbitrary
                     pointer to the significant, with the latter being of principal interest. For
                     phase one of our synesthetic prototyping, we used six speakers to arrange a
                     soundscape in Display Studio (see <a href="#figure01">figure 1</a>,

                     opposed to digital) we aimed for the sonic impression of a pre-industrial
                     setting. We then divided natural sounds (birds, rain, etc.) from artificial
                     (human-generated) sounds and we arranged them according to <a href="#table01">table 1</a> above, with the audience reaction as the
                     largest level of abstraction followed by Pre-conscious sounds, such as
                     background noise. We then placed sources (speakers in strategic position in our

                     reactions of the physical audience of the installation. This
                     "making" recognises that, no matter the data, via the
                     route of experiential analogy, information will always be incomplete and gaps
                     therefore need to be filled imaginatively in order to explore modes of knowledge

                  <div class="ptext" id="p50">In this article we have indicated some of the directions in which studies of
                     sound in the Roman amphitheatre could be taken, and in so doing, we hope to
                     address the need for new technological tools and theories to overcome the
                     problems with recreating ancient sounds. Archaeoacoustics facilitates an
                     understanding of sound and noise within a physical space, but has yet to be
                     applied to Roman sites. Digital modelling allows for the partial mapping of
                     Roman soundscapes. The study of soundscapes is a philosophical and conceptual
                     activity which goes beyond the physical reconstruction of the acoustic
                     properties of a space such as the Roman amphitheatre. Digital technology may
                     facilitate the reconstruction, experience and reassessment of the sounds within
                     a Roman amphitheatre, but the output is only as good as the data on which it is
                     based, as advanced as the technology used to capture and recreate it.
                     Graeco-Roman literature provides us with rich ekphrastic narratives and
                     contexts, and a synaesthetic approach enables a deep reading of those texts.
                     This deep reading of texts combined with digital modelling allows us to explore
                     various sensory configurations, each of them hypothetical due to the fragmentary
                     nature of the evidence and the cultural specificity of the experiences we seek
                     to recreate. Nevertheless, this is a worthy enterprise. Starting with the
                     assumption that during any live event there is an audience and a sensory (aural
                     for example) impact on the spectators, experiential analogy through synaesthetic
                     prototyping becomes a methodological device in itself. It aims to renegotiate
                     the importance sounds held for the Romans and break down our understanding of
                     the past as a mute, sanitized intellectual ideal. 
                  </div>
                  
                  <div class="counter"><a href="#p51">51</a></div>
                  <div class="ptext" id="p51">The Roman spectacle was an experience that involved the entire sensory spectrum,
                     for both its audience and its performers. In order to fully understand it, one
                     has to engage in its multisensory vitality. Digital prototyping and
                     installations of sensory data have the potential to bring out the cultural and
                     historical significance of the senses through immersive experiencing. Beyond
                     theoretical speculations, such an account of the senses in antiquity could
                     enhance the experience of cultural heritage exhibitions<a class="noteRef" href="#d4e927">[12]</a>, or add to peripatetic explorations of archaeology on-site. For
                     example, the recreation of an opening sacrifice to the Roman games will
                     incorporate both the sound and the visual effect of fire. It could also further
                     inform more popular industrial applications of antiquity: film and games, for
                     instance. Roman history and culture will no longer appear mute, or biased by
                     older, sanitized and whitewashed receptions of antiquity. The adoption and
                     canonisation of the noumenal as superior, bespeaks of <em class="emph">our very own</em>
                     hierarchic stratification within conditions of knowledge production. Against the
                     ocularcentric tradition, we finally argue that the potentials of digital
                     prototyping of sensory artefacts should aim to bring out the cultural and
                     historical significance of the senses for researchers and students. We may
                     recall that the scientific revolution was one of <em class="emph">sight</em>

                     confront the challenge not only of learning how to hear, but also of relearning
                     how to read in order to see and hear at the same time. And alongside its noise,
                     we can further challenge its (digital) ancient neatness. Challenging idealised
                     cultural stereotypes is certainly the first step to making Humanities relevant
                     to the actual study of humanity. With the intermediation of technology, Digital

                  describes games being raced by amateurs, rather than professionals. It gives
                  a sense of what it was like to sit down and watch the races as they
                  progressed. There are descriptions of sound, colours and movements in quick
                  succession. The whistling cheers of the hordes, the bright gleam of the
                  colours, white and blue, green and red on insignia. There is also a
                  description of the horses themselves: their sounds and movements as they
                  push, stamp, drag, struggle, rage, jump, fear and are feared (Sid. Ap.

                  sound activity that is both source as well as context orientated: "After these bands of dancers came a crowd of lyre-players
                  and many flute-players, and after them the people who carried the
                  censers in which perfumes and frankincense were burned along the whole
