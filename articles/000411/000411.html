                  <p>During the 2016–2017 financial year, King's Digital Lab (King's College London)
                     undertook an extensive archiving and sustainability project to ensure the
                     ongoing management, security, and sustainability of ~100 digital humanities
                     projects, produced over a twenty-year period. Many of these projects, including
                     seminal publications such as <cite class="title italic">Aphrodisias in Late
                        Antiquity</cite>, <cite class="title italic">Inscriptions of Roman
                        Tripolitania</cite>, <cite class="title italic">Henry III Fine Rolls</cite>,
                     <cite class="title italic">Jonathan Swift Archive</cite>, <cite class="title italic">Jane Austen Manuscripts</cite>, <cite class="title italic">The Gascon
                        Rolls</cite>, <cite class="title italic">The Gough Map</cite>, and <cite class="title italic">Inquisitions
                        Post Mortem</cite>, occupy important positions in the history of digital humanities. Of
                     the projects inherited by the lab, about half are either of exceptionally high
                     quality or seminal in other ways, but almost all of them struggled with funding
                     and technical issues that threatened their survival. By taking a holistic
                     approach to infrastructure, and software engineering and maintenance, the lab
                     has resolved the majority of the issues and secured the short to medium term
                     future of the projects in its care. This article details the conceptual,
                     procedural, and technical approaches used to achieve that, and offers policy
                     recommendations to avoid repetition of the situation in the future.

               <div class="ptext" id="p1">Digital Humanities (DH) research has reached an inflection point. On the one hand
                  it
                  appears to be in robust health, with an active community spread around the world,
                  well-attended annual conferences, several well-established centres of excellence (be
                  they labs, institutes, or departments), and new initiatives appearing on a regular
                  basis. Activity is particularly strong in the United Kingdom, North America, and
                  Europe, with significant work being done in Asia and Australasia, and important new
                  initiatives developing in South America and Africa. University courses are
                  proliferating at graduate and undergraduate level, and advances are being made to
                  pedagogy [<a class="ref" href="#hirsch2012">Hirsch 2012</a>]. Intermittent criticism of the field is a sign
                  of increasing intellectual vitality, as colleagues in neighbouring disciplines
                  question its popularity and interrogate its intellectual, ideological, and ethical
                  foundations [<a class="ref" href="#eyers2013">Eyers 2013</a>]
                  [<a class="ref" href="#allington2016">Allington et al. 2016</a>]. This activity has appeared at the same time as the
                  notion and utility of DH infrastructure has been questioned [<a class="ref" href="#rockwell2010">Rockwell 2010</a>], and project teams have been forced to explore ways
                  projects can not only be sustained but elegantly ended [<a class="ref" href="#carlin2006">Carlin et al. 2006</a>].
                  Despite inheriting a relatively deep tradition, we are only beginning to understand
                  the dense entanglements that accrue over time between digital humanists,
                  administrators, and the web servers, programming languages, and tools, we use to
                  produce our publications.

               <div class="ptext" id="p2">While technical digital humanities teams now have a vastly more sophisticated range
                  of options than previous generations, including corporate-grade cloud services and
                  free online services, this has done little to ease the problem of maintainability
                  or
                  sustainability - especially for high quality digital scholarship. Idiosyncratic
                  solutions to specific research questions in this emerging field has left us with a
                  legacy corpus developed from the 1990s into the 2000s which raises new challenges
                  in
                  terms of sustainability. Problems that have been deferred for years, sometimes
                  decades, have become pressing. A generation of legacy projects that need maintenance
                  but are out of funding have reached critical stages of their lifecycles, an
                  increasingly hostile security context has made DH projects potential attack vectors
                  into institutional networks, heterogeneous and often delicate technologies have
                  complicated the task of maintenance, and an increasing number of emerging formats
                  have made archiving and preservation yet more difficult. This presents a
                  significant, and growing, challenge for the community – and one that needs to be
                  resolved through increased awareness of the issues, evolved management of digital
                  humanities infrastructure, attention to the full lifecycle of projects, and
                  inventive approaches to funding that extend the life and impact of valuable research
                  by sharing costs across funding agencies and institutions. This article aims to
                  contribute to that process by initiating a conversation and explaining the
                  experience and some solutions implemented in King’s Digital Lab (KDL) but does not
                  aim to present a straight-forward “How To” guide for other teams.
                  The realisation of robust and holistic approaches to the maintenance of digital
                  research outputs is a matter of some urgency, but no single solution will work for
                  every digital humanities team.

               <div class="counter"><a href="#p3">3</a></div>
               <div class="ptext" id="p3">It is clear, however, that sustainable management of digital outputs that have
                  survived beyond their initial funding has become a major problem. It is time to
                  admit our problems and share our conceptual and procedural solutions. Such projects,
                  although of central importance to the wider field of digital humanities and
                  humanities scholarship generally, present a range of challenges. In the academic and
                  financial year 2016-2017<a class="noteRef" href="#d4e299">[1]</a>, KDL worked on 6–8 funded projects at any one time and was
                  involved in external grant proposals with a total value of £26m (GBP), together with
                  collaborators across a wide variety of universities and cultural heritage
                  organisations in London, the United Kingdom, Europe, and the United States. This
                  constituted the lab’s primary activity and is at the core of its raison d'être. In
                  the same year, however, the lab completed assessment (followed by archiving,
                  migration, or upgrade) of ~100 digital humanities projects undertaken over twenty
                  years of activity at King’s College London and inherited from earlier instantiations
                  of DH, including the Centre for Computing in the Humanities (CCH), the Centre for
                  eResearch in the Humanities (CeRch), and the Department of Digital Humanities (DDH).
                  The projects came both with, but mainly without, ongoing funding. This corpus of
                  publications represents valuable and impactful research, as well as significant
                  investment from funding bodies, and research and heritage institutions. Humanities
                  scholars rely on and make ongoing reference to the work contained in it, which is
                  increasingly being integrated into global Linked Open Data initiatives supported by
                  libraries, archives, museums, and other digital humanities teams.

               <div class="ptext" id="p4">Finding a comprehensive and scalable approach to sustainable development in digital
                  humanities labs is a non-trivial problem. Any solution must be tailored to the local
                  environment and help support not only the complexity and range of digital
                  scholarship, but financial and operational issues and more fundamental problems
                  related to entropy of software systems and digital infrastructure. It also needs to
                  allow for the fact that digital tools and infrastructure do not allow for perfect
                  process, perfect archiving, or perfect security: at some point it is always
                  necessary to retreat to principles of risk management and cost-benefit analysis. The
                  work presented here involved coordination with technical specialists, researchers,
                  administrative and financial university staff, and colleagues in IT and the library.
                  It helped KDL transition many digital humanities projects from an insecure to a
                  sustainable basis, but the work is incomplete and will - in a fundamental sense -
                  never end. Some projects, moreover, cannot be “saved” despite
                  best intentions. Rather than aim for perfect process, KDL have chosen to accept
                  archiving and sustainability as a permanent issue that requires ongoing care and
                  attention. It has been added to the lab’s Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC)
                  engineering process and is considered from our very first conversations with new
                  project partners. Our experience is shared here to open a conversation and, rather
                  than proposing simple solutions or demanding policy change, to invite discussion.

                  <div class="ptext" id="p5">King’s Digital Lab (KDL) was launched in November 2015 at King’s College London.
                     The lab evolved from the Centre for Computing and the Humanities (established
                     1991) and the Centre for eResearch in the Humanities (established 2008), which
                     merged to form the Department of Digital Humanities (DDH) in 2011. At the time
                     of writing, DDH delivers 5 masters programmes, 1 PhD programme and an
                     undergraduate programme to ~500 students and comprises ~40 academic staff. KDL
                     was founded to increase digital capability and generate external grant income
                     for digital projects within DDH, and across the Faculty of Arts &amp; Humanities
                     as a whole: it is an independent Arts &amp; Humanities department in its own
                     right, specialising in digital humanities software development but increasingly
                     working with social scientists too. The team sometimes act as Principal or
                     Co-Investigators on grants but always work in unison with colleagues in other
                     departments and/or institutions, implementing a model for digital humanities
                     research at scale.

                  <div class="ptext" id="p6">Unlike core academic departments, which engage in teaching as well as research,
                     KDL is dedicated to research software engineering (RSE), and the implementation
                     of the systems, infrastructure, tools, and processes that are needed to produce
                     digital scholarly outputs. The lab has 12 permanent full-time staff to support
                     these activities: analysts, developers, designers, a systems manager, a project
                     manager, and the director, and maintains its own server and network
                     infrastructure. The team work in close collaboration with the university’s IT
                     department and evolving University eResearch team. KDL’s research philosophy is
                     evolving: it lies at the intersection of human research and technical systems,
                     exploring and exploiting the creative synergies fostered by this encounter to
                     push the boundaries of digital humanities forward. Taking an active interest in
                     research methodology as well as inevitable business and technical realities, the

                     of historicisation - an acknowledgment of the reality of digital scholarship in
                     early 21st century higher education - and a pragmatic response to the inherited
                     and emergent issues outlined in this paper. The design and engineering of
                     software and its supporting infrastructures is a problem that needs to be
                     conceived as at once technical, political, economic, and <em class="emph">human</em>.
                     While the lab exists to engage in technical development, it is mandated to
                     explore the epistemic and methodological implications of digital humanities
                     development and can contribute to the broader field from a unique vantage point.
                     Its institutional setting, technical expertise, and exposure to research
                     problems that only time can generate positions it to explore fundamental issues
                     of digital theory and method (including but not limited to digital entropy),
                     while at the same time developing innovative methods for new research.

                     range and scholarly value: it represents a key corpus in the history of digital
                     humanities. Digital Humanities at King’s College is indebted to a group of
                     people who were instrumental in developing a range of projects inherited by KDL.
                     Colleagues like Harold Short, John Bradley, Willard McCarty, Charlotte Roueché,
                     Marilyn Deegan, and Paul Spence, were involved in a remarkable array of projects
                     of enormous scholarly value. In collaboration with PIs, both at King’s College
                     and in partner institutions, their work provided the core of the lab’s
                     inheritance including flagship projects such as <cite class="title italic">Aphrodisias

                     high quality or seminal in other ways. This is a sizeable
                     “estate” to manage, but the authors are aware of at least
                     one team managing considerably more, and more than one team who have suffered
                     serious security breaches because of unmaintained applications. Teams struggling
                     with the issues are located in the United States and Europe as well as the
                     United Kingdom, suggesting any issues with policy and approach transcend
                     national borders.<a class="noteRef" href="#d4e498">[4]</a> Such circumstances entail a considerable
                     moral bind: either ignore the demands of (some) project owners that their
                     projects’ digital publications and data continue in perpetuity and turn them off
                     (risking reputational damage and reducing the number of DH projects available to
                     users, more often than not initially supported via public funding), introduce
                     financial risk by maintaining them gratis (absorbing unfunded maintenance costs
                     and undermining other activities), or do nothing and accept the existential
                     risks that accompany a major security breach.

                     associated with the systems that generate and store that data. Collaborators
                     often become uneasy at the use of “industry” frameworks and
                     “business” language, suggesting (understandably) that it
                     detracts from academic research culture. Meanwhile, some critics of the digital
                     humanities appear to be unaware that a universe of very high quality, bespoke,
                     but at-risk digital scholarship exists far away from the values and commercial
                     imperatives of Silicon Valley ideology.<a class="noteRef" href="#d4e510">[5]</a> In that sense, this paper is an account of a course
                     charted between Charybdis and Scylla, seeking to protect a cargo of scholarship
                     from technical and financial realities, the barbs of critics, the
                     corporatisation of higher education, and gaps in national policy. Were it not
                     for the fact that this is <em class="emph">the precise set of operational tensions</em>
                     that drives the intellectual and creative culture of laboratories like KDL, and
                     the support of an almost uniformly understanding group of project owners and
                     stakeholders, the combined pressures would be insufferable. Given this, we view
                     this article as an opportunity to articulate the issues facing teams like KDL,
                     gesture towards some of our solutions, and make it easier for other teams to
                     share their experiences and request the resources needed to mitigate issues.

                  <div class="ptext" id="p11">The ~100 projects inherited by KDL range across several DH sub-disciplines, with
                     a focus on Digital Classics (23 projects), Digital History (23 projects), and
                     Digital Literary Studies (14 projects). Another group can be best described as
                     Digital Humanities (20 projects), with smaller but important groups in Digital
                     Musicology (5 projects), Cultural Studies (5 projects), and Spanish Studies (4
                     projects). A further 5 are best described as inter-disciplinary. New projects
                     appear on a regular basis, of course, meaning the precise numbers constantly
                     shift. Surprisingly, and accepting that five years is a long time in the digital
                     world, 77 of the projects are less than 5 years old, with only 22 projects more
                     than five years old. Of more concern is the fact that, when KDL was established,
                     the majority of these projects were “orphaned”, without
                     funding for maintenance. In lieu of merely shutting them down, they had been
                     kept live with little or no maintenance, resulting in some unacceptably old
                     operating systems remaining in production. This is by no means out of step with
                     the situation at many organisations (commercial or otherwise). It reflects an
                     era in the history of computing when technological optimism was somewhat higher
                     and security risks somewhat lower than they are today.

                  <div class="ptext" id="p12">We would like to note, in this context, that our openness in publishing the
                     details of the situation is relatively unusual and should indicate the
                     importance we feel the subject holds for the global humanities and social
                     science communities, and the library and archival teams that support them. We
                     have a good degree of confidence the issues have been resolved, as far as is
                     possible given today’s environment and the evolving security threats it
                     presents, but – more importantly – feel it is time to have an open conversation
                     about these issues. Teams like KDL struggle with issues presented by myriad
                     pressures: it is neither fair nor productive for Principal Investigators (PIs),
                     funding agencies, and the wider community, to have the reality of those
                     pressures hidden from them. Significantly, rather than seeing such issues as
                     embarrassments, to be hidden from administrators, funders, and colleagues inside
                     and outside our institution, the lab recognises them as research opportunities
                     for developing enhanced methodologies. It can be noted, too, that this attitude
                     represents continuity with the history of digital humanities at King’s College
                     rather than a departure from it. Previous generations of colleagues, including
                     Harold Short, Marilyn Deegan, Lorna Hughes, and Sheila Anderson, tried to prompt
                     policy change at a national level (most clearly through the Arts &amp;
                     Humanities Data Service, but also through regular connection with national
                     funding bodies and other organisations), but their efforts were not supported at
                     crucial moments [<a class="ref" href="#rusbridge2007">Rusbridge 2007</a>]. Our goal is to empower similar
                     teams to seek and secure the support needed to do their jobs, and contribute to
                     the development of guidelines, standards and policies that can guide digital
                     scholarship. This ambition needs to be seen in a wider context that includes
                     issues of not only technical and financial sustainability but equitable career
                     paths, ethical attribution, diversity, and DH in developing countries.

                  <div class="ptext" id="p13">Although (again) by no means unusual, the details of KDL’s technical estate in
                     late 2015 would give many systems administrators sleepless nights. KDL projects
                     were running: Windows 2003 (2 servers); Windows 2008 (9 servers); Debian 4 (13
                     servers); Debian 5 (32 servers); Debian 6 (33 servers); Debian 7 (10 servers).
                     The preponderance of Linux servers reduced risk significantly, but the age of
                     many of those was enough to be a risk even before the potential impact of
                     weaponised hacking tools on mainstream institutional systems became clear. All
                     servers were backed up, onto older machines that were adequate but not entirely
                     fit for purpose, and a significant security breach could have led to several
                     days' downtime while the systems were restored to their previous best-known
                     state. It was initially difficult to communicate this to some project owners,
                     who were unaware of the need for infrastructure maintenance, and the risks their
                     servers posed. The WannaCry event prompted a marked change, however. PIs who had
                     previously resisted sharing responsibility for their projects’ security
                     immediately allowed KDL to turn off servers until emergency patching had been
                     completed or (in the worst cases), both server and application had been rebuilt.
                     The lab was close to taking this action unilaterally, regardless, for the good
                     of everyone involved. The consciousness-raising that accompanied WannaCry,
                     following its impact on the UK National Health Services (NHS) and other key
                     digital infrastructures, made the process considerably easier [<a class="ref" href="#cellan-jones2017">Cellan-Jones and Lee 2017</a>].

                     date and patched application frameworks (the body of code that enables the
                     websites, databases, archives, and digital scholarly editions end-users interact
                     with), which can be equally difficult to maintain. As with the use of Linux,
                     decisions to build using open source tools lowered risk significantly but did
                     not eliminate the need for basic ongoing maintenance. 26 of the oldest projects
                     were built using Java, but 52 were built using the Python-based web framework
                     Django, which has proven to be relatively secure. When coupled with the bespoke
                     XML-based publishing solutions xMod and Kiln (used for digital scholarly
                     editions), security risk and associated costs were almost entirely removed - but
                     these tools could not be used for every project. The most problematic projects
                     in the legacy portfolio were built using PHP-based frameworks such as WordPress
                     and Typo 3, which were promptly removed from KDL servers wherever possible.
                     Exceptions aside, analysis of the lab’s application security validated and
                     renewed our focus on a more limited technology stack based on Linux, Python,
                     Django, and associated supporting tools. Other labs might undertake similar
                     analysis and conclude they should focus on a stack <em class="emph">including</em>
                     Windows and PHP-based tools and <em class="emph">excluding</em> Linux and frameworks like
                     Django (to better align to their technical history and capabilities): the issue
                     is a matter of systems maintenance and security, not a reflection of the
                     so-called “programming language wars”
                      [<a class="ref" href="#stefik2014">Stefik and Hanenberg 2014</a>]. Experimentation with a range of new technologies continues, particularly
                     in emerging frameworks to support augmented and virtual reality, but long-term
                     support is focused on the core tool set.

                     projects inherited by KDL, and detailed in this paper, were developed using
                     funding that only supported technical development and limited post launch
                     hosting of projects. Limited or no support existed for significant post-funding
                     system maintenance. In that sense, the funders <em class="emph">themselves</em> signalled
                     that they did not expect (or were not prepared to support) the development of
                     long-term or permanent digital resources: without the goodwill of colleagues and
                     the host institution most of them would have been closed years ago. Their future
                     was often only discussed tangentially, elided in conversations between technical
                     teams and PIs during the development process, in the optimistic hope
                     “something” would happen eventually, and that either the
                     funding agencies would see the value of the scholarly assets being built, or a
                     national solution would be implemented to protect them – or, in the absence of
                     the realisation of such hopes, that hosting institutions would support them
                     gratis in perpetuity. PIs shifted emotional responsibility onto technical teams,
                     and vice-versa: actual contractual responsibility was normally left
                     undefined.

                     the lack of knowledge about the many intersecting issues in play. Many of the
                     projects hosted by KDL were produced during seminal years in the history of the
                     field, when flagship digital humanities projects demonstrated the potential that
                     digital tools and methods held for arts and humanities research, and they are

                     straightforward to maintain, and that libraries would develop subscription
                     models able to support bespoke non-commercial projects - held back proactive
                     funding of archiving and sustainability initiatives [<a class="ref" href="#turner2008">Turner 2008</a>].
                     Funding agencies and researchers alike assumed that their role was to prompt
                     expansion and illustrate possibilities, and that issues of maintenance and
                     sustainability would be resolved in the future. This attitude was
                     understandable, but it is having a serious impact on teams who have inherited
                     multiple high profile (and now unfunded) projects that are well beyond their
                     initial funding periods. That is not to suggest that earlier generations of
                     digital humanists did nothing to plan for the future, however. UK colleagues
                     often cite the defunding of the Arts &amp; Humanities Data Service<a class="noteRef" href="#d4e579">[6]</a> and the AHRC ICT Methods Network<a class="noteRef" href="#d4e591">[7]</a> at the start
                     of the millennium as signal events that undermined the future of multiple

                     Andrew Russell and Lee Vinsel point out that the technology industry is so

                     unsustainable projects, the central <span class="foreign i">raison

                     is no reason the worst scenarios (permanent loss of multiple flagship digital
                     humanities projects) should come to pass. As Smithies has argued elsewhere, a
                     wider view of digital humanities infrastructure, in its technical as well as
                     intellectual and ethical dimensions, can provide perspectives that aid not only
                     technical development and management, but the development of ethical
                     perspectives, and greater purchase over business decision-making and funding
                     policy [<a class="ref" href="#smithies2017">Smithies 2017</a>, 113–151]. Only by exploring this wider
                     perspective can an appropriate understanding be gained, and supporting policy
                     developed. Patrik Svensson takes a similar approach in his recent book about DH

                     infrastructure is often written by people more invested in the easy development
                     of new projects (and thus the easy availability of development teams and server

                     than helps the sustainability argument [<a class="ref" href="#anderson2013">Anderson 2013</a>]. The
                     situation is further complicated by widespread cynicism about large-scale

                     Project Bamboo in the United States [<a class="ref" href="#dombrowski2014">Dombrowski 2014</a>], which aimed
                     to create a large national cyberinfrastructure in the humanities but foundered

                     that digital humanities needs to assess its own requirements, and not assume
                     that infrastructures designed for one purpose will fit another, but it is

                     open-ended contracts and then embed archiving and maintenance deep into the
                     culture of technical development, from requirements definition and the
                     identification of digital research tools and methods, through to infrastructure
                     design, deployment and maintenance. This is based on a conception of
                     “infrastructure” that moves beyond material technical necessities,
                     templates, and process documents (as essential as they are), towards one that
                     acknowledges the centrality of people, funding, ethics, technology strategy,
                     software engineering method, and data management to the long-term health of our
                     research infrastructures. This becomes even more pressing if we acknowledge the
                     wider epistemological and methodological shifts occurring across scientific and
                     humanistic disciplines, related to the emergence of data science but also myriad
                     new forms of research dissemination and product development. The community needs
                     to recognise that high quality research requires attention to long-term digital
                     sustainability if quality is to be maintained. This extends well beyond the
                     specifically <em class="emph">digital</em> humanities, of course, and relates to all
                     disciplines and interdisciplinary efforts that use digital tools and methods.
                     Importantly, the failure (or sub-optimal performance) of previous large-scale
                     infrastructure efforts supports the argument for greater attention to the need
                     for investment in human capital and process maturity alongside capital
                     investment. This suggests the need for a range of initiatives from institutions
                     engaging in DH activity and funding agencies supporting it, from the development
                     of viable technical career paths, to training in basic software development
                     methods: archiving and sustainability is only one aspect.

                     frameworks that enables digital scholarship. Much like research, software
                     development rarely takes a linear path, and the relative volatility of the open
                     web and rapid development of new technologies presents an ecosystem within which
                     published work needs to be protected and maintained over time. Rather than
                     presenting a pristine environment for artefacts, the digital environment, much
                     like the physical one, presents challenges of an economic, political and
                     entropic nature. The precarious existence of artefacts in the physical world,
                     and the evolving responses from the research community to their preservation and
                     documentation, therefore inform our digital practises. To this end, KDL uses an
                     approach to the funding and management of research projects that considers the
                     complexities of not just the research, but also software development and its
                     ongoing sustainability in a changing digital landscape. While slightly
                     increasing initial costs, the benefits of this approach accrue over time -
                     particularly in relation to academic impact, but also medium and long-term

                  <div class="ptext" id="p26">Our experience suggests that, much as with traditional production and publication
                     of research materials of archival quality, digital projects benefit from being
                     planned and executed with their longevity in mind from the start. This often
                     involves updating scholarly content, but always involves technical maintenance
                     to ensure the publication remains accessible. This places additional importance
                     on consistency and transparency in approach, supported by effective
                     dissemination and internal peer review of technical documentation. Maintenance
                     and ongoing hosting of a digitally published research project needs to be
                     included in grant application budgets, reflecting the life-cycle of the project
                     beyond the date of publication, with a set of maintenance milestones determined
                     at the outset. This is not merely good operational practice, but an indication
                     of the intellectual maturity of the project. Proper understanding of digital
                     scholarship requires an acknowledgement of its entropic nature; the absence of
                     forward planning implies a misunderstanding of the object being produced at a
                     fundamental – perhaps ontological – level. KDL’s process is thus guided by a
                     desire to enable high quality digital scholarship, balancing technical and
                     financial issues with the intellectual and historical significance of the
                     project alongside a consideration of its impact, future funding potential, and
                     potential contribution to the UK Research Excellence Framework (REF). The
                     process blends experience with common sense, rather than being anything
                     particularly complicated.

                     emergent tensions between the envisioned and manifest material, financial, and

                     is unreasonable to expect funding agencies to provide ongoing funding for all
                     projects, it does seem reasonable to ask their support for projects that are

                     a range of archival approaches, and integration into Research Data Management

                     additional technical work has been initiated behind the scenes at King’s
                     College, in a self-funded collaboration between the lab and the DH department.
                     The goal is to create a “data lake” of metadata and digital
                     objects collected over the history of DH at King’s, and comprising over 5
                     million digital objects, for use in teaching as well as research. This is part
                     of a commitment to the implementation of deep infrastructure to support DH
                     archiving, which will be aligned to institutional research data management
                     infrastructure and made openly available to the wider community. Work is
                     progressing slowly, as time and funding allows, but the goal is to create a
                     suite of approaches that can be used in the future.

                     material for collection, use, and preservation. KDL’s process for archiving
                     inherited “legacy” projects reflects this. Rather than
                     relying on rigid assessment matrices or requiring slavish attention to
                     cost-benefit analyses, it is self-consciously oriented towards relatively
                     subjective issues of “scholarly and intellectual value” and
                     “cultural heritage value”. These need to be balanced
                     against hard operational and financial realities, but it was decided relatively
                     early in the process that it would not be possible to create a procrustean
                     assessment framework that could be applied rigorously to all projects: the
                     heterogeneous nature of the projects (technically as well as intellectually),
                     the frequent mismatch between scholarly value and straight-forward impact
                     metrics such as web traffic, as well as uneven access to funding meant that a
                     more holistic - but still consistent and transparent - process needed to be
                     adopted.

                     complexity, security risk, maintenance cost, infrastructure cost, PI engagement,
                     institutional support, value to KDL, and value to King’s College. Early
                     assessments used a tabular matrix to guide analysis, but this was quickly
                     abandoned as too limiting: recommendations are made in prose form, allowing
                     quantitative and qualitative issues to be taken into account. A brief
                     “business case”, including recommendations and costs, is then presented
                     to the Vice Dean Research, Faculty of Arts &amp; Humanities, and a decision is
                     made. Problematic cases can be referred to the Faculty Research and Impact Team
                     (FRIT), and upwards to the Dean if necessary. The process, at this high level,
                     works very well. Simon Tanner’s notion of a “balanced view”, assessing value using both subjective
                     and objective measures, allows the lab to act as liaison between the projects
                     and University, and thus support the projects and the wider DH community [<a class="ref" href="#tanner2012">Tanner 2012</a>]. The key principle is that KDL acts as facilitator
                     rather than decision-maker, providing professional digital humanities analysis
                     to both PI and management. This requires resources to engage in due diligence,
                     willingness to steward sometimes difficult conversations, and occasional
                     recommendations that projects be archived rather than maintained in their live
                     state, but the process ensures all stakeholders have equal access to information

                     sustainability issues. During the financial year 2016/2017, the lab undertook a
                     complete audit of all projects held on its servers, including inherited legacy
                     projects, and developed processes for realistic costing of their maintenance and
                     hosting. In tandem, the lab set up contractual agreements that supported the
                     reintegration of the updated legacy projects brought under Service Level
                     Agreements (SLA) into the broader production processes of the lab. During the
                     final four months of the financial year 2016/2017, one full-time member of staff
                     was dedicated to the implementation of the new processes, with the intention to
                     bring all prior legacy projects into current processes under SLA, migrate
                     projects not suited to further managed hosting at KDL to the university’s IT
                     department (ITS), external hosting, or a static legacy server, and archiving the
                     remainder. A pilot phase was conducted using the portfolios of two prolific
                     King’s College researchers. Business cases for those projects were submitted to
                     the Faculty of Arts &amp; Humanities, resulting in approval for 5 years’ support
                     and maintenance.

                     clarify the extent and duration of KDL’s commitment. These are now issued as
                     part of the release process of any project approaching finalisation and launch,
                     and discussed with PIs in the earliest stages of project definition. As the
                     pilot phase progressed, technical and supporting data about additional projects
                     was gathered, including historical information about funding, PIs/Co-Is,
                     external stakeholders, and infrastructure. This required the identification and
                     synthesis of multiple historical sources but enabled KDL to gain an overview of
                     the extent of the legacy projects, including dependencies and risks. The
                     information was collated and included in documentation that supported the
                     reintegration of each project into the lab’s active production cycle, whether
                     that be via managed decommissioning, migration, or defined support and
                     maintenance underwritten by key stakeholders. Based on this high-level
                     assessment, 29 projects were dealt with almost immediately in a first phase that
                     involved them being taken offline and archived by storing database dumps and
                     content files in zip files, because they were incomplete, or incurred security
                     risk out of all proportion to their scholarly value.<a class="noteRef" href="#d4e832">[10]</a> Others required only basic maintenance to make them
                     secure. A further 35 were scheduled for Phase 2,<a class="noteRef" href="#d4e835">[11]</a> and 35 for Phase
                     3.<a class="noteRef" href="#d4e850">[12]</a> Only legacy projects that were no
                     longer in active development were considered. Another class of project,
                     inherited from DDH but still in active development, were dealt with using a
                     different process. A second key document - the Statement of Work (SoW) - evolved
                     to fit a subsidiary need: to detail and cost work required to bring projects up
                     to an acceptable standard for ongoing hosting. That might only involve simple
                     server upgrades, requiring half a day, or several weeks of active development to
                     rebuild the site in its entirety.<a class="noteRef" href="#d4e853">[13]</a></div>

                     the approved SLAs are all finite - ranging from two to five years - but equally
                     important to note that agreement was reached only after robust business cases
                     were produced, detailing the scholarly and cultural heritage value, the
                     significance to the Research Excellence Framework (REF), the
                     “brand” value to the university, and the PI’s future

                     of the projects more apparent. This process, resulting in much-needed clarity
                     around project cost, value, and mutual expectations, was a necessary first step
                     towards the faculty managing its digital assets in a more transparent and
                     cost-effective way, and in alignment to its wider strategic direction. It is
                     perhaps not an ideal solution, which would involve limitless funds and
                     assurances of perpetual support, but it is practical and (we think) sensible
                     given the complexities of long-term technology management and the need to accept
                     competing needs for finite funds.

                     At the very least their data and a public metadata record will be retained: the
                     future of each project can be discussed on a case-by-case basis. Enhanced
                     transparency has also facilitated co-funding arrangements (between College,

                     average SLA cost of ~£2000 GBP per year to an extremely reasonable level for
                     each party. It is equally important to note that KDL are currently authorised to
                     charge maintenance and hosting at cost recovery level, far below commercial
                     rates (this is the case for normal project work too). This might need to be
                     adjusted in future years, to manage demand if nothing else, but was a crucial
                     element in explaining and justifying the archiving and sustainability projects

                     to produce “orphan” projects with uncertain futures. If a
                     tone of frustration is detected in this article it stems from the relatively
                     common-sense nature of the solutions, coupled with the significant stress placed
                     on teams like KDL by a lack of robust policy. This is not to criticise funding
                     agencies, who have been learning about the implications of digital scholarship
                     alongside the communities they serve (they do an excellent job, with limited
                     resources) but it is important to recognise the human cost of poorly managed

                     worsen rather than improve the situation in that country, by requiring data

                     and awareness of KDL as a new initiative. Expectations of ongoing hosting and
                     maintenance were often ill-defined, and reliant on memory rather than crisp
                     documentation: a result, again, of the loose requirements for archiving and
                     sustainability in past years, as well as changes in personnel and restructuring.
                     In many cases, the production of a SLA was all that was required for the PI to
                     request support from their university (so that they had a simple document to
                     present to administrative teams, usually with only a modest cost attached). If

                     project or stood to benefit from its ongoing maintenance, King’s College would
                     support a proportion of the SLA. Discussions could become difficult in more
                     complex cases, such as when significant work needed to be undertaken to upgrade
                     the project, or maintenance costs were above the average (normally due to
                     significant use of disk space) but all PIs, internal and external, were offered
                     three scenarios:

                     A range of “archival solutions” have been considered, ranging
                     from removing complex front-end websites and archiving data, to software
                     emulation, and packaging sites as virtual machines for offline use. The basic
                     philosophy is to embrace heterogeneity of archival solutions, in line with the
                     heterogeneity of the projects themselves. Bespoke approaches are developed on a
                     case-by-case basis, although always in alignment with wider university, national
                     and (where appropriate) international infrastructure initiatives.

                     discussing an arrangement with the British Library National Web Archive to
                     improve technical and procedural alignment. King’s Research Data Management
                     system is likely to be used for preservation of raw research data along with the
                     lab’s own server infrastructure. A project has been completed with the British
                     Museum to produce static sites (more conducive to future archiving) from one of
                     their legacy projects [<a class="ref" href="#jakeman2018">Jakeman 2018</a>], and a collaboration with
                     Stanford University Press is exploring new modes of digital publishing to
                     balance advanced features with sustainability and maintainability [<a class="ref" href="#ciula2017">Ciula 2017</a>]. The internal project referred to above, with the
                     Department of Digital Humanities, aims to aggregate Digital Humanities content
                     stored at King’s College and making it publicly available for reuse so that even
                     if some projects do lose their active web presence, their data will still be
                     accessible. The lab is beginning to consider in some technical detail the
                     different options available for archiving and preservation, including the
                     difference between presentation and data layers, the possibility of preserving
                     functionally limited but usable “static” websites rather than
                     complete systems, the possibility of packaging publications into downloadable
                     “virtual machines” that can be run on the desktop, and
                     coupling all of these approaches with “snapshots” stored in
                     the British Library National Web Archive and Internet Archive. The work
                     described in this paper only becomes tractable through a range of solutions, in
                     other words, conducted using a research-oriented frame of mind that seeks to
                     embed archiving and preservation deeply within core digital humanities theory,
                     method, practice, and policy. Improved policy and infrastructure at a national
                     level would help significantly, but this is a multi-faceted issue that will
                     require broad-based input and support.

                     transparent processes were in place, and clear options determined, emails were
                     sent to PIs <span class="foreign i">en masse</span> to accelerate phases Two
                     and Three. It had become essential the assessment process not drag on,
                     undermining the future of the lab, so there was a degree of nervousness about
                     potential responses. In the initial email to project partners, a deadline for
                     responses within 6 weeks from the sending date was given, after which Faculty
                     would be notified of the status of the resource. After a further month, the
                     permission would be sought from Faculty to archive the projects of
                     non-responsive project partners. This timeline was clearly set out in the emails
                     and followed to the letter. Responses were largely swift and positive, with
                     allowing mutually acceptable solutions to be identified in collaboration.
                     Project partners generally responded to initial contact well within the stated
                     time, and often immediately. Responses were broadly appreciative, and the
                     rationale for putting older digital research outputs on secure footing appeared
                     intuitively clear. This raises the question of whether resistance to adopting
                     best practice across the wider research community is exaggerated: it is perhaps
                     more the case that robust methods and clear processes are lacking, and funding
                     policy acts against their development.

                     King’s Digital Lab operates on a non-profit basis (with accordingly slim
                     margins), so one of the most fundamental stages in assessment of the legacy
                     projects was the audit of not just the digital resources held on KDL servers,
                     but also defining the costs involved in their responsible ongoing management and
                     hosting. In this sense the lab performed an administrative and communicative
                     role, rather than acting as judge and jury. The inherently positive nature of
                     the process made it more likely PIs would respond well and allowed the lab to
                     streamline the further processing of legacy projects, and minimise detailed
                     negotiation and problem solving for which there is limited resource. The aim was
                     to conclude the financial year of 2016/2017 with no undocumented or out of
                     contract legacy projects remaining on KDL servers, and all legacy projects that
                     were neither migrated nor archived being brought under Service Level
                     Agreements.

                  <div class="ptext" id="p41">That was not completely achieved, but results were satisfactory. At the time of
                     writing all assessment and decision-making has been completed, Service Level
                     Agreements are in place for projects that are to remain hosted on KDL servers,
                     migration has occurred or is scheduled for other projects, and archiving of the
                     remainder will occur when time and resource allows. Security risk has been
                     brought within significantly more acceptable tolerances. At the end of the
                     process dozens of once uncertain projects will have been given clarity, and a
                     valuable corpus of digital humanities projects will have been brought under
                     robust management. Surprisingly, given the anxiety that attended the start of
                     the initiative, 46% of the projects were placed under Service Level Agreements,
                     guaranteeing between three and five years of secure maintenance and hosting.
                     Where the end date of projects passed less than five years ago, the lab issued
                     backdated, zero-cost Service Level Agreements, itemised with future costs for
                     each component, to clearly signpost future hosting and maintenance needs. This
                     effectively gave several major projects no-cost extensions to their hosting and
                     maintenance, as well as giving them time to consider their options and plan for
                     the future. At least two significant sites will be rebuilt using new funding,
                     and several others will be subject to follow-on funding proposals. It is worth
                     mentioning that a very small subset of projects (five in total) await full
                     resolution, while discussions around creative funding (e.g. crowdfunding and
                     archiving options) continue.

                     community 3-5 years to continue seeking new options and align to evolving
                     archiving and preservation efforts in the wider research data management and
                     eResearch communities [<a class="ref" href="#nicholson2018">Nicholson 2018</a>]. 39% of the inherited
                     projects have been archived in some form, 13% on a static HTML legacy server
                     that allows their basic content to remain live but incurs no further
                     maintenance, and 26% on local backup servers. No data, in the form of image
                     files or otherwise, has been removed from potential circulation. Plans are in
                     place to migrate the remaining 15% of the projects to other institutions, in a
                     very pleasing move that signals that they also see the value in investing in the
                     future of digital scholarship. 6% will be migrated to a WordPress service hosted
                     in King’s College IT department, and 9% will be migrated to external hosting
                     providers. The onward cost of our current project archiving services are
                     negligible; local backup is supported from baseline operating costs, and the
                     running cost of the two static HTML legacy servers is ~£600 per annum. The major
                     costs, naturally, stem from the 12 months of effort, including 4 months with a
                     dedicated full-time team member, to undertake assessment, produce documentation,
                     and communicate with PIs. It is possible that significant additional costs will
                     appear when more complex sites need to be archived, too, but these cases will
                     appear in a staggered way and therefore be more manageable as part of the lab’s
                     normal software development and maintenance process. The end result, in simple
                     terms, is KDL’s new “maintenance schedule”: a list of ~50 projects, all
                     covered by Service Level Agreements and generating modest internal and external
                     income to offset costs. Concerns remain about some projects, and others remain
                     “in process”, but that – in our estimation – is the best that can be
                     expected: maintenance and archiving of digital scholarship is an iterative,
                     continuous process, that does not allow for perfect endings.

                     human, as well as the technical, financial and political perspectives implicit
                     in digital scholarship. It has reinforced the lab’s commitment to producing
                     digital research within a holistic and scalable framework, supported by
                     straightforward documentation to ensure mutual clarity about what can be
                     expected from research partnerships. A key component of this framework includes
                     the enhanced Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC) process, which is now
                     implemented from the inception of a project, to align its development with
                     post-publication maintenance and, where appropriate, archiving plans. Early
                     clarity about the feasibility and cost of maintaining projects beyond the funded
                     period allows all parties time to plan ahead, with sufficient time to
                     accommodate the development and turnaround time of follow-on funding
                     applications, negotiations with partner institutions, infrastructure resourcing
                     and requisite allocation of staff time. In addition to optimising maintenance
                     and management of legacy digital research outputs, this approach minimises
                     ambiguity regarding responsibilities and expectations, and contributes to
                     reputation risk management in more than one dimension. Contrary to what might
                     have been expected, KDL’s experience of introducing the level of transparency
                     and process described in this article was almost uniformly positive.

                     questions addressed in this paper is unlikely to diminish in future years,
                     requiring ongoing interrogation of what is an “ideal”
                     technology stack, and best practice. While experimentation with new technology
                     is vital and the precise details of future process design cannot be rigidly
                     determined, more attention to its sustainability, particularly where there is
                     significant investment from public funds, will enhance the field, enhance the
                     benefits of interdisciplinary collaboration outside of the Arts and Humanities,
                     and strengthen arguments for robust funding of the digital humanities sector.
                     Here, it is necessary to differentiate between established technologies and
                     experimental ones. We need to accept brittle code and the possibility of failure
                     in the shorter term for developing technologies but incubate emerging
                     technologies within a context of “legacy risk assessment” informed by
                     industry standards and including upfront analyses of wider infrastructures and
                     technological limitations. Software sustainability will, in all likelihood,
                     remain a pressing issue for the foreseeable future across all research
                     disciplines. The broader conclusion from the experience of KDL is that entropic
                     factors should be taken into account at early planning stages and be accepted by
                     all parties to the project including PIs, developers, and funders. Here, the
                     degree of orientation towards (or away from) archiving and sustainability are
                     core concerns. Funding and associated policy is central to sustainable
                     development, maintenance and archiving. Assuming that future technologies will
                     make it easier or cheaper to solve problems associated with digital entropy is
                     no longer adequate. Sustainable funding strategies need to be based on
                     transparent costing that includes infrastructure and maintenance costs and made
                     simpler and more reliable by established best practice. For this to be
                     effective, realistic costing methods need to be developed and shared between
                     product partners, and embedded within funding policy.

                     were selected on the basis of low research value and minimal complexity,
                     e.g. underused blog sites, orphaned pilot sites, low relevance to King’s
                     College and King’s Digital Lab (e.g. hosting of personal Wordpress sites,
                     conference sites without updates since the main event, etc). A template

                     weeks, after which we said that permission would be sought from Faculty to
                     decommission the web resource. A further month from this, the site would be
                     decommissioned. The majority of project partners responded in a timely

                     REF-able and perceived to be of mid- to high research value) began with an
                     investigation within the lab to unearth institutional memory of the affected
                     projects. They were prioritised according to the categories “SLA
                     supported” (where no moneys would be charged to the project in the
                     contractual period), “SLA paid” (charged according to cost recovery
