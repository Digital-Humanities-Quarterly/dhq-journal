                  <p>With the increasing proliferation of digital technologies into our daily
                     routines, long-standing debates have resurfaced on the potential of prosthetic
                     devices to extend our cognitive capacities and distribute intelligence across
                     human and non-human agents. This article will propose ways in which we, as
                     educators, can harness the distractions that new technologies can pose to
                     teaching and research towards productive models of distributed attention and
                     collective intelligence.
                  </p>
                  
                  <p>By reflecting on the relationship between play and pedagogy through critical
                     theory, as well as on the benefits of hyper-connected and collaborative
                     learning, this article hopes to expand the branch of Digital Humanities that
                     Holly Willis terms as the “cinematic
                     humanities.” Remixing, recontextualization, and the
                     non-linear/non-sequential reconfiguration of information can provide us with new
                     modes of distributed attention and critical making in the digital age.
                  </p>
                  
                  <p>This article focuses on low and no-budget process-oriented collaborative projects
                     for Cinema, Media Studies, and Digital Humanities courses (adjustable to other
                     subject matters) that incorporate remixing, social and locative media, and
                     augmented reality into experimental modes of connected and collaborative
                     learning. The first assignment is a live film scoring remix, where students
                     collectively brainstormed on picking sound clips/samples to add new soundtracks
                     to early silent films. Remixing practices can offer new insights into cinema's
                     legacy and challenge ocularcentric notions of film spectatorship by, in this
                     case, reversing the conventional hierarchy of image-sound into sound-image and
                     reflecting on how our minds attempt to process the impulse of sensory
                     synchronization in cinema. The second sample assignment proposes new ways of
                     using easy-to-learn and accessible GIS (Geographic Information System) and AR
                     (Augmented Reality) tools to create projects related to civic engagement and
                     local/online activism.
                  </p>
                  
                  <p>The drifts from pre-determined learning outcomes are meant to be active
                     disruptions to any prescribed limitations that delimit what digital humanities
                     should or should not be, and other issues that often undermine the potential
                     contributions to digital humanities that derive from the intellectual and
                     material labor that happens in the networked, expanded and distributed
                     classroom. The remix aesthetic, the “unfinished” and
                     makeshift nature of these projects is something that I find adds value to this
                     kind of process-oriented pedagogy because it remains in touch with the
                     pre-institutionalized experimental ethos that prompted the formation of the
                     digital humanities and other disciplinary cross-pollinations.

                     practices that are “immersive,
                     embodied, gestural, and virtual,” and produces modes of inquiry that
                     emerge from the creative experimentation with the affordances of new media
                     platforms [<a class="ref" href="#willis2015">Willis 2015</a>, 74].

                  <div class="ptext" id="p2">In the context of higher education, distraction often goes hand in hand with the
                     idea of play, and both of these are sometimes dismissed as counterproductive in
                     terms of learning, partly because it is difficult to evaluate their outcomes
                     within traditional and standardized models for assessment [<a class="ref" href="#stommel2013">Stommel, Rorabaugh, and Morris 2013</a>]. Pre-industrialization, work and play were not as
                     compartmentalized and segregated as in post-industrialized capitalist societies
                     (see for example [<a class="ref" href="#imre2009">Imre 2009</a>]). In recent years, however, there has
                     been a widespread trend towards the conflation of work and play in various
                     industries. While play used to be historically regarded as a subversive response
                     to capitalist ideology by activist artists and intellectuals, it is now being
                     standardized, institutionalized, and packaged for mass marketing. Gamification —
                     a neologism referring to the convergence of gaming mechanics (such as scoring,
                     competition, and rules) with non-gaming contexts particularly related to labour
                     production and product consumption – has become a massive corporate buzzword in
                     several industries, ranging from advertising to education. And yet, the
                     principles behind gamification should not simply be condemned as what Ian Bogost
                     calls “marketing bullshit” that
                     profits on the popularity of videogames and the billion-dollar gaming industry
                     [<a class="ref" href="#bogost2011">Bogost 2017</a>]. In education, there have already been numerous
                     case studies that demonstrate the productive outcomes of gamification in terms
                     of student engagement and learning motivation (e.g. [<a class="ref" href="#kapp2012">Kapp 2012</a>];
                     [<a class="ref" href="#huang2013">Huang and Soman 2013</a>]; [<a class="ref" href="#petrucco2016">Petrucco and Agostini 2016</a>]). Non-profit
                     educational technology association Educause even goes as far as arguing that
                     gamification “is most effective as a
                     pedagogical tool where it forms part of a well-planned strategy to
                     encourage research, inspire creativity, teach basic principles, or hone
                     problem-solving skills”
                      [<a class="ref" href="#educause2011">Educause 2011</a>]. While I do not wish to overstate the educational value of game-oriented
                     learning, I consider playful experimentation and distracted acts of reading
                     integral components of pedagogy and critical thinking/acting in the digital age.

                  <div class="counter"><a href="#p3">3</a></div>
                  <div class="ptext" id="p3">The most challenging courses to teach are those where students feel they cannot
                     contribute anything original to canonical discourses, which, in this case,
                     includes classes on film history and theory. In this section, I will focus on a
                     two-part collaborative experiment I performed with my Film Theory graduate
                     students, with the objective of exploring pop cultural connections to film
                     historiography and creating new types of collaborative amateur archives that
                     enable younger generations to productively engage with the past. The idea for
                     this project began through a problem-oriented approach centered around a
                     methodological and phenomenological issue: in the field of Film and Media
                     Studies, sound is usually analyzed in relation to moving images and, conversely,
                     mainstream film audiences are habitually conditioned to think of sound and image
                     as synchronous and interdependent. Accordingly, in film theory, sound is mostly
                     treated as an element that is dependent on the reception of the image rather
                     than critiqued in its own right. As film theorists Thomas Elsaesser and Malte
                     Hagener assert, “in classical cinema sound is
                     usually analyzed strictly in relation to (and in dependence on) the
                     image”
                      [<a class="ref" href="#elsaesser2015">Elsaesser and Hagener 2015</a>, 154]. The privileging of visual-oriented approaches to media is further
                     indicated by the fact that sound studies is still regarded as an under-developed
                     subfield within Film and Media Studies and, by extension, the digital humanities
                     (as noted, for instance, in [<a class="ref" href="#elsaesser2015">Elsaesser and Hagener 2015</a>]).

                  <div class="ptext" id="p4">The first project I will analyze is a live film scoring remix, where students
                     collectively brainstormed on picking sound clips (as audio samples) to add new
                     soundtracks to early films. Remixing practices can offer new insights into
                     cinema's legacy and challenge ocularcentric notions of film spectatorship by, in
                     this case, reversing the conventional hierarchy of image-sound into sound-image
                     and reflecting on how our bodies attempt to process the impulse of sensory
                     synchronization in cinema. For this collaborative film (re)scoring assignment, I
                     wanted to challenge students to reverse this sound-image relationship – that is,
                     to inverse the typical hierarchy of image-sound into that of sound-image, with
                     sound being at the forefront of their cinematic experience, in order to propose
                     different ways of analyzing acoustics in cinema and other media. The project had
                     an open-ended investigative component that was not fixed on a single predictable
                     outcome: it challenged the students to consider whether and/or how spectatorship
                     changes when images are understood in relation to sound. Further, the students
                     were asked to reflect on whether the class could collectively come up with our
                     own version of an <em class="emph">acoustic visuality</em>, where sound subverts the
                     ocular-centric primacy in audiovisual analysis.

                  <div class="ptext" id="p5">With these thoughts in mind, I challenged my students to spontaneously brainstorm
                     for a new score for a transitional sound film from 1930 titled <cite class="title italic">Tomatos Another Day</cite> (or, <cite class="title italic">Tomatoes
                        Another Day/ Tomato is Another Day/ It Never Happened</cite>) by James
                     Sibley Watson Jr. and Alec Wilder<a class="noteRef" href="#d4e262">[1]</a>, which centers on a love triangle between a married couple and
                     the cheating wife’s lover. I consider this rather historically neglected film to
                     be an appropriate case study for analyzing intertextuality and referentiality in
                     cinema, and for considering the historicity of parodic works in a contemporary
                     context. Before I describe the remixing activity, I would like to explain why I
                     picked this particular film, and how it helped forge a connection between film
                     history and modern-day spectatorship. It is important to provide students with
                     the necessary critical background prior to introducing unconventional learning
                     activities so that they are able to effectively connect theory to practice.

                  <div class="ptext" id="p6">The original film itself is an excellent example of early sound experimentation
                     at a time when cinema was entering a transitional phase brought about by the
                     introduction of synchronized film sound. The title is a play on the phrase
                     “tomorrow is another day,” with the <cite class="title italic">Tomatos</cite> actors phonetically approximating this phrase in the way
                     silent cinema actors would visually mimic the sound of words. <cite class="title italic">Tomatos</cite> conveys an ambivalent critique of the use of
                     sound in transitional sound films of the late 1920s and early 1930s. Innovations
                     in sound-on-sound film led to the first mainstream synchronized movies in 1923.
                     Similar (but far less documented) debates had occurred in the early years of
                     cinema about the use of intertitles in narrative films; once text was
                     incorporated into filmic narratives, cinema had arguably ceased to be a
                     universal medium because of the language-specific intertitles that added layers
                     of meaning to the then-silent moving images. The question at the time <cite class="title italic">Tomatos</cite> was made was whether synchronized sound was
                     the next step to rendering spectators less active by attempting to shape – in
                     more sensory ways than before – their response to moving images. Film theorists
                     such as Andre Bazin, Sergei Eisenstein, and Hugo Münsterberg had offered diverse
                     insights into the impact of synchronized sound on cinema's recording capacities
                     and its status as an art medium, particularly in relation to notions of realism,
                     montage, and audience reception. Although some early film theorists cautiously
                     regarded sound as a potential asset to the cinematic experience, it is fair to
                     say that the introduction of synchronized sound was initially largely regarded
                     as a hinder to the expressive qualities of the medium. <cite class="title italic">Tomatos</cite> reflects on this widespread anxiety about sound cinema in a
                     humorous manner that was, unfortunately, too close to home for its contemporary
                     audiences to fully appreciate its nuances.

                  <div class="ptext" id="p7">Upon first viewing, <cite class="title italic">Tomatos</cite> seems to criticize
                     certain conventions of the talkies, particularly in its exaggerated and
                     unnecessary use of sound to state the obvious. It seems as though the
                     incorporation of sound into the love triangle of <cite class="title italic">Tomatos</cite>' narrative only serves to highlight what the moving images
                     make plainly obvious, and to unnecessarily describe the emotional state of the
                     characters, which is already exaggerated through their dramatic performances.
                     However, the directors manage to turn what initially seems to be an overt
                     critique of cinematic cliches (going beyond the talkies and also critiquing
                     narrative and performative conventions) into avant-garde experimentation and,
                     ultimately, a meditation on the productive uses of sound in cinema. Acoustic and
                     temporal experimentation is particularly manifest in moments in the film that
                     highlight the disjunctions between what is shown (and how) and what is heard,
                     such as an extreme close up on a match that throws off the rhythm and temporal
                     linearity of continuity editing. Disjunctive temporality, reflected in
                     conspicuous editing and visible/shock cuts, is especially noticeable when the
                     husband shoots his gun in the direction of his cheating wife and laments on what
                     he has done, while a few seconds later his wife appears on the screen unharmed,
                     as if the shooting had never occurred. The temporal disjunctions in the
                     narrative necessitate an active viewer and listener, thus suggesting new modes
                     of participatory spectatorship.

                     resonates even more strongly, as Andrew Grossman argues, “in a media age intolerant of
                     aesthetic ‘dissonance’ and intent on madly synchronizing nearly every
                     aspect of thought, culture, and behavior”
                      [<a class="ref" href="#grossman2014">Grossman 2014</a>]. The incongruity of sound, image and temporal sequencing in <cite class="title italic">Tomatos</cite> suggests productively dissonant uses of sound,
                     for instance with the objective of subverting mainstream ideologies and
                     transcending industry confines. <cite class="title italic">Tomatos</cite>' dissonance
                     lends itself well to remixing and audio sampling, which I chose as the main
                     critical practices through which students would interact with the film in the
                     class activity. By treating <cite class="title italic">Tomatos</cite> as a remixable
                     database, students spontaneously proposed several songs to re-score the film in
                     class, and I assembled them into a makeshift YouTube playlist that would serve
                     as the film’s new score. We re-played the film on mute, and layered the new
                     audible soundtrack alongside the muted version of the film, with students giving
                     me cues whenever they wanted me to switch to the next track. The audio samples
                     chosen by the students ranged from classical to Korean pop (K-pop) music, and
                     reflected the diverse musical tastes of the multicultural student cohort. This
                     participatory mode of spectatorship has resulted in some interesting moments of
                     re-synchronization between the sound clips and the moving images, and encouraged
                     students to think of other inter-relations between sound and image that surpass
                     ocularcentric paradigms.<a class="noteRef" href="#d4e316">[2]</a>

                     tried a second, more elaborate and pre-meditated version using a different film,
                     an early silent film called <cite class="title italic">Dream of a Rarebit
                        Fiend</cite> (Wallace McCutcheon and Edwin S. Porter, 1906). This time,
                     students had more time to collectively brainstorm on picking the sound clips for
                     the new soundtrack in an online forum. The online forum also helped me quantify
                     participation (since each student was using their name under their contribution)
                     and dissect in more detail how students’ creativity works individually and
                     collectively. I then assembled their choices into a flowchart visualization
                     (<a href="#figure01">Figure 1</a>). Using a visualization for audio
                     samples is far more challenging to do when working with sound, so I decided to
                     use the film’s timecode and a screenshot from the beginning of each segment to
                     visually and temporally cue the corresponding audio transitions; this can be
                     easily done with a free online timeline flowchart program such as SmartDraw
                     Cloud. The second version of this sound remix ultimately escalated into a live
                     DJ performance in class, where the student DJ had downloaded mp3s of all the
                     chosen songs using KeepVid [set to mp3 download for sound-only audio files] and
                     brought his mixing console to class (<a href="#figure02">Figure

                     track of participation and encouraged some quiet students to contribute more
                     online, the first version was also useful in terms of providing a more
                     spontaneous example of collective intelligence in the classroom.

                  <div class="ptext" id="p10">While remixing practices usually result in context collapse, I wanted students to
                     alternatively explore remixing as an active act of recontextualization, and as a
                     process of building new connections between the old and the new. In the case of
                     silent film history, Paolo Cherchi Usai argues that the producers and
                     contemporary audiences of those films, and today’s viewers, are separated by “too many material and historical
                     variables, and our patterns of perception of moving images have
                     remarkably changed in the meantime”
                      [<a class="ref" href="#usai2010">Usai 2010</a>, 166]. New engagements with older media can therefore revive student interest
                     in “that rich and intimidating
                     legacy of the past”
                      [<a class="ref" href="#hutcheon1985">Hutcheon 1985</a>, 4]. Remixing and sampling as active modes of critical engagement with media
                     require familiarity with the contexts and contents that are being remixed in the
                     first place. Watching the remixed version inevitably evokes comparisons between
                     the original film and the altered version, and establishes more intimate
                     connections to films that are of the distant past for younger generations of
                     viewers. In retrospect, it became even more apparent that the different sound
                     clips the students picked were not arbitrary: they demonstrated familiarity with
                     the filmic narrative (e.g. the love triangle in the film), and awareness of each
                     film’s historical and technological contexts, as well as a sophisticated
                     understanding of each film’s fluctuating dynamic between visual aesthetics and
                     acoustics.

                  <div class="ptext" id="p11">In re-watching the recordings of the remixes, students felt a special connection
                     to the film and said that by watching their remixed version they simultaneously
                     and comparatively thought of the original version as well as the personalized
                     experience of watching the film. Blair Davis has also observed this process of
                     thinking of the past and present simultaneously – or, in new media terms,
                     hypertextually – when he screened silent films with anachronistic soundtracks
                     such as techno music [<a class="ref" href="#davis2008">Davis 2008</a>, 92]. Anachronisms become
                     contemplative and self-reflexive for students, and compel them to carefully
                     consider other compositional elements in these films, as well as become more
                     aware of the films’ variable materialities, their diverse
                     exhibition/distribution contexts, and media ecology at large. As Katherine Groo
                     argues, deviations from the original work can serve as an act of “metahistorical thinking” that “productively counters the
                     [perceived] stability of film historiography with the possibility of
                     manifold and imaginative alternatives, each of which produces new forms
                     of historical knowledge”

                  <div class="ptext" id="p12">In addition, the resulting remixes indicate the students’ shared ability to think
                     of narrative as recombinatory elements in a remixable database, a process that
                     is consistent with the non-linear and/or modular logic of the various media they
                     interact with on a daily basis, and something that opens up new multimodal
                     possibilities for audiovisual studies in the digital age. Several media
                     theorists, including Douglas Rushkoff, have argued that modern popular culture
                     and/or new media stimulate a new cognitive and sensory “evolutionary leap” in their
                     younger consumers, and many behavioral psychologists have claimed that modern
                     audiences have shorter attention spans [<a class="ref" href="#rushkoff2006">Rushkoff 2006</a>, 36].
                     While in education shorter attention spans are typically regarded as
                     counterproductive, Rushkoff and Davis posit that new cognitive skills have
                     emerged from this, such as the ability to process information more rapidly as a
                     result of a less linearly-constrained and more interactive thought process [<a class="ref" href="#rushkoff2006">Rushkoff 2006</a>, 38–9]
                     [<a class="ref" href="#davis2008">Davis 2008</a>, 91]. Moreover, moving beyond ocular-centric
                     paradigms of media reception challenges our bodies to, literally, make
                     <em class="emph">sense</em> of mediated information using other modes of perception
                     besides vision or, at least, alongside the culturally dominant visual paradigms

                     critical practice, I wanted students to consider the human aspects of digital

                     “hide” AR messages in specific New York City landmarks
                     and/or cultural events that relate to themes covered in the course (e.g.
                     expanded cinema, street art, feminist media-making, gentrification,
                     gamification, urban architecture, activism, and historiography) and then share
                     clues online (hinting at the location of their AR) before embarking on a quest
                     to uncover each other’s virtual hidden messages in real locations. In order to
                     receive participation credit, each student had to contribute at least 1 AR to
                     the project, accompanied by a brief rationale of their choice of location and
                     landmark. The app we chose through trial-and-error was walla.me (after trying
                     out other AR apps like Aurasma and Blippar), which is a free and easy-to-use
                     locative AR app that has the added feature of enabling its users to connect and
                     monitor each other’s walla.mes on a digital map, and also alerts users when
                     there are hidden ARs in nearby locations (<a href="#figure03">Figure

                  <div class="ptext" id="p15">The AR class project provided students the opportunity to foster new conceptual
                     connections to place, and to transform the physical into a virtual-material
                     space with emotional and historical resonance. Student Karen Sadler was inspired
                     by the idea of AR as a disruptive practice that subverts spatiotemporal
                     boundaries. The site of her AR was a locked bookcase that showcases pioneering
                     books written by Cinema Studies professors in NYU’s Cinema Studies department.
                     Karen hinted at the location of her AR to her classmates by dubbing it as a
                     container of “dangerous books,” since the books showcased
                     deal with subversive forms of cultural critique. Karen created her own virtual
                     graffiti that included the access date and the abbreviated address of the
                     bookcase’s physical location. [<a href="#figure04">Figure 4</a>]. The use
                     of graffiti-like AR text transformed the notion of automated geo-tagging into
                     something playful and subversive. AR provided a phenomenological and subjective
                     dimension to otherwise impersonal cartographic modes of urban navigation. The
                     act of virtual defacement through AR was meant to metaphorically
                     “unlock” the books from their fixed and protected
                     physical location, and to emphasize the transcendental value of the
                     revolutionary ideas expressed in these books. Instead of using AR to distract
                     from the significance of the physical location, Karen used it to amplify and
                     virtually disseminate the value of this locale that ultimately transcends its
                     physicality. Using AR at school gave Karen the chance to reflect on the ethical
                     implications of her virtual intervention, and to regard the concrete
                     consequences of using AR to virtually alter private, publically displayed
                     intellectual and material property.

                  <div class="ptext" id="p16">Student Shirley Ogolla chose to explore the potential of AR as a tool for
                     political activism, after our class discussions on digital democracy and
                     cyber-ethics. The desire to utilize technology for political activism became
                     even more pressing for many students in the wake of the 2016 U.S. presidential
                     election, and several members of my class found it cathartic and liberating to
                     repurpose the technology at their disposal for sociopolitical reflection.
                     Shirley used as her AR site a politically themed photography exhibition in NYU’s
                     Tisch School of the Arts to provide her own virtual critique of the two main
                     presidential candidates. Shirley’s most effective walla.mes centered on the
                     theme of walls and boundaries. For instance, she focused one of her walla.mes on
                     a photo collage of a Donald Trump poster on top of a picket fence (visibly
                     alluding to the proposed building of the U.S.-Mexico wall), and added the
                     caption: “I don’t even know where to begin…” (<a href="#figure05">Figure 5</a>). Shirley’s own AR annotations to the photographed images
                     ironically convey her inability to adequately verbalize her post-election shock.
                     By using additional wall and fence-related objects and locations on campus,
                     Shirley’s AR interventions on physical boundaries suggest the irreversible
                     associations our culture now attaches to such images as symbols of oppression
                     and segregation.

                  <div class="ptext" id="p17">Inspired by the empowering potential of AR as a tool of social critique, Shirley
                     went on to use AR in her final, multimedia project of tracing gentrification in
                     her Williamsburg neighborhood in Brooklyn (<a href="#figure06">Figure
                        6</a>). Shirley’s final project focuses on virtually preserving
                     pre-gentrification memories of Williamsburg by layering digitized archival and
                     resident-submitted photos onto the newer architectural façades of the area. The
                     subversive use of AR for social critique and historical preservation is becoming
                     more commonplace as an artistic counter-cultural practice, as evidenced, for
                     instance, in projects such as <cite class="title italic">Mi Querido Barrio</cite> (My
                     Beloved Community, Caribbean Cultural Center African Diaspora Institute, NYC,
                     2016), an augmented reality tour of East Harlem that aims to make visible
                     gentrification’s unseen implications of cultural erasure. Thinking of emerging
                     technologies as tools for cultural critique and activism – rather than as
                     obstructions to meaningful interactions – gives students the chance to produce
                     meaningful interventions that connect real locations to memory, history,
                     culture, and collective identity.

                  <div class="ptext" id="p18">Another student, Elyse Singer, picked the Brown Building on the NYU campus as the
                     physical location of her AR. The Brown Building is the site of the Triangle
                     Shirtwaist factory, where the worst industrial disaster in New York City
                     occurred in 1911. Elyse used the keyword “palimpsest” and three emojis to
                     hint at the location of her AR online: a triangle, a shirt, and a factory (<a href="#figure07">Figure 7</a>). She utilized AR to pay tribute to some
                     of the victims of the factory fire by superimposing some of the immigrant
                     workers’ photographs onto the physical location of the memorial plaques (<a href="#figure08">Figures 8 &amp; 9</a>). When this location is visited
                     with a walla.me enabled smartphone, the impersonal memorial plaques come to life
                     through the virtually superimposed photographs of some of the victims that
                     spring up like ghosts from the distant past. AR here possesses a
                     historiographical and commemorative function that serves to experientially
                     connect visitors to the legacy of that specific location. Furthermore, Elyse
                     wanted to particularly highlight and memorialize the labor performed by the
                     young immigrant women (mostly Jewish and Italian) who died in the fire – an act
                     that gained even more significance in the context of the 2016 U.S. presidential
                     election and the impending threats to the rights of women and immigrants. The
                     virtual superimposition of images and text onto real places evoked a palimpsest
                     aesthetic. As Elyse observed, the palimpsest – an effaced piece of writing or
                     manuscript on which later writing has been superimposed, with traces of the
                     older form still visible – served as an apt metaphor for AR (<a href="#figure10">Figure 10</a>).

                     but still bearing visible traces of its earlier form,” provided a
                     lens through which to examine diverse interactive works throughout the semester
                     that collapse distinctions between past and present to propose new modes of
                     participatory historiography [<a class="ref" href="#old">Oxford Living Dictionaries</a>]. The evocation of the
                     palimpsest metaphor and its layered aesthetic in the students’ AR creations was
                     thus a productive extension to, and practical application of, some of the
                     concepts studied in the course. Further, the composite aesthetic resulting from
                     the palimpsest-like intermingling of visually inassimilable physical objects and
                     virtual interventions provides a suitable metaphor for the experience of
                     simultaneously navigating virtual and real locations. Larissa Hjorth and Sun Sun
                     Lim observe that the different modes of mobility and intimacy afforded by
                     digital media have enabled “multiple cartographies of space in
                     which the geographic and physical space is overlaid with an electronic
                     position and relational presence, which is emotional and social”
                      [<a class="ref" href="#hjorth2012">Hjorth and Lim 2012</a>, 478]. This overlaying is not only mediated virtually, but also mapped out
                     cognitively: individuals navigate electronic-social spaces while cognitively and
                     experientially relating them to the experience of being present in their
                     material-geographic equivalents, and vice versa. Contrary to the argument that
                     “hyper-local social media data is
                     actually a manifestation of [the] temporalization and de-territorialization
                     [of visual experience],” this class project actually de-temporalized
                     and re-territorialized our experience of virtually augmented real space by
                     maintaining connections to site-specificity [<a class="ref" href="#hochman2014">Hochman, Manovich, and Yazdani 2014</a>]. Such
                     participatory uses of AR and other locative media challenge the notion that
                     digital technologies disconnect and alienate their subjects from the physical
                     experience of space.

                     up to this point, very few free AR apps offer, and I found this feature useful
                     in not only connecting students to the history and legacy of their urban
                     environment, but also to each other’s subjective connections to the
                     “same” physical locations. Eric Gordon and Adriana de
                     Souza e Silva argue that, historically, the practice of geocaching has been “effective in connecting people to
                     locations, [but] it has been less effective in connecting people to each
                     other”

                     only forging a one-on-one connection to the urban landscape through AR, but to
                     also gain a multimodal understanding of social space as experientially
                     interconnected. Even though the sense of net locality is now more
                     technologically disseminated, it is important to remember that it is primarily
                     socially and subjectively, rather than technologically, determined. The
                     multilayered navigation of space puts Guy Debord’s idea of psychogeography into
                     new contexts of techno-cultural mobility. Debord uses the term psychogeography
                     to allude to the emotional and psychological effects of geographical locations
                     on individual behavior [<a class="ref" href="#debord1989">Debord 1989</a>, 139]. AR can potentially
                     create new modes of psychogeography by allowing individuals to prescribe their
                     own unconventional ways of navigating their environment that diverge from the
                     ordinary ways we are socially and architecturally conditioned to experience
                     modern space.

                  <div class="ptext" id="p21">The use of AR provided a playful way of “testing” and
                     extending students’ applied knowledge of the course material, and its use was
                     contextualized through our cinematic exploration of psychogeography, urban
                     drifts (dérives), misappropriations/urban hijacks (détournements), and locative
                     media. The multiple distractions of the urban landscape, something that my
                     students had become accustomed to, became de-routinized and re-examined in a new
                     light. I would also add here that the urban milieu might have been more
                     instrumental than technology in training students on how to navigate, multitask
                     and re-focus their attention, since some of the students did not consider
                     themselves as “digital natives” (either due to their age or
                     their minimal interactions with technology). This offers an expanded perception
                     of distracted reading, beyond it being only digitally and/or
                     generationally-conditioned, and might provide some encouraging
                     cross-generational counterpoints to the so-called “digital
                     divide.”

                  <div class="ptext" id="p22">Furthermore, AR gave students the opportunity of exploring the connections
                     between new and experimental media practices, and their relationship to the
                     urban landscape and long-standing Expanded Cinema and avant-garde traditions in
                     NYC. As with any new tool introduced in the classroom, I find it crucial to
                     provide students with examples that illustrate its potential uses. Therefore,
                     students became familiar with some creative approaches to cinematic uses of AR
                     and GPS technology through the work of groundbreaking artists such as activist
                     Amir Baradaran, Heidi J. Boisvert, and the Blast Theory collective. These
                     artists utilize geo-locative tools to explore, as Baradaran’s FutARist manifesto
                     states, “the experiential, conceptual and
                     legal shifts suggested by the advent of AR within the modalities of
                     contemporary art, its practice and reception”
                      [<a class="ref" href="#baradaran">Baradaran</a>]. With the intention of exploring the subversive subjectivities that
                     emerge when AR is utilized to virtually alter and deface public space, students
                     were challenged to interrogate first-hand notions of ownership, surveillance,
                     social agency, and urban architecture through this new form of virtual graffiti.

                     is in line with Adeline Koh’s argument that “play and games have tremendous

                     like an effective way of repurposing GIS and other locative platforms to create
                     new participatory archives and alternative cartographies that connect students
                     to their immediate environment. The main tool for this class project was
                     Fulcrum, which is an easy-to-use mobile data collection platform. Even though
                     Fulcrum is not open-source, institutional access allows for students to all
                     contribute data (such as photos, videos, and location information) on the same
                     map in real-time, and edit them easily; the data can then be exported and
                     publicly published on other platforms like Esri’s ArcGIS Online (AGOL). Fulcrum
                     is both a web-based platform and a mobile app. Users can customize the online
                     data collection form for the mobile Fulcrum app with the information required
                     for specific projects, such as a description of each data point and extra fields
                     for audiovisual location-based data.

                  <div class="ptext" id="p25">The objective of my class scavenger hunt was for students to use the customized
                     data form on their mobile Fulcrum app to document examples of ongoing
                     activism/resistance and civic engagement on and near the NYU campus, and to
                     archive those in the form of videos, photos, audio, hyperlinks and participant
                     interviews. With the assistance of NYU technology expert Kyle Greenberg, we
                     added some required fields to the customizable mobile Fulcrum form builder, such
                     as a mandatory field for a description of the data point (with the prompt
                     “What do you see?”), a classification of the type of activism
                     (reductively labeled as either “Active” for ongoing protests and current
                     events, or “Passive” for more subjective interpretations of
                     activism/resistance), a justification (“Why is this activism/resistance?”),
                     and a field for uploading at least one form of audiovisual data such as
                     photographs, video, or audio. The option of incorporating mandatory fields that
                     students need to fill out is useful in terms of prompting more on-the-spot
                     critical reflection whenever students enter a new data point, and making sure
                     that every addition to the database has a specific and thought-out purpose. To
                     stimulate some healthy competition among the students, I set up a points system
                     to award each finding. For instance, 10 points were awarded for data on active
                     acts of resistance (such as a live protest march or demonstration), 5 points for
                     passive activism (such as activist posters or signs), 3 points for interviews, 3
                     points for uploading more than one form of media documentation (video, audio,
                     image), and -3 points for returning to class after the 1 hour deadline that was
                     assigned for the scavenger hunt.

                  <div class="ptext" id="p26">By adding these categories and requirements to the scavenger hunt, students were
                     able to approach data as more than just singular bits of information in a
                     database (<a href="#figure11">Figure 11</a>). This helped them visualize
                     the real-time data points that were added on our Fulcrum map as referents to
                     multiple media and social relations, and gave them the opportunity to reflect on
                     their individual and collective trajectories as alternative modes of
                     thematically and psychogeographically mapping their surroundings. The abstract
                     space on the map and the information in the Fulcrum database thus became endued
                     with heterogeneous points of social difference and possibilities for personal
                     intervention. In navigating the campus and surrounding areas with the objective
                     of documenting signs of resistance to the status quo, students were able to
                     collectively re-imagine their surroundings as vibrant hubs for everyday acts of
                     activism and social engagement. Furthermore, the resulting data formed an
                     archive of ephemeral and ongoing activities that are testament to the changing
                     post-election climate in present-day NYC. Their findings included multimedia
                     documentation of a pledge to collect signatures for turning NYU into a sanctuary
                     campus (a cause close to the students’ hearts), a campus leadership initiative
                     for students of color, artistic forms of resistance, and inspirational quotes
                     etched on nearby landmark sites. The images below show an annotated compilation
                     of some of the media contributed by the students (<a href="#figure12">Figures 12-14</a>).

                     as activism/resistance motivated students to provide concrete accompanying
                     arguments for their chosen data, especially in cases where it was not
                     immediately apparent why they chose that particular site or artifact. For
                     instance, student Leonard Cortana took a photograph of a defaced Chaplin poster
                     in the Tisch building, and tagged it as a “mash up” with the data
                     description “not my dictator” (<a href="#figure15">Figure 15</a>).
                     Adding further explanation, Leonard uploaded an audio recording of himself
                     explaining why the defaced Chaplin poster – which is significantly from
                     Chaplin’s 1940 film <cite class="title italic">The Great Dictator</cite> – resonates
                     with his own experience of the current political climate in the U.S. The
                     classification of the poster as a political mashup also demonstrated the
                     student’s ability to relate this example of DIY mashup graffiti to the
                     historical exploration of subversive practices of resistance covered in the
                     course. Olusola Babajide-Kassam, a Nigerian student invested in issues of
                     everyday racial discrimination, uploaded a series of images from a Black Lives
                     Matter photo exhibition on campus, and described it as a pronouncement of “the
                     essence of our lives as blacks…[who] have been undermined in several facets
                     of the community…[by] whites not in the sense of color but in terms of
                     mentality” (<a href="#figure16">Figure 16</a>). Olusola also
                     contributed audio with his own commentary on Black Lives Matter, and recorded
                     video and audio-only interviews with predominantly white NYU students. In the
                     audio-only files, the color of the interviewees becomes apparent through the
                     challenging questions about race posed by Olusola; the choice of using only
                     audio to document these interviews helped illustrate his idea of an internalized
                     “white mentality” that transcends external appearance. In
                     his video interviews, Olusola documented the rather typical responses to Black
                     Lives Matter by white students, who stated solidarity with the cause but could
                     not further elaborate on what needs to be done to practically ensure racial
                     equality. Despite the young students’ expected responses, though, Olusola’s
                     confrontational questions caused them to actively acknowledged their own racial
                     and class privilege, and to reflect on deep-set and institutionalized forms of
                     racism that cannot easily be reversed. Going beyond the objective of
                     documentation and reflecting on calls to action, several students in the class
                     uploaded resources on how to make a change. The Political Resources poster in
                     the Cinema Studies department lounge, for instance, was an image that most of
                     the students chose to include in hopes of turning the documentation of civic
                     protests into an active tool for multiple modes of organized civic participation
                     (<a href="#figure17">Figure 17</a>).

                  <div class="ptext" id="p28">During the turbulent post-election period, students found the scavenger hunt to
                     be a positive and encouraging experience in terms of the future of critical
                     thinking and the defense of human rights. Being able to witness and document the
                     many instances of civic protests made students feel part of the shared struggles
                     for equality, and this experience also made them reflect on other potential uses
                     of social media tools beyond their so-called distracting and trivializing
                     aspects. Through this project, not only did students learn more about locative
                     media such as GIS and GPS through practice, but they also created their own
                     archive that makes visible and virtually permanent the multiple efforts for
                     civic participation and free speech. The ability to capture ephemeral moments of
                     protest further added to the meaningful aspects of the project, and helped the
                     students experiment with different ways of documenting and sharing transient
                     experiences. The scavenger hunt also gave the class a chance to interact with
                     their community (e.g. through interviews with protest organizers and
                     participants) and become more aware of how their seemingly neutral surroundings
                     become politically charged in times of crisis. I decided to leave this project
                     open-ended even after the end of the course since students are still
                     periodically adding to it whenever they encounter something worth adding to the
                     database. The next step to this project would be extracting the stored Fulcrum
                     data into an Esri platform such as StoryMaps for an interactive and publicly
                     accessible visualization of the students’ collective cartography of local
                     activism.

                     spans have been historically dismissed as frivolous and counterproductive,
                     dating back to, for instance, early 20<span class="hi superscript">th</span> century
                     debates on long-form prose poetry [<a class="ref" href="#thain2016">Thain 2016</a>]. Instead of
                     resisting and rejecting emerging technologies and their (debatably) new
                     cognitive demands, this essay has proposed some strategies for adapting pedagogy
                     to embrace innovative modes of inquiry and practice (both in terms of technology
                     and methodology), while at the same time maintaining and amplifying certain
                     standard learning objectives such as critical thinking. These digital humanities
                     group projects provide examples of expanded learning tools that can be modified
                     for teaching other subjects, and also enable students to make contributions to
                     cultural research, participatory historiography, and civic engagement through
                     experimental critical practice. The drifts from pre-determined learning outcomes
                     are meant to be active disruptions to any prescribed limitations that delimit
                     what digital humanities should or should not be, and other issues that often
                     undermine the potential contributions to digital humanities that derive from the
                     intellectual and material labor that happens in the networked, expanded and
                     distributed classroom. The remix aesthetic, the productive distractions from
                     predictable learning outcomes, as well as the “unfinished”
                     and makeshift nature of these projects is something that I find adds value to
                     this kind of process-oriented pedagogy because it remains in touch with the
                     pre-institutionalized experimental ethos that prompted the formation of the
                     digital humanities in the first place.
