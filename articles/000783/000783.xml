                <p>This article provides critical feedback on the design, development, and use of a multimedia website dedicated to a project on the history of science in the Alps during the Enlightenment. At the crossroads of the history of science and technology, 
                    experimental history, public history, and the digital humanities, this project serves as a good case study to explore the implications of the digital turn on the practice and dissemination of history. We show how our emphasis on eighteenth-century practices and 
                    materiality of science-in-the-making enabled us to reconceptualise historiography in the digital context. This approach encouraged us to produce our own archive for the project: a public website interweaving media and periods allowing visitors to reassemble materials 
                    according to their interests, thereby producing their own reflexive narratives and arguments. After presenting the website in detail, we analyze how a selected group of users engaged with it, raising core issues for the digital humanities. 
                    Conceptually, we discuss how this was achieved by aligning the mountain-as-a-milieu and the digital-as-a-medium to produce an ecology of media for a “public digital history”.

                    <head>Taming Mont Buet in the 18th Century</head>
                   
                 <p>Located in the Haut-Giffre, twenty kilometres north of Mont Blanc as the crow flies, Mont Buet, formerly known as Glacier du Buet, is a geological gateway to the Alps as well as a forgotten threshold to scientific, 
                     literary, and artistic alpine expeditions. In 1770, two savants from Geneva, the Deluc brothers, achieved the first recorded ascent of this summit. In a quest to find fossils to document their history of the Earth, 
                     they used the Buet as a field for geology and mineralogy, as well as a laboratory for atmospheric physics and meteorology, conducting experiments with portable instruments such as a thermometer and a barometer 
                     (Middleton 1968; Sigrist and Heilbron 2011; Mihailescu et al. 2025). In 1775, the Genevan musician, writer, and engraver Marc-Théodore Bourrit in turn climbed the mountain. Imbued with the post-baroque culture of fieldwork observations, 
                     Bourrit brought back sketches of the mountains that were later transformed into engravings and published in various books. Bourrit brought order to a world once thought chaotic and untamable through his many depictions, 
                     thereby elating a new aesthetic sensibility of sublime and harmony, a peculiar “sentiment de la nature” (Joutard 1988; Moussa 1995). Eventually, Horace-Bénédict de Saussure’s empirical and systematic
                     study of the formation of the Earth also benefited from many expeditions on Mont Buet from 1776. Sending Bourrit back on the summit the following year with specific instructions and a dedicated drawing instrument, 
                     Saussure was able to publish the very first panorama (see fig. 1). In contrast with the early modern impression of mountains as permanent and immutable, this iconography sheds light on its slow but incessant metamorphosis, 
                     its movements and dynamics. In 1778, yet another expedition around Mont Blanc brought Saussure, accompanied by Genevan physicist Marc-Auguste Pictet, back on top of Buet. Conducting topographic surveys, 
                     Pictet was able to draw the first map of the surroundings of Mont Blanc solely based on the observation and measurement of empirical data, which was published in Saussure’s Voyages dans les Alpes in 1786. 
                     Thus, Mont Buet was gradually domesticated into a “laboratory of nature”, a controlled environment—framed by cartography, instrumentation, representations—where the savants could perform their experiments.  
                     The summit became a prime place of knowledge, entwining bodies, instruments, and the mountain, as well as the various sociabilities that underpinned the collaboration and competition between a patrician, 
                     a bourgeois, a rightless “Natif,” all from Geneva, and their local guides and porters (Mihailescu et al. 2022). 
                    </p>
                 
                 <p>These historical ascents of Mont Buet have produced a rich array of material representations of the mountain space—notebooks, prints, publications, drawings, and instruments—, including novel forms of visualisations such as the “circular view” 
                     (see fig. 1). Over the past years, we conducted extensive archival work to document how, in the last decades of the eighteenth century, the Buet has successively turned from an abstract wild and frightening space into a rich, 
                     lived space that wove together a variety of contemporary issues, and was later again tamed into a domesticated place. 
                     While political strife engulfed the city state of Geneva, with the people struggling for more freedom and equality (Walker 2014; Debarbieux and Rudaz 2010), 
                     the Buet became at the same time a social space, where scientists from the nobility collaborated with, but also strived to distinguish themselves from, instrument makers, artists, chamois hunters, 
                     and porters; a scientific space for the confrontation of irreconcilable theories of the Earth and of diverging measuring practices; and, thereby, a natural space where, 
                     at the dusk of the Little Ice Age, the first ideas of the “environment” were being forged. But Mont Buet and the surrounding Alps, from terrifying abstractions to objects of interest, also became a cultural space, 
                     described by Jean-Jacques Rousseau as immune from the torments of modern civilization, as well as a touristic space. After the Parminter cousins on their way to a Grand Tour were the first women to ascend Mont Buet in 1786, 
                     the mountain was nicknamed the “Ladies’ Mont Blanc” and started appearing in the first travel books.

                        <head>Reconstructing Historical Expeditions in the 21st Century</head>
                        <p>Following the archival work, we launched the project The peak that hides the mountain. Between 2020 and 2023 we 1) assembled an interdisciplinary team of scholars (historians, anthropologists, sociologists ), 
                            two museum curators , artists (a photographer, a drawing artist, and a sound artist ), a journalist , and the broader public, all willing to engage with history in the wild and document, each in their own way, 
                            their ascent of Mont Buet; 2) replicated the mercury barometer carried on the slopes of Buet by the Genevan savants and reproduced the gestures they once made to measure the atmospheric pressure on different points of their paths; 3) 
                            reconstructed the expeditions, along with the observations, drawings, and measurements, carried out by the Genevan savants Jean-André and Guillaume Deluc, Marc-Théodore Bourrit, Horace-Bénédict de Saussure, 
                            and Marc-Auguste Pictet on Mont Buet in the late eighteenth century; 4) produced our own archive for the project in the form of a public website, montbuet.net, 
                            that interweaves media and periods, allowing visitors to reassemble materials according to their interests and thus construct their own reflexive narratives and arguments. 
                            The timeline of the whole project is illustrated in fig. 2 which can be read chronologically from bottom to top. It shows how the trajectories of a multiplicity of actors 
                            (represented by colors) crossed in diverse venues and events (represented by geometric shapes).
                        </p>
                        
                        <p>At the crossroads of the history of science and technology, experimental history, public history, and the digital humanities, we approached the mountain not only as a subject of study, 
                            but also as an actor which can shape the ways in which it is experienced and represented through narratives, images, quantitative measurements, and textual descriptions. 
                            Our goal was to convey this experiential thickness of the mountain in ways that would allow the scholarly community and the broader public alike to question and enrich our contemporary view of this space. 
                            Consequently, this research project led us to rethink the role of archives and media in the historian’s craft. The ontological reappraisal of the physical environment as both a historical actor 
                            in the past and a historical source in the present critically challenges the traditional role of historians solely as narrators. If, indeed, a digital interface can be considered an “integral part of the argument” 
                            in digital humanities projects (Andrews and van Zundert 2018), the goal of montbuet.net was specifically to show the mountain’s historical agency, albeit without enforcing one specific narrative over another—or 
                            even the narrative genre in general. Acknowledging that historical practice involves intelligible mediation through collaboration with other disciplines, we aimed to broaden the production of historical meaning 
                            by complementing the interpretation of existing media—a hermeneutics of the archive—with the creation of a new and reflexive multimedia archive.

                        <head>Critical Feedback on a Digital Public History Project</head>
                        <p>This project serves as a good case study to explore the implications of the digital turn on history. Reflecting on almost two decades of digital humanities, Serge Noiret (2018) assessed the effects of the “digital turn” on the practice and dissemination of history. 
                            Seeking to rethink the historian’s craft in this context, Noiret coined the term “digital public history” to designate the new forms of interaction with the public that can emerge through contact with digital sources, new media, and computational methods and visualisations. 
                            In this spirit, we collaborated with a digital art studio  to create a dedicated website to host and display, employing various navigation patterns, all archival materials gathered and produced during the project—prints, manuscripts, drawings, engravings, sketches, 
                            sounds, photographs—as well as contributions from subsequent public participation. The design and development of such a website raises a host of issues for the “digital public humanities”, and for DH at large: How to design a digital tool that goes beyond the genre of 
                            historical narrative, allowing visitors to build their own path through history? How does the digital medium blur the boundaries between archive, museum, exhibition, and repository? How do historical content and the historiographical approach—the mountain as space—allow 
                            us to rethink, by analogy, the role of the digital medium?
                        </p>
                        <p>In the present paper, we provide critical feedback on the design, development, and use of the project’s multimedia website https://montbuet.net. We first detail this peculiar project of “history in the wild” and dwell on the role played by various media in conveying scientific 
                            discourse—both for eighteenth-century physics and for contemporary history—and show how our emphasis on the practices and materialities of science-in-the-making allowed us to reconceptualise historiography in the digital context. We then present in detail the website and provide 
                            critical feedback about its use and perceived status by a group of users who participated in a focus group. Finally, we conceptualise the mountain as a lived and living space that is at the same time a past historical actor and a current historical source; a milieu that can be 
                            navigated and made sense of by seizing traces and clues along the way, and by assembling them according to one’s own narrative or logic. The navigation of a digital milieu thereby becomes one way of seizing this mountainous space in its anthropological and environmental thickness: 
                            matching the mountain-as-a-milieu and the digital-as-a-medium, it becomes possible produce an ecology of media for a “public digital history”.

                 <p>As we have seen, the experience of Mont Buet has always been highly mediated using many different forms of material representation from texts and images to experimental practices that yielded diagrams and charts. Many different media that have always been woven together by the actors 
                     themselves in a ceaseless effort to convey their experience of the physical environment in the most faithful way. Many different media that the very agency of Mont Buet has always shaped, to the extent that some actors complained about the limits of their media—such as Jean-André Deluc in the epigraph of this paper—, 
                     while others invented new forms of media—such as Saussure’s circular view engraved by Bourrit—, or coined specific terms to designate previously unobserved geological formations—such as the concept of “glacier” systematically defined for the first time by the Delucs and Saussure.
                 </p>
                 <p>Building on this history and the digital humanities, our perspective helped us reflect on the nature and function of media and their weaving—be they textual descriptions, drawings, charts, photographs, sounds—in the communication of scientific, literary, artistic, and touristic experiences, 
                     as well as in the collective production of the mountain space. In this first part, we show how specific attention given to the materialities and practices of media allowed us to rethink historiography in a digital context.

                     <p>Research on the history of mountain spaces has produced nuanced accounts that offer new perspectives about the cultural (Dora 2016; Reichler 2013), political (Hansen 2013; Mathieu 2013), artistic (Mark et al. 2017; Oettermann and Schneider 1997), environmental (Mathieu 2019), and scientific (Sigrist 2011; Felsch 2009) 
                         aspects of mountain explorations. While some studies have highlighted how mountains influenced the forms of knowledge produced there (Felsch 2009; Becker 2009; Gal 2018), the mountains themselves are often approached only through the narratives of the historical actors. Yet, mountains in general, and the Alps in particular, 
                         were long considered dangerous and barren lands, if not simply an uninteresting and remote void. For good and for ill, the scientific expeditions undertaken by the Genevan savants at the end of the eighteenth century greatly contributed to the taming of Mont Buet and its surroundings, paving the way for 
                         both scientific and touristic activities and practices. 
                     </p>
                     <p>For several decades, historians have drawn attention to the material practices and objects involved in the production of knowledge. In the past few years, historians of science have also started engaging directly with material practices and scientific objects by reconstructing experiments in laboratories (see Fors, Principe, and Sibum 2016). 
                         Though insightful, these reconstructions of past experiments have focused on the controlled and purified environment of the laboratory. However, as a vast literature in the history of science shows, the practice of science outside the laboratory confronted the practitioner with distinct issues (e.g. Kohler 2002; Vetter 2011). 
                         Special practices (e.g. note taking), instruments (sturdy, portable), or people (e.g. local informants) had to be deployed to navigate wild and unpredictable environments. We designed this project to develop and test a new approach for engaging directly (and complementary to traditional historical sources) with the material agency 
                         of physical environments to reveal the role they played in shaping new practices, scientific instruments or objects, forms of knowledge, even soundscapes (Valsangiacomo and Chanteloup 2023) and taste (Valsangiacomo and Mathieu 2023).
