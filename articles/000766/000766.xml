                 <p><name>Rebecca Y. Bayeck</name> is an assistant professor in instructional technology and learning sciences. 
                    Her research interests lie at the intersection of learning sciences, educational technology, literacy studies, 
                    and the interdisciplinary field of game studies. Within this intersection, my research includes games 
                    (digital and analog); learning and literacies; emerging technologies; and the design of inclusive learning spaces 
                    and exhibitions. She is also interested in Black digital humanities and in how it can inform other fields, as well 
                    as how how culture shapes learning and literacy practices in different environments. Dr. Bayeck holds a dual Ph.D. 
                    in Learning Design and Technology and Comparative International Education from 
                    <name>Pennsylvania State University</name>.

                 <p><name>Joseph M. Bayeck</name> is a researcher and educator. His research interests are at the intersection of 
                    learning, race, and culture. At this intersection, he also explores ways to leverage culture, technology, and 
                    mentoring to improve the learning experiences of minoritized students in the digital world. Dr. Bayeck is further 
                    interested in the emerging field of Black digital humanities as a resource to make sense of Black learners' 
                    experiences in the digital world.

         <dhq:abstract>
           <p>In an increasingly digital and digitized world, weaved in algorithms, the meaning and importance of the emerging field 
              of Black digital humanities (Black DH) is central to our understanding of the experiences of Black people. This special 
              issue builds on previous publications to center Black people and Blackness in the current world through the lenses of 
              Black DH, setting the stage for the various meanings and roles Black DH can play in its intersection with others fields 
              and practices that affect Black humanity and experience.

            <p>This special issue explores Black digital humanities viewed and interpreted for its meanings and implications in relation 
               to practices in the digital world and fields that affect Black experiences.

      <body>
        <div>
          <head></head>
            <p>The journey to conceptualizing this special issue started in a summer seminar organized by the 
               <ref target="https://www.clir.org"><name>Council on Library and Information Resources</name></ref> (<name>CLIR</name>). 
               Since 2004, through its postdoctoral fellowship program, <name>CLIR</name> has recruited, trained, and established 
               cohorts of talented researchers steeped in the materials and methods of their disciplines for work in libraries and 
               cultural organizations. In recent years, the program has endeavored to advance a sophisticated understanding of 
               production, management, and re-use of research data and to contribute to a sustainable infrastructure for future 
               research. Beginning in 2019, <name>CLIR</name> initiated the recruitment of postdoctoral researchers with a focus on 
               methods and processes pertaining to the execution of research in African American and African Studies. 
               <ref target="https://www.clir.org/2018/09/clir-receives-grant-for-data-curation-fellowships-in-african-american-and-african-studies/">The 
               Data Curation Fellowships for African American and African Studies (AAAS)</ref> provided an opportunity for scholars 
               to explore AAAS in the digital world and to contribute to the curation of data using approaches that are mindful of 
               issues such as privilege, identity, access, erasure, privacy, and technology.
            </p>
            <p><name>CLIR</name>'s seminar created a space for these fellows and their supervisors to engage in conversations related 
               to various topics. Participants discussed topics such as a) understanding the emerging field of Black digital humanities; 
               b) defining the future of Black digital humanities; and c) the intersection of emerging technologies with Black 
               experiences. <name>CLIR</name>'s postdoctoral fellowships in data curation for AAAS built on the work of researchers 
               like <name>Kim Gallon</name>, <name>Catherine Knight Steele</name>, <name>André Brock</name>, and <name>Moya 
               Bailey</name> in defining the field. Fellows also benefited from the works of scholars such as <name>Gabrielle 
               Foreman</name>, <name>Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie</name>, and <name>Safiya U. Noble</name> in our discussions about the 
               future of Black digital humanities.
            </p>
            <p>As <name>Alanna Prince</name> and <name>Cara Marta Messina</name> argue, more work still needs to be done to center 
               Black digital humanities <ptr target="#prince_etal2022"/>. Similarly, we contend that there is also a critical need to 
               center Black voices in Black digital humanities. We acknowledge that Black digital humanities has gained much ground 
               and is in the process of establishing itself as a field of research in its own right. The 2020 death of <name>George 
               Floyd</name> increased interest in Black experiences, bringing more light to the work that scholars like those 
               mentioned above have been doing for years. In our increasingly wired and digitized lives, interactions, culture, and 
               society, Black digital humanities is rightly situated to be the space that explores emerging technologies and Blackness, 
               the space that shapes new methods and practices in fields seeking to address and understand issues of race, power, and 
               access. This field is a space to examine how technology is used to study, define, and present Black people's experiences, 
               culture, and history in various settings.
            </p>
            <p>More than any other field, we contend that inherent to Black digital humanities work is information, formation, 
               transformation, and crosspollination of scholars and the public that engage with this work. By informing, we mean 
               educating on the work of Black scholars, innovative approaches to digital spaces, and projects that center Black people 
               in digital humanities <ptr target="#prince_etal2022"/>. Formation implies situating Black digital humanities as a 
               field in its own right and providing a space for individuals to make sense of Blackness in the digital age. We conceive 
               transformation as shaping research and practices to reflect the joy and fun of Black lives in their multiple forms. With 
               cross-pollination, we imply the free-flow of concepts, practices, and thoughts from Black digital humanities to other 
               fields and vice versa, which encourages knowledge sharing and dialogue <ptr target="#cramer_etal2023"/>. This special 
               issue builds on previous research to advance and situate Black digital humanities in relation to other fields. It also 
               points to the practice of learning and teaching inherent to Black digital humanities.
            </p>
            <p>For this special issue, we situated Black digital humanities in different contexts. In doing so, we intended to avoid 
               the creation of a <q>single story</q>, to refrain from presenting Blackness <q>as one thing, as only one thing, over 
               and over again</q> in the digital world. Connecting with the histories and pasts that inform Black digital humanities to 
               advance the field and shape its future, we drew on <term xml:lang="ak">Sankofa</term>, which is an Akan proverb as well 
               as a philosophical perspective from the broader Ashanti language group in <name>Ghana</name>, West <name>Africa</name>. 
               <term xml:lang="ak">Sankofa</term> means <quote rend="inline">we must go back and reclaim our past so we can move 
               forward; so, we understand why and how we came to be who we are today</quote> 
               <ptr target="#aboagye2022" loc="8"/>. Digital <term xml:lang="ak">Sankofa</term> is therefore about reclaiming how 
               Blackness and Black people have been constructed in digital spaces to define but also develop new ways of thinking as 
               time passes in the field of Black digital humanities. Hence, we think of the intersection of the past and future of 
               Blackness and Black people with technology and other fields. This approach reduces the barriers posed by the complexity 
               and specialized language typical of academic articles, thereby enhancing the dissemination of ideas beyond common Black 
               digital humanities circles.

          <head>Articles Included in This Special Issue</head>
            <p>The result is a collection of six articles that are both conceptual and practical in nature. The papers, which are 
               described briefly below, represent current and ongoing efforts to engage in the practice of Black digital humanities in 
               today's environments as well as learning contexts. It is our hope that these articles will offer insight into how 
               scholars are defining Black digital humanities and attend to issues of technology from a Black lens.
            </p>
            <p>The six articles that make up this special issue are organized into three distinct themes: (1) perspectives on Black 
               digital humanities and its future; (2) centering Blackness in digital spaces; and (3) owning the stories and experiences 
               of Black people.

            <p><title rend="quotes">Debates in #BlackDH: Key Moments and Queer Directions in Black Studies Scholarship</title> by 
               <name>Faithe J. Day</name> situates the critical role of Black digital humanities at the intersection of identity and 
               digital studies. Drawing on the research and researchers within and outside Black studies, the article shows how Black 
               digital humanities can expand by including Black feminist, queer, and justice-oriented perspectives. <name>Day</name> 
               contends that by engaging with the past, present, and future of Black studies, the Black digital humanities will only 
               continue to grow and spread through its own social and scholarly networks as a transformative assemblage of critical 
               and queer work.

            <p>In <title rend="quotes">Bridging the Gap of Exhibition Design, Instructional Design, and the Learning Sciences for the 
               Future of Black Digital Humanities</title>, <name>Rebecca Y. Bayeck</name> examines the connections between Black digital 
               humanities and the fields of exhibition design, instructional design, and the learning sciences. Focusing on key elements 
               of these fields, this paper shows their relevance to the Black digital humanities. The author also argues that Black 
               digital humanities has at its core principles and practices that call for equity and inclusion. Finally, the author 
               speaks to how the dialogue between Black digital humanities and other fields can create new frameworks for inclusion, 
               design, and learning for all. 
            </p>
            <p><title rend="quotes">Library Professionals: Instrumental in Black Digital Humanities</title> by <name>Jina 
               DuVernay</name> reflects on the current divide between library professionals and scholars in Black digital humanities. 
               Drawing on her experience as a librarian, the author argues that bridging the gap between library professionals and 
               Black digital humanities scholars will benefit this emerging field. Given the extent to which library professionals 
               engage in digital humanities-related projects, <name>DuVernay</name> highlights the importance of learning more about 
               the field of Black digital humanities to aid scholars in advancing their work.

            <p><title rend="quotes">Decolonial by Design: Building <title rend="italic">Sekuru's Stories</title></title> by 
               <name>Jennifer Kyker</name> emerges from a co-authored digital humanities project that contributes toward the 
               decoloniality of knowledge by preserving the music and oral histories of Zimbabwean <term xml:lang="sn">mbira</term> 
               player <name>Sekuru Tute Chigamba</name>. Through the her work with <name>Sekuru</name> and the case study of 
               <title rend="italic">Sekuru's Stories</title>, the author shows how digital humanities projects can serve as a tool to 
               highlight and tell the stories of Black people that went unheard or ignored as a result of colonization.
            </p>
            <p><name>Angela Sutton</name> and <name>Jessica Fletcher</name>'s <title rend="quotes">Community-Driven Linked Data 
               Approaches in <title rend="italic">Builders and Defenders</title>: <name>Nashville</name>'s Historical Black Civil War 
               Database</title> discusses the development of the <title rend="italic">Builders and Defenders</title> database, which 
               collects biographical information on the Black Civil War-era population of <name>Fort Negley</name> in 
               <name>Tennessee</name>. The authors reflect on the creation of the database, which required critical collaboration with 
               the community of <name>Nashville</name>, as well as intentional engagement in collective decisions and conversations with 
               descendants, public and academic historians, computer scientists, and software developers. The article centers Black 
               voices, histories, and experiences, offering fresh insights into the interpretations and meanings surrounding the history 
               of <name>Fort Negley</name>.

            <p>Finally, <title rend="quotes">Infrastructural Sovereignty in the Black Atlantic</title> by <name>Dhanashree Thorat</name>

               Black man who was kidnapped from his <name>Igbo</name> village and sold into slavery. This article reads Google's 
               infrastructural initiative against the grain of <name>Equiano</name>'s autobiographical narrative to locate how the 
               violent afterlives of slavery and colonialism manifest in and undergird internet infrastructure projects today.
