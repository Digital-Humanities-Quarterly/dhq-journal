                  <p>In an increasingly digital and digitized world, weaved in algorithms, the meaning
                     and importance of the emerging field 
                     of Black digital humanities (Black DH) is central to our understanding of the experiences
                     of Black people. This special 
                     issue builds on previous publications to center Black people and Blackness in the
                     current world through the lenses of 
                     Black DH, setting the stage for the various meanings and roles Black DH can play in
                     its intersection with others fields 
                     and practices that affect Black humanity and experience.

                     Since 2004, through its postdoctoral fellowship program, CLIR has recruited, trained, and established 
                     cohorts of talented researchers steeped in the materials and methods of their disciplines
                     for work in libraries and 
                     cultural organizations. In recent years, the program has endeavored to advance a sophisticated
                     understanding of 
                     production, management, and re-use of research data and to contribute to a sustainable
                     infrastructure for future 
                     research. Beginning in 2019, CLIR initiated the recruitment of postdoctoral researchers with a focus on 
                     methods and processes pertaining to the execution of research in African American
                     and African Studies.

                        Data Curation Fellowships for African American and African Studies (AAAS)</a> provided an opportunity for scholars 
                     to explore AAAS in the digital world and to contribute to the curation of data using
                     approaches that are mindful of 
                     issues such as privilege, identity, access, erasure, privacy, and technology.

                  <div class="ptext" id="p2">CLIR's seminar created a space for these fellows and their supervisors to engage in conversations
                     related 
                     to various topics. Participants discussed topics such as a) understanding the emerging
                     field of Black digital humanities; 
                     b) defining the future of Black digital humanities; and c) the intersection of emerging
                     technologies with Black 
                     experiences. CLIR's postdoctoral fellowships in data curation for AAAS built on the work of researchers
                     
                     like Kim Gallon, Catherine Knight Steele, André Brock, and Moya 
                     Bailey in defining the field. Fellows also benefited from the works of scholars such as
                     Gabrielle 
                     Foreman, Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie, and Safiya U. Noble in our discussions about the 
                     future of Black digital humanities.

                  <div class="ptext" id="p3">As Alanna Prince and Cara Marta Messina argue, more work still needs to be done to center 
                     Black digital humanities [<a class="ref" href="#prince_etal2022">Prince and Messina 2022</a>]. Similarly, we contend that there is also a critical need to 
                     center Black voices in Black digital humanities. We acknowledge that Black digital
                     humanities has gained much ground 
                     and is in the process of establishing itself as a field of research in its own right.
                     The 2020 death of George 
                     Floyd increased interest in Black experiences, bringing more light to the work that scholars
                     like those 
                     mentioned above have been doing for years. In our increasingly wired and digitized
                     lives, interactions, culture, and 
                     society, Black digital humanities is rightly situated to be the space that explores
                     emerging technologies and Blackness, 
                     the space that shapes new methods and practices in fields seeking to address and understand
                     issues of race, power, and 
                     access. This field is a space to examine how technology is used to study, define,
                     and present Black people's experiences, 
                     culture, and history in various settings.

                  <div class="ptext" id="p4">More than any other field, we contend that inherent to Black digital humanities work
                     is information, formation, 
                     transformation, and crosspollination of scholars and the public that engage with this
                     work. By informing, we mean 
                     educating on the work of Black scholars, innovative approaches to digital spaces,
                     and projects that center Black people 
                     in digital humanities [<a class="ref" href="#prince_etal2022">Prince and Messina 2022</a>]. Formation implies situating Black digital humanities as a 
                     field in its own right and providing a space for individuals to make sense of Blackness
                     in the digital age. We conceive 
                     transformation as shaping research and practices to reflect the joy and fun of Black
                     lives in their multiple forms. With 
                     cross-pollination, we imply the free-flow of concepts, practices, and thoughts from
                     Black digital humanities to other 
                     fields and vice versa, which encourages knowledge sharing and dialogue [<a class="ref" href="#cramer_etal2023">Cramer and Tichenor 2023</a>]. This special 
                     issue builds on previous research to advance and situate Black digital humanities
                     in relation to other fields. It also 
                     points to the practice of learning and teaching inherent to Black digital humanities.

                  <div class="ptext" id="p5">For this special issue, we situated Black digital humanities in different contexts.
                     In doing so, we intended to avoid 
                     the creation of a “single story”, to refrain from presenting Blackness “as one thing, as only one thing, over 
                     and over again” in the digital world. Connecting with the histories and pasts that inform Black digital
                     humanities to 
                     advance the field and shape its future, we drew on <em class="term">Sankofa</em>, which is an Akan proverb as well 
                     as a philosophical perspective from the broader Ashanti language group in Ghana, West Africa. 
                     <em class="term">Sankofa</em> means “we must go back and reclaim our past so we can move 
                     forward; so, we understand why and how we came to be who we are today” 
                     [<a class="ref" href="#aboagye2022">Aboagye 2022</a>, 8]. Digital <em class="term">Sankofa</em> is therefore about reclaiming how 
                     Blackness and Black people have been constructed in digital spaces to define but also
                     develop new ways of thinking as 
                     time passes in the field of Black digital humanities. Hence, we think of the intersection
                     of the past and future of 
                     Blackness and Black people with technology and other fields. This approach reduces
                     the barriers posed by the complexity 
                     and specialized language typical of academic articles, thereby enhancing the dissemination
                     of ideas beyond common Black 
                     digital humanities circles.

                     at the intersection of identity and digital studies. Drawing on the research and researchers
                     within and outside Black 
                     studies, the article shows how Black digital humanities can expand by including Black
                     feminist, queer, and justice-oriented 
                     perspectives. Day contends that by engaging with the past, present, and future of Black studies, the
                     Black 
                     digital humanities will only continue to grow and spread through its own social and
                     scholarly networks as a transformative 
                     assemblage of critical and queer work.

                     of these fields, this paper shows their relevance to the Black digital humanities.
                     The author also argues that Black 
                     digital humanities has at its core principles and practices that call for equity and
                     inclusion. Finally, the author

                     DuVernay reflects on the current divide between library professionals and scholars in Black

                     Drawing on her experience as a librarian, the author argues that bridging the gap
                     between library professionals and 
                     Black digital humanities scholars will benefit this emerging field. Given the extent
                     to which library professionals

                     <cite class="title italic">Sekuru's Stories</cite>, the author shows how digital humanities projects can serve as a tool to 
                     highlight and tell the stories of Black people that went unheard or ignored as a result
                     of colonization.

                     Database” discusses the development of the <cite class="title italic">Builders and Defenders</cite> database, which 
                     collects biographical information on the Black Civil War-era population of Fort Negley in

                     with 
                     the community of Nashville, as well as intentional engagement in collective decisions and conversations with
                     
                     descendants, public and academic historians, computer scientists, and software developers.

                     focuses on the June 2019 Google announcement of a new undersea fiber-optic cable line
                     connecting Portugal 
                     and South Africa, which was named “Equiano” after Olaudah Equiano, an eighteenth-century 
                     Black man who was kidnapped from his Igbo village and sold into slavery. This article reads Google's 
                     infrastructural initiative against the grain of Equiano's autobiographical narrative to locate how the 
                     violent afterlives of slavery and colonialism manifest in and undergird internet infrastructure
                     projects today.
