            <head>Introduction<note> I would like to
								express my sincere thanks to the anonymous reviewers and the editors
								for their careful review of my manuscript and their many insightful
								comments and valuable suggestions. I also thank deepl.com for help
								in translating both the quotations from the German-language
								travelogues as well as from some French or German research articles,
								and partly my own manuscript. All travelogues were originally
								published in German, which I will not mark in the following.
								Regarding the few translated quotations from research contributions,
								in contrast, I indicate the original
					language.</note>

            <p>In loose modification of Firth’s famous dictum, one could claim: “You shall know
					a category by the company it keeps!”<note> The original dictum is: “You shall know a word by the
								company it keeps!” [Firth 1962 [1957]: 11.]</note>
					Understanding categories implicitly in their relation to other categories is
					omnipresent in the digital humanities, but explicit and systematic reflections
					on the nature and implications of these relations are rare. The importance of
					relations between categories is particularly evident in knowledge organization
					systems such as ontologies and taxonomies. However, they also play an important
					role in many other contexts, because categories mediate between different levels
					intertwined in research processes. In view of such methodological entanglements,
					the article is concerned with the systematization of categorial relations. The
					related research and discussions involve the thematic field and practice of
					‘annotation’, for which the application and development of categories are
					central [Gius / Jacke 2017], the concept of ‘operationalization’ [Moretti 2013]
					[Pichler / Reiter 2022] as well as different understandings or
					conceptualizations of ‘theory’ [Kleymann 2023] and ‘modeling’ [Flanders /
					Jannidis 2018]. These concepts and practices have in common that they all play a
					central role in bridging the gap between computational methods and the theoretic
					concepts of the humanities. According to Drucker [2021, 81] the motivation of
					humanities scholars is rather the “investigation of the cultural record”, less
					“problem solving”. In the digital humanities, both are intertwined: problem
					solving with the aim of knowledge production about the cultural record. In this
					intermediate position, categories and the construction and reflection of their
					use in the context of modeling as a “process of identification and
					categorization” [Diehr 2021, 251] play an important role. </p>
            <p>The reflections in this contribution are based on an underlying study that
					examined – in the frame of a PhD project rooted in literary studies, oriented
					towards cultural studies and digital humanities – patterns of knowledge and
					argumentation in a corpus of German-language travelogues about India published
					around 1900 [Hinzmann 2020a]. In the comparative reading and annotation process,
					these patterns were (re)constructed<note> The typographical solution of ‘(re)construction’ is
								intended to represent the understanding that it is a combination of
								‘construction’ and ‘reconstruction’: It involves a constructivist
								approach that at the same time strives for the closest possible
								proximity to the historical recurrence phenomena to be
								reconstructed.</note> and investigated as <emph>topoi</emph>. In this endeavor the operationalization and
					(re)modeling of topology as a methodology were merged. In doing so, I pursued a
					double objective: I linked the systematic exploration of the
					semantic-argumentative content of the study corpus with the development of a
					methodology to realize this analysis and interpretation based on it. A <emph>topos</emph> – the central category of the study – is
					particularly complex. The notion of ‘topos’ has a multi-faceted conceptual
					history between different languages [Rubinelli 2009], so the definitional
					challenges are omnipresent. In the following, ‘topos’ is used in the singular
					and ‘topoi’ in the plural, which follows the origin in Greek and can be
					considered conventionalized.<note>
								For example, the translation of Curtius’ standard work <title rend="italic">European Literature and the Latin Middle
									Ages</title> (a study that shaped literary studies of topoi) uses
								the term ‘topic’ to translate ‘topos’. This translation can lead to
								unfavorable and misleading implications especially within the
								digital humanities (including its proximity to ‘topics’ in ‘topic
								modeling’). The terminological decision is meant to clarify that, in
								addition to the thematic-semantic dimension, it is also a category
								that has an argumentative dimension and is rooted in Greek rhetoric.
								I refer to a system of concrete topoi as <term>topology</term>. Although different practices can be observed,
								this use of topology can also be considered conventionalized [Meiner
								2022] [Rubinelli 2017]. To ensure a distinction from topology as
								methodology, I italicize the term topology when referring to a
								constellation of topoi. The adjective ‘topical’ refers to the
								concept of ‘topoi’ (but not ‘topics’). To avoid confusion of terms
								and in the sense of demarcation, it should be further taken into
								account that ‘topology’ as a term has experienced a remarkable boom
								in the last decade, which is not predominantly related to topoi. One
								reason for this is that the Greek prefix ‘topo-’, for example, is
								also contained in the term ‘topography’, to which ‘topology’ refers
								in a different way in other research contexts and projects, where
								‘topology’ emphasizes some relational interdependencies, but it is
								otherwise a completely different use of the term (see e.g. [Rosol
								2022]).</note> Following [Bornscheuer 1976] I define a
					topos as a pattern of argumentation that is not reducible to its particular
					(formal) logical dimension, but polyvalent. For the (re)construction of topoi,
					important aspects are the frequency of their occurrence on the surface of the
					text (quantitative dimension, recurrence) and the argumentative functionality
					(qualitative dimension, coherence). That is why I have modeled topoi as dynamic
					crystallization points of recurring argumentation patterns closely associated
					and inseparable from semantic and symbolic dimensions. The comparison of a large
					number of argumentative contexts is necessary in the (re)construction process.
					Topoi have an elementary character, yet are not stable ‘cores’. They do not lie
					on the surface of the text but are anchored in the <term>(en)doxa</term> – a historically and culturally situated, generally accepted
					and shared knowledge of experience, orientation and opinion that is referred to
					or expressed in argumentation [Amossy 2002] [Bornscheuer 1976].<note> Cf. [Bornscheuer 1976,
								99-100]; although [Bornscheuer 1976] is an important reference for a
								dynamic topos concept (between instrument and sediment, innovation
								and tradition, etc.), his study remains partly abstract – he does
								not solve the problem of operationalizing the concept for text
								analysis.</note>
            </p>
            <p>Considering the broader context of categorial relations in their relevance for
					digital humanities on the one hand and the concrete study in the field of topos
					research on the other, the question is what can be derived from the study, in
					other words, what is transferable to other categories and category systems. The
					complexity and multi-layered nature of ‘topos’ as a category, historically going
					back to antiquity, provides an opportunity to systematize the interdependencies
					between categorial elements in the concrete research design. The starting point
					was the ‘relationality’ of topoi – i.e. the assumptions that a topos needs to be
					(re)constructed in relation to other topos concepts and that the category
					‘topos’ should be defined in relation to other categories. The basic principles
					observable in this specific context of the development and application of
					categories are transferable to other contexts. The paper proposes a typology
					differentiating vertical, horizontal, heuristic and epistemological relations.
					After an overview of the conceptual model of the four relation types and an
					outline of the related framework, I will situate my understanding of topology as
					methodology within topos research and then illustrate the relations by
					explaining what each of them means in this context as well as by discussing
					concrete examples from the travelogue corpus. I will then focus on the iterative
					dimension of the research process. Finally, I will briefly reflect on
					limitations and open up perspectives on possible future work.</p>

            <head>Overview, general characterization and reflection of categorial relations </head>
            <p>A decision in designing the conceptual model is that categories and categorial
					relations can be organized within a heuristic space. Different heuristic spaces
					can be discussed in a comparative perspective – represented by the
					epistemological space which is conceived as a conceptual macro-space that
					encompasses several heuristic spaces (see Figure 1). While vertical and
					horizontal relations can be conceived as rather simple axes, heuristic and
					epistemological relations represent more complex spaces of categorial
					interdependencies (see Table 1). The heuristic space consists of three axes: In
					addition to the vertical and horizontal relations, there is the diagonal
					relation between categories that do not belong to the same class. The diagonal
					axis is important and will be considered in their interaction with the other two
					axes, but the focus is on the vertical and horizontal axes. Another important
					conceptual distinction of the spatial model are three different levels: The
					level of the textual surface refers directly to the object of investigation,
					e.g. a text corpus. On the opposite side lies a deep structure, which represents
					the level of theoretical concepts or interpretations of the realm of phenomena.
					In the middle or in the space in between, categories and concepts operate,
					building a bridge between the other two levels.</p>

            <p>
               <emph>Vertical relations</emph>: The vertical axis connects
					observable and measurable entities on the textual surface with a theoretic
					concept and a category which relates them. Starting from a central category,
					this axis thus builds a bridge in two directions: on the one side to the
					concrete measurable and describable units of investigation of the primary object
					and on the other side to theoretical concepts or interpretations of certain
					underlying principles or structures in the field of phenomena. There is a strong
					overlap with the concept of operationalization understood as a “method for
					tracing a (theoretical) term back to text-surface phenomena” [Pichler / Reiter
					2021, 1]. [Moretti 2013, 1] already describes this with a bridge metaphor:
					„Operationalizing means building a bridge from concepts to measurement, and then
					to the world. In our case: from the concepts of literary theory, through some
					form of quantification, to literary texts.” </p>
            <p>
               <emph>Horizontal relations:</emph> The horizontal relation links
					different concepts that belong to the same category type. Concepts in this sense
					are instantiations of a category type. In the analysis of such concepts, the
					definition of the single concept arises in relation to the other concepts – in
					other words, within the system of all distinct concepts. The concepts belong to
					the same category type, thus they are in a non-hierarchical relation, like for
					instance elements of controlled vocabularies. Manifestations of concrete
					concepts can be located on the horizontal surface of the text. </p>
            <p>
               <emph>Heuristic relations:</emph> The heuristic relations
					comprise the interdependencies implied by all categorial relations within one
					framework, including besides the vertical and the horizontal also the diagonal
					axis, which concerns the relations between categories belonging to different
					types of categories. The heuristic space is a model of the interconnectedness of
					the vertical, the horizontal and the diagonal axis and represents how a category
					system works.</p>
            <p>
               <emph>Epistemological relations: </emph>Epistemological
					relations concern the theoretical reflection on the interdependence of
					categories between different frameworks, thus it is about a definition of
					categories in relation to other category systems. In this perspective, we
					compare categories at a high level of abstraction. That means a meta level of
					relating a category (= the conceptualization or definition of a category type)
					to categories belonging to other frameworks. The questions here are how a
					methodological framework can be related to other frameworks and maybe also
					larger paradigms or paradigm shifts. The exact epistemological distinction of a
					category from definitions of a comparable category not at least allows for new
					perspectives on possible synergies combining different methodologies. </p>

            <head>Categorial relations in the (re)construction of topoi and the (re)modeling of
					topology as a methodology</head>
            <p>At the beginning of the study of the travelogue corpus, I identified striking
					patterns in both the argumentative and the semantic-imaginary dimension. I
					searched for a suitable set of instruments and a category system with which I
					could describe these varying repetitions. In a comparative reading and manual
					annotation process I investigated them as <term>topoi</term>. The
					process included two main aspects: (1) analyzing the corpus with topology as a
					methodology; (2) modeling the character and functioning of topoi as well as
					topology as a methodology by working with the concrete categories and concepts
					and applying them to the corpus. The category of topos seemed to capture the
					patterns of recurrence in their imaginary-argumentative complexity and
					interconnectedness. The fact that the concept of topos is particularly frequent
					in the research on travel literature and intercultural studies – but without a
					systematic methodology – encouraged this choice. The desideratum that I tried to
					address was a synthesis between the theory and practice of topos research. The
					elements of the category system were not defined at the beginning, except for
					the central category of <term>topos</term>, whose definition was,
					however, modified in the process of remodeling the topology. The iterative
					development of the category system during the annotation of the material lacks
					published documentation. More standardization for this kind of development of a
					category system would be helpful. Both the underlying study and the proposed
					framework of categorial relations aim to contribute to this effort.<note> In the underlying study,
								manual annotation was conducted in different systems (with a
								changing set of keywords and concepts) and relevance was assessed
								taking into account frequency (via simple search functions). In
								comparison to standards of digital humanities, this procedure is not
								best practice. At the same time, the process had a dynamic openness
								which gave new insights about how development and application of
								categories within ‘recursive modeling’ work.</note> In the
					(re)construction of topos concepts and subsequent analytical steps, it became
					increasingly clear how topoi can be characterized and defined in their
					polyfunctionality. After the following introductory remarks presenting the
					central reference points of my approach and briefly outlining the results of the
					work, the focus will then lie on illustrating and exemplifying the relations
					with reference to topos research in general and the underlying study in
					particular.</p>
            <div>
               <head>Previous topos research and striving towards a transdisciplinary
						methodology </head>
               <p>Topos research stands between the disciplines; it is not standardized and
						transverse to conventional paradigms (cf. [Knoblauch 2000] regarding
						sociology). In my understanding, this is primarily because its roots lie in
						antiquity and are embedded in a way of thinking that does not have
						disciplinary divisions and corresponding knowledge production practices, as
						we know them today. Within the ‘philological tradition’, topology has split
						into different areas, each of which emphasizes different qualities of topoi
						dependent on the specific (sub)discipline and related research interests.
						The versatility of the category has led to its fragmentation. In his
						discussion of ancient rhetoric [Barthes 1985, 138-141] already emphasized
						the complexity and threefold role of topoi / topology – as method, as
						storeroom (of possible argumentative elements), and as grid (for finding
							arguments).<note> In the
									original, the terms are ‘méthode’, ‘réserve’ and ‘grille’
									[Barthes 1985, 138-141].</note> However, he did not
						translate this into a concrete methodology. The most elaborated and
						important theoretical reference for my approach is Bornscheuer’s dynamic
						concept of topos. [Bornscheuer 1976, passim] emphasizes that topoi are both
						‘sediment’ and ‘instrument’ (i.e. ‘storeroom’ and ‘grid’). Although
						Bornscheuer derived and defined the polyvalence of the category of topos
						very precisely from a theoretical point of view, particularly with reference
						to the ancient rhetorical tradition, he did not realize nor conceive a
						transfer into analytical practice. [Knape 2000, 758] notes this lack of
						practice in the field of topos research as a desideratum and emphasizes the
						challenges of isolating and interpreting topical structures in a text.
						However, his approach of a two-axis model influenced by structuralism and
						rhetoric is linked to a problematic conception of conscious text production,
						in which he assumes that topoi always exist in a paradigm and are
						“implemented” during text production [Knape 2000, 756].<note> However, such a
									retrievable paradigm cannot be presupposed for the modern age
									(i.e. a time in which topology is no longer a widespread
									educational medium and therefore awareness of topoi in language
									use cannot be assumed), but must be (re)constructed by means of
									concrete manifestations of topoi at the surface level of the
									text.</note> This entails, among other problems, a
						tendency to overemphasize the stability of topoi and to overlook their
						potential to dynamize discourses and systems of knowledge.<note> The inaccurate limitation
									of topos research to the static, conservative character of topoi
									is also recognized by [Hallacker / Schmidt-Biggemann, 21], who
									address questions of innovation and transformation processes of
									knowledge (but do not pursue the development of a systematic
									methodology).</note> Following Bornscheuer [1976, 177],
						however, topoi can be seen as the source and result of various
						historical-social forces; they are both influential and changeable,
						stabilizing and dynamizing. The stable tradition or conventionality of
						‘topoi’ is discussed within literary studies, particularly in the reception
						of Curtius’ influential and polarizing work <title rend="italic">European Literature and the Latin Middle Ages</title>.<note> In the reception of Ernst
									Robert Curtius, who has become (in reducing his work)
									paradigmatic for a motif-historical conception of topos research
									[Curtius 2013 [1948]], different notions of topos became
									established in the different (sub)disciplines (simplified:
									literary studies – ‘material’, linguistics – ‘formal’), which
									ran unmediated and disconnected side by side. </note>
               </p>
               <p>A splitting within topos research was subsequently reinforced in the
						contrasting of two different qualities of topoi already outlined above –
						namely that they are a (“material”) ‘storeroom’ on the one hand and a
						(“formal”) ‘grid’, a kind of ‘template’ for argumentation, on the other.
						Studying the travelogues, however, clearly demonstrated how closely these
						two qualities are intertwined, so that I pursued an integrative approach
						that would overcome (sub)disciplinary boundaries. The knowledge of
						experience, orientation and opinion that crystallizes in topoi regulates the
						“asystematic coherence” [Bornscheuer 1976, 43] of communication (in everyday
						language, but also more ‘aesthetic forms’). This encompasses a broad range
						of knowledge-related and argumentation practices. It spans from political
						contexts to constructions of imaginary spaces (such as ‘India’) to knowledge
						about genres (like ‘travelogues’). It is important to recognize that
						rationality in this context tends to be overemphasized: Argumentative
						coherence usually is note created purely in a rational or logical way, but
						based on the (historically and culturally situated) archive of topoi.<note> For the relatedness of
									the concept of archive with the approach of topology as
									methodology, see [Hinzmann 2020a, 448-450] discussing [Baßler
									2005].</note> Thus, topoi generate both argumentative
						coherence as well as symbolically-imaginarily grounded semantic coherence.

               <p>While topos research in its various lines of tradition represents a pool of
						ideas around topoi, a convincing set of tools to systematize the
						argumentative-semantic patterns in my study corpus was lacking. In view of
						this methodological vacuum in the ‘traditional humanities’ and the abundance
						of material to be handled (40 travelogues, approx. 11,000 printed pages), I
						relied on ideas from the digital humanities (and corpus linguistics) for
						conceptual modeling and combined this line of thought with a discussion of
						topos research. I was concerned with integrating various relevant aspects of
						the category into a multi-layered conceptualization of ‘topos’ that is
						connected to, but also distinct from, the rhetorical tradition, and could be
						translated into a concrete research design. The images contained in the
						corpus (e.g. photographs) were excluded for pragmatic reasons; all
						considerations relate to the annotation and analysis of texts.<note> My hypothesis regarding
									the intermediality of topoi (e.g. [Pfister / Seidel 2003]) would
									be that condensation processes are intensified through the
									interrelations or ‘echoes’ of textual and visual manifestations
									of topoi.</note>
               </p>
               <p>The results lie on two closely interlinked levels: the (re)construction of
						topoi and the (re)modeling of topoi as a methodology. An important aspect is
						the assumption that topoi are defined in relation to other topoi, namely to
						other topos concepts that have been modeled as instantiations of the
						category topos. The topos concepts are modeled as elements of a topical
						constellation and thus lying on the same level. I refer to these
						constellations using the term <term>topology</term> (and
						distinguish it from topology as methodology by italicizing it).<note> See further explanation
									regarding the terminological decision above in note
								4.</note> Two
						<term>topologies </term>– the ‘India <term>topology</term>’ and the ‘travelogue <term>topology</term>’ – were considered relevant for the corpus of
						German-language India travelogues around 1900. The India <term>topology</term> is composed of 86 topoi that contribute to the topical
						stabilization and dynamization of an imaginary ‘India’ around 1900 (see
						Figure 6). The travelogue <term>topology</term>, on the other
						hand, forms a constellation of 67 topoi that are considered characteristic
						of the textual genre ‘travelogue’ around 1900 (see Figure 2).<note> The underlying study not
									only looked for topoi in the primary text material, but also in
									research texts on comparable texts (research from the field of
									travel literature and intercultural studies). This step was
									intended to create a horizon for comparison. It became clear
									that there are some topoi that have already been discussed, but
									nowhere with the systematic objective of topology as
									methodology. Some topoi of the ‘India <term>topology</term>’ are also relevant in other texts about
									‘India’ as [Dharampal-Frick 1994] for the early modern period
									and [Gokhale 2011] for the second half of the 20th century have
									shown. The topoi of the ‘travelogue <term>topology</term>’ are also relevant in texts about other
									imaginary spaces (see for example [Fischer 2004] for ‘England’
									and [Schmidhofer 2010] for ‘Japan’).</note> This
						heuristic differentiation of two <term>topologies</term> allows
						for the specific characterization of each individual constellation as well
						as the precise description of the interdependencies between them. Their
						visualization in clusters opens new perspectives on the underlying
						principles of their interconnectedness.</p>

               <p>Figure 2 shows the twelve cluster of the travelogue <term>topology</term>. These clusters are the result of conceptual modeling.
						Two topoi associated with the same cluster are distinct but functionally
						similar. Subsequent to the (re)construction of the topoi, the (conceptual)
						cluster analysis allows for their systematization in order to gain a better
						overview of the connections and characteristics of the specific <term>topology</term>. The clustering of the two different
						topologies revealed clear differences in the ways the respective topoi
							act.<note> The clustering
									related to those topoi that constitute the imaginary India
									around 1900 shows specific forms of topical collocations, which
									become visible through the systematization in clusters, as well
									as different types of clusters. With regard to the bridge topoi
									in in the India <term>topology</term>, it can be
									noted that these occur less frequently, but are particularly
									frequent between the two clusters of interpretations of history and colonialism. See the visualization of the India <term>topology</term> in Figure 6.</note>
						In the clustering of the travelogue <term>topology</term>, the
						phenomenon emerged that some topoi belong to more than one cluster. This
						coincides with the increasingly clarified view of the polyfunctionality of
						topoi, i.e. the fact that topoi are argumentatively open. That means that
						their argumentative character can manifest in ‘different directions’
						(described in rhetoric as the ‘in utramque partem principle’ [Bornscheuer
						1976, 42]). However, these argumentative ‘directions’ are not only ‘pro’ or
						‘contra’, but – in my combinatorial approach – depend on the other topoi
						with which they occur. This approach echoes earlier findings of topos
						research, but significantly expands and nuances them.</p>
               <p>These forms of combination have been central to the investigation of the
						corpus and I have modeled them as ‘topical collocations’. The relevance of
						this category was clear relatively early on, as my aim was to operationalize
						the observed combinatorial character of topoi. The modeling of bridge topoi,
						in contrast, is a particularly striking example of how a new phenomenon and
						the associated category can become visible in the research process. Based on
						the finding that some of the topoi belong to several clusters, I defined the
						concept of bridge topoi and applied it as a category in the following. This
						is an important step in the process: An emergent phenomenon is
						conceptualized and the resulting concept is transformed into a category in
						the moment in which it is systematically applied. This application of the
						category consisted of systematically checking for each topos whether a
						multiple assignment to the clusters is plausible or not on the basis of the
						annotated examples (and their frequency). This resulted in a deeper
						knowledge of the travelogue <term>topology</term> and thus also
						a new understanding of the genre. The approach of (re)defining travelogues
						in its basic characteristic and genre principles via clusters and associated
						topoi could probably be transferred to other genres. The assumption is that
						a text-type-specific investigation of topoi and their clustering would also
						be informative for other corpora.</p>
               <p>While the (re)construction of the topoi, the clustering and the collocation
						analysis concern the level of the realm of phenomena, I have (re)modeled
						topology as methodology step by step in parallel. The starting point was the
						topos research mentioned above and the aim of developing a systematic
						methodology. In addition to the more precise modeling of some general
						functional principles of topoi (reduction and amplification, distribution,
						combination), the study resulted in ten operationalization steps. This
						result is both a model of topology as a practiced methodology (‘model of’)
						and hopefully a ‘model for’ future research designs in (digital) topos
						research. The operationalization steps condense the methodological insights
						gained in the course of the process – in other words, they are an idealized
						and abstract representation of the research process. The modeling of these
						steps and their practical implementation simultaneously led to the
						application of the methodology that I developed and used in parallel. Their
						order does not necessarily correspond to this chronology but can also
						deviate depending e.g. on the hypotheses or the research question. The first
						five steps are particularly important with regard to category development
						and application. (1.) definition of the corpus, (2.) definition of the
						relevant <term>topologies</term>, (3.) (re)construction of
						topoi, (4.) cluster analysis, (5). collocation analysis. The steps 6 to 9
						are less relevant for understanding the main analysis results but concern
						their further interpretation.<note> After the (6.) interpretation of the (re)constructed and
									clustered topoi, (7.) previous research especially on travel
									literature was set in relation to the analysis results. In the
									(re)construction process, (8.) I encountered resistance
									(especially with regard to the recurrence pattern of
									‘abundance’, which has neither the quality of a topos nor a
									cluster, but which I ultimately modeled as a ‘super topos’).
									Such resistances appear to be generalizable and constitute a
									separate operationalization step. (9.) Especially in literary
									studies, the singularity of the individual text is often
									overemphasized because no corpus is known or available as
									reference material. Against the background of the topoi of an
									entire corpus, it becomes clearer for each individual text what
									is specific and what are characteristics shared with other
									texts. </note> The last operationalization step (10.)
						reflects the dynamics of remodeling topology as a methodology while applying
						it. </p>
               <p>In the following, I discuss the four relations already presented using
						concrete examples from the travelogue corpus of the underlying study. The
						principle behind their selection is that they are as representative as
						possible of the relation type to be shown and relatively easy to understand,
						also without deeper knowledge of travelogues or India.</p>

               <head>Vertical relations</head>
               <p>The <emph>category</emph> topos is closely related to the
						<emph>concept </emph>topos. Both lie on
						a mediating level, oriented upwards towards the textual surface and
						downwards towards the <term>endoxa</term>, an assumed discursive
						deep structure (see Figure 3). As already mentioned, topoi can be
						(re)constructed from their manifestations on the surface of the text. In
						this process, certain recurring patterns, which I have called ‘manifestation
						patterns’, can often be recognized among larger numbers of manifestations.
						Several of these manifestation patterns can be subsumed under one topos or,
						conversely, the manifestation patterns can be understood as forms of
						expression of the topos. The level of manifestation patterns is an
						intermediate level between the category topos and the surface of the text.
						As outlined above, the relevance of topoi is based on both recurrence and
						coherence – both together determine their relevance in a concrete discursive
						situation. In Figure 3, the <emph>category</emph> topos
						shows up on the axis linked to the form of a concrete <emph>concept</emph> anchored in an underlying
						structure.</p>

               <p>The <term>too much Europe</term> topos appears in different
						manifestation patterns such as ‘too much civilization’, ‘too much industry’,
						‘bad European influence’, etc. In the naming of the topos, the <term>too much</term> was included because the topos is
						particularly frequently appearing in this line of argument (not just as
						“European influence”). In some cases, it is linked to the influence of
						British colonial domination.<note> Cf. [Fries 1912, 137]: „Apart from that, Bombay is too much
									of a Europeanized city to help our interest for long.” Cf.
									[Wechsler 1906, 112] regarding Calcutta: „This is where Europe
									is centralized. Here are the big banks, the big traders, and
									even though the city is two long day journeys by express train
									away from Bombay, life in the European quarter is still much
									more European, or more English to be precise, than in Bombay
									itself.”</note> In other cases, it is not explicitly
						related to Europe, but to ‘civilization’ in general. Criticism of
						industrialization and modernity are closely linked in this manifestation
						pattern, which is, e.g., related to living and working conditions.<note> Cf. [Hengstenberg 1908,
									165]: „Like a whirlwind, modern industry burst upon the minds of
									harmless people and affected their outer and inner
								lives.”</note> Certain major cities are perceived as
						particularly Europeanized, while others, such as Jeypur, do not yet seem to
						be affected by the process.<note> Cf. [Garbe 1889: 55-56]: “If my readers should have gained
									the impression from the mention of the various European
									institutions that life in Jeypur is already drenched in Western
									culture to a remarkable degree, then I must assure them with
									great determination that the opposite is true. Only in Benares
									has Indian folk life preserved the character of the highest
									antiquity so pure and unadorned as in Jeypur
							[...].”</note> The topos thus appears on the text level in a
						wide range of forms in which it crystallizes and is at the same time
						anchored in various discursive contexts that inform the corpus (colonialism,
						tourism, etc.). </p>

               <head>Horizontal relations</head>
               <p>The axis of the horizontal relations can operate in different ways and thus
						be subdivided into two parts (see Figure 4). In the case of the
						(re)construction of topoi, the relation betweens the individual topos
						concept (as instantiation of the category) and the other elements in the
						respective concept system (the ‘India <term>topology</term>’ and
						the ‘travelogue <term>topology</term>’) are important. The basic
						logic of horizontal relations is that the combination of concepts – modeled
						as topical collocations – can be described on the basis of a clear
						differentiation of the concepts. The combinations become visible by
						distinguishing the individual concepts. Furthermore, on the level of the
						text surface, the relations between manifestations of topoi can be described
						more precisely. In this context, I have proposed the concept of the ‘topos
						profile’ of texts.<note>
									However, such profiles could also be examined for groups of
									texts or shorter sections of texts, depending on the research
									interest. In all cases, the focus is on the manifestations of a
									topos or several topoi on the surface of the text, meaning on
									the characteristics of the distribution and
								frequency.</note> Many passages had to be analyzed to
						obtain an overview about the occurrence of topoi in order to systematize the
						collocations. During the (re)construction process, it is not immediately
						obvious whether a particular recurrence pattern is to be classified as a
						collocation (i.e. two topoi) or as one topos. The demarcation between two
						topoi or the subsuming of different manifestation patterns under one topos
						is a question of the granularity of the category and the understanding of
						the concept in relation to other concepts within the system. </p>

               <p>An example illustrating the challenges in differentiating recurrence patterns
						and defining them as one distinctive topos concept is the topos of <hi rend="italic">i</hi>
                  <term>nexpressibility</term> that is
						present in various genres and transhistorically widely spread. However,
						according to [Curtius 2013 [1948], 159] it is debatable whether we are
						dealing with one topos or whether several topoi should be differentiated. He
						states that the “root of the topoi […] is ‘emphasis upon inability to cope
						with the subject.’ From the time of Homer onwards, there are examples in all
						ages. In panegyric, the orator ‘finds no words’ which can fitly praise the
						person celebrated.” In contrast, other studies, especially those dealing
						with travelogue corpora, have reconstructed only one topos, with slight
						nuances in the names (e.g. “indescribability topos” in [Fischer 2004, 288];
						“topos de l’indicible” in [Choné 2015, 251-257]). The topos or the topoi
						(depending on the perspective) revolve around the paradox that they express
						that something is inexpressible. In the travelogue corpus, different
						manifestation patterns (something is ‘indescribable’, ‘untellable’, etc.)
						could be identified leading to the differentiation of two topoi:
						<term>inexpressibility by words </term>(‘Unsagbarkeit’)
						and <term>unrepresentability</term> (‘Undarstellbarkeit’ = not
						representable in any medium). This differentiation is justified by their
						strong recurrence and argumentative differentiation in the corpus. In some
						cases, inexpressibility increases intermedially, in the sense that something
						cannot be expressed in any medium – a frequent manifestation pattern of this
						collocation is ‘neither brush nor pen’.<note> For example, [Dahlmann 1908, vol. 2, 214] writes
									about the Taj Mahal, that it “is so perfect that no description
									can come close to doing justice to this work of art. No building
									in India has been drawn and photographed so many times, it has
									been described countless times; but neither pen nor brush can
									convey even a faint idea of the marvel [...].”</note>
						In other cases,
						<term>inexpressibility by words </term>can
						be overcome because visual media offer a way out of the dilemma of <term>unrepresentability</term>.<note> Cf. [Tellemann 1900, 98-99]: “The detailed
									description of this remarkable building is extremely difficult
									and almost only possible with the aid of
								photography.”</note> Regarding the horizontal layer of the
						text surface and the analysis of topos profiles the texts by [Halla 1914]
						and [Litzmann 1914] are for example very contrasting: While in Halla’s text
						manifestations of the <hi rend="italic">color</hi> topos have a significant
						frequency and dominate the text, in the case of Litzmann it can be observed
						that almost the entire repertoire of topoi of the <hi rend="italic">two
							topologies</hi> is distributed over the text.</p>

               <head>Heuristic relations</head>
               <p>The relation types of the vertical and horizontal axis are focused on one
						central category and concepts all belonging to this same type of category –
						namely ‘topos’. In the heuristic space, these two axes are closely
						interlinked. The heuristic space involves furthermore the diagonal axis,
						thus those relations between categories belonging to different classes. As
						described above, the conceptual clustering revealed various phenomena, which
						in turn led to the formation of new categories and the corresponding
						expansion of the toolkit: (a) Bridge topoi emerged, which belong to two or
						more clusters. By modeling this category, the argumentative
						polyfunctionality of topoi becomes visible. (b) Different cluster types
						appeared, which only become evident in the comparison of the two <term>topologies</term> and through which, in turn, the
						specifics of these can be captured more precisely.<note> The conceptual clustering
									was done with the visualization and analysis software VUE (=
									Visual Understanding Environment is an open source project of
									Tufts University, <ref target="https://vue.tufts.edu/">https://vue.tufts.edu/</ref>), without which the process of
									‘encircling’ and clustering the approximately 150 topoi would
									not have been feasible. The software VUE was used for
									visualizations of the topoi (as well as the clusters and
									collocation patterns).</note> Of course, the dynamics
						in category formation do not need to be so open. For example, one could
						think of a follow-up study that continues with the 150 topos concepts (or a
						part of them, for example individual clusters, etc.) and the methodology
						outlined in a selection of the 10 operationalization steps.<note> In the underlying project
									of studying topoi in India travelogues, the circular process
									between category application and category development was
									terminated when a state was reached in which nothing new became
									visible through a refinement of the categories and, conversely,
									the application of the categories no longer entailed any
									definitional changes. In the context of Grounded Theory, this
									would correspond to ‘theoretical saturation’ [Franken et al.
									2020, 103]. </note>

               <p>Looking at the following concrete textual example, I want to illustrate the
						added value of this approach with respect to the categories of clusters,
						bridge topoi, and collocations. </p>
               <p>“In the realm of the Maharajas and Rajahs, you get to know the truly Indian
						India, quite untouched by English civilization, the dreamland where you
						experience fairy tales at every turn, you only need to wander through the
						cities.” [Litzmann 1914, 61]</p>
               <p>In this highly condensed passage, a relatively large number of topoi appear
						in reduced form. According to the examples above, the collocation of the
						three topoi <term>too much Europe</term>, <term>untouchedness</term>, and <term>authenticity</term> can be
						considered as already familiar. According to Figure 2 showing the clusters
						of the travelogue <term>topology</term> (I write the clusters in
						the following upper-cased for better readability), these topoi all belong to
						the tourism cluster. <term>Untouchedness</term> furthermore bridges to the singularity cluster. The <term>authenticity</term>
						topos (in the original <term>Echtheit</term>) is particularly
						polyfunctional – it belongs to five clusters (besides
						tourism and singularity also language
							reflection, recognition, writing programmatic / self-presentation). These
						topoi are all elements of the travelogue <term>topology</term>.
						At the same time, we can also observe manifestations of topoi of India <hi rend="italic">topology</hi> in the passage cited above: The <term>dream</term> topos and the <term>fairy
							tale</term> topos, both belonging to the irreality cluster which also includes <term>1001
							nights</term>, <term>magic</term>, <term>fantasy</term> and <term>miracles</term> (see Figure 6).
						Topoi of this cluster are often combined with topoi of the princes / wealth cluster. To illustrate the
						quantitative dimension of topoi, one case can be mentioned in which the
						recurrence of a pattern was not frequent enough to be considered as a topos:
						The pattern that the <term>(Maha) Rajas</term> were only “pseudo
						kings” or “puppets” of the British recurs in the corpus.<note> Cf. [Litzmann 1914, 62]:
									“The title Maharajah (king over princes) sounds even proud, and
									yet these rulers are only pseudo-kings, puppets in the hands of
									England.” Cf. [Meyer 1906, 21]: “One counts about 150 such
									Indian princes, of whom the small ones, however, possess only a
									shadow of power. The English government gives them a fairly free
									hand in administration, but supervises them through political
									agents sent to their courts.”</note> Thus, a potential
						collocation pattern between the
						princes / wealth cluster and
						the “puppet pattern” of the colonialism cluster
						seemed to emerge, but this could not be confirmed (due to relatively low
						frequency), since it appeared too rarely in the overall view of the corpus
						in the end.</p>

               <head>Epistemological relations</head>
               <p>While the space of heuristic relations refers to topoi, <term>topologies</term> and associated categories within the topology as
						methodology, the space of epistemological relations is concerned with the
						relations between different category systems. Figure 7 depicts various
						categories of other frameworks to which the category ‘topos’ is related.
						This kind of epistemological demarcation of a category can be thought of
						both synchronically and diachronically. In addition, the epistemological
						type of relations can be split up further: (a) There can be relations
						between two different conceptualizations of the category ‘topos’. Here the
						naming of the category coincides, but the conceptualizations are different.
						An example of such a different modeling approach working with the supposedly
						‘same’ category (identical label, i.e., ‘topos’), is the SAToRBase project.
						As part of the project and network, a database for topoi in French
						literature was set up, but with a significantly different understanding of
						topos than that of the underlying study. Anchored in ‘structural
						narratology’, the SAToRBase project aims to create a thesaurus of narrative
						recurrence patterns conceived as topoi [Sinclair 2003] [Dubost 2021]. In
						contrast, I argue that topoi are argumentative patterns rooted in a
						historically and culturally situated <term>doxa</term> and are
						not just ‘plot elements’.
							<note> Although the SATorBase project is informed by a
									significantly different understanding of ‘topos’, it has
									nevertheless also modeled a kind of methodological equivalent to
									‘manifestation patterns’ called “toposème” [Dubost 2021]. Both
									approaches thus share the idea to model an intermediate category
									between topos and text surface. The <term>toposème</term> are in contrast to the modeling of <term>manifestation patterns</term> in the
									underlying study thought of as the presence or absence of
									particular (types of) recurrences. Cf. [Dubost 2021, original in
									French]: „If the Satorians later find that one of these variants
									(for example, the color of the girl’s hair or the father’s
									widowhood) turns out to be recurrent and topical, a new topos,
									incorporating this variant as a <hi rend="italic">toposème</hi>,
									will be created.” </note> (b) In the second case, the
						names of two supposedly different categories can differ, but the
						conceptualization of the content of the category can be (almost) congruent.
						This can be observed, for example, for the category of the ‘collective
						symbol’, which is strikingly similar to the understanding of ‘topos’
						represented here.<note> [Link
									1988, 285 and 290] discussed the close connection of his newly
									introduced category with topoi. In follow up research, this lack
									of selectivity respectively ‘reuse’ means that the two
									categories ‘collective symbol’ and ‘topos’ are sometimes used
									quasi synonymously without reflecting their relation (see e.g.
									[Dürbeck 2007, 35]).</note> (c) In the third case,
						there are categories with distinct labels and different conceptual content.
						This is the most common case and the one outlined in Figure 7. Relating the
						conceptualizations in the sense of a demarcation of a category vis-à-vis the
						‘categorial neighbors’ has two advantages: on the one hand, it sharpens the
						categories of the different frameworks; on the other hand, it enables
						well-founded combinations of methodologies.</p>

               <p>In studying the history of the concept of topos, it became clear that some
						basic assumptions of ancient rhetoric are not compatible with the attempt of
						operationalization. This, above all, concerns the fact that topoi are
						situated at the level of <term>inventio</term> (the first
						production stage of a speech before <term>dispositio</term>, <term>elocutio</term>, <term>memoria</term>, and <term>actio</term>) and are conceptualized as an element of a
						repertoire or paradigm [Knape 2000]. Within the (re)modeling process, topoi
						were taken out of this narrow assignment. Instead, it was emphasized that
						topoi are not exclusively situated in a paradigm, but (in the logic of
						rhetoric / reformulated in structuralist terms) lie at an intermediate level
						between a deep structure (<term>inventio</term> / paradigm) and
						a surface structure (<term>elocutio</term> / syntagma).<note> Furthermore, the
									relatively specific debates in the reception of Curtius’
									influential and polarizing work, in the course of which the
									discussions about ‘formal topoi’ versus ‘material topoi’
									culminated, actually already run through the history of topos
									research and rhetoric since antiquity. Here, systematic insights
									and the historical perspective are entangled.</note> As
						already indicated, the conceptualization of its categorial neighbors and
						counterparts has an effect on the notion of ‘topos’ itself. This concerns
						among others the intersections to ‘narrative’ and ‘trope’ [Nate 2013], to
						‘conceptual metaphor’ [Lakoff / Johnson, 1980], or to ‘frame’ as category
						within frame semantics [Ziem, 2014]. The closer a related category is
						conceptually, the more precision potential an epistemological
						relationalization has. This concerns, in particular, the tradition of
						discourse-linguistic topos research [Wengeler 2015], which has close
						connections and similarities (analysis of argumentative recurrence patterns
						as topoi) but presupposes a clearly different concept of argument and
						chooses a different solution in dealing with the opposition of ‘formal’ and
						‘material’ topoi.<note>
									Potential for synergies between topos research and discourse
									analysis in the sense of Foucault has already been addressed by
									[Bornscheuer 1987, 24-25, original in German]: “Nevertheless,
									today the transition no longer seems entirely speculative, that
									if topos research continued to consistently pursue historically
									overarching and interdisciplinarily bundled questions, it could
									develop into a completely different kind of ‘archaeology’ than
									Curtius had in mind, namely an ‘archaeology’ that asks for the
									‘fundamental codes of a culture’ more in the sense of Michel
									Foucault.”</note>
               </p>
               <p>The added value of the approach of topology as a methodology and of
						considering its epistemological relations is that a differentiated
						description of methodological contexts is possible. For example, [Buzard
						1993, 4] defines the touristic pattern that travelers want to move ‘just off
						the beaten track’ as a “master trope”.<note> “The master-trope for my investigation is named in
									my title. If there is one dominant and recurrent image in the
									annals of the modern tour, it is surely that of the beaten
									track, which succinctly designates the space of the ‘touristic’
									as a region in which all experience is predictable and
									repetitive, all cultures and objects mere ‘touristy’
									self-parodies.” [Buzard 1993, 4]. The search for authenticity or
									‘realness’ as a kind of coded escape from the code is described
									by [Culler 1988, 165]: “The authenticity the tourist seeks is at
									one level an escape from code, but this escape itself is coded
									in turn, for the authentic must be marked to be constituted as
									authentic.”</note> In the corpus investigated, four
						different topoi of the ‘travelogue <term>topology</term>’ are
						closely associated with this figure of argumentation (<term>too much Europe</term>
                  <hi rend="italic">, </hi>
                  <term>labyrinthine alleys</term>, <term>authenticity</term>, <term>untouchedness</term>).<note> Cf. [Halla 1914, 210]:
									“From the station, a well-kept park with beautiful palm trees
									leads to the dark red town hall, which with its Italian portico
									would fit in well in Naples; the Chandni Chowk also seems
									half-European after the cities of the Punjâb; so up and right
									into the middle of the jumble of narrow alleyways full of
									original character [...].”</note> This (re)construction
						makes it possible to describe the recurrence pattern of the touristic
						discourse ‘just off the beaten track’ much more precisely as a specific form
						of collocation that can manifest in different ways. Particularly frequent or
						popular topoi have been mentioned and discussed in studies about travelogues
							(<term>idyll</term>, <term>paradise</term>, <term>inexpressibility</term>, etc.), but so far, no attempt has
						been made to consistently apply topology as a methodology for investigation
						and to systematically (re)construct a conceptual system of topoi. In the
						perspective proposed here, a non-systematic (re)construction risks being
						subject to a ‘confirmation bias’ and mainly recognizing those patterns of
						recurrence that have already been discussed in previous research.</p>

            <head>Categorial interdependencies in the research process </head>
            <p>In the digital humanities, research processes are influenced by different
					understandings and practices of knowledge production. On the one hand, there is
					the iterative character of the research process in the humanities – the
					omnipresent, but underspecified ‘hermeneutic circle’.<note> Although the vagueness of the
								‘hermeneutic circle’ and the associated practices in the humanities
								have been critically reflected upon [Danneberg 1995], the openness
								with regard to knowledge production and argumentation, i.e. the
								variance in the generation of intersubjective statements and the
								frequently discussed pluralism of methods continue to exist [Booth
								1986] [Horstmann et al. 2023]. The resulting tension implies that
								the underdetermined but omnipresent ‘hermeneutic circle’ in the
								humanities requires formalization and concretization in the digital
								humanities. This has led to several proposals, for example the
								“expanded hermeneutic circle of understanding” as a “formalization
								of the hermeneutic annotation process” in [Gius / Jacke 2017, 242
								and 250] and a proposal to differentiate four different ‘hermeneutic
								circles’ [Hinzmann 2020b].</note> On the other hand, there
					are standards, formalization and a need for the explicit formulation of research
					designs and workflows resulting from the requirements of computational methods.
					The different disciplinary backgrounds with regard to the organization of the
					research process are defined by [Kuhn 2020, 69] as „scheduling dilemma, which
					affects the point in the course of the project when specifications of the core
					analysis task are fixed (as early as possible from the computational
					perspective, but as late as possible from the Humanities perspective)”.
					Secondly, there is the “subjectivity problem, which concerns the degree of
					intersubjective stability of the target categories” [Kuhn 2020, 69]. When
					assuming a “given concept” [Pichler / Reiter 2022, 4], the ‘circularity’ of the humanities tradition tends to be set aside
					in favor of the linearity of the computational workflow as well as quantitative
					approaches. Although manual annotation is theoretically taken into account
					[Pichler / Reiter 2022, 10, Figure 2], the specific nature of the respective
					research designs has not yet been differentiated clearly enough. The focus lies
					on top-down approaches and hypothesis testing, which is explicitly called for by
					[Underwood 2019: 17]: “Instead of measuring things, finding patterns, and then
					finally asking what they mean, we need to start with an interpretive hypothesis
					(a ‘meaning’ to investigate) and invent a way to test it.” An overly emphatic
					preference for ‘top-down’ approaches could lead to an increasing distance from
					the humanities.</p>
            <p>In contrast, computational methods in their adaptations for the digital
					humanities might benefit from a more explicit reflection on the ‘circularity’
					inherent in the iterative research process. In the qualitative social sciences,
					Grounded Theory Methodology (GTM) has led to such an explicit theoretical
					reflection. The potential of integrating methods derived from qualitative social
					research and especially GTM to reflect on workflows and “humans in the loop”
					[Liu 2020] in the digital humanities has so far been rarely addressed [Baker
					2020] [Bischof / Freybe 2022] [Franken 2022]. What an integration or
					interweaving of DH practices with Grounded Theory Methodology (GTM) could entail
					has recently been explored in more detail by [Bischof / Freybe 2022]. They see
					GTM as a “reflective procedural framework to carefully inspect the entanglement
					between research practice, methods, and data” which “acknowledges that building
					models from data is a long, iterative journey” [Bischof / Freybe 2022, 2]. In
					order to better understand the opportunities and challenges of building bridges
					in and for the digital humanities, it is essential to recognize the different
					traditions, practices and objectives – not only between computational methods
					and humanities knowledge, but potentially also in the direction of social
					sciences and cultural studies. For example, in cultural studies approaches,
					research fields are only explored and identified step by step during the
					research process and, accordingly, the data to be analyzed are not fixed from
					the outset. They will be adapted to the specified research question [Franken
					2022, 1]. Figure 8 is related to the understanding of the “abductive research
					attitude” as a way of “going through loops of inductive and deductive
					inference.” [Bischof / Freybe 2022, 22] The abductive research process implies
					that there are neither pure ‘bottom-up’ approaches nor pure ‘top-down’
					approaches but that „it is clear that many assumptions are already embedded in a
					DH project before it has even begun“ [Bischof / Freybe 2022, 22]. Making these
					assumptions and implicit hypotheses as well as the associated decisions
					transparent is an important conceptual extension of the reflections on
					interdependencies between categories. This plea can be linked to the statement
					by [Pichler / Reiter 2022, 16] that it is important to work on a shared
					“vocabulary on how such operationalization decisions can be made more
					transparent and thus intersubjectively (more) revisable”. </p>

            <p>The approximation of “recursive modeling” is described by [McCarty 2008, 398] as
					process in which “the working model begins to converge on the theoretical
					model”. The description of this convergence remains rather open but can be
					intertwined with the proposed differentiation between category and concept
					systems. Table 2 shows the integration of the two differentiations. The sequence
					of ‘heuristic spaces’ is conceivable as iterations within one project, but also
					as part of projects that build on one another. The resulting four different
					types of categories and concepts can be arranged spatially and be combined with
					a proposal to distinguish four different focus points of a project or various
					sub-phases: category development, category application, concept
					operationalization and concept (re)construction (see Figure 9). Reflecting
					possible assumptions in their relation to the three levels – the textual
					surface, the ‘working model’ as well as the ‘theoretical model’ – allows for
					distinguishing assumptions about the category from assumptions about the realm
					of phenomena as well as from hypotheses about the object of investigation.</p>

            <head>Future work</head>
            <p>The following section will outline some future work that is conceivable based on
					the proposed framework. The obvious limitation so far is that the framework is
					related to one central category with a focus on one research process. It may
					seem tautological that the framework is developed referring to topos research,
					which is also used as an illustrative example context. Indeed, it remains an
					open question to what extent the framework will also be useful in reflecting on
					the interdependencies between the application and development of other
					categories. However, the design of the framework was accompanied by an
					examination of overarching methodological debates and some initial approaches
					towards case studies. In the process, transfer possibilities within the digital
					humanities and especially computational literary studies were identified and
					integrated. Nevertheless, this work is in its early stages.</p>
            <p>In general, an explicit reflection on assumptions in different phases of the
					research process could be particularly useful with regard to the application and
					development of annotation categories. These range between different forms of
					automatic, semi-automatic and manual annotation. Annotation processes stand
					between the different traditions, in a variety of different forms between human
					and machine [Rapp 2017] [Gius / Jacke 2017]. It would be helpful to reflect
					(annotation) categories more clearly as an “instrument of structuring” [Franken
					et al. 2020, 89]. The framework could also prove useful in the context of
					reflecting on different layers of annotation, which are often intertwined in a
					research process in the digital humanities. Furthermore, it could be examined to
					what extent the framework can be combined with other reflection instruments,
					such as the distinction between explorative, conceptualizing, explanatory and
					automation-oriented annotation [Pagel et al. 2020].</p>
            <p>The differentiation between the level of ‘category’ and ‘concept’ can be
					considered as relevant in other contexts, for example, related to
					“narratological event <emph>concepts</emph>” and “event <emph>categories</emph>” [Vauth et al. 2021, 333]. ‘Events’
					could also be an interesting case study because various conceptualizations exist
					as different aspects are emphasized in different disciplines and contexts
					depending on the objectives – for example, a narratological context with
					reference to literary texts raises other questions than event detection and
					classification in historical texts [Sprugnoli / Tonelli 2019]. The same can
					apply to the possible differentiation between ‘category’ and ‘concept’ of
					“genre”. It can sometimes stand alongside other categories, for example when
					“style can be associated with categories such as genre, epoch, author, and many
					more” [Herrmann et al. 2015, 46]. However, it can also be central and divided
					into several sub-categories and sub-concepts. Besides (theoretical) ‘target
					concepts’ that form the starting point of operationalizations, there is also a
					type of ‘concepts’ that emerge only in the course of the analysis process (and
					can become ‘categories’). In the study of [Calvo Tello 2021, 295–319], two ‘new’
					genres (distinct groups of texts behaving like genres) emerged, which he named
					‘literary fiction’ and ‘bucolic novel’. Even though all of the other sub-genres
					‘existed’ prior to this, these two new forms of genre-like textual coherence
					became visible during the research process. Whether such an insight resulting
					from the investigation is a ‘concept’ or a ‘category’ is a question of
					perspective: the term ‘concept’ would imply a stronger link to the field of
					investigation from which the concept emerged. However, the ‘bucolic novel’ could
					also become part of an analytical grid as a ‘genre’ category, with which further
					corpora would be examined. While in this case, new categories emerged and the
					category system was refined, there are in contrast projects that start from
					already existing systems of categories like tagsets. For example, [Chihaia 2021]
					applied the protocol for event annotation in literary texts developed by [Vauth
					et al. 2021] to a new corpus of newspaper articles.</p>
            <p>With reference to the proposed framework, a clearer distinction of several
					conceptualizations and aspects of ‘theory’ is possible (see Table 3). Similar
					attempts can be found in [Pichler / Reiter 2022, 16] and [Kleymann 2023]. A
					theory can be a) related to the category system and thus referring to
					methodological questions, e.g. explicating a framework. It can b) also be
					connected with reflections about the ‘realm of phenomena’. Concerning a) there
					will usually be a theoretical framework integrating different aspects of a
					theoretical context given by the humanities (e.g. narratology) and a theoretical
					reflection that is related to the computational models that are implemented. It
					seems useful to be aware of these different types or dimensions on which
					‘theory’ operates, especially as there is a variety of frames of reference and
					understanding of theory in the digital
					humanities. The
					theoretical reflection that the framework of the four relations strives for can
					increase transparency and intersubjective comprehensibility and thus potentially
					also reproducibility or repeatability (eg. [Pichler / Reiter 2022, 17]; [Schöch
					2023]).</p>

						humanities, especially computational literary studies. </head>
               <graphic url=""/>
            </figure>
            <p>In addition to the more general considerations, the article also aimed to address
					(digital) topos research as relevant field for the semantic-argumentative
					exploration and analysis of corpora. An interesting case of epistemological
					relations that arises between ‘topos’, ‘theme’ and ‘topic’ as a category in
					‘topic modeling’. Within computational literary studies, the motif-historical
					tradition following [Curtius 2013 (1948)] is emphasized when referring to the
					‘topos’ concept [Piper 2018] [Horstmann 2018]. However, the interpretation of
					‘topics’ in ‘topic modeling’ is a complex case (e.g. [Schöch 2017], [Du /
					Schröter 2022], [Bischof / Freybe 2022]) and should not be confused with ‘topoi’
					as patterns of thematic-semantic as well argumentative coherence. In this
					context, topos research (with regard to argumentative, not only semantic
					coherence), the highly interdisciplinary field of thematology (or thematics, see
					e.g. [Hjørland 2001]; [Louwerse / Peer 2002]) and applications of ‘topic
					modeling’ should be discussed more precisely in their epistemological relations
					in order to work out potential synergies and possible methodological
					integrations. </p>
            <p>Assuming that all language use is permeated by topoi implies that all use of
					language in research can also be investigated with regard to topoi. An awareness
					of the rhetoricity of academic language also raises awareness of
					pseudo-objectivities or sensitizes us to the implications, influences or
					constructiveness of a chosen metaphor. An interesting example is the result of
					the study by [Wilder / Wolf 2009, 175], who examine the topoi of literary
					analysis in a didactic context and list “some special topoi of professional
					literary analysis”, including „Appearance/reality: The writer points out a
					perception of two entities; one more immediate, the other latent; one on the
					surface, the other deep.” It is not problematic per se, but there are striking
					parallels to the concept of ‘vertical relations’ in this article as well as to
					the concept of operationalization. The concept of ‘research topos’ may be a
					useful tool for reflection on scientific use of language.<note> The concept addresses the use
								of topoi in research contexts that are topically structured like
								other discursive contexts and that can be examined with regard to
								the use of topoi. Research topoi do not operate in a fundamentally
								different way from other topoi. Considering them can raise critical
								awareness on argumentative patterns of scientific language use
								[Hinzmann 2020a, 503].</note>

            <head>Conclusion </head>
            <p>The proposed framework of categorial relations is conceived as a methodological
					(meta)model of and for working with categories and concepts and describing them
					in their interdependencies. Reflecting on these interdependencies is
					particularly important in the digital humanities because they are situated
					between different disciplinary traditions, each of which has a different focus
					and understanding of the role and functions of categories. The proposals
					associated with the framework for differentiating between ‘category’ and
					‘concept’, between different theoretical views and between assumptions on three
					different levels aim to strengthen the dialog between the different research
					contexts. Explicit reflection on the role of categories and concepts could be
					important especially in computational literary studies and in the context of
					annotation practices but is not limited to this. The framework aims to mediate
					between different understandings of knowledge production and research processes.
					Its design is as simple as possible and capable of being connected and expanded,
					as was outlined in the reflection on the iterative research process and
					conceivable future work. If the article also contributes to illustrating the
					potential of (digital) topos research, a further goal would be achieved. Topoi
					as a category are multifaceted and could contribute to building inter- and
					transdisciplinary bridges between the currently rather disconnected fields of
					argumentation analysis and argument mining, topic modeling, discourse analysis
					and thematology. Combining the exploration of corpora regarding their
					thematic-semantic <emph>and</emph> argumentative forms of
					coherence, as well as entanglements between the two as they crystallize in
					topoi, would be a field of research in which the framework could prove useful
					and in which topology as methodology could be further developed.</p>
