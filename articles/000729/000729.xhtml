                  <p>The following is a case study of manual annotation as used in a large-scale variationist
                     linguist project focusing of spoken varieties of German in Austria. It showcases the
                     technical architecture used for annotation, which unifies different granularities
                     of tokenization through the corpus in a distinct entity designed for annotation. It
                     furthermore lays out the hierarchical stand-off annotation used in the project Deutsch
                     in Österreich (“German in Austria”) and demonstrates how a semantic model for the hierarchical organization of annotations
                     can bring transparency to the annotation process while also providing a sounder epistemological
                     basis than monodimensional annotation.</p>

                     research practices there is (cf. [<a class="ref" href="#lordick_etal2016">Lordick et al. 2016</a>, 187]), and yet, especially in linguistics, specific annotations and their annotation guidelines
                     are seldomly published or discussed, and are often unavailable (cf. [<a class="ref" href="#ide2017">Ide 2017</a>, 2]). Moreover, with some exceptions (e.g. [<a class="ref" href="#ide_etal2017">Ide and Pustejovsky 2017</a>], [<a class="ref" href="#consten_etal2012">Consten and Loll 2012</a>]), the process of annotation in linguistics itself is rarely subject to critical reflection,
                     despite being fundamental for many branches of empirical linguistics. The purpose
                     of this case-study is to add to this reflection process of annotation in linguistics,
                     especially from a variationist linguist perspective. Furthermore, this case-study
                     showcases examples of a hierarchical annotation system with a meaningful structure,
                     developed by and used in the FWF-funded<a class="noteRef" href="#d4e190">[1]</a> Special Research Program “Deutsch in Österreich” (FWF F060 “German in Austria,” henceforth DiÖ). Additionally, it aims to contribute to the discussion of the epistemological
                     status of annotation (in the sense of classification of data, see <a href="#section04">Section 4</a> below). We also propose that the annotation structure used by DiÖ can be generalized
                     for a variety of research interests.</div>

                        goals as well as the data used in the project, both from a formal and a semantic point
                        of view is necessary. Additionally, we give a short contextualization of the variationist
                        linguistic research context. Within DiÖ, inter- and intraindividual variation of different
                        varieties of German are a focus of research. The basic assumption underlying this
                        field is that there is not a single, coherent German variety, but rather different
                        varieties of the language, with different speakers having access to different subsets
                        of German (they have, so to say, access to a repertoire of different ways of speaking
                        – see e.g. [<a class="ref" href="#koppensteiner_etal2021">Koppensteiner and Lenz 2021</a>]). These different varieties are made up and signified by certain variants of a linguistic
                        variable (e.g. different pronunciations of one and the same word, or different terms
                        for the same concept). While some speakers are assumed to have their language use
                        structured as one variety with different poles, other speakers are assumed to have
                        two (or more) distinct and separated varieties. Usually, these poles of one (or two
                        distinct) variety/ies are associated with specific extra-linguistic factors, such
                        as the communicative situation. In a specific communicative situation, certain variants
                        indicate either the usage of e.g. high-prestige varieties (usually corresponding to
                        standard language) or a more localized variety (usually dialectal). The research goal
                        – which can be roughly summarized as the question of “Who speaks with whom in what way in which situation?” – is therefore the organization of these varieties within the speakers, how they
                        relate to the language system itself and to extralinguistic factors, such as the age
                        of the speaker, their dialect region, or the appropriateness for specific situations,
                        and how these varieties are changing.</div>

                     <div class="ptext" id="p6">To reflect these complex, interlinking factors, we collected language data in a variety
                        of ways: we used fairly traditional, sociolinguistic research methods, such as structured
                        interviews or conversations among peers in absence of a researcher. Additionally,
                        more recent methods from the field of digital humanities were used as well, such as
                        computer-assisted language production experiments. These language production experiments
                        were used to evoke variants usually occurring too rarely in conversations to make
                        reliable claims about their distribution, e.g. relative clauses or complementizer
                        agreements (for more on language production experiments for corpus building, see e.g.
                        [<a class="ref" href="#bulow_etal2019">Bülow and Breuer 2019</a>], [<a class="ref" href="#fingerhuth_etal2022">Fingerhuth and Breuer 2022</a>] or [<a class="ref" href="#lenz_etal2019">Lenz et al. 2019</a>]).  We conducted these language production experiments, whereby a stimulus is shown
                        to the participant and their verbal response is recorded, using OpenSesame, a program
                        to build and conduct experiments for social sciences (see [<a class="ref" href="#mathot_etal2012">Mathôt et al. 2012</a>]). Additional reading- and translation tasks completed the corpus material. Overall,
                        just for a subcorpus of the research project, more than 500 hours of spoken language
                        were recorded.</div>

                        which encompasses all different project parts and their respective research data.
                        The research platform is based on a PostgreSQL database with several custom-made frontend
                        interfaces for data entry, based on previous work by [<a class="ref" href="#breuer2021">Breuer 2021</a>]. The audio was segmented and transcribed (partially using software developed by DiÖ,
                        see [<a class="ref" href="#breuer_etal2022">Breuer et al. 2022</a>]). We tokenized the transcribed data in two separate ways: for the more open settings,
                        such as the structured interview and the conversation among peers, the data was tokenized
                        on the word level. The more structured settings, such as the translation tasks, language
                        production experiments and reading lists were tokenized on the level of (half-) sentences.
                        These (half-)sentences correspond to responses of our informants (for more on language
                        production experiments see <a href="#section03.2">Section 3.2</a>). In order to be able to produce coherent, but also flexible tagging, a further entity
                        (named “answers”) was created, which unifies the different levels of tokenization. One, or several
                        word-tokens can be subsumed as an answer, which is the actual entity in the database
                        that is being tagged. This allows for the coherent tagging and easier data extraction
                        of tagged material, as the source of everything being tagged (whether it is a half-sentence
                        stemming from a controlled setting or individual word tokens coming from a transcript
                        from an open setting) is a centralized entity. <a href="#figure01">Figure 1</a> provides a schematized and simplified model of the data structure.</div>

                        “descriptive or analytic notations with language data”  [<a class="ref" href="#ide2017">Ide 2017</a>, 2], usually falls into one of two general categories: there is, on the one hand, (semi-)automatic
                        annotation, and manual annotation on the other. The (semi-)automatic approach is considered
                        first. This kind of annotation is usually done with large corpora and is carried out
                        using natural language processing tools, such as the python library spaCy ([<a class="ref" href="#honnibal_etal2020">Honnibal et al. 2020</a>]) or the NLTK (“Natural Language Tool Kit”, [<a class="ref" href="#bird_etal2009">Bird et al. 2009</a>]). These kind of annotations are usually – but not always – fairly one-dimensional.
                        A prime example of these kinds of annotation processes is POS (“part of speech”) tagging, which usually associates a token with a label clarifying their part of
                        speech function within a sentence. <a href="#table01">Table 1</a> showcases an example from the DiÖ-corpus for an utterance tagged for part of speech
                        according to two different models – spaCy’s universal tagset and the Stuttgart-Tübing-Tagset,
                        a tagset modelled for German ([<a class="ref" href="#schiller_etal1999">Schiller et al. 1999</a>]):

                        Different levels of granularity are observable: The tags designed for the German language
                        provide a more granular approach to the classification. We can additionally observe
                        a misassignment of a tag: the “ist” is wrongfully labelled as auxiliary or respectively finite auxiliary, when it is

                        and in DiÖ as well: it allows researchers to tag vast material of data at a very low
                        cost and with great accuracy. This makes the data easier to search and analyze. There
                        are, on the other hand, definite caveats to automatic annotation: the processes and
                        parameters of assigning specific labels to individual tokens is usually not entirely
                        transparent to the researchers. This results in two distinct problems: on the one
                        hand, the relationship between the labels and the linguistic theory used to justify
                        them is obscured, which can be problematic when researchers explicitly work within
                        a specific theoretical framework (cf. [<a class="ref" href="#newman_etal2020">Newman and Cox 2020</a>, 43]). Even more so, the “theoretical assumptions, complex social factors, and linguistic intuitions,” which are important factors in building an annotation scheme, are irrecoverably lost
                        in automatic annotation and not “identified and clearly reflected,” as [<a class="ref" href="#demarneffe_etal2017">de Marneffe and Potts 2017</a>, 412] argue (see also <a href="#section04">Section 4</a>). While e.g. part of speech tags are highly canonized and widely used, they are still
                        not theory-neutral and carry specific assumptions about language. The comparatively
                        low cost of automatic annotation and the omission of a human annotator results in
                        an annotation process and result that appears highly objective. When such “assumptions underlying a classification scheme” become “effectively invisible and thus no longer subject to challenge or rethinking,” this invisibility becomes “dangerous and should be avoided,” as e.g. Sperberg-McQueen argues [<a class="ref" href="#sperbergmcqueen2016">Sperberg-McQueen 2016</a>, 378].</div>

                        corrections of the automatic annotations are often part of the workflow. There are

                        work done was tagged manually. The different status of the tags is even indicated
                        in the data model itself: whereas the automatic annotations are saved as attributes
                        to the individual tokens, the manual tags are distinct entities in the database, and
                        are given to answers (which consist of either tokens on the word level or on the level
                        of half-sentences, see <a href="#section02.2">Section 2.2</a>), meaning that they are recorded in their own table. We lemmatized and part of speech
                        tagged the corpus to ensure better searchability, but it is not a basis to answer

As e.g. [<a class="ref" href="#smith_etal2008">Smith et al. 2008</a>, 164] note, these automatic annotations are very often “inadequate” for many research questions because of their simplicity. This means that researchers
                        generally need to classify their data further. Even though it is very often not labelled
                        as such, such a classification of data according to the needs of a linguist is nothing
                        else than the further annotation of linguistic data. [<a class="ref" href="#kendall2008">Kendall 2008</a>, 336] for example showcases this problem perfectly, explaining how there is no unified
                        method of achieving further classification of linguistic data (i.e. annotation), while
                        also not referring to this process as annotation (instead using the terms “variable tabulating” and “coding”):</div>

                        question working with corpora requires researchers to further (manually) annotate
                        their data in some way (cf. [<a class="ref" href="#smith_etal2008">Smith et al. 2008</a>, 165]), research in annotation tends to focus on automated annotation (cf. [<a class="ref" href="#newman_etal2020">Newman and Cox 2020</a>, 26]). Coverage of manual annotation has been described as “rather patchy,” with [<a class="ref" href="#smith_etal2008">Smith et al. 2008</a>, 167] noting how underrepresented the process of manual annotation is in introductory textbooks.
                        The field of corpus linguistics appears to therefore stand before the problem that
                        one of its fundamental methods – manual annotation of language data – is chronically

                        to the automatic annotations discussed in <a href="#section03.1">Section 3.1</a>, the manual annotation process functions quite differently, both on the level of
                        the data model of the cooperative online research database and on the level of tag
                        design for individual annotations. Picking up the discussion in <a href="#section02.2">Section 2.2</a>, the data model is explained in more depth before turning to the general semantics
                        of the tags used, which is then further illustrated using examples of individual tags
                        and the tagging process from research from DiÖ.</div>

                     <div class="ptext" id="p20"><a href="#figure01">Figure 1</a> above lays out a (simplified) database diagram of how the manual annotations are
                        handled within DiÖ. As mentioned in <a href="#section02.2">Section 2.2</a>, annotations are not directly given to either individual word-tokens or half sentences,
                        but rather to a different entity in the data model, which are termed “answers”. These answers may consist of a response from a language production experiment<a class="noteRef" href="#d4e636">[2]</a>, or one or more word tokens from a transcript of a free speech setting. Thereby,
                        we assign the annotations to answers that contain the relevant tokens or responses.
                        This has the benefit that these answers act as entities that unify the heterogenous
                        data sources (word tokens from transcripts, responses from language production experiments).
                        It furthermore allows for annotating several word tokens as one answer, which is immensely
                        helpful for the annotation of linguistic phenomena beyond the individual word level,
                        such as syntactic structures like the passive. Additionally, it leaves the primary
                        language data intact.</div>
                     
                     <div class="counter"><a href="#p21">21</a></div>
                     <div class="ptext" id="p21">Another important entity within the database scheme is that of the tags themselves:
                        these are, in contrast to the part of speech tags (see <a href="#section03.1">Section 3.1</a>), not saved as a varchar-attribute to the individual word tokens<a class="noteRef" href="#d4e655">[3]</a> but rather as distinct data sets within the database. This annotation method can
                        therefore be considered as a form of stand-off annotation (i.e., an annotation not
                        saved directly in the text itself, such as e.g. TEI-coding, where the annotations
                        are set directly in the text). The tagging process itself is thus conceived as assigning
                        an m:n relation between the tags and the answers. There are again benefits to this:
                        it allows for proper documentation of the meaning of individual tags as attributes
                        of an entity within the database, it means that constraints for the combination of
                        tags to ensure well-formed annotations can easily be set, and it furthermore eliminates
                        the issue of mis- or heterogenous spellings of one tag. Moreover, this allows to easily
                        change tags – if researchers become unsatisfied with the definition or name of a tag,
                        only the entry in the table specifying the tags needs to be changed instead of manipulating
                        every instance of the tag, as would be the case with inline annotation.</div>

                     <div class="ptext" id="p22">Consider, for example, a researcher being interested in a specific morphological phenomenon
                        (e.g. variation in comparative and superlative forms of adjectives, such as &lt;dünkler&gt;/&lt;dunklicher&gt;
                        “darker” as comparative of &lt;dunkel&gt; “dark”<a class="noteRef" href="#d4e663">[4]</a>). They will comb through the corpus and search for adjectives (utilizing the POS-tags
                        for the transcripts tokenized on word level). Whenever they find a token that is an
                        adjective in the comparative, they will create an answer consisting of that token
                        and tag it. They can then go through the responses of the language production experiments
                        concerned with comparative forms of adjectives, and create an answer consisting of
                        the relevant response and tag it as well. “Tagging,” in this case, means that an answer is recorded in the database, which consists of
                        one or several token or a response from a language production experiment. That answer
                        is then linked with the relevant tags, which are datasets in their own right. The
                        table labelled “Tags_to_Answers” in <a href="#figure01">Figure 1</a> represents this. In order to adapt a tag, it is not necessary to change it in every
                        tagged answer – instead, only the dataset that represents the tag needs to be changed
                        because the answers refer to that dataset instead of having the tag itself recorded
                        in it.</div>

                     <div class="ptext" id="p23">In <a href="#figure01">Figure 1</a>, we can additionally observe that tags are associated with one or more annotation
                        tiers. Whenever an answer is being tagged, it first needs to be specified on which
                        annotation tier the researcher wants to tag. This limits the number of available tags
                        to the researcher to the relevant one for the phenomenon being tagged, and avoids
                        ambiguities and redundant tags, as tags can be assigned to a tier specifying their
                        use-case (e.g. a tag for number can be used to both specify singular / plural for
                        phenomena concerning nouns or verbs, depending on which tier it is used). The main
                        entities characterizing the annotation within DiÖ are therefore the answers (i.e.,
                        a homogenized version of the language material being tagged), the individual tags
                        (i.e. the linguistic labels carrying a specific, analytic meaning) and their relationship
                        to each other (i.e. the annotation of language data with tags).</div>

                        DiÖ employs a hierarchical tagging system for manual annotations (in contrast to the
                        flat/one-dimensional model used for automatic annotations, where any notion of hierarchy
                        is, at best, implicit). The individual tags are organized as tag families in a parent-child
                        relationship on different generations, wherein certain tags (the “children”) may only follow certain other tags (their “parent”). This organization follows a specific semantic model, as illustrated by <a href="#figure02">Figure 2</a>:

                     <div class="ptext" id="p25">As can be seen, the basic parent tag on generation 0 on any annotation tier will be
                        a tag characterizing the linguistic phenomena being annotated – mostly, this will
                        be a single tag per tier (relative clauses, where the variation is studied on two
                        levels – that of the noun (phrase) in the matrix clause and the referent in the relative
                        clause – for example have two tags on the generation 0, one for each element). Like
                        the stem of a tree, this tag creates the basis from which the other tags stem. Tags
                        on the first generation generally denote categories that characterize the phenomenon
                        being studied. These category tags compliment each other, and usually, every category
                        tag is applicable to a specific instance of the phenomenon being annotated (e.g. the
                        tags on the first generation for the phenomenon “variation of /au/,” which are “realization of /au/,” “sound preceding,” “sound following,” and “etymological root,” must always apply to any instance of the phenomenon, as any word containing /au/
                        has a specific realization of the sound, a sound preceding and following it<a class="noteRef" href="#d4e722">[5]</a>, and an etymological root). Whereas the tags on the first generation denote categories
                        of the linguistic phenomenon and complement each other, tags on the second generation
                        denote features of the categories, and usually exclude each other. To stick with the
                        example of the “variation of /au/,” the second generation tags following e.g. the tag “etymological root” may be a tag for Middle High German /ou/ or Middle High German /û/, but it cannot
                        be both – these tags describing the Middle High German vowel of the word exclude each
                        other. The same goes for “sound following” or “sound preceding” – here, only one of the possible children of that tagset apply for every specific
                        instance of the phenomenon. As such, these tags usually exclude each other. The third
                        generation in a tagset usually specifies features further, and offers what could be
                        considered features of features, categorizing the phenomenon with a higher granularity.
                        An example would be a further specification of the grammatical voice of a verb – while
                        usually, the features (second generation tags) of a category “grammatical voice” (generation one tag) would be “active” or “passive,” the kind of passive used can be further specified: a dative passive, a processual
                        passive or a statal passive. These would be features specifying other features further,
                        which puts them on the third generation.</div>

                     <div class="ptext" id="p26">While technically, this hierarchical system can expand, offering as many successive
                        generations as needed, most of the tagsets for a specific phenomenon do not exceed
                        the first three generations and follow the semantics of the generational structure
                        closely. In order to devise a tagset for a specific linguistic phenomenon, the researchers
                        interested in that phenomenon set up a draft for a specific annotation system following
                        the logic laid out above. This draft is then brought forward to the researchers which
                        manage all annotations within the cooperative online research platform. The draft
                        tagset is then checked for consistency and applicability as well as redundancy with
                        existing annotations, and is then brought back to the researchers for review of the
                        changes made. Once the researchers agree on a first draft, we implement the tags and
                        their hierarchies into the database. Usually, after some preliminary annotations being
                        made, the tagset will be expanded or changed to encompass finer distinctions or additional
                        categories wherever needed. This follows the idea of an iterative, cyclical model
                        of the creation of tagsets and annotation schemes (cf. e.g. [<a class="ref" href="#zinsmeister2015">Zinsmeister 2015</a>, 87]).</div>

                        on responses to language production experiments, the interface (see <a href="#figure03">Figure 3</a>) allows for transcription and organization of the utterances to responses, which
                        are then saved as answer, and can then be annotated in the same interface. The researchers
                        select the annotation tier from a drop-down menu and adds the relevant tags. The tags
                        and their children are displayed as nested, reflecting the parent-child-structure
                        in order to make the user interface clearer (see e.g. [<a class="ref" href="#johnson2014">Johnson 2014</a>, 29–36] for the role of visual structure in user interface design). Additionally, color feedback
                        indicates the hierarchy, with darker blue tones for deeper layers. For convenience,
                        pre-set tag groups can be saved and applied to answers, which allows for faster tagging.
                        During the saving process, the annotations are checked if they adhere to well-formedness

                        the language production experiments to evoke specific linguistic constructions, the
                        respective phenomena may occur anywhere in the open settings (e.g. a set of language
                        production experiments was explicitly designed to evoke responses of adjectives in
                        the comparative and superlative forms, but these forms may appear anywhere in the
                        open settings). In order to make manual annotation efficient, very often student assistants
                        were tasked with finding instances of the linguistic phenomenon within the transcripts
                        of the open settings and tag them only with the generation 0 tag of that tier. An
                        additional interface (see <a href="#figure06">Figure 6</a>) then allows to retrieve all instances of a tag (e.g. a generation 0 tag) on a specific
                        tier, and further annotate the answers. As a result, the annotation process frequently
                        involved only giving bare annotations to make hard-to-find phenomena easily searchable
                        (mostly the tag on generation 0), and then tag them with additional annotations via
                        this interface. Since this interface allows for the search of any tag on any tier,
                        it is also regularly used to verify tagged instances (e.g. make sure that the tag
                        only covers relevant instances, and is neither too broad nor too narrow).</div>

                        technical advantages of setting up annotations this way is in order (advantages of
                        the semantics of the tagging system are discussed in <a href="#section04">Section 4</a>). There are a variety of benefits to using a relational database structure for annotations:
                        the stand-off nature of the annotations ensures that the metalinguistic data, such
                        as annotations, is clearly separated from the language data, making it easily recoverable.
                        Additionally, it becomes easy to change the description, definition or names of individual
                        tags without combing through the annotated material. The primary data itself can easily
                        be modified as well (e.g. in the case of spelling mistakes, or incomplete transcripts)
                        without any additional workload of making sure that the annotations still refer to
                        the correct answers. Furthermore, the annotations become part of the database that
                        also hosts the corpus, in line with suggestions made by e.g. [<a class="ref" href="#smith_etal2008">Smith et al. 2008</a>, 175]. By including the annotations within the database structure, they are easily recoverable
                        and accessible to other researchers once the corpus is published (which DiÖ plans

                        following a generation 0 tag detailing the linguistic phenomenon (which coincides
                        with the annotation tier used), the phenomenon is annotated for three different categories,
                        which are necessary to describe the variation encountered in the phenomenon. These
                        are, on the one hand, the concrete realization of the &lt;-ig&gt; graphemes, and the phonetic
                        context (i.e. the sound following and preceding &lt;-ig&gt;) on the other. These are the
                        linguistic categories that need to be annotated (other variables, such as speaker
                        age, origin, or setting, are not tagged explicitly, but are added when results are
                        exported based on the records in the database), and they complement each other in
                        the description of the phenomenon. In contrast, the features of these categories –
                        recorded on the generation 2 tags – exclude each other, and are specific for each
                        occurrence of unstressed &lt;-ig&gt;. Both of these categories and their relevant features
                        refer to the same linguistic system – that of the pronunciation of the specific instance
                        of the phenomenon.</div>

                        (a famous example would be the “isn’t it?” phrase, often associated with varieties of British English). German (in Austria)
                        offers a variety of such tag questions, which can be heterogenous in both grammatical

                        are the grammatical form (QTForm), the intonation (Int), its position in the sentence
                        (PosSatz) and in the utterance (PosTurn), as well as the intended kind of response
                        (RespType) and its possible function (QTFunk). In contrast to the example taken from
                        phonetics, not all of these categories refer to the same linguistic system – we can
                        observe a grammatical category (QTForm), a category on the phonetic level (Int), a
                        syntactical category (PosSatz) and a discourse category (PosTurn) as well as two pragmatic
                        categories (RespType and QTFunk). The categories also differ in how much interpretation
                        they demand of the annotators: whereas syntactical and grammatical categorization
                        with the relevant features requires a negligible amount of interpretation, other features,
                        such as the intended type of response or the possible function require a significant
                        effort of interpretation from the annotator. We can expect lower inter-annotator agreement

                        in linguistics, and they characterize a more formal level. The category of function,
                        on the other hand, which includes features like “demanding confirmation” or “declaring insecurity,” is much more open-ended, and the features of this category only showcase one possibility
                        of dividing up pragmatic functions of question tags, and – as indicated by a categorization
                        of “miscellaneous” – this might not yet be the best possible way of doing it. The next iteration of

                        to be reviewed.</div>

                     examples of the semantic logic behind the hierarchical structure, this section aims
                     to briefly problematize annotation as a (linguistic) research method based on the
                     approach to annotation within the DiÖ project. Furthermore, we want to showcase the
                     benefits of working with the multi-dimensional method of annotation, and how it can
                     be generalized for other fields of study.</div>

                  <div class="ptext" id="p42">First and foremost, two aspects, which have so far only been implicitly assumed, need
                     to be laid out. First, it is imperative to conceive of the process of annotation as
                     something that is necessarily interpretative, and not purely objective. Annotation
                     is always, “at least in some degree, the product of the human mind’s understanding of the text,” as [<a class="ref" href="#leech1997">Leech 1997</a>, 2] has stated. Secondly, annotation is essentially a question of the classification
                     of data. This necessarily has the implication that, insofar as the classification
                     of whatever phenomena can be considered production of knowledge, annotation is research
                     (see also e.g. [<a class="ref" href="#breuer_etal2018">Breuer and Seltmann 2018</a>, 146]) – and a kind of research that is very often undertheorized (cf. [<a class="ref" href="#lordick_etal2016">Lordick et al. 2016</a>, 188]). These two factors feed into each other: annotation, as categorization, cannot be
                     purely objective, as whatever classification scheme that is used is necessarily imperfect
                     and incomplete (cf. [<a class="ref" href="#sperbergmcqueen2016">Sperberg-McQueen 2016</a>, 389]), meaning that researchers must select foci which they deem worth categorizing as
                     well as possible. As [<a class="ref" href="#sperbergmcqueen2016">Sperberg-McQueen 2016</a>, 378] demonstrates, “perfect classification would require, and a perfect classification scheme would exhibit,
                     perfect knowledge of the object,” meaning that if there theoretically was a phenomenon which researchers would be able
                     to categorize fully and perfectly, this phenomenon would no longer be worth researching,
                     as there would be nothing left to learn about it.</div>
                  
                  <div class="counter"><a href="#p43">43</a></div>
                  <div class="ptext" id="p43">Annotation is therefore very often a necessary part of the production of knowledge
                     in the humanities without standing on stable theoretical footing. Ideally, researchers
                     are aware of these pitfalls, and adapt their method of data classification (i.e. annotation)
                     accordingly. Very often, however, we can observe that annotations end up in a circular
                     logic. [<a class="ref" href="#consten_etal2012">Consten and Loll 2012</a>] provide a very enlightening study of such cases, demonstrating how “hypotheses of a theory are (partly) tested with derived (annotated) data that have
                     been generated in the framework of the same theory” ([<a class="ref" href="#consten_etal2012">Consten and Loll 2012</a>, 712]). This, simply put, means that without critically reflecting the process of annotation,
                     researchers fall into the danger of subscribing to unfalsifieable hypotheses, as all
                     the data on which they test their hypothesis is annotated in such a way that it makes
                     falsification impossible (i.e. by annotating the data in such a way as the theory
                     would suggest). To return to the example of tag questions and their annotation provided
                     in <a href="#section03.2">Section 3.2</a>, this danger becomes imminently clear: if the researchers assume, based on whatever
                     theory, that there are X different kinds of tag questions, and annotate them accordingly,
                     it would be surprising if the results of the annotation process used to test the theory
                     differed in any way from the theory used to annotate them.</div>
                  
                  <div class="counter"><a href="#p44">44</a></div>
                  <div class="ptext" id="p44">This fact is among the reasons of why within DiÖ, we annotate the corpus with several
                     dimensions instead of just classifying data as a monodimensional variants of a variable.
                     In such a way, the annotations are easily recoverable, and the groupings of linguistic
                     phenomena to a variant becomes transparent, and thereby an easier subject to review.
                     Because of a meaningful, hierarchical structure of the annotations, based on categories
                     and features that describe the phenomenon, the researchers need to make explicit what
                     they consider constitutive of a certain variant. Thereby, problematic cases where
                     the data does not fall neatly into pre-described variants can still be annotated according
                     to their categories and features and thereby possibly suggest new, unfound regularities.
                     Additionally, such a structure helps the researchers in their design of an annotation
                     scheme, as there is no need to start from scratch for every linguistic phenomenon
                     worth investigating.</div>
                  
                  <div class="counter"><a href="#p45">45</a></div>
                  <div class="ptext" id="p45">Finally, since classification – of whatever sort – can be conceived of “as identifying locations in an n-dimensional space,” where “[e]ach dimension is associated with an axis, and the set of possible values along
                     any one axis is sometimes referred to as an array” [<a class="ref" href="#sperbergmcqueen2016">Sperberg-McQueen 2016</a>, 380]), there is definite value in making this annotation space more complex than simply
                     one axis with a singular array. Instead, this semantic model makes the annotation
                     space as complex as the object at hand demands while also giving meaning to not just
                     the values in an array, but to the axis itself. To return to the example of tag questions
                     provided in <a href="#section03.2">Section 3.2</a>, instead of locating the data points as array of variants on the axis of a variable
                     “tag questions,”<a class="noteRef" href="#d4e1696">[9]</a> the DiÖ annotation logic provides a much richer annotation space with several, transparent
                     axes that describe the data being tagged with a finer granularity. In such a way,
                     this annotation logic can be beneficial not just for corpus linguistics, but for research
                     in humanities in general, as it gives a meaningful and transparent structuring to
                     the annotation space.</div>

                  <div class="ptext" id="p46">This paper has laid out the annotation processes conducted by DiÖ. By narrowing the
                     scope from annotation in general to manual annotation, we set the focus on manual
                     annotation as a research practice on the example of corpus and variationist linguistics.
                     From the digital perspective, it was laid out how stand-off annotation can be beneficial
                     for the annotation of linguistic corpora, allowing proper documentation of tags seamlessly,
                     make it painless to edit already existing tags, showing a clear distinction between
                     the annotations and the data being annotated, and being able to set constraints that
                     only allow well-formed annotations according to the annotation manual. Then, the semantic
                     layer of the DiÖ annotation process was laid out. The benefits of a multi-dimensional,
                     hierarchical structure for tags, where generations correspond to either categories,
                     features of a category, or features of a feature were shown. Two examples from contemporary
                     variationist linguistics, the pronunciation of unstressed &lt;-ig&gt; in standard varieties
                     of German in Austria, and the variation of tag questions, exemplified this. Finally,
                     we argued that annotation in general can be understood as a form of – necessarily
                     subjective and incomplete – categorization. The hierarchical, multi-dimensional model
                     of annotations used in DiÖ provides a richer, more transparent annotation space than
                     e.g. variant tabulation could. For this reason, the model used in DiÖ may be considered
                     a better fit for many annotation projects in humanities research than simple, uni-dimensional
                     annotation.</div>

                     how annotation as a practice is situated within different research fields. Additionally,
                     it should be closer investigated on what epistemological footings annotation can stand
                     within a certain discipline. Moreover, it would be worth questioning, possibly based
                     on concrete examples, in how far annotation as categorization can have ontological
                     implications for the humanities, insofar as the categorization achieved by annotation
                     in the humanities can be considered a natural kind or “merely” a representational convention (cf. [<a class="ref" href="#magnus2018">Magnus 2018</a>, 1427]).</div>
