                  <p>This reflection provides a brief examination of Black DH genealogy.  Focusing on a
                     set of significant moments and events in the origin of Black DH provides an opportunity
                     to showcase how it has been central to the development of the broader digital humanities
                     field. Moreover, this select survey of Black DH reveals a pattern of work that utilizes
                     a “technology of recovery” to restore the humanity of Black people through digital projects that center social
                     justice but neglect joy and pleasure.</p>

                  <div class="ptext" id="p1">If we were to create a timeline of significant events in the rise of the digital humanities,
                     then 2008 would certainly be a year of great importance. The National Endowment for
                     the Humanities <a href="https://www.neh.gov/divisions/odh/dhi-now-odh" onclick="window.open('https://www.neh.gov/divisions/odh/dhi-now-odh'); return false" class="ref">announced</a> the creation of a new office: The Office of Digital Humanities. However, an event
                     that might be missed in the genealogy of the digital humanities and significance of
                     2008 is that a month later the conference, <a href="https://archive.mith.umd.edu/diaspora2008/" onclick="window.open('https://archive.mith.umd.edu/diaspora2008/'); return false" class="ref">“Digital Diasporas: Digital Humanities and African American/African Diaspora Studies”</a> occurred at the University of Maryland from April 30th to May 3rd. “Digital Diasporas” was the first conference of its kind to bring together the fields of digital humanities
                     and African American/African Diaspora Studies, though certainly not the first efforts
                     to establish a relationship between Blackness and digital technologies in the Academy.
                     For that origin story, we might look to 1983 and The <a href="https://hbw.ku.edu/" onclick="window.open('https://hbw.ku.edu/'); return false" class="ref"><cite class="title italic">History of Black Writing (HBW) Project</cite></a> by Maryemma Graham. As an early Black digital humanities (Black DH) project, the
                     HBW project, then known as “The Computer Assisted Analysis of Black Literature,” recovered Black writing through a comprehensive checklist and database. Thus, in
                     2008, the “Digital Diasporas” conference was a manifestation of decades of work by Graham and other Black scholars
                     in charting a relationship between digital technologies and knowledge about the Black
                     experience.</div>
                  
                  <div class="counter"><a href="#p2">2</a></div>
                  <div class="ptext" id="p2">Ten years later, in 2018, the <a href="https://arhu.umd.edu/events/conference-intentionally-digital-intentionally-black" onclick="window.open('https://arhu.umd.edu/events/conference-intentionally-digital-intentionally-black'); return false" class="ref">“Intentionally Digital, Intentionally Black”</a> conference, which also took place at the University of Maryland from October 18th
                     to October 20th in 2018, expanded the connection between the digital humanities and
                     Blackness. For example, the Digital Diasporas conference featured Alexander G. Weheliye’s
                     project, “Black Studies and the Digital Archive ” which sought to expand the contours of the field with the digital life of resources
                     on Blackness. “Intentionally Digital, Intentionally Black,” also featured projects and scholarship which examined the ways that gender, race
                     and technology operate online through Black women’s use of  social media as represented
                     by the panel, “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GR0f-V4VQqA" onclick="window.open('https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GR0f-V4VQqA'); return false" class="ref">Always at Work: Black Women Online</a>.”  In addition, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qhOvS4y3dtU" onclick="window.open('https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qhOvS4y3dtU'); return false" class="ref">This Code Cracks: A #BlackCodeStudies</a> roundtable featured Marisa Parham who presented her work, “<a href="https://mp285.com/sections/portfolio/" onclick="window.open('https://mp285.com/sections/portfolio/'); return false" class="ref">.break.dance</a>” a project that explores the interplay between Blackness, time, space, and digital
                     experiences through basic web technologies such as html, javascript, and css. These
                     two events, separated by a decade, highlights the ways Black Studies scholars have
                     not simply kept apace but also anticipated the development of the digital humanities
                     as a field, and more importantly the rise of Black DH. In essence, Black DH work has
                     consistently been on the cutting edge of the digital humanities.</div>
                  
                  <div class="counter"><a href="#p3">3</a></div>
                  <div class="ptext" id="p3">Presently, a <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1rZwucjyAAR7QiEZl238_hhRPXo5-UKXt2_KCrwPZkiQ/edit" onclick="window.open('https://docs.google.com/document/d/1rZwucjyAAR7QiEZl238_hhRPXo5-UKXt2_KCrwPZkiQ/edit'); return false" class="ref"> list</a> of over 400 projects and scholarship, that is maintained by the “<a href="https://coloredconventions.org/" onclick="window.open('https://coloredconventions.org/'); return false" class="ref">Colored Conventions Project</a>”, indicates the growth of Black DH that demonstrates the value of the work that recovers
                     and restores Black humanity. Yet, even as we continue to see exciting work in Black
                     DH emerge, there are only a few projects that center topics such as Black pleasure
                     and sexuality. Many projects on the list are focused on Black people’s historical
                     and contemporary struggle for liberation. This should not surprise the avid student
                     of the Black experience. In some sense, Black DH has followed the trajectory of traditional
                     scholarship on the Black life and its investment in heteronormative values and respectability
                     politics that tend to focus on Blackness in relationship to the struggles for social
                     justice.</div>
                  
                  <div class="counter"><a href="#p4">4</a></div>
                  <div class="ptext" id="p4">Still, the outlook for work that examines expansive notions of Blackness is bright
                     when we look at a small but growing body of Black DH undertakings. For example, Camille
                     Lawrence’s project, the “<a href="https://www.blackbeautyarchives.org/" onclick="window.open('https://www.blackbeautyarchives.org/'); return false" class="ref">Black Beauty Archives</a>” takes up beauty culture in the African diaspora through digitized images of beauty
                     tools, magazines, and advertisements and creates a digital space where pleasure and
                     joy are located, shaped, and developed from Black aesthetics. Similarly, “<a href="https://www.blacklesbianarchives.com/" onclick="window.open('https://www.blacklesbianarchives.com/'); return false" class="ref">The Black Lesbian Archives</a>” by Krü Maekdo uses music, videos, and still images to powerfully archive and curate
                     the rich history of Black lesbians’ lives and experiences throughout the United States
                     and beyond. Finally, LaShawn Pittman’s “<a href="https://realblackgrandmothers.com/" onclick="window.open('https://realblackgrandmothers.com/'); return false" class="ref">Real Black Grandmothers</a>”not only offers a digital archive of Black grandmothers’ lifesaving role in Black
                     communities but provides an opportunity for people to playfully participate in the
                     cultivation of a digital space where Black grandmother wit and “<a href="https://realblackgrandmothers.com/her-sayings/" onclick="window.open('https://realblackgrandmothers.com/her-sayings/'); return false" class="ref">sayings</a>” are preserved and shared through Twitter. </div>
                  
                  <div class="counter"><a href="#p5">5</a></div>
                  <div class="ptext" id="p5">Together, these three projects represent the future of Black DH through digital humanists'
                     use of digital technologies to recover the joy and pleasure of Blackness. </div>
