            <p>The relative youth of Black DH as a field has allowed it to be born radical. While
               some fields have more conservative traditions that they must break free from, Black
               DH has been able to forage a more inclusive path. The focus of Black DH and this
               special issue is not to define Black DH, but rather spotlight the limitless,
               interdisciplinary nature of Black DH and Black scholarship. Both article and
               metareflection authors alike build upon lineages of Black studies, feminist, queer,
               and womanist scholars, forging new paths using their innovative methodologies as they
               examine, construct, and reimagine innovative communities and people.</p>

         <head>Framing Black Digital Humanities</head>
         <p>We conceptualized and proposed this issue shortly after the 2018 <title rend="italic"
               >Intentionally Digital, Intentionally Black </title>conference held by <ref
               target="https://aadhum.umd.edu/asante/about/">University of Maryland’s Center for
               African American History, Culture, and Digital Humanities</ref> (AADHum),
            co-organized by Catherine Knight Steele and Trevor Muñoz. One of the core challenges
            expressed by scholars was the limited legibility of their work in DH, a field that is
            predominantly white. Their work was often categorized as outside of DH, borrowing DH
            tools and applied them to other self-contained fields. Scholars noted how this impacted
            their ability to secure academic jobs, get published, or even be granted tenure. There
            are tangible and serious consequences to not recognizing the work of Black scholars as
            well as not validating methodologies and projects that center Black subjects in DH.</p>
         <p>Over the past four years digital humanities scholars have committed to antiracism and
            feminism, calling for a more equitable field/ Black Digital Humanities has blossomed.
            Black DH scholars who have helped shape the field — such as Catherine Knight Steele,
            André Brock, and Moya Bailey — have published books with NYU, MIT, and other
            well-established presses. There has also been a rise in Black DH and media studies
            positions.</p>
         <p>However, we must still work to center Black digital humanists and scholars; this work is
            ongoing and necessary, especially in the face of anti-Black violence in academia and
            digital spaces. We also recognize that there are inequities within Black DH projects,
            and limited funding also means limited opportunity. Even with a stream of new lines of
            hire, the academic job market remains unstable. Coupled with issues of retention and the
            abuses and exploitations faced by Black scholars, even those that can finally be put
            into productive positions find themselves pushed to the margins of academia. Precarity
            is rife, but each day we marvel at how these scholars resist and center themselves and
            their colleagues. We imagine this special issue as a hub of that resistance. In a fight
            against white-supremacy, sexism, and ableism, we stand with other scholars of Black DH
            and we work towards a more equitable world.</p>
         <p>The past four years have changed beyond just the scope of Black DH. We knew that
            undertaking a project like this would be major — it is nearly four years in the making.
            Building a special issue takes time even in perfect conditions. We and the writers of
            this issue saw cataclysmic shifts — the Covid-19 pandemic, racial reckonings, volatile
            presidencies, and the Russian-Ukrainan war. Much has changed. It is no surprise that
            despite the pandemic's hinderings and the overall global conflicts and violence, Black
            people have been able to organize, work, and bond. Our authors wrote mostly before and
            in the midst of these events, and may not have been able to fully or directly attend to
            this in their work. We ask that you read these in good faith, and know that the omission
            was not intentional. Instead we ask that you read the articles and think about how they
            might help yourself and others better understand the contemporary moment. Reading the
            articles and metareflections published in this special issue at this time should urge
            you to think in new ways about how Black DH projects can be revelatory of larger issues.
            For example, Bryan M. Jenkin's and Taryn K. Myers’ work on Black Podcasts is helpful in explaining why
            centering Black voices and opinions is critical to understanding our current political
            climate. Dr. Ravynn K. Stringfield’s work on Black women’s social networks exposes how
            they build community and support one another in the face of adversity– building a
            framework for how we might <emph>all</emph> work together to uplift each other.</p>
         <p>The relative youth of Black DH as a field has allowed it to be born radical. While some
            fields have more conservative traditions that they must break free from, Black DH has
            been able to forage a more inclusive path. </p>
         <div>
         <head>Process </head>
         <p>In this special issue — from the original brainstorming to the final publication — we
            committed to Black digital humanities and larger Black feminist methodologies and
            practices for collaboration. Because this SI is specifically focused on the future of
            Black DH, which meant specifically inviting early-career scholars to publish, we
            committed to demystifying the publication process and disciplinary knowledges, pushing
            against the opaque writing and reviewing process that often manufactures barriers for
            graduate students, especially Black graduate students. </p>
         <p>For us, citational politics have been critical in how we think and practice our
            scholarship. Taking cues from scholars like Jessica Marie Johnson, Moya Bailey, and
            André Brock, we always cite where we can (and not just when necessary) and we take joy
            in building up scholarship and creating networks of thought. As we note below, we also
            encourage our writers to do the same.</p>
         <p>Recently, several scholars came together to compile “<ref
               target="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1lZmZqeNNnYfYgmTKSbL2ijYbR4OMovv6A-bDwJRnwx8/edit"
               >Anti-Racist Scholarly Reviewing Practices: A Heuristic for Editors, Reviewers, and
               Authors</ref>,” a set of anti-racist scholarly reviewing practices with specific
            steps editors, reviewers, and authors can implement into their everyday work. The goal
            of this document is to invite inclusive and equitable practices, rather than reproducing
            gatekeeping. Even though this document was not available during our reviewing process,
            we implemented several of these practices as they align with our own methodologies and
            commitments. We encourage editors, reviewers, and authors in digital humanities to take
            seriously these anti-racist practices. In our commitment to this anti-racist process
            that centers Black knowledges, experiences, and methodologies, we use this space to
            explain our own editorial process — a process we hope others take on, whether invested
            in Black DH, anti-racism, or changing academia. </p></div>
         <div>
         <head>Transparent Submission &amp; Proposal Process</head>
         <p>When we proposed the special issue, we chose a workflow that allowed for scholars,
            especially early career scholars, to learn about the peer review and publication
            process. The call for proposals invited scholars to submit a short description of their
            planned article; this meant less work up front for potential authors. In the <ref
               target="http://bit.ly/between-DH-and-me-CFP">original call for proposals</ref>, we
            also invited interested scholars to join proposal workshops.</p></div>
         <div>
         <head>Workshopping &amp; Writing Sessions</head>
         <p>The first workshop, which we held twice, centered around attendees drafting their
            proposals and asking us questions. In this workshop we described the proposal process,
            shared the criteria we were planning to use to evaluate the proposals, provided a longer
            description of the publication process, and answered any questions from attendees. Most
            of the attendees submitted proposals. The <ref
               target="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1btcC63F1JZuHbZDcyiTo_e_8xkk5vuq6FfSD85kkh-E/edit?usp=sharing"
                  ><title rend="quotes">Workshop for Proposals</title> handout</ref> is available
            for further reading.</p>
         <p>Once proposals were accepted, we also hosted a series of writing sessions before the
            contributors submitted their articles to be peer reviewed. These writing sessions
            allowed contributors to carve out time to write, ask us questions, and continue to learn
            about the peer review and special issue process. During these workshops and writing
            sessions, we had a chance to build community with the authors, learning not only about
            their articles but their values, goals, and overall research.</p></div>
            <div>
         <head>Feedback on Drafts</head>
         <p>Before the contributors sent their proposals in for peer review, we also provided a
            round of feedback. We hoped not only to continue fostering the community we built
            through the workshops and writing sessions, but also wanted to play a part in ensuring
            articles would receive the most productive, careful, and thoughtful feedback. We read
            through each article and provided feedback in regards to citational politics,
            organization, the development of important ideas, and ethical research practices. We
            pointed to Moya Bailey’s <title rend="quotes">#transform(ing)DH Writing and Research: An
               Autoethnography of Digital Humanities and Feminist Ethics</title> as a guide for
            ethical, feminist online research <ptr target="#bailey2015"/>.</p></div>
         <div>
         <head>Recognizing Labor and Limitations</head>
         <p>Composing a special issue, writing articles and metareflections, peer reviewing, and
            editing all take an enormous amount of mostly uncompensated labor. This uncompensated
            labor, though, scratches the surface for what the past four years has brought upon Black
            academics and Black communities. First, COVID-19 has devestated Black and Latinx
            communities <ptr target="#oppel2020"/>. Even the CDC’s lack of transparency with
            surveillance data demonstrates how data collection can continuously harm Black people or
            hide the violence Black people face, as Angel David Nieves addresses in his
            metareflection. Second, the state-sactioned murders of Breonna Taylor and George Floyd
            led to the demand from institutions for Black scholars, practitioners, writers, and
            workers to address anti-Blackness. Suddenly, the expected labor for Black academics
            doubled and tripled, often with no offers for compensation. Because of this, we were
            constantly communicating with the article and metareflection authors, offering flexible
            deadlines, space to ask questions, and words of encouragement. This special issue is the
            product of an immense amount of labor, from the editors to the reviewers to the
            authors.</p></div></div>
         <div>
         <head>Organization of this Special Issue</head>
         <p>When we first envisioned the make up of this issue we knew that we wanted to highlight
            our brilliant peers and that we wanted to give our readers a sense of what was to come
            in Black Digital Humanities. While highlighting the work of brilliant scholars such as
            Ravynn K. Stringfield, Romi Ron Morrison, and Brienne A. Adams among others, we also
            realized that their work rested on the scholarship of a previous generation of scholars
            that blazed the trials that they walked across. In order to acknowledge this we have
            enlisted several advanced scholars, including Moya Bailey, Kim Gallon, and Kaiama L. Glover
            to write <emph>metareflections</emph>. These short essays gave them the space to
            meditate and reflect on their own work and the larger DH field. They also allow for the
            scholars to imagine its future as well as the concerns and optimism they have for the
            future of Black Digital Humanities.</p>
         <p>The digital humanities often evades containment to a single genre. Whether it be a web
            only project, digital dissertation, or the building of a digital archive or respiratory,
            it is nearly impossible to set a rigid guideline to how each project should be composed.
            We gave our writers free reign to write whatever they wanted, however they wanted to
            compose their work. Some of our articles take on a standard journal article frame, while
            others are insights into digital archives or podcasts, some are intended to be used as
            pedagogical tools, and others offer outline methodologies for others to take up in their
            work. The unique format of each article puts into practice the exact sort of thinking
            that the creator implores for its readers.</p>
         	<p>Although the genres are distinct, they coalesce together under shared themes — the importance of recovering, recording, and preserving historical data and objects; recognizing spaces for uplift and joy; and spotlighting the brilliance of Black folks and their extensive contributions to technology. These themes themselves are all
            interconnected. The collection of objects and data assure that Black people's
            contributions to technology (and beyond) are minted, and there is a certain level of joy
            and community that is built around that work — a great example of this are the scholars
            behind the <ref target="https://coloredconventions.org/about/">Colored Conventions
               Project</ref>. As editors, we brought these pieces together in hopes that our readers
            would show the multitudes of Black DH scholarship, while also learning more about what
            brings them together, and what forms the tenets of the field. </p></div>

            <p>Steele’s celebration of Black women is reflected
            throughout several of the contributors’ articles and reflections. </p>
         <p>The article contributors to this issue demonstrate both their own innovative approaches
            to digital spaces. Franny Gaede, Ana-Maurine Lara, Alaí Reyes-Santos, and Kate Thornhill
            apply decolonial methodologies in creating a digital archive of Afro-Indigenous women
            healers in the Caribbean, centering cultural awareness in all aspects of the project.
            Similarly, Jazma Sutton and Kalani Craig incorporate <quote rend="inline">descendant
               archival practice</quote> in the building and analysis of <title rend="italic"
               >Remembering Freedom History Harvest</title>, a digital archive that <quote
               rend="inline">relies...on the community archives and memory work that join together
               in descendant archival practice as a way to generate Black women’s histories</quote>.
            Finally, Ravynn K Stringfield examines the labors of joy for Black women graduate
            students sharing their experiences online, which include her own labors on her blog
               <title rend="italic">Black Girl Does Grad School (BGDGS)</title>; she reminds us that
            there are communities and networks that will never fail us, even in the face of abject
            political adversity. </p>
         <p>The contributors also analyze the approaches of Black people and communities in digital
            spaces in innovative ways. For instance, Brienne Adams analyzes intimacy in affirmative
            transformative fan practices in the the <title rend="italic">Awkward Black Girl</title>
            and <title rend="italic">Insecure</title> Black digital fandoms. Bryan Jenkins and Taryn
            Myers conduct a rich qualitative coding analysis of Black podcasts, centering their
            analysis on how these podcasts integrate and build community, resistance, and voice.
            Finally, Romi Ron Morrison’s <title rend="quotes">Voluptous Disintergration</title>
            helps us better understand Black life and its relationship to technology and
            revolutionary politics. Their theorization of Black Computational Thought highlights the
               <quote rend="inline">quotidian, social, opaque, woven, and fugitive practices of
               computation born from Black diasporic movement</quote>, giving us further insight into
            how Black people have always already been on the cutting edge of both technology and
            culture.</p>
            <div>
         <head>Metareflections</head>
         <p>Across the metaflections we hope you notice the incredible strides the field has made,
            and can see more plainly the ways in which these scholars have made and influenced the
            field. But we also want to note how they are not just brilliant scholars that have
            created works that are thoroughly cited throughout, they are have also acted as mentors,
            as interlocutors, and as champions of this rising generation — proving that they are not
            just brilliant, but that they are nurturing and supportive and that they believe in this
            generation, a generosity that is unparalleled. As you read them, we hope that it
            inspires you to return to and take a deeper look into their work, as that will bring
            further clarity of purpose as you dive into the work of this rising generation that
            builds from them. </p>
         <p>Moya Bailey reflects on her journey as a central Black DH scholar and looks forward; she
            reflects on how Black DH and other online spaces can provide ample opportunity for
            connection and research towards social justice, but expresses concern with DH’s
            continued obsession with coding. Still, she finds hope in the expanding diversity — both
            identity and theoretical diversity — of the field. Like Bailey, Roopika Risam reflects
            on her early years in DH, which led her and like-minded colleagues to create coalitions
            to build a more justice-centered and ethnicity-focused DH. She had not initially set out
            to do DH work, but like many of us, she found that DH was a place that was ripe for
            exploring new possibilities, possibilities that offered even more opportunities to work
            towards social justice than more traditional frameworks and methods of study. </p>
         <p>Angel David Nieves gives practical advice on how we can work towards expanding the
            diversity of the field. He offers ten specific practices that can do just that. They
            include <quote rend="inline">harness[ing] the breadth of digital expertise, in Black
               social media, and Black software and hardware design while developing new forms of
               digital scholarship</quote> and supporting information systems practitioners who are
            advancing Black DH projects. From an information systems practitioner perspective,
            Bethany Nowviskie argues for the need to create archives, collections and libraries that
            center generative and healing infrastructure, rather than control. Elizabeth Losh focuses on concerns about funding, labor, and equity, and encourages more
            localized organizing to better support Black DH, Black graduate students, and graduate
            students of color; she points to the <title rend="italic">Intentionally Digital,
               Intentionally Black</title> conference as an example. These scholars point us towards
            concrete ways that we can assure that the field of Black DH, and even DH more broadly,
            has better practices and more inclusive ways of organizing within the field. In Kim
            Gallon’s metareflection, she urges us to not just look to Black DH as a site of
            resistance and liberation, but to also look at the places where the joy and pleasure of
            Black life can be found. We see Gallon’s call as necessary. It is this hope and joy that
            sustains the optimism we run on to drive the future in a better direction. We hope that
            you find moments of pleasure tucked all throughout this issue, and we hope that they
            nourish you.</p>
         <p>The other metareflection writers look back to their own theoretical groundwork in DH,
            and their own impetus for driving the field. Kaiama L. Glover remarks on how DH has the
            ability to provide new space and platforms for all sorts of thinking and projects. Like
            many, she believes in the <quote rend="inline">affordances of the digital</quote> for
            collaboration and work towards equity. But, in order to do this, she urges us to avoid
            replicating the practice of focusing solely on the US, and push the boundaries further
            to be more inclusive of all Black people, and create more space and opportunity for
            research by and about people from Caribbean and Black people across the global diaspora.
            Avoiding a focus solely on the US helps us move away from overdetermining American
            subjects and overlooking others. This resonates with Louis Maraj’s plea that we avoid
            canonizing or constricting Black DH with too much definition. Instead, we should focus
            on the multiplicity of Black DH and Black lives. He notes <quote rend="inline">Nah, I
               believe that virality inherently offers — through distribution — constant space for
               mashing up contexts, artifacts, identities, and the very frameworks on which
               settler-colonial, racial capitalist projects lie</quote>. As Maraj argues – and as
            all the metareflection authors demonstrate – Black Digital Humanities scholars,
            practices, and theories resist full and complete definitions.</p></div></div>
         <div>
         <head>Conclusion</head>
         	<p>We hope Black DH continues to evade definition. Practically, it calls in all types of folks who do
            all types of work, whether the emphasis lies in the digital or in the humanities. It
            also allows scholars to create an individual sense of the field to fit their own needs.
            More than thirty years into its earliest conceptions of the field, in 2014 the website
               “<ref target="https://whatisdigitalhumanities.com/">What is Digital Humanities</ref>”
            randomized more than 800 DH scholar’s running definitions of the field showing the wide
            breadth of definitions.</p>
         <p>The focus of Black DH and this special issue is not to define Black DH, but rather
            spotlight the limitless, interdisciplinary nature of Black DH and Black scholarship.
            Both article and metareflection authors alike build upon lineages of Black studies,
            feminist, queer, and womanist scholars, forging new paths using their innovative
            methodologies as they examine, construct, and reimagine innovative communities and
            people. We hope this special issue contributes to the expanding field as well as Black
            DH scholars, DH scholars, and graduate students committed to Black studies and centering
            Black lives to take up this work. </p></div>
