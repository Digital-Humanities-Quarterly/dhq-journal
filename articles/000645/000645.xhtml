                  <p>The relative youth of Black DH as a field has allowed it to be born radical. While
                     some fields have more conservative traditions that they must break free from, Black
                     DH has been able to forage a more inclusive path. The focus of Black DH and this
                     special issue is not to define Black DH, but rather spotlight the limitless,
                     interdisciplinary nature of Black DH and Black scholarship. Both article and
                     metareflection authors alike build upon lineages of Black studies, feminist, queer,
                     and womanist scholars, forging new paths using their innovative methodologies as they
                     examine, construct, and reimagine innovative communities and people.</p>

                  <div class="ptext" id="p1">We conceptualized and proposed this issue shortly after the 2018 <cite class="title italic">Intentionally Digital, Intentionally Black </cite>conference held by <a href="https://aadhum.umd.edu/asante/about/" onclick="window.open('https://aadhum.umd.edu/asante/about/'); return false" class="ref">University of Maryland’s Center for
                        African American History, Culture, and Digital Humanities</a> (AADHum),
                     co-organized by Catherine Knight Steele and Trevor Muñoz. One of the core challenges
                     expressed by scholars was the limited legibility of their work in DH, a field that
                     is
                     predominantly white. Their work was often categorized as outside of DH, borrowing
                     DH
                     tools and applied them to other self-contained fields. Scholars noted how this impacted
                     their ability to secure academic jobs, get published, or even be granted tenure. There
                     are tangible and serious consequences to not recognizing the work of Black scholars
                     as
                     well as not validating methodologies and projects that center Black subjects in DH.</div>
                  
                  <div class="counter"><a href="#p2">2</a></div>
                  <div class="ptext" id="p2">Over the past four years digital humanities scholars have committed to antiracism
                     and
                     feminism, calling for a more equitable field/ Black Digital Humanities has blossomed.
                     Black DH scholars who have helped shape the field — such as Catherine Knight Steele,
                     André Brock, and Moya Bailey — have published books with NYU, MIT, and other
                     well-established presses. There has also been a rise in Black DH and media studies
                     positions.</div>
                  
                  <div class="counter"><a href="#p3">3</a></div>
                  <div class="ptext" id="p3">However, we must still work to center Black digital humanists and scholars; this work
                     is
                     ongoing and necessary, especially in the face of anti-Black violence in academia and
                     digital spaces. We also recognize that there are inequities within Black DH projects,
                     and limited funding also means limited opportunity. Even with a stream of new lines
                     of
                     hire, the academic job market remains unstable. Coupled with issues of retention and
                     the
                     abuses and exploitations faced by Black scholars, even those that can finally be put
                     into productive positions find themselves pushed to the margins of academia. Precarity
                     is rife, but each day we marvel at how these scholars resist and center themselves
                     and
                     their colleagues. We imagine this special issue as a hub of that resistance. In a
                     fight
                     against white-supremacy, sexism, and ableism, we stand with other scholars of Black
                     DH
                     and we work towards a more equitable world.</div>
                  
                  <div class="counter"><a href="#p4">4</a></div>
                  <div class="ptext" id="p4">The past four years have changed beyond just the scope of Black DH. We knew that
                     undertaking a project like this would be major — it is nearly four years in the making.
                     Building a special issue takes time even in perfect conditions. We and the writers
                     of
                     this issue saw cataclysmic shifts — the Covid-19 pandemic, racial reckonings, volatile
                     presidencies, and the Russian-Ukrainan war. Much has changed. It is no surprise that
                     despite the pandemic's hinderings and the overall global conflicts and violence, Black
                     people have been able to organize, work, and bond. Our authors wrote mostly before
                     and
                     in the midst of these events, and may not have been able to fully or directly attend
                     to
                     this in their work. We ask that you read these in good faith, and know that the omission
                     was not intentional. Instead we ask that you read the articles and think about how
                     they
                     might help yourself and others better understand the contemporary moment. Reading
                     the
                     articles and metareflections published in this special issue at this time should urge
                     you to think in new ways about how Black DH projects can be revelatory of larger issues.
                     For example, Bryan M. Jenkin’s work on Black Podcasts is helpful in explaining why
                     centering Black voices and opinions is critical to understanding our current political
                     climate. Dr. Ravynn K. Stringfield’s work on Black women’s social networks exposes
                     how
                     they build community and support one another in the face of adversity– building a
                     framework for how we might <em class="emph">all</em> work together to uplift each other.</div>

                        we
                        committed to Black digital humanities and larger Black feminist methodologies and
                        practices for collaboration. Because this SI is specifically focused on the future
                        of
                        Black DH, which meant specifically inviting early-career scholars to publish, we
                        committed to demystifying the publication process and disciplinary knowledges, pushing
                        against the opaque writing and reviewing process that often manufactures barriers
                        for
                        graduate students, especially Black graduate students. </div>

                        joy
                        in building up scholarship and creating networks of thought. As we note below, we

                        steps editors, reviewers, and authors can implement into their everyday work. The
                        goal
                        of this document is to invite inclusive and equitable practices, rather than reproducing
                        gatekeeping. Even though this document was not available during our reviewing process,
                        we implemented several of these practices as they align with our own methodologies
                        and
                        commitments. We encourage editors, reviewers, and authors in digital humanities to
                        take
                        seriously these anti-racist practices. In our commitment to this anti-racist process

                        editing all take an enormous amount of mostly uncompensated labor. This uncompensated
                        labor, though, scratches the surface for what the past four years has brought upon
                        Black
                        academics and Black communities. First, COVID-19 has devestated Black and Latinx
                        communities [<a class="ref" href="#oppel2020">Oppel et al. 2020</a>]. Even the CDC’s lack of transparency with
                        surveillance data demonstrates how data collection can continuously harm Black people
                        or
                        hide the violence Black people face, as Angel David Nieves addresses in his
                        metareflection. Second, the state-sactioned murders of Breonna Taylor and George Floyd
                        led to the demand from institutions for Black scholars, practitioners, writers, and
                        workers to address anti-Blackness. Suddenly, the expected labor for Black academics
                        doubled and tripled, often with no offers for compensation. Because of this, we were
                        constantly communicating with the article and metareflection authors, offering flexible
                        deadlines, space to ask questions, and words of encouragement. This special issue
                        is the
                        product of an immense amount of labor, from the editors to the reviewers to the
                        authors.</div>

                  <div class="ptext" id="p14">When we first envisioned the make up of this issue we knew that we wanted to highlight
                     our brilliant peers and that we wanted to give our readers a sense of what was to
                     come
                     in Black Digital Humanities. While highlighting the work of brilliant scholars such
                     as
                     Ravynn K. Stringfield, Romi Ron Morrison, and Brienne A. Adams among others, we also
                     realized that their work rested on the scholarship of a previous generation of scholars
                     that blazed the trials that they walked across. In order to acknowledge this we have
                     enlisted several advanced scholars, including Moya Bailey, Kim Gallon, and Kaiama
                     L. Glover
                     to write <em class="emph">metareflections</em>. These short essays gave them the space to
                     meditate and reflect on their own work and the larger DH field. They also allow for
                     the
                     scholars to imagine its future as well as the concerns and optimism they have for
                     the

                  <div class="ptext" id="p15">The digital humanities often evades containment to a single genre. Whether it be a
                     web
                     only project, digital dissertation, or the building of a digital archive or respiratory,
                     it is nearly impossible to set a rigid guideline to how each project should be composed.
                     We gave our writers free reign to write whatever they wanted, however they wanted
                     to
                     compose their work. Some of our articles take on a standard journal article frame,
                     while
                     others are insights into digital archives or podcasts, some are intended to be used
                     as
                     pedagogical tools, and others offer outline methodologies for others to take up in
                     their
                     work. The unique format of each article puts into practice the exact sort of thinking
                     that the creator implores for its readers.</div>

                     importance of recovering, recording, and preserving historical data and objects,
                     recognizing spaces for uplift and joy, and spotlighting the brilliance of Black folks
                     and their extensive contributions to technology. These themes themselves are all
                     interconnected. The collection of objects and data assure that Black people's
                     contributions to technology (and beyond) are minted, and there is a certain level
                     of joy
                     and community that is built around that work — a great example of this are the scholars

                     to digital spaces. Franny Gaede, Ana-Maurine Lara, Alaí Reyes-Santos, and Kate Thornhill
                     apply decolonial methodologies in creating a digital archive of Afro-Indigenous women
                     healers in the Caribbean, centering cultural awareness in all aspects of the project.
                     Similarly, Jazma Sutton and Kalani Craig incorporate “descendant
                     archival practice” in the building and analysis of <cite class="title italic">Remembering Freedom History Harvest</cite>, a digital archive that “relies...on the community archives and memory work that join together
                     in descendant archival practice as a way to generate Black women’s histories”.
                     Finally, Ravynn K Stringfield examines the labors of joy for Black women graduate
                     students sharing their experiences online, which include her own labors on her blog
                     <cite class="title italic">Black Girl Does Grad School (BGDGS)</cite>; she reminds us that

                     and <cite class="title italic">Insecure</cite> Black digital fandoms. Bryan Jenkins and Taryn
                     Myers conduct a rich qualitative coding analysis of Black podcasts, centering their
                     analysis on how these podcasts integrate and build community, resistance, and voice.
                     Finally, Romi Ron Morrison’s “Voluptous Disintergration”
                     helps us better understand Black life and its relationship to technology and
                     revolutionary politics. Their theorization of Black Computational Thought highlights
                     the
                     quotidian, social, opaque, woven, and fugitive practices of
                     computation born from Black diasporic movement, giving us further insight into

                        field. But we also want to note how they are not just brilliant scholars that have
                        created works that are thoroughly cited throughout, they are have also acted as mentors,
                        as interlocutors, and as champions of this rising generation — proving that they are
                        not
                        just brilliant, but that they are nurturing and supportive and that they believe in
                        this
                        generation, a generosity that is unparalleled. As you read them, we hope that it

                     <div class="ptext" id="p22">Moya Bailey reflects on her journey as a central Black DH scholar and looks forward;
                        she
                        reflects on how Black DH and other online spaces can provide ample opportunity for
                        connection and research towards social justice, but expresses concern with DH’s
                        continued obsession with coding. Still, she finds hope in the expanding diversity
                        — both
                        identity and theoretical diversity — of the field. Like Bailey, Roopika Risam reflects
                        on her early years in DH, which led her and like-minded colleagues to create coalitions
                        to build a more justice-centered and ethnicity-focused DH. She had not initially set
                        out
                        to do DH work, but like many of us, she found that DH was a place that was ripe for
                        exploring new possibilities, possibilities that offered even more opportunities to
                        work
                        towards social justice than more traditional frameworks and methods of study. </div>

                     <div class="ptext" id="p23">Angel David Nieves gives practical advice on how we can work towards expanding the
                        diversity of the field. He offers ten specific practices that can do just that. They
                        include “harness[ing] the breadth of digital expertise, in Black
                        social media, and Black software and hardware design while developing new forms of
                        digital scholarship” and supporting information systems practitioners who are
                        advancing Black DH projects. From an information systems practitioner perspective,
                        Bethany Nowviskie argues for the need to create archives, collections and libraries
                        that
                        center generative and healing infrastructure, rather than control. Elizabeth Losh
                        focuses on concerns about funding, labor, and equity, and encourages more
                        localized organizing to better support Black DH, Black graduate students, and graduate
                        students of color; she points to the <cite class="title italic">Intentionally Digital,
                           Intentionally Black</cite> conference as an example. These scholars point us towards
                        concrete ways that we can assure that the field of Black DH, and even DH more broadly,
                        has better practices and more inclusive ways of organizing within the field. In Kim
                        Gallon’s metareflection, she urges us to not just look to Black DH as a site of
                        resistance and liberation, but to also look at the places where the joy and pleasure
                        of
                        Black life can be found. We see Gallon’s call as necessary. It is this hope and joy
                        that
                        sustains the optimism we run on to drive the future in a better direction. We hope
                        that
                        you find moments of pleasure tucked all throughout this issue, and we hope that they
                        nourish you.</div>

                     <div class="ptext" id="p24">The other metareflection writers look back to their own theoretical groundwork in
                        DH,
                        and their own impetus for driving the field. Kaiama L. Glover remarks on how DH has
                        the
                        ability to provide new space and platforms for all sorts of thinking and projects.
                        Like
                        many, she believes in the “affordances of the digital” for
                        collaboration and work towards equity. But, in order to do this, she urges us to avoid
                        replicating the practice of focusing solely on the US, and push the boundaries further
                        to be more inclusive of all Black people, and create more space and opportunity for
                        research by and about people from Caribbean and Black people across the global diaspora.
                        Avoiding a focus solely on the US helps us move away from overdetermining American
                        subjects and overlooking others. This resonates with Louis Maraj’s plea that we avoid
                        canonizing or constricting Black DH with too much definition. Instead, we should focus
                        on the multiplicity of Black DH and Black lives. He notes “Nah, I
                        believe that virality inherently offers — through distribution — constant space for
                        mashing up contexts, artifacts, identities, and the very frameworks on which
                        settler-colonial, racial capitalist projects lie”. As Maraj argues – and as
                        all the metareflection authors demonstrate – Black Digital Humanities scholars,
                        practices, and theories resist full and complete definitions.</div>

                     It
                     also allows scholars to create an individual sense of the field to fit their own needs.
                     More than thirty years into its earliest conceptions of the field, in 2014 the website
                     “<a href="https://whatisdigitalhumanities.com/" onclick="window.open('https://whatisdigitalhumanities.com/'); return false" class="ref">What is Digital Humanities</a>”
                     randomized more than 800 DH scholar’s running definitions of the field showing the
                     wide

                  <div class="ptext" id="p26">The focus of Black DH and this special issue is not to define Black DH, but rather
                     spotlight the limitless, interdisciplinary nature of Black DH and Black scholarship.
                     Both article and metareflection authors alike build upon lineages of Black studies,
                     feminist, queer, and womanist scholars, forging new paths using their innovative
                     methodologies as they examine, construct, and reimagine innovative communities and
                     people. We hope this special issue contributes to the expanding field as well as Black
                     DH scholars, DH scholars, and graduate students committed to Black studies and centering
