                <!-- Include a brief abstract of the article -->
                <p>My paper contains original <q>Word Processor Art</q> compositions and an
                    explanation of the theoretical grounding for my work. I compose visual images
                    (comprised of words primarily taken from advertisements about the object they
                    construct) in a program not intended for that purpose (Microsoft Word). I break
                    from the expected form of the <q>Word Processor Document</q> to scrutinize how
                    machines, especially computer programs and the graphical user interface (GUI),
                    influence the consumer's utilization of computers. In particular, my project
                    questions how machines influence users' thinking and how the
                        <q>user-friendly</q> inhibits creativity. The process disassembles the
                    notion of <q>user-friendly</q> as a transparent influence and reveals how media
                    shapes the author's imagination and creations.</p>

                <p>The ever-present PC, in many ways, parallels the presence of the typewriter in
                    the 1950s, 60s and 70s, which led artists to experiment with the grid-like form
                    of mechanical type to create concrete and, eventually, dirty concrete poetry. My
                    work is inspired by these artists and the typewriter poetry they composed. My
                    work also references art collective JODI's compositions and how our contemporary
                    society resists the limitations of the GUI.</p>

                <p>My intent is to draw attention to the media of the composition. My work disobeys
                    the prompts of the GUI to emphasize the idea that pre-packaged programs elicit
                    conditioned responses and stifle genuinely creative uses of computing devices.
                    Nietzsche writes that <quote rend="inline" source="#kittler1986">our writing
                        tools are also working on our thoughts</quote> (quoted in <ptr
                        target="#kittler1986" loc="200"/>). My purpose in producing this work is not
                    a rejection of computing or the GUI, but to draw attention to an interface’s
                    existence and influence on its user. My work points to a creative space outside
                    of conditioned responses to the GUI.</p>

                <p>The author presents her Word Processor Art as a means of drawing attention to the
                    way GUIs of pre-packaged computer programs condition the way users interact with
                    them. </p>

        <body>
            <p>Nietzsche writes that <quote rend="inline" source="#kittler1986">our writing tools
                    are also working on our thoughts</quote> (Nietzsche, cited in <ptr
                    target="#kittler1986" loc="200"/>). Avid users of technology justify their
                reliance on technology, because they believe that these devices facilitate, speed,
                strengthen, or seemingly eliminate the unnecessary or unproductive from commonly
                occurring activities. However, this relationship between the user and the device is
                anything but one-sided. Rather, a user begins to anticipate the exclusion of these
                processes, trading cognition for output. Nietzsche’s observation translates to the
                21st century: our digital tools work on our thoughts, and the result is undesirable.
                The standardization of <q>user-friendly</q> and its seemingly invisible presence
                teaches its users, through inculcation, to respond to machines' prompts. Users
                engage particular programs for prescribed purposes and anticipate a predictable type
                of product. Contemporary, American, techno-centric culture accepts the incredibly
                specific role <q>creators,</q> the makers of machines and their programs, design for
                consumers of computers. The constant exposure to media as tools for communication
                and expression dulls creative thought processes by training users to simply respond
                as the program's designers expect. This does not have to be the case.</p>
            <p>In the following paper, I disobey the conventions of Microsoft Word to demonstrate
                that, despite the corporate intention of its marketers, the controlled ways users
                interact with their machines need not be obstacles to creative thought; rather,
                these mechanisms, programs and the Graphical User Interface (GUI), can serve to
                assist in the creation of new forms of expression. In my project, I create visual
                images out of words, using a program not intended for that purpose (Microsoft Word).
                By breaking from the expected form of output, which resembles what I am creating in
                this text, I ask the audience to scrutinize how machines, especially the GUI of
                modern computers, limit the consumer's creative utilization of computers. The GUI
                utilizes visual icons (trash cans, menus, etc.) as an electronic platform through
                which users interact with technology in lieu of command-line interfaces. My work
                questions how the manufacturers’ notion of <q>user-friendly</q>, both through
                programs and the GUI, deliberately inhibits creativity in the effort to create
                passive, unthinking consumers, who use uniform products in predictable and
                prescribed ways. Resisting this level of corporate control, I manipulate a program
                in ways not intended by its creators. By fighting limitations inherent in the
                average consumer’s personal computing experience, I disassemble the notion of
                    <q>user-friendly</q> as a transparent and benign influence. Rather, digital
                tools, which <emph>should</emph> aid the user, hazard becoming potentially
                disruptive censors, which discourage exploration of the digital page and stifle the
                author’s creative imagination.</p>
            <p>The first digital poetry surfaced in the 1950s and surged with the emergence of the
                personal computer in the 1980s. As digital compositions evolved from the printed
                page to include generative, kinetic, interactive, and multimedia work, these pieces
                continued to rely on the computer screen as a space for composition. Since my work
                draws much inspiration from the work of concrete and dirty concrete poets, my poems
                rely on the <quote rend="inline" source="#funkhouser2007">shaping of the poem [as]
                    an embodiment of its content,</quote> or in some cases as the foil of its
                content <ptr target="#funkhouser2007" loc="13"/>. This qualifies my work as what
                Christopher Funkhouser names static visual digital poetry. He states that <cit>
                    <quote rend="block" source="#funkhouser2007">Static works – or poems that do not
                        move – are made from one of two distinct approaches: they are either shaped
                        by an artist (presented to readers in print or in an exhibition setting) or
                        built as viewer-activated work (viewed onscreen or printed out). Digitally
                        rendered poems portray at least three different traits: words are arranged
                        into literal shapes; words show patterns that represent dispersal or
                        displacement of language; or words are combined with images (as in a
                        collage). </quote>
                    <ptr target="#funkhouser2007"/>
                </cit></p>
            <p>I shaped my work as a static presentation, meant to be viewed, not altered, by the
                reader. The <q>literal shape</q> of my compositions alters the way in which the
                reader engages with both the text and image, and draws attention to how form and
                content intertwine. Rather than simply reading the words that make up my
                compositions, a reader must grapple with the shape the poem has taken. According to
                Funkhouser, the diverse body of static visual poetry relies on both shape and text
                in its composition, but engages with the visual and textual in widely different
                    ways.<note>For example, in David Daniels’ work <title rend="quotes">The Flying
                        High Tail Longhorn Gate</title> from his collection <title rend="italic">The
                        Gates of Paradise</title>, the shape of his poem inextricably intertwines
                    with and, arguably, dictates the content of his poems. <figure>

                    </figure>
                </note> My own work expands on the body of currently existing visual digital poetry,
                through my method of selecting and arranging textual material. </p>
            <p> On the most basic level, my poems purposefully layer media to deconstruct the
                marketed purpose of their medium (Word Processor). Their new construction creates a
                place where printed advertisements, physical objects, producer intentions, interface
                restrictions, and user creativities collide. First and foremost, my poems undermine
                the comfortable and familiar constraints of the word processor. Instead of using
                Word to compose the expected products (8.5 x 11 inch page after page), I imitate
                hacker-typewriter artists of the dirty concrete movement like Steve McCaffrey, bp
                Nichol, John Riddell, and Robert Zend, who relied on the grid of the typewriter page
                as a canvas for their creations. Much like these authors reimagined the grid of the
                typewriter page as a place where typographical rules might or might not apply, I
                envision the digital page as a place for something other than prose
                compositions.</p>
            <p>In my own compositions, I draw attention to the limitations and requirements of the
                computer as media and the word processor as a program, when it is obeyed. As I
                deviate from the expected format, a remarkable number of red, green, or blue
                squiggly lines alert that my composition has not behaved well. Spellchecking and
                grammar warnings initially mar these reconstructions. Becoming an unfriendly user, I
                click through layers of menus and disable the bulk of the surface-level constraints
                Microsoft Word imposes and continue composing.</p>
            <p> Distributers prime consumers to be receptive to their product long before it is ever
                in their hands. That is, consumers use a product in the way producers instruct them
                to use it; they color within the lines. In order to simplify production, minimize
                user error, protect copyrights, and make money, producers standardize not only their
                products, but also the marketed uses of these products. They eliminate access to the
                product’s inner workings to promote only particular utilization of the machine. They
                teach their consumers obedience, which <title rend="italic">The Oxford English
                    Dictionary</title> defines as <cit>
                    <quote rend="inline" source="#obedience">compliance with or performance of a
                        command, law, etc.</quote>
                    <ptr target="#obedience"/>
                </cit>. The producers of a machine rely on the willingness of its customers to
                comply with the marketed use of the machine and its applications, in order to
                achieve a product that universally appeals. </p>
            <p> By disobeying machines' prompts, a creator can use constraints as a source of
                inspiration to rediscover a space for creativity that has long been ignored, in lieu
                of mass-marketed, user-friendly technology. My compositions criticize the media’s
                self-promoted user-friendliness by using its original product advertising as the
                foundation of each poem. I reassemble old advertisements, articles, and instruction
                manuals in the two dimensional shape of the product on the pages of a word
                processor. Visual icons and rhetorical devices, meant to seduce the user into
                    <q>properly</q> using this newly available technology, confront the user in this
                new construction, which takes shape in a program intended for prose-like
                compositions. In <title rend="italic">Media Parasites in the Early
                    Avant-Garde</title>, Arndt Niebisch informs that the <quote rend="inline"
                    source="#niebisch2012">abuse of media</quote> requires one to <cit>
                    <quote rend="inline" source="#niebisch2012">(ab)use media technologies… in the
                        system in a way not intended by hegemonic powers</quote>
                    <ptr target="#niebisch2012"/>
                </cit>. Rather than conforming to the expectations of the digital page, one ought to
                defy them. This deliberate, albeit limited, subversion demonstrates the author’s
                awareness of processes behind the most accessible interface. Working against these
                constraints creates opportunities to think critically in forgotten, invisible
                spaces, and to shirk off the often unacknowledged influences of user-friendly.</p>
            <p> But why resist these constraints in this way? Well-meaning producers of products,
                who want to sell lots and lots of their products, inhibit (intentionally or
                unintentionally) the creative uses of their products by stressing their
                user-friendliness and cutting off the user’s access to the product’s inner workings.
                Although this logic follows from a marketing standpoint (why <emph>not</emph>
                protect the interests of the company through copyrights and closing off the
                system?), it involuntarily circumvents the machine’s processes, writing them off as
                necessary and seamless. The old adage, <q>It’s about the journey, not the
                    destination</q> surprisingly simplifies what should be obvious to the consumer.
                In always skipping to the end, the user misses opportunities for creation and
                innovation. In his chapter <title rend="quotes">The Unworkable Interface</title>,
                Alexander Galloway revises McLuhan’s idea that the <quote rend="inline" source="#galloway2012"
                    >medium is the message</quote>, writing: <cit>
                    <quote rend="block" source="#galloway2012"><p>Politics thus reveals why the door
                            or window theory of the interface is inadequate. The door-window model,
                            handed down from McLuhan, can only ever reveal one thing, that the
                            interface is a palimpsest. It can only ever reveal that the interface is
                            a reprocessing of some other media that came before. </p>
                        <p> On this point I will be absolutely clear; a palimpsest the interface may
                            be; yet it is still more useful to take the ultimate step, to suggest
                            that the layers of the palimpsest themselves are <q>data</q> that must
                            be interpreted. To this end, it is more useful to analyze the intraface
                            using the principle of parallel aesthetic events, and to claim that
                            these parallel events reveal something about the medium and about
                            contemporary life.</p></quote>

            <p>Galloway stresses the idea that each <q>layer</q> of the medium reveals something
                about the culture in which that medium exists. If we are to follow the layers of
                traces that he describes, then we should expect to access some essential truth by
                sifting through the effaced, the constructed, and the erased. The fact is, consumers
                have been taught to accept that there is nothing to excavate below the surface of
                the GUI. The GUI masks the product’s processes under the guise of facilitation, not
                inhibition. Does this make the processes and programs of our computers and smart
                phones faster and more accessible? Sure. Do users feel like unimpeded, even
                liberated, creators, who need not be bogged down with the particulars of messy
                programming? Mostly. However, this compulsory system, which reveals nothing to the
                vast majority of users about what happens between input A and output Z, provides
                almost no opportunity for an individual who might find meaning in what occurs in
                between. That space is a missed opportunity to create, expand, and innovate, if the
                user is willing to fight the system rather than merely conform to conditioned
                expectations.</p>
            <p> Fighting the system is difficult, especially when the producers of the systems are
                working hard to make working with their products seem effortless. Galloway describes
                the artistic impulse of these programmers, stating <cit>
                    <quote rend="inline" source="#galloway2012">Today’s ludic capitalist is
                        therefore the consummate poet-designer, forever coaxing new value out of
                        raw, systemic interactions (consider the example of Google). And all the
                        rest has changed to follow the same rubric: labor itself is now play, just
                        as play becomes more and more laborious […]</quote>
                    <ptr target="#galloway2012" loc="29"/>
                </cit>. The overlap of work and play conflate our society’s ideas about the
                boundaries of those two worlds. To take Galloway’s example of Google further, if he
                is correct, then the makers of Google’s seemingly infinite algorithms, maps, search
                engines, etc. are the ultimate magicians. The data-mining, the prioritization of
                information, the masking of processes all disappear behind the blank white search
                page of Google. When users play, they supply user-generated content that producers
                need to develop and market a new product back to that very consumer. These moments
                of play become essential to development, production, and consumption. These
                interactions are camouflaged in the most accessible interface. As consumers, we
                consume the simplicity of the product. </p>
            <p> I designed my poems as easy to view, but tricky to read. The in-your-face simplicity
                of the GUI functions in a similar way. These compositions emphasize the presence of
                a GUI in the <q>user-friendly.</q> They are products of the program in which (and
                artifacts from which) they were composed. If the observer interacts only
                superficially, casually observing the image with no interrogation of the words, the
                item remains <q>user-friendly.</q> It appears a jumbled amalgamation of letters that
                presents a cohesive picture. With this approach, the composition remains merely
                visual, masking the meaning of its text. However, as the reader transitions to
                reading the project actively, work becomes vital to discovering what occurs
                underneath the most accessible interface. To marry the meaning of the text with the
                visual image it constructs, the reader must link words across gaps and lines,
                unearthing meaning along the way. The process of reading is necessarily enhanced and
                disrupted by the visual form of the composition. Funkhouser describes the experience
                of reading static visual digital poetry, stating <cit>
                    <quote rend="inline" source="#funkhouser2007">Reading the embedded text is not
                        as fluid an experience as reading it on a blank page without visual
                        distraction. Readers are more likely to scan the compacted version,
                        receiving the language in bits and pieces</quote>
                    <ptr target="#funkhouser2007"/>
                </cit>. This method of excavation rewards readers, as they work to link shape and
                content. In my compositions, this process reveals history about the product and its
                marketing. Much like Galloway’s layers of the medium, each layer of these
                compositions shows how producers portrayed, marketed, and utilized these machines.
                Moreover, the marketed uses of these first computers contrast starkly with the
                black-boxed programming inherent in many devices today.</p>

            <p>In my composition <title rend="quotes">Simplicity (Apple II),</title> I focus on
                Apple's marketed simplicity: simple design, simple to use, and simple to purchase.
                When Steve Jobs introduced the Apple Macintosh in 1984, he designed his product with
                    <q>user-friendly</q> in mind. The Macintosh was the first personal computer
                marketed specifically for the masses. The Macintosh features a GUI, which allows the
                user to initiate computer processes by using a mouse to navigate the visual images
                on a virtual desktop, in lieu of textual commands.<note>Doug Engelbart, inventor of
                    the mouse, created the keyset in the 1960s. This device, although initially
                    difficult to use, allowed individuals to manage both the functions of the
                    keyboard and the mouse, without needing to physically move their hands from one
                    to the other. Engelbart’s focus was to amplify the user’s control of the
                    computer’s capabilities. He envisioned the keyset as essential to unlocking the
                    potential of the computer. However, when Steve Jobs encountered both the keyset
                    and the mouse in 1979, he selected the mouse for use at Apple. He preferred the
                    mouse, because it required far less instruction, and therefore time, to learn to
                    use. The mouse was ultimately the <q>user-friendly</q> option <ptr
                        target="#mars2015"/>.</note> These substitutions allowed a user to master
                the machine with minimal training. For the shape of the poem, I imitate the profile
                of the Apple IIe that is on the cover of its user manual (see fig. 2). This
                photograph is white and tan, a single finger hovers over the keyboard. This image,
                reminiscent of Michelangelo’s <title rend="quotes">The Creation of Adam</title>
                suggests that humans have now stepped into the ultimate role of creator. This
                machine is developed as a divine extension of our own selves. For the text, I draw
                from three advertisements (Figures 3, 4, and 5). Each of these texts boasts the
                sophistication, user-friendliness, and simplicity of the machine. For example, in
                    <title rend="quotes">How to buy a personal computer,</title> the advertisement
                states that <cit>
                    <quote rend="block" source="#howto1979">And kids of all ages are finding how
                        much fun computers can be, and have no time for TV once they’ve discovered

                        place, owned by one of your neighbors. He’ll show you exactly what you can

                </cit> The machine is so simple that kids can use it. It is such fun that it can
                replace passive entertainment of the television. Just as Galloway earlier suggests,
                the lines between work and play overlap in this medium. Instead of elevating this
                machine to perform solely adults' work or minimize it as a venue only for play, the
                user is encouraged to search instruction on <quote rend="inline" source="#howto1979">exactly
                    what you can use a personal computer for[,]</quote> which includes programming,

                </cit>. Ironically, in this phase Apple celebrated Apple IIe as <cit>

                    <ptr target="#howto1979"/>
                </cit>. Shortly thereafter, Apple developed the Macintosh, which severely restricted
                the user's access to the system, starting a trend that made the GUI of its operating
                system nearly impermeable for the average user. </p>

            <p>In a blog post excerpt from the second chapter of her book <ref
                    target="http://loriemerson.net/2012/09/07/reading-writing-interfaces-book-project-description/"
                        ><title rend="italic">Reading Writing Interfaces: From the Digital to the
                        Bookbound</title></ref>, Lori Emerson outlines the effect of contemporary
                GUIs on the consumer. She points to the accepted and prevalent model, originating in
                the Macintosh, as a point of man’s exclusion from the functions of the machine,
                which the user accepts because of his illusion of control. She writes that: <cit>
                    <quote rend="block" source="#emerson2013"><q>user-friendly</q> now takes the
                        shape of keeping users steadfastly unaware and uninformed about how their
                        computers, their reading/writing interfaces, work let alone how they shape
                        and determine their access to knowledge and their ability to produce
                        knowledge. As Wendy Chun points out, the user-friendly system is one in
                        which users are, on the one hand, given the ability to <q>map, to zoom in and out, to manipulate, and to act</q>
                        but the result is a <q><emph>seemingly</emph>
                            sovereign individual</q> who is mostly a devoted consumer of
                        ready-made software and ready-made information whose framing and underlying
                        mechanisms we are not privy to. However, it’s not necessarily the GUI
                            <emph>per se</emph> that is responsible for the creation of Chun’s
                            <q><emph>seemingly</emph> sovereign
                            individual</q> but rather a particular philosophy of computing and
                        design underlying a model of the GUI that has become the standard for nearly
                        all interface design.</quote>
                    <ptr target="#emerson2013"/>
                </cit> Modern personal computers rely on the popularized GUI model to cultivate the
                consumer's superficial relationship with the product. Instead of the user imagining
                what a computer might do and programming it to do so, that individual surveys the
                list of available, ready-made programs and uses one for its intended function. A
                user, for example, might not understand how a search engine like Google shapes his
                experience of information. This user might equate a search on Google to searching
                the entire internet (or the entirety of human knowledge, for that matter). Because
                of this assumption, he remains unaware of websites Google excludes from its database
                and oblivious to how Google presents and privileges information. Furthermore, the
                user gains access to this database by responding to the keyword prompt Google's
                search engine requires. The <q>user-friendly</q> design shapes how the user searches
                and filters his experience of information. In spite of the seemingly infinite
                expanse of information presented, the program limits the creativity of the user and
                the diversity of the resultant information. Emerson explains that <cit>
                    <quote rend="inline" source="#emerson2013">Without a fully open, flexible, and
                        extensible architecture, the home computer becomes less a tool for learning
                        and creativity and more a tool for simply ‘handling information’</quote>
                    <ptr target="#emerson2013"/>
                </cit>. User-friendly transforms into a tool of unquestioning passivity. Its systems
                stifle originality. The system allows users to control, access, and move
                information, but it trains the user to react to prompts. The user composes on word
                processors, calculates in spreadsheets, and draws in <title rend="italic"
                    >Paint</title>. And, since the use of these machines saturate our society (at
                the time I composed this, I had a PC, a tablet, and a smart phone within three feet
                of me), it is natural that the habit of interacting with these machines increasingly
                influences users’ cognitive processes and patterns.</p>

            <p> The term user-friendly is of course loaded and slippery. It derives from consumer
                desires and creator requirements. Consumers want to be masters of their machines
                without feeling dumb or discouraged. Moreover, many resist investing the time,
                energy, or attention it requires to become experts. Computer corporations devote
                themselves to creating user-friendly GUIs and programs for their devices, which make
                the consumer believe that they control their product and that the device empowers
                the consumer. Creators construct the glossy illusion of user-friendly with intense
                labor. In a 1995 issue of <title rend="italic">Forbes</title>, an article titled
                    <title rend="quotes">New Hope for Computer Illiterates</title> cites the general
                manager of IBM personal systems division Richard Thoman's estimate that one in three

                </cit>. This overwhelming failure rate motivated creators of personal computers to
                improve how the consumer both interacts with computers and anticipates interacting
                with computers.</p>

            <p>In order to create this type of system, which runs more efficiently and is therefore
                more universally user-friendly, the system of variables must be closed. Creators
                need to standardize the production of computers and their components and relegate
                users to their place as interchangeable parts of the system. The concept of
                conforming to new media rather than controlling it, although cultivated in computing
                in the 1980s and 90s, has been an element of how mankind experiences media for as
                long as media have existed. Systems of writing, paper, and writing utensils
                standardize written language. Humans, as consumers over time, become increasingly
                passive in mediatic participation, especially as systems become more complex. In
                Jonathan Crary’s essay <title rend="quotes">Techniques of the Observer,</title> he
                discusses Sir David Brewster’s kaleidoscope, which was invented in 1815. According
                to Crary, Brewster views <quote rend="inline" source="#crary1988">productivity and
                    efficiency</quote> as essential to this visual machine (Brewster, cited in <ptr
                    target="#crary1988"/>). More importantly, he considers it a <quote rend="inline"
                    source="#crary1988">mechanical means for the reformation of art according to
                    an industrial paradigm</quote> (Brewster, cited in <ptr target="#crary1988"
                    loc="22"/>). The resultant art form, a reflection and collection of still
                images, orders seemingly common objects into a beautiful narrative. As the observer
                interacts with the machine, minimal work creates endlessly original forms to admire.
                This action and its product is, of course, limited. For the machine to function
                properly, the user maintains distance from the inner workings and plays the role
                expected by the designer. Evolving visual and industrial technologies require users
                to play a specific part in the functioning of the machine. </p>
            <p>No longer the maker, the user becomes an element of the apparatus, a cog in the
                machine. Crary justifies this move by applying Marxist theory to elucidate
                human-machine relationships, <cit>
                    <quote rend="inline" source="#crary1988">In the factory, Marx contend[s], the
                        machine makes use of man by subjecting him to a relation of contiguity, of
                        part to other parts, and of exchangeability… the apparently passive
                        observers of the stereoscope and Phenakistiscope were in fact made into
                        producers, by virtue of specific physical capacities, of forms of
                        verisimilitude</quote>
                    <ptr target="#crary1988" loc="33"/>
                </cit>. By becoming necessary not to the functioning, but to the purpose of the
                machine, the user becomes part of the machine itself. In order to create the artwork
                these machines were designed to produce, the user must actively contribute. That is,
                the observer must work to observe. The consumer continually embraces illusions,
                which deceive him into thinking he maintains control: <cit>
                    <quote rend="inline" source="#crary1988">An apparatus openly based on a
                        principle of disparity […] inevitably would give way to a form that

                        it</quote>
                    <ptr target="#crary1988" loc="35"/>
                </cit>. The user depends on the illusion of natural, human privilege to structure
                his consumer existence. For our current society, the ways in which consumers want
                and expect the quick, accessible, and <q>user-friendly</q> still denote these
                individuals as components of the machine. They become increasingly dependent on
                technologies as self-explanatory extensions of themselves. Users engage with digital
                technology in much the same way that the observer engages with the phenakistiscope.
                In both cases, the user works as an element of the machine in order to produce
                beautiful objects that are limited by the medium of their creation. </p>
            <p>No one exemplifies how to defy the limits a medium, using its constraints as a source
                of inspiration, better than the makers of concrete poetry. Concrete poetry became
                internationally significant beginning in the 1950s. In her seminal work entitled
                    <title rend="italic">Concrete Poetry: A World View</title>, published in 1968,
                Mary Ellen Solt traces the emergence of concrete poetry on the international stage.
                The movement originated simultaneously in Switzerland, with poet Eugen Gomringer,
                and in Brazil, with the Noigandres group. In her introduction, Solt offers a broad
                definition of concrete poetry: <cit>
                    <quote rend="block" source="#solt1968">Generally speaking the material of the
                        concrete poem is language: words reduced to their elements of letters (to
                        see) syllables (to hear). Some concrete poets stay with whole words. Others
                        find fragments of letters or individual speech sounds more suited to their
                        needs. The essential is reduced language... the concrete poet is concerned
                        with establishing his linguistic materials in a new relationship to space
                        (the page or its equivalent) and/or to time (abandoning the old linear
                        measure). Put another way this means the concrete poet is concerned with
                        making an object to be perceived rather than read. The visual poem is
                        intended to be seen like a painting; the sound poem is composed to be
                        listened to like music. Concrete poets, then, are united in their efforts to
                        make objects or compositions of sounds from particular materials.</quote>
                    <ptr target="#solt1968"/>
                </cit> Concrete poetry breaks with traditional forms set out by canonical poetry and
                constructs previously uncharted structures on the page. Juri Valoch, a
                Czechoslovakian poet, states that concrete poetry permits <quote rend="inline"
                    source="#solt1968">as much freedom as possible</quote> and that the concrete
                poet’s goal is <quote rend="inline" source="#solt1968">to move as far as possible
                    from traditional poetry</quote> and write his <quote rend="inline"
                    source="#solt1968">own things, unhampered, yet with a sense of form</quote>
                (Valoch, cited in <ptr target="#solt1968"/>). This focus on structure occupies the
                focus of the artist, but form must be of the artist’s own creation, uninhibited by
                the formalities and expectations of the existing canon of literature. The concrete
                poets revise what it means to compose. They rethink and revise the literary,
                historical, and media expectations in order to create a space for their own creative
                imaginations to flourish. In <title rend="italic">Culture is Our Business</title>,
                McLuhan describes creative composers as the ultimate visionaries. He writes that <cit>
                    <quote rend="inline" source="#mcluhan1970">Poets and artists live on frontiers.
                        They have no feedback, only feedforward. They have no identities. They are

                    <ptr target="#mcluhan1970" loc="44"/>
                </cit>. These individuals, like their work, accept no boundaries. Concrete poets
                compose with multimedia, often appealing in diverse ways (through writing, sound,
                and sight), in what the Noigandres refer to as <quote rend="inline"
                    source="#solt1968">verbivocovisual.</quote> These <quote rend="inline"
                    source="#solt1968">experimental</quote> poems serve <quote rend="inline"

                (Ernst Jandl, cited in <ptr target="#solt1968"/>). The authors of these often
                intense compositions use concrete methodology to reject prescribed methods of
                creative thinking. </p>
            <p> The typewriter fulfilled a central role to authors' rising interest in composing
                concrete poetry. Charles Olsen describes the appeal of the technology, <quote
                    rend="inline" source="#solt1968">It is the advantage of the typewriter that,
                    due to its rigidity and its space precisions, it can, for a poet, indicate
                    exactly the breath, the pauses, the suspensions even of syllables, the
                    juxtapositions even of parts of phrases, which he intends</quote> (Olsen, cited
                in <ptr target="#solt1968"/>). Emerson writes that the pervasiveness of the
                typewriter made it <cit>
                    <quote rend="inline" source="#emerson2014b">invisible to its users. The point at
                        which a technology saturates a culture is the point at which writers and

                        begin to break apart that same technology to once again draw attention to
                        the way in which it offers certain limits and possibilities to thought and

                    <ptr target="#emerson2014b"/>
                </cit>. Poet Ronal Johnson supports Emerson's theory, when he admits, <quote
                    rend="inline" source="#solt1968">As I am unable to think except on the
                    typewriter, my poems have been, from the beginning, all 8 1/2" X 11</quote>
                (Johnson, cited in <ptr target="#solt1968"/>). The ever-present typewriter so
                completely permeates this time period that concrete poets, resisting the formalism
                inherent in the tradition of the poem, come to reject the normalized use of the
                typewriter, too. Instead of obeying the restrictions of the grid, they disrupt the
                expected pattern to draw attention to their intentional misuse of the apparatus.</p>
            <p> In spite of this radical refusal of traditional verse, concrete poetry attracted
                attention as being overtly academic and excessively <q>clean.</q> bp Nichol coined
                the phrase <quote rend="inline" source="#emerson2014b">dirty concrete</quote> to

                poetry or even Solt's suggestion that a generalized definition exists, dirty

            <p> The ever-present PC, in many ways, parallels the presence of the typewriter in the
                1950s, 60s and 70s, which led artists to experiment with the grid-like form of
                mechanical type to create concrete poetry. Perhaps the most obvious reincarnation of
                these dirty typewriter artists and their goals is through glitch art. Glitch art or
                glitch aesthetics has its roots in the most basic malfunctioning of electronic
                equipment (glitch). Its aesthetics reside in those moments when the digital, visual,
                or auditory performs in unexpected ways: the <q>wrong</q> colors, extreme
                pixilation, a skipping recording, an alien-like photo, an upside-down video, a link
                that leads nowhere, etc. Glitch aesthetics, then, as Emerson explains it in <title
                    rend="italic">The John Hopkins Guide to Digital Media</title>, <cit>
                    <quote rend="inline" source="#emerson2014a">involves experimentation with the

                anxiety-producing, behaviors of technology as the foundation of their art form. That

                something other than the standard, anticipated construct of the GUI. </p>
            <p> Disobeying through art, especially digital art, is nothing new. Art collective JODI,
                comprised of Joan Heemskerk and Dirk Paesmans, chose the Internet as its medium in
                the mid-1990s and, since then, have built one of the most expansive collections of
                digital art, radicalizing what is expected, respected, and produced. JODI revels in
                the inconstancy of technology and machines. Its creators juxtapose any number of
                tools (glitch art, unseen hyperlinks, familiar formatting, uncomfortably distorted
                interfaces, etc.) with the user's expectations for what the interface should do.
                They masterfully and unpredictably upset those expectations. On March 17, 1999,

                        with a little trash can bottom right, pull-down menus, scroll bars, system
                        icons. With its 'interface in your face' approach, the website of jodi.org
                        might be an antidote to our obliviousness to interface
                        standardization</quote>
                    <ptr target="#jodi1999"/>
                </cit>. Users have been so successfully trained to interact with their machines that
                responding to the interface requires hardly any concentration. It is second-nature.
                As true as Paul’s observation of the commonplace, invisible interface was in 1999,
                how much more so might it be today? In this age of smart phones, tablets, laptops,
                and (increasingly) wearables, the pervasiveness and touted user-friendly,
                self-explanatory nature of these multi-media devices has become the norm for any who
                can afford it and many who cannot. Perhaps Paul is correct, maybe our society needs
                JODI to draw attention to the processes in which the user partakes. When a user
                clicks <q>I Agree</q> under a <q>User Agreement,</q> the system is not supposed to
                shut down (as it inevitably will at <ref target="http://wwwwwwwww.jodi.org"
                    >wwwwwwwww.jodi.org</ref>). When the user mouses over nothing, that mouse should
                not encounter a hyperlink. That very hyperlink should, the user is taught, direct
                the computer’s flow to a new, recognizable interface.</p>
            <p> JODI does not subscribe to these <q>shoulds,</q> rather they revel in glitch to
                disrupt the user’s passive compliance to their machines. In <title rend="italic"
                    >Technology and Industry News – Chicago</title>, tech-artist Nick Briz explains
                that <cit>
                    <quote rend="inline" source="#briz2011">Where technology attempts to be
                        transparent and nonintrusive, JODI makes it obvious, abrupt, unsettling,
                        confusing</quote>
                    <ptr target="#briz2011"/>
                </cit>. As JODI provides opportunities for an individual to toy with their
                creations, they interrupt the user’s expectations of the interface. The user must
                confront the idea that the apparent transparency of the taken-for-granted GUI is
                actually a disguise for many complicated processes, which lie beneath the surface of
                the interface and which overtly shape what the user creates. When a user encounters
                JODI’s work, that individual is made <cit>
                    <quote rend="inline" source="#briz2011">forcefully aware of the role technology
                        is playing in [his/her] relationship to the world (or at the very least

                    <ptr target="#briz2011"/>
                </cit>. Through their disruption of the norm, JODI highlights how distant the user
                is from what happens behind the interface.</p>
            <p>To distract the user from his or her ignorance of a device’s inner workings,
                manufacturers place humanity at the center of a device’s advertising. My <title
                    rend="quotes">iPhone</title> composition shows how the element of community
                became central to <q>iPhone mania.</q> Unlike my previous compositions, I drew the
                text for this poem from Rob Kelley’s article, titled <title rend="quotes">iPhone
                    mania hits flagship stores</title>
                <ptr target="#kelley2007"/>. This piece hearkens back to the human qualities Apple
                began to emphasize with Lisa. Instead of recognizing this device as an extension of
                an individual’s cognitive and creative abilities, the iPhone morphed into a promise
                of <q>connectedness</q> and community. Although smart phones supply knowledge at the
                swipe of a finger, they (more importantly) reconnect the isolated with the
                community. Kelley points out that when this new technology (the iPhone) came out,
                individuals lined the streets for days in advance. However, the technical prowess of
                the machine was rarely the focus: <cit>
                    <quote rend="block" source="#kelley2007">At the Apple Store on Manhattan's tony
                        Fifth Avenue, the man who was fifth in line was planning to propose to his
                        girlfriend with a ring and an iPhone. For lunch Friday, a 44 year-old
                        graphic designer who was No.88 in line, ordered foie gras and sparkling
                        lemonade delivered. <said>Half the fun is the experience of the line,</said>
                        said Herman, adding that there was talk among the iPhone hopeful of having a

                    <ptr target="#kelley2007"/>
                </cit> This article points to engagements, shared meals, and celebrations, as the
                appeal of purchasing an iPhone. Although ease of use and technological capabilities
                certainly play a role in convincing consumers to purchase a device, it seems
                undeniable that the calculated inclusion of human capabilities, including social
                connectivity and individual creativity, remains central to the lure of these
                products.</p>

            <p>Considering Apple’s successes invoking humanity to market their technology, shouldn’t
                a move which allows for less-impeded creation be the next step? Rather than
                continuing the process of packaged, disjointed functions, creators
                    <emph>could</emph> unlock the interface for its users. They <emph>could</emph>
                design more flexible, penetrable programs. By opting for transparency in the GUI,
                allowing their users to meddle and make mistakes, developers could remove some
                obstacles to creative production, which have been in place for decades.</p>
            <p>In spite of my criticisms, I do not suggest personal computing would be better off
                without user-friendly programs or GUIs. In fact, I doubt that a realistic
                alternative to user-friendly currently exists. In some way or another, every device
                since the beginning of time has appealed to its user for the purpose of being (often
                easily) used. My aim in producing this work is not rejection of our computers’
                limitations, but awareness. My compositions point to the creative space neglected by
                users as they blindly work in supposedly invisible interfaces. My poems encourage
                users to acknowledge how machines influence their thoughts and creations. The intent
                is to draw attention to the media of the composition and the constraints and
                expectations built into that program or interface. My work disobeys the prompts of
                the machine to emphasize what the user sacrifices for user-friendly. </p>
            <p>I acknowledge that my poems may not stir Apple, Microsoft, or any of the other
                technological monoliths to make the inner-workings of their products transparent and
                accessible. As the authors of <title rend="italic">Electronic Civil Disobedience
                    write</title>, <cit>
                    <quote rend="inline" source="#criticalart1997">Since revolution is not a viable
                        option, the negation of negation is the only realistic course of action.
                        After two centuries of revolution and near-revolution, one historical lesson
                        continually appears – authoritarian structure cannot be smashed; it can only

                </cit>. In a battle there is the effort of fighting. So, my goal is individual
                effective resistance: resisting machines’ default settings, denying information
                access, unearthing what goes on behind even the most basic programs, and thinking
                creatively outside the <q>page.</q> I hope to inspire the idea that, although
                functionality and user-friendliness are comfortable and convenient, they should not
                only be available at the cost of lock-boxed, streamlined, productive output.</p>
