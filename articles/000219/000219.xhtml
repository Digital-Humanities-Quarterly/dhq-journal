                  <p><cite class="title italic">Status Update</cite> is an ethnography about Silicon
                     Valley, Twitter, and the way that its residents use Twitter to oil the wheels of
                     late capitalism. The review finds much to like in Marwick's book: it is an
                     eloquent take-down of Silicon Valley culture and its pretense of being part of
                     the counter-culture while forwarding distinctly neo-liberal ends. But the review
                     also finds that Marwick has a tendency to "study up."
                     Her ethnography is so focused on Silicon Valley elites that it ignores how
                     people outside Silicon Valley produce and consume (and tweet about) digital
                     culture.

               <div class="ptext" id="p1">I recently read Alice Marwick’s <cite class="title italic">Status Update</cite> in which
                  she closely studies the political beliefs and social media habits of people in
                  Silicon Valley. It’s first and foremost a portrait about digital culture and the way
                  that digital culture shapes political belief. But it should also be interesting to
                  digital humanists who, to use Kathleen Fitzpatrick’s phrasing, ask "traditional kinds of humanities-oriented questions about
                  computing technologies"
                   [<a class="ref" href="#fitzpatrick2010">Fitzpatrick 2010</a>]. <cite class="title italic">Status Update</cite> is very much in this vein since
                  it examines how we use our tools and how, in turn, those tools shape
                  consciousness.
               </div>
               
               <div class="counter"><a href="#p2">2</a></div>
               <div class="ptext" id="p2">For Marwick, the main tool in question is Twitter, and as a way of a hands on
                  exercise while reading her book I decided to tweet her about it: 
                  <div id="figure01" class="figure">
                     <a href="resources/images/figure01.png" rel="external"><img src="resources/images/figure01.png" alt="" /></a>
                     
                     <div class="caption-no-label">
                        <div class="label">Figure 1. </div>
                     </div>
                  </div> Unfortunately, Marwick never responded to my tweets.
               </div>
               
               <div class="counter"><a href="#p3">3</a></div>
               <div class="ptext" id="p3">This Twitter tale underscores one of the central points that <cite class="title italic">Status Update</cite> is making: in Marwick’s view, social media users (or at
                  least the users she studied in the Bay Area) tweet not only to exchange information
                  but to increase their social capital. And in striving to increase their social
                  capital, they also participate in modeling and practicing the type of activities
                  that support neo-liberal economies that thrive on hustle. Building on an argument
                  first forwarded by Richard Barbrook and Andy Cameron in "The
                  Californian Ideology"
                  [<a class="ref" href="#barbrook1996">Barbrook and Cameron 1996</a>] Marwick contends that people involved in the Bay Area
                  "tech scene" ascribe to a set of neo-liberal beliefs that
                  give foundation and legitimacy to Silicon Valley entrepreneurial business practices.
                  On the surface, Silicon Valley presents itself as a counter culture that is
                  epitomized in the figure of Steve Jobs who had more than a few hippy predilections
                  including a vegan diet, youthful wanderings in India, and a [perhaps fatal] faith
                  in
                  the power of alternative medicine. But while Silicon Valley may take on
                  revolutionary and counter-cultural vestments, its more fundamental commitments are
                  to neoliberalism and its celebration of individuals who compete freely with one
                  another by selling and promoting themselves through markets. While these cultural
                  contradictions have been described by others besides Marwick (see for example Fred
                  Turner’s <cite class="title italic">From Counterculture to Cyberculture</cite>
                  [<a class="ref" href="#turner2006">Turner 2006</a>]), she ups the ante by arguing that these same
                  contradictions have been embedded in so-called "Web 2.0" social
                  media platforms. Marwick observes that many people in the Valley believe that these
                  platforms carry out democratic and egalitarian ends by facilitating connections and
                  by spreading information. While social media may do these things sometimes, in
                  Marwick’s view, its more salient function is that it allows people to use it for
                  self promotion, for enhancing status, and for displaying oneself to others. So in
                  tweeting, I too might have been "subjecting" myself to these same
                  questionable models of social behavior.

               <div class="counter"><a href="#p4">4</a></div>
               <div class="ptext" id="p4">As I was absorbing these points, I happened to tweet about them: 
                  <div id="figure02" class="figure">
                     <a href="resources/images/figure02.png" rel="external"><img src="resources/images/figure02.png" alt="" /></a>
                     
                     <div class="caption-no-label">
                        <div class="label">Figure 2. </div>
                     </div>
                  </div> At the time, my tweeting seemed like a benign act. I’d merely transferred
                  my habits of annotating books from the physical marginalia of the printed page, into
                  Twitter. But if you apply Marwick’s theoretical framework to this act, it takes on
                  a
                  darker, more disturbing character. To be sure, I’m performing a Status Update (e.g.
                  "Hey followers! I’m on page 6 of Marwick’s book and she’s
                  making a pretty cool point!"). But I’m also probably engaging in a more
                  competitive and performative act of updating (and promoting) my status (e.g. "Hey followers! Check out the erudite books I read! Retweet it and
                  maybe your followers will start following me").
               </div>
               
               <div class="counter"><a href="#p5">5</a></div>
               <div class="ptext" id="p5">While the second parenthetical is purposefully left unsaid when people tweet,
                  seasoned Twitter users are aware of it. And since we tolerate these types of
                  messages and produce some of our own, we’re turning ourselves into subjects that
                  model neo-liberal ideals of virtue. Marwick didn’t reply to this tweet either. I can
                  only speculate as to why but here are two possible explanations: internalized
                  neo-liberal subjectivity suggests that one's status wouldn't be enhanced by
                  connecting with me. Alternatively (and more positively), such an interaction would
                  give further unwelcome credence to neo-liberal models of the self.
               </div>
               
               <div class="counter"><a href="#p6">6</a></div>
               <div class="ptext" id="p6">In subsequent chapters on lifestreaming and self-branding, Marwick argues that the
                  performative self isn’t just a discrete behavior that people in Silicon Valley adopt
                  while using social media. Instead, it’s a behavior that pervades entire lives
                  whether individuals are working, playing or socializing. In a chapter titled "Self-Branding: The (Safe for Work) Self" Marwick traces how
                  inhabitants of Silicon Valley regard their entire lives as a brand that needs to be
                  groomed and managed for the workplace. And in a chapter titled "Lifestreaming: We Live In Public" she details how Silicon Valley social
                  media encourage its inhabitants to see themselves continually "through the gaze of others." In the aggregate, <cite class="title italic">Status Update</cite> is a compelling description of how some people in a
                  particular time, and a particular place, inhabit and navigate a neo-liberal world.
                  
               </div>
               
               <div class="counter"><a href="#p7">7</a></div>
               <div class="ptext" id="p7">It’s worth emphasizing the fact that Marwick is talking about a particular time and
                  a
                  particular place. Like any good ethnographer she tries to clarify the limits of her
                  study and the boundaries beyond which her analysis doesn’t reach. But as readers and
                  interested scholars, we want to know if the study scales. Can Marwick’s observations
                  be taken as a synecdoche of how the rest of us use social media? Have people who
                  live in other parts of the world succumbed as completely to a neo-liberal ethos as
                  the Valley has? Marwick presumes to be writing to an audience that extends beyond
                  the inhabitants of Silicon Valley. But whether that is true or not is an open
                  question.
               </div>
               
               <div class="counter"><a href="#p8">8</a></div>
               <div class="ptext" id="p8">Part of the answer to these questions lies in reviewing how others have studied
                  culture. As the anthropologist Laura Nader observed, in traditional ethnography,
                  anthropologists had a tendency to "study down"
                   [<a class="ref" href="#nader1972">Nader 1972</a>]. They took their craft to the ends of the earth, and instead of studying the
                  colonizers, they studied the colonized. Marwick has done the reverse. She is mostly
                  studying up. The book illustrates her using the rather regal twitter handle "@alicetiara," hobnobbing at the invitation-only conference
                  Google Zeitgeist, and flying to the expensive South By Southwest conference.
                  Elsewhere we see her cabbing to "an opulent hilltop event
                  space" for a Facebook party and agonizing over what to wear in front of
                  the step and repeat at the Webutante Ball. This isn’t to say that there’s something
                  inherently wrong in studying up. Elites too deserve study and the requirements of
                  participant observation (as anthropologists call it) probably justify the amount of
                  time Marwick devotes to glamming it up with the tech glitterati. But studying up,
                  just like studying down, has its limitations and they are on display here.
               </div>
               
               <div class="counter"><a href="#p9">9</a></div>
               <div class="ptext" id="p9">First, the elites who Marwick studies are mostly in the business of promoting,
                  selling, marketing and writing about technology. Yet the book spends little time
                  talking about how actual programmers and engineers feel about their position in the
                  mode of production. <cite class="title italic">Status Update</cite>, in other words,
                  focuses on the consumption of technology rather than its production. 
               </div>
               
               <div class="counter"><a href="#p10">10</a></div>
               <div class="ptext" id="p10">Second, <cite class="title italic">Status Update</cite> portrays a world where everyone is
                  on the make, where everyone has become outer directed, where the authentic self is
                  eclipsed by the edited self, and where everyone has become so consumed by
                  self-presentation that nothing is left but an edited self. To be fair to Marwick,
                  it’s possible that almost all modern individuals are outer directed and seek acclaim
                  from others. In the <cite class="title italic">Discourse on Inequality</cite>, Rousseau
                  postulates that this is simply a facet of becoming civilized [<a class="ref" href="#rousseau1992">Rousseau 1992</a>]. As such, perhaps <cite class="title italic">Status
                     Update</cite> is a mirror that reflects contemporary American life. Still, it’s
                  unlikely that individuals are outer-directed to the same degree or that it’s the
                  predominant mode of living in a world pervaded by digital culture. The social media
                  platforms after all were created by software engineers, who, according to an article
                  by Luis Capretz in the <cite class="title italic">International Journal of Computer
                     Studies</cite>
                  [<a class="ref" href="#capretz2003">Capretz 2003</a>], occupy the top introverted quadrants of the Myers
                  Briggs test. It’s not like programmers don’t occasionally want to bask in the
                  limelight. But programmers wouldn’t be programmers if they didn’t derive some of
                  their most enjoyable experiences from talking to machines rather than performing in
                  front of others.

                  subjected (or reshaped) the colonized. Marwick does a pretty good job of showing how
                  that has taken place in the Bay Area. Her study is replete with personal anecdotes
                  by people in Silicon Valley using social media that has been created in Silicon
                  Valley. But it’s an open question as to how much the ideology of the Valley has
                  colonized the rest of us. In particular, when the book suggests that neoliberal
                  ideology is part and parcel of whatever people have adopted when they subscribe to
                  Web 2.0 principles and Web 2.0 technologies, it makes an association that probably
                  doesn’t have that much traction outside Marwick's field site. The people who use the
                  term Web 2.0 these days are programmers and designers who refer to it when they are
                  trying to describe a rich user interface that is snappy and responsive. It has a
                  discrete meaning and its principles are subscribed to by programmers and designers
                  of many different political stripes. Some of them may be neoliberals but others –
                  especially those who are members of The Free Software Foundation -- are distinctly
                  not. <cite class="title italic">Status Update</cite>, however, glosses over this more
                  common usage of Web 2.0 and piles onto the phrase a set of politics that are not in
                  keeping with the way it is most commonly employed. This isn’t to say that Marwick
                  has invented her definition out of whole cloth. It is derived from the way Tim
                  O’Reilly and other elites of the Valley have tried to spin the term. But the
                  dissonance between her definition and the way it is used elsewhere illustrates the
                  fact that her study cannot be easily scaled. Put another way, Status Update may be
                  a
                  faithful portrait of life in the Valley. But we should be careful not to let that
                  portrait eclipse how technology is being produced and used in the hinterlands where
                  social media may be being repurposed for other ends besides status enhancement.

               <div class="ptext" id="p12">By studying up, <cite class="title italic">Status Update</cite> misses out on a large
                  segment of Web 2.0 producers and consumers and fails to describe the less
                  narcissistic ways that some of its members have chosen to integrate themselves into
                  late capitalism. If cyberspace was developed in Silicon Valley (and that proposition
                  might itself be a myth), its power base is diffusing rapidly across the world. To
                  document this digital culture, we’ll need to complement Marwick’s successes in
                  studying up with other ethnographies that "study out" and
                  "study down." Until then we won’t know whether or not the
                  colonizers have actually colonized the rest of us.

               <div class="ptext" id="p13">For scholars of the digital humanities these are important questions to be asking.
                  Marwick claims that digitization and the over-reach of social media has affected our
                  sense of what it means to be human in the era of late capitalism. She has certainly
                  made a compelling case that in Silicon Valley the sense of what it means to be human
                  is being reshaped by the technologies that Silicon Valley has itself created. But
                  for scholars in the digital humanities comparative case studies are needed. We
                  should be working hard to find out how applicable Marwick's thesis is in other parts
                  of the world.
