			<p>The ubiquity of the web has dramatically transformed scholarly communication. The
				shift toward digital publishing has brought great advantages, including an
				increased speed of knowledge dissemination and a greater uptake in open
				scholarship. There is also an increasing range of scholarly material being
				communicated and referenced. References have expanded beyond books and articles
				to include a broad array of assets consulted or created during the research
				process, such as datasets, social media content like tweets and blogs, and
				digital exhibitions. There are, however, numerous challenges posed by the
				transition to a constantly evolving digital scholarly infrastructure. This paper
				examines one of those challenges: link rot, which serves as a way towards
				understanding its corollary, reference rot. Link rot is likely most familiar in
				the form of <q>404 Not Found</q> error messages, but there are other less prominent
				obstacles to accessing web content. Our study examines instances of reference
				rot in <title rend="italic">Digital Humanities Quarterly</title> articles and its
				impact on the ability to access the online content referenced in these articles
				after their publication. We also look at the extent to which article references
				rely on links in order to gain a more complete understanding of the threat
				posed.</p>
			<p>This study provides an important step in assessing remediative actions as well as
				a broader examination of perceptions of cohesion and integrity in the digital
				humanities literature. As the Endings Project team mentions in their DH2019
				paper, <quote rend="quotes">HTML is the most popular standard output for DH projects,</quote> meaning that
				websites continue to be a key mechanism for delivering digital humanities (DH)
				outputs <ptr target="#arneil2019"/>. The ongoing costs and resources required to
				maintain and repair web-based DH outputs is well known, as shown by efforts such
				as the Endings Project and the Socio-Technical Sustainability Roadmap
				<ptr target="#sociotechnical"/> <ptr target="#ending2022"/>. Our research contributes to this area of
				knowledge from a particular angle: the impact on the stability of the DH
				scholarly record.</p></div>
			<div>
			<head>Literature Review</head>
			<p>Looking at the literature, we observe three main categories relevant to this
				article: theory of citation, evolving guidelines for proper citation, and
				studies of the practice of link preservation. Citation theory describes the
				continuous tug between the ideals of citation and the disciplinary
				administrative function of scholarly discourse <ptr target="#zuckerman1987"/>. Broadly
				speaking, a reference is a piece of information provided in a scholarly work
				that specifies the work of another person used in the creation of the former. A
				citation is a paraphrase, quotation or allusion to a source, a specific instance
				of a reference such as a paraphrase or quotation. The scholarly literature rests
				on the premise that citations and references exist to pay homage and give credit
				to prior work, to substantiate claims and maintain intellectual honesty, and to
				provide leads and background reading <ptr target="#garfield1994"/>. Consequently, if readers
				cannot access the referenced material, then they are unable to uphold these
				standards or corroborate the scholarly record. The arguments of individual
				articles are weakened, and the integrity of the scholarly literature is
				threatened. Recent efforts have contributed critical approaches to citation
				theory, such as citation justice, that seek to expand understanding of social
				systems of credit within academia <ptr target="#knowledgeequity"/>.</p>
			<p>Hyperlinks are a critical component of scholarly discourse in the digital era, and
				in the late 1990s and early 2000s, we see researchers beginning to adapt
				citation guidelines to accommodate new online resources. Janice Walker created
				MLA-Style Citations of Electronic Sources for referencing emerging formats such
				as Telnet, listservs, and video games <ptr target="#walker1995"/>, whereas Anita Greenhill and
				Gordon Fletcher sought to catalog citation recommendations in the World Wide Web
				Virtual Library <ptr target="#greenhill2003"/>, and the Library of
				Congress’s <q>Learning Page</q> demonstrates the concern for capturing appropriate
				links. Across disciplines, citation guidelines have grown to accommodate, and
				hustled to keep up with, shifts in web practices. As of the 7th edition, the APA
				Handbook (<ref target="#apa2020">2020</ref>) offers examples for 27 types of electronic
				resources, from websites to Wikipedia to datasets to podcasts. This range of
				electronic resources points to the widening understanding of viable source
				materials as well as the complex set of standards that authors and stewards of
				scholarly output must reconcile.</p>
			<p>In <title rend="quotes">Scholarly Context Not Found: One in Five Articles Suffers from Reference Rot,</title>
				<ptr target="#klein2014"/> studied science, technology, and medicine articles to
				document the extent of reference rot, which they define as a combination of link
				rot and content drift. They define content drift as a resource changing or
				evolving over time, up to the point where it no longer reflects the originally
				referenced content. Attributing the lagging system of link preservation to the
				swift adoption of web-based scholarly communications, the expanding capacity to
				reference different types of things, and the challenge of bridging digital
				reference systems and paper-based communications, the authors call for robust
				solutions to ensure integrity of the web-based scholarly record. To Klein and
				co-authors, the integrity of the link maintains the context necessary to ensure
				sound scholarship, for <quote rend="inline">as references rot or as the content they originally
				referred to changes, it becomes impossible to revisit the intellectual context
				that surrounded the referencing article at the time of its publication</quote> <ptr target="#klein2014"/>.</p>
				<p>Zhou et al. <ref target="#zhou2015">2015</ref> studied the persistence of web resource citations
				by developing a machine-learning model for assessing link rot in scholarly
				articles. They propose establishing a system of priority for archival
				preservation of links by proactively predicting links more prone to rot.
				<ptr target="#brunelle2015"/> attempt to measure the impact of missing
				resources through web user experience interviews that evaluate how the loss of
				embedded resources affects user trust in archived websites. The Hiberlink and
				Robust Links projects have contributed valuable research framing the problem of
				reference rot in the scholarly literature. While their recommendations rely on a
				specific set of digital publishing tools that has not yet been widely adopted
				across the academy, the project has contributed a more sophisticated
				understanding of how link preservation requires attending not only to the ideals
				of citation and web maintenance best practices but also to the social
				expectations concerning who is responsible for these linkages <ptr target="#robustify"/>.</p>
			<p>Our study joins these and others that have examined instances of link rot in the
				scholarly literature. Our aim here is not only to document the amount of link
				rot but also to understand the extent to which citations rely on links. To do so
				we also looked at the percentage of articles that contain links, the average
				number of links per article, and the percentage of citations that are links.
				Only two other studies to date have examined all of these topics together.
				<ptr target="#aronsky2007"/> examines PubMed articles immediately after
				publication, and <ptr target="#yang2010"/> provide a comprehensive study of
				Chinese humanities and social science journals. Several studies examine one or
				two of these topics, and are used in the Analysis section to contextualize our
				data and to understand how the DH literature compares to other disciplines.</p></div>
			<div>
			<head>Methodology</head>
			<p>Our study examines the prevalence of websites listed as citations in <title
					rend="italic">DHQ</title> articles and the status of those websites. <title
					rend="italic">DHQ</title> is one of the most long-standing, well known
				journals within the field of digital humanities and is listed in the Directory
				of Open Access Journals as well as indexed in the Clarivate Analytics <title rend="quotes">Emerging
					Sources Citation Index</title> <ptr target="#dhqabout"/>. All types of articles were included in
				the analysis (e.g. Introductions, Articles, Reviews) as each article type
				consistently contained references. Our analysis examined only citations
				appearing in the Works Cited section and excluded citations in the Notes section
				as well as in-text links. When analyzing an individual link, we manually opened
				the link in a new browser tab, observed any changes in the URL as the page
				loaded, and once the page loaded (or not) placed it into one of seven
				categories. In a small number of cases, the link was correctly displayed but the
				HTML code contained a minor formatting error. We chose to follow the (correctly)
				displayed link, under the assumption that a reader interested in following the
				citation would do the same. Beyond this, we did not perform any additional
				searching to track down if a page had been relocated or archived, since the
				object of study is the link as it appears in the citation. The browser
				environments used for analysis were free of ad blockers and similar browser
				extensions, which can significantly alter how URLs and pages perform. The
				analysis was performed in the United States, and we acknowledge that results
				will likely differ depending on geographic location due to Internet Protocol
				(IP) address restrictions.</p>
			<p>We examined articles published in <title rend="italic">DHQ</title> from its inception in
				2007 up to 2019. To make the data collection process more manageable, we used
				systematic sampling to determine which articles to analyze. Systematic sampling
				uses a fixed interval, and fits this particular dataset because the citations
				and links within the articles in <title rend="italic">DHQ</title> are sufficiently
				normally distributed. This method ensures even representation of the
				characteristics of the articles published per year that we want to observe
				(i.e., number of citations, number of links and working status of the links),
				which was important in allowing us to reliably track trends over time <ptr target="#hibberts2012"/>. Since the population size is known, we chose the sampling interval
				based on our desired confidence interval, 95%, and margin of error, 5%, for the
				proportion of citations that are links, assuming a variance of 25%. In order to
				achieve this, the target sample size would be 205 with a sampling interval of
				0.47. We rounded up the sample interval to 0.50, meaning that we analyzed every
				other article (226 total), which slightly improves the margin of error to 4.55%
				while maintaining the 95% confidence interval.1 We decided that defining the
				population as the total number of articles, rather than total number of
				citations, would better foster future re-use of the data set, which is openly
				available online <ptr target="#coble2021"/>.</p>
			<p>Each citation that appeared as a link in the sample was labeled using one of seven
				categories:</p>
			<p>
				<emph>Link resolves correctly</emph>:</p>
				<list rend="simple">
			<item>1. Page exists</item>
			<item>2. Redirected, to the same page</item></list>
			<p>
				<emph>Link does not resolve correctly</emph>:</p>
			<list rend="simple">
			<item>3. Page exists, but is different</item>
			<item>4. Redirected, to same site</item>
			<item>5. Redirected, but page or site is different</item>
			<item>6. Page does not exist, site exists</item>
			<item>7. Page does not exist, site does not exist</item></list>
			
			<div>
			<head>1. Page Exists</head>
			<p>The link resolves as expected and it resolves to a page with content that is
				clearly the cited source. This category includes Handles and DOIs, paywalled
				content with previews (e.g. <title rend="italic">New York Times</title>), and pages
				with SSL certificate issues that still resolve.</p></div>
			<div>
			<head>2. Redirected, to the same page</head>
			<p>The link redirects automatically and takes you to a page with content that is
				clearly the cited source. It is important to note that, for all categories,
				determinations of whether a page is the <emph>same</emph> or <emph>different</emph> are based primarily on clues given in the
				citation — most notably the page title, creator, and similar URL structure. Some
				assumptions were made based on information available, and this is a potential
				source of error in the study.</p></div>
				<div>
			<head>3. Page exists, but is different</head>
			<p>The link resolves but the page content is obviously and significantly different
				from what was cited, such as web technologies that are no longer supported by
				browsers (e.g. Abode Flash).</p></div>
				<div>
			<head>4. Redirected, to same site</head>
			<p>The link redirects, although the user is taken to a different page on the same
				top-level domain (typically the homepage) rather than the page specified in the
				citation. This outcome was common in cases where a site migration had occurred.
				Though this is not the most worrisome category, since the intended page often
				still exists and is findable with additional effort, technically speaking the
				link does not resolve correctly.</p></div>
				<div>
			<head>5. Redirected, but page or site is different</head>
			<p>Redirected to a page or site that is obviously and significantly different from
				the cited source.</p></div>
				<div>
			<head>6. Page does not exist, site exists</head>
			<p>The page no longer exists but the site it was part of still resolves. One
				challenge with our approach of differentiating a web page and a website is
				determining what exactly is the “site.” Practices can vary widely, particularly
				in citations of non-academic works, and we used discretion when it was obvious
				from contextual clues in the content and URL structure, otherwise we defaulted
				to using the top-level domain.</p></div>
				<div>
			<head>7. Page does not exist, site does not exist</head>
			<p>Neither the page nor the site it was part of still resolves. This is the most
				worrying category, as there is effectively no original trace left of the cited
				source. Such pages might be captured in the Internet Archive or other web
				archives, but that outcome was outside the scope of this study.</p></div>

			<p>Figure 1 breaks down this information by year, where the first column (in blue)
				shows the average number of total references (links and non-links) contained in
				the sampled articles published that year. For instance, on average, an article
				published in 2007 contains twenty-three citations, which includes both
				references to print sources and links to websites. This data was collected using
				web scraping and it maps onto the primary axis (i.e., the y axis on the left,
				with the range 0 - 45). The second column (in yellow) shows the percentage of
				citations that are links for that year. For example, for all sampled articles
				published in 2007, 32% of the citations are links. Conversely, 68% of the
				citations point to <q>non-website</q> sources, such as print materials, interviews,
				and other types of media. This number is calculated by dividing the total number
				of citations that are links by the total number of citations overall (links and
				non-links), and it maps onto the secondary axis (i.e., the y axis on the right,
				with the range 0% - 100%).</p>

			<p>We know that link rot exists on the web, and Figure 2 demonstrates that there is
				something significant at stake as it relates to the integrity of the DH
				literature. Within the sample, there are 596 works cited that are links that do
				not work correctly. This count means that 31% of citations containing links, and
				8.7% of all sampled citations, including non-link citations, no longer work
				correctly. Conversely, 69% of links still resolve to the cited source.</p>
			<p>These numbers become more troubling when compared to other disciplines. Table 3
				compares our data to other studies examining links that appear in references or
				works cited section and reveals that <title rend="italic">DHQ</title> has a comparable
				and relatively high percentage of link rot. Since we looked only at the works
				cited section, we excluded comparison studies that analyzed links in other
				areas, such as abstracts or entire articles.</p>

			<p>Compounding the threat of link rot is the extent to which references in the DH
				literature rely on internet resources. According to sampled data, 80% of
				articles in <title rend="italic">DHQ</title> contain at least one reference with a
				URL. As Table 4 indicates, this percentage is relatively high compared to other
				fields where data is available. Additionally, Table 5 shows that <title
					rend="italic">DHQ</title> articles contain an average of 8.5 links per
				article, which is significantly higher compared to other disciplines. This
				suggests that the problem of link rot is spread across a high proportion of
				articles. The higher frequency of links as citations indicates a greater
				reliance on links compared to other fields.</p>

			<p>There are some caveats to our findings. For instance, even if a link does not
				work, the page might still exist at a different link. The web is fluid, and our
				study is only a snapshot of a particular moment from a particular geographic
				location. Also, a broken link does not necessarily mean a non-existent page. A
				simple search could reveal the new URL, a site may only be temporarily
				unavailable, or it might be available in the Internet Archive or another web
				archive. A study of library and information science literature found that
				employing these two strategies decreased the rate of inaccessible URLs from 36%
				to 5% <ptr target="#sadatmoosavi2012"/>.</p></div>
			<div>
			<head>Discussion</head>
			<p>Our data shows that a significant number of works cited no longer exist, are
				inaccessible, or have additional barriers to access. Instances of link rot
				increase with time. Additionally, there is a higher frequency and higher
				proportion of links contained in <title rend="italic">DHQ</title> articles, showing
				that internet resources are a critical part of the DH literature. Taken
				together, the combined result is a persistent and cumulative threat to the
				integrity and stability of the DH literature, and one that is even more alarming
				when compared to other disciplines.</p>
			<p>Just as there are multiple causes of link rot, there is no single or simple
				solution to this threat. Here we revisit the three categories presented in the
				literature review to use as a framework for discussion: theory of citation,
				evolving guidelines for proper citation, and studies of the practice of link
				preservation. We focus on recent initiatives as well as overlooked aspects that
				we believe are worth greater attention.</p>
			<p>The area of citation theory has much potential for reframing our understanding of
				the problem. Many technical solutions have been proffered, but after almost
				three decades the problem of link rot is as persistent as ever and there has not
				yet emerged a convincing full-scale solution. Thus, perhaps we need new lenses
				through which to view this phenomenon. For instance, it may be worth revisiting
				the broad assumption that scholarly literature should be accessible for the long
				term. Put differently, are there wider epistemological shifts or perceptions
				toward academic systems of credit that are being reflected in our commitment to
				widening the scope of verifiable sources?</p>
				<p>In <title rend="italic">Digital Diaspora: A Race for Cyberspace</title> <ptr target="#everett2009"/>,
				Anna Everett lays out the critical ways a Black digital public sphere developed
				parallel to the white, masculinist domain of the early Internet. Kelly Baker
				Josephs and Roopika Risam continue this thread in their introduction to <title
					rend="italic">Digital Black Atlantic</title> <ptr target="#josephs2021"/> and work
				to name these digital spaces of resistance. Josephs and Risam, in pursuit of the
				objective <quote rend="inline">to create a provisional space and framework for academic conversation
				that could emerge by virtue of acts of citational and conceptual juxtaposition,</quote>
				gesture toward alternative acts of scholarly activation. Current pedagogies of
				writing also point to a shifting sense of how to cite sources. In <title rend="quotes">Web Writing
					and Citation: The Authority of Communities,</title> <ptr target="#switaj2015"/>, Elizabeth Switaj
				lists the variations on retweet (RT), modified tweet (MT), via, and hat-tip
				(h/t) that indicate a move on social media to gestural citation, its paths to
				conversation, and its social system of credit.</p>
			<p>The second area, guidelines for citation, has the potential for incremental
				improvements to the health of the scholarly record. For authors, Sadat-Moosavi et al. <ref target="#sadatmoosavi2012">2012</ref> suggest best practices for constructing links, such as citing
				documents in repositories (which typically use persistent identifiers) rather
				than private for-profit platforms such as Academia.edu and ResearchGate. When
				available, using persistent identifiers is a key practice. Of the 108 DOI links
				in our data, 107 resolved correctly (99.1%). Some publishers use DOIs in the URL
				string (e.g. <ref target="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/9781118680605.ch23">https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/9781118680605.ch23</ref>) but
				such links are not persistent (i.e. the persistent link is 
				<ref target="https://doi.org/10.1002/9781118680605.ch23">https://doi.org/10.1002/9781118680605.ch23</ref>). Seemingly minor details make a
				difference, and ideally such strategies would be more widely incorporated into
				citation manuals in an effort to provide authoritative guidance to
				researchers.</p>
			<p>There are a number of approaches to the third area, the practice of link
				preservation. Building on Aronsky et al. <ref target="#aronsky2007">2007</ref> finding that 12% of links in PubMed
				were already broken two days after publication, journals should incorporate
				link-checking as a regular part of the editorial process. Further, scanning all
				article links on a regular basis would make this work more manageable for
				journals and also help to identify patterns or issues specific to their field.
				Another option would be to implement measures such as those of the <title
					rend="italic">Review Journal of the IDE</title>, which also requires authors
				to use the Internet Archive’s <q>Save Page Now</q> service <ptr target="#ride"/> for referenced
				links. This helps ensure that a record exists of the site as it was originally
				referenced, which Jones et al. <ref target="#jones2021">2021</ref> identify as a core issue but one that is
				not inherently guaranteed by web archiving services such as the Internet
				Archive, Archive-It, or Conifer. The on-demand service Perma.cc was specifically
				designed to address reference rot by generating permanent links to affix web
				citations used in publishing <ptr target="#permacc"/>. Perma.cc comes the closest to
				providing a turnkey solution, although its approach is to replace the original
				resource with a replica. Each of these web archiving strategies show different
				approaches that can be employed by journals, although it is worth noting that
				they rely on external service providers.</p>
			<p>Finally, there are several recent initiatives providing resources for website
				creators and maintainers as well as a growing general awareness of the labor and
				craft required to build and sustain web-based DH outputs. Page-level redirects,
				or URL forwarding, is a proven and established technique for ensuring that links
				resolve correctly, and is particularly important when migrating a site or
				performing other updates that alter the URL structure of references. Best
				practices for this are thoughtfully articulated in Guidelines for Preserving New
				Forms of Scholarship <ptr target="#greenberg2021"/>.</p>
			<p>More broadly, the Socio-Technical Sustainability Roadmap gives a practical
				framework and holistic approach for the range of work involved in the entire
				lifecycle of a project <ptr target="#sociotechnical"/>. And the Endings Project has
				produced a valuable set of tools, principles, and body of knowledge that
				advances our ability to create <quote rend="inline">accessible, stable, long-lasting resources in
					the humanities</quote> <ptr target="#ending2022"/>. Additionally, <ptr target="#minimalNd"/> provides an
				ethos that undergirds this work, and tools like Wax directly put these
				principles into practice by generating static sites <ptr target="#minimalNd"/>
				<ptr target="#nyrop2021"/>. None of these will inherently ensure long-term access to websites,
				and it is crucial to acknowledge that all require real and sustained
				institutional investments in staff and technical resources (see the articles by
				Otis and Cummings in this issue). However, there is some room for optimism given
				the overlap and shared history between DH and scholarly communication <ptr target="#coble2014"/>. The practitioners of the latter, who share a keen interest in the
				stewardship of the scholarly record and have already taken great strides to
				address this phenomenon, are well positioned in terms of expertise and resources
				to continue these efforts. Taken together, they constitute an engaged community
				bringing necessary advancements to digital scholarly infrastructure.</p></div>
			<div>
			<head>Conclusion</head>
			<p>Scholarly discourse depends on the practice of referencing sources. Our study
				shows that over a quarter of sampled citations are links to websites. Over 30%
				of these references are inaccessible or have additional access barriers. When
				compared to other fields, articles in <title rend="italic">DHQ</title> contain the
				highest number of links per article, a high proportion of citations that are
				links, and a high proportion of articles that contain links. This problem is
				persistent and gets worse over time, creating a significant threat to the
				stability and integrity of the DH literature.</p>
			<p>Even when we acknowledge that link rot and content drift present a risk to the DH
				literature, it is worth exploring to what extent this is a problem. It is unwise
				to simply assert that all websites should be accessible forever. Rather, within
				the context of scholarly literature, we should consider what criteria or
				considerations would be helpful to better understand which sites require longer
				term access. Preserving the record of a resource does not inherently preserve
				access to that resource, and understanding the social expectations of citation
				practice within a given field should be taken into account as DH citations are
				created. Maintaining access to websites is different from maintaining links to
				those websites, and it is always worth emphasizing that implementing such
				approaches at scale requires significant investments of labor and resources from
				institutional coalitions of publishers, libraries, and archives.</p></div>
