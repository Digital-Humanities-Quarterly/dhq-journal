                  <p>The ubiquity of the web has dramatically transformed scholarly communication.
                     					The shift toward digital publishing has brought great advantages, including
                     					an increased speed of knowledge dissemination and a greater uptake in open
                     					scholarship. There is also an increasing range of scholarly material being
                     					communicated and referenced. References have expanded beyond books and
                     					articles to include a broad array of assets consulted or created during the
                     					research process, such as datasets, social media content like tweets and
                     					blogs, and digital exhibitions. There are, however, numerous challenges
                     					posed by the transition to a constantly evolving digital scholarly
                     					infrastructure. This paper examines one of those challenges: link rot. Link
                     					rot is likely most familiar in the form of “404 Not Found” error
                     					messages, but there are other less prominent obstacles to accessing web
                     					content. Our study examines instances of link rot in <cite class="title italic">Digital Humanities Quarterly</cite> articles and its impact on the
                     					ability to access the online content referenced in these articles after
                     					their publication.</p>

                     				studies of the practice of link preservation. Citation theory describes the
                     				continuous tug between the ideals of citation and the disciplinary
                     				administrative function of scholarly discourse <span class="error"><a class="ref" href="#zuckerman1987">#zuckerman1987</a></span>. Broadly
                     				speaking, a reference is a piece of information provided in a scholarly work
                     				that specifies the work of another person used in the creation of the former.
                     A
                     				citation is a paraphrase, quotation or allusion to a source, a specific instance
                     				of a reference such as a paraphrase or quotation. The scholarly literature rests
                     				on the premise that citations and references exist to pay homage and give credit
                     				to prior work, to substantiate claims and maintain intellectual honesty, and to
                     				provide leads and background reading <span class="error"><a class="ref" href="#garfield1994">#garfield1994</a></span>. Consequently, if readers
                     				cannot access the referenced material, then they are unable to uphold these
                     				standards or corroborate the scholarly record. The arguments of individual
                     				articles are weakened, and the integrity of the scholarly literature is
                     				threatened. Recent efforts have contributed critical approaches to citation
                     				theory, such as citation justice, that seek to expand understanding of social

                     				citation guidelines to accommodate new online resources. Janice Walker created

                     				document the extent of reference rot, which they define as a combination of link
                     				rot and content drift. They define content drift as a resource changing or
                     				evolving over time, up to the point where it no longer reflects the originally
                     				referenced content. Attributing the lagging system of link preservation to the
                     				swift adoption of web-based scholarly communications, the expanding capacity to
                     				reference different types of things, and the challenge of bridging digital

                     				2007 up to 2019. To make the data collection process more manageable, we used
                     				systematic sampling to determine which articles to analyze. Systematic sampling
                     				uses a fixed interval, and fits this particular dataset because the citations
                     				and links within the articles in <cite class="title italic">DHQ</cite> are sufficiently
                     				normally distributed. This method ensures even representation of the
                     				characteristics of the articles published per year that we want to observe
                     				(i.e., number of citations, number of links and working status of the links),
                     				which was important in allowing us to reliably track trends over time <span class="error"><a class="ref" href="#hibberts2012">#hibberts2012</a></span>. Since the population size is known, we chose the sampling interval
                     				based on our desired confidence interval, 95%, and margin of error, 5%, for the
                     				proportion of citations that are links, assuming a variance of 25%. In order to
                     				achieve this, the target sample size would be 205 with a sampling interval of
                     				0.47. We rounded up the sample interval to 0.50, meaning that we analyzed every
                     				other article (226 total), which slightly improves the margin of error to 4.55%
                     				while maintaining the 95% confidence interval.1 We decided that defining the
                     				population as the total number of articles, rather than total number of
                     				citations, would better foster future re-use of the data set, which is openly
                     				available online [<a class="ref" href="#coble2021">Coble and Karlin 2021</a>].</div>

                     to
                     				the cited source). The sections in green represent links that do not work
                     				correctly (i.e., the link does not resolve to the cited source). While the data

                     				literature rely on internet resources. According to sampled data, 80% of
                     				articles in <cite class="title italic">DHQ</cite> contain at least one reference with a
                     				URL. As Table 4 indicates, this percentage is relatively high compared to other
                     				fields where data is available. Additionally, Table 5 shows that <cite class="title italic">DHQ</cite> articles contain an average of 8.5 links per
                     				article, which is significantly higher compared to other disciplines. This
                     				suggests that the problem of link rot is spread across a high proportion of
                     				articles. The higher frequency of links as citations indicates a greater
