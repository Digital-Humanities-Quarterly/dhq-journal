                  <p>In <span class="hi italic">Computing Taste</span>, Nick Seaver conducts an anthropological
                     study of the technologists who design algorithmic music recommendation systems. He
                     explores their ways of thinking and talking about music, taste, and computation to
                     better understand their technological design approaches. By highlighting the humans
                     behind the machines, <span class="hi italic">Computing Taste</span> shows how to think about

                     people listen to music. Those services do much more than just provide access to
                     massive searchable libraries; they actively shape what users listen to via their
                     recommendation systems. Music recommendation comes in many forms, from basic
                     suggestions to playlists to personalized “radio stations,” all of which now rely on
                     algorithmic computing technologies. Much has been written about how those
                     technologies have transformed the media landscape and have created significant
                     issues for users [e.g., [<a class="ref" href="#gaw2022">Gaw 2022</a>]; [<a class="ref" href="#pajkovic2022">Pajkovic 2022</a>]] as well as creators [e.g., [<a class="ref" href="#giblin_doctorow2022">Giblin and Doctorow 2022</a>]].

                     lies within those conversations, but approaches the space from a different angle.
                     Rather than offer yet another social critique of the modern state of algorithmic
                     recommendation, Seaver focuses on the designers of those technological systems.</div>

                     work that Seaver conducted over several years in the early 2010s. He spent time
                     within a company he calls “Whisper” and conducted interviews with a wide variety of
                     technologists across the industry. Seaver’s aim is not primarily technology
                     criticism (though he does offer critiques) but rather to illuminate the cultural
                     practices of those who design recommendation technologies. What do the designers aim
                     to accomplish through their work? How do they understand music? And perhaps most
                     centrally, how do they think about taste? <span class="hi italic">Computing Taste</span>
                     reveals that the answers to those questions are anything but simple.</div>

                           algorithmic systems and in discourse about them. Although they are often figured as
                           unfeeling agents of rationality, they
                           describe themselves as motivated by a deep care for music. Like many of their
                           critics, the makers of music recommendation recognize that there is something
                           strange about their aspirations — a tension between the closed, formal rationality
                           of technology and the open, contingent subjectivity of taste. [<a class="ref" href="#seaver2022">Seaver 2022</a>, 8]</p>

                     entirely or to flatten them into simple caricatures. <span class="hi italic">Computing

                           map neatly on to techniques and data sources: if you thought that people liked
                           music because of how it sounded, then you’d make a system that analyzed audio
                           data; if you thought they liked music to fit in with their friends, then you
                           might try to acquire social network data… But what I found at Whisper, and

                     recommendation systems think about music, taste, and the computational systems they
                     develop. Chapter topics include the need to assist users in navigating “too much
                     music,” the capture of users’ attention, the mathematical nature of music, and the
                     “space” of musical genres. Each chapter begins with an illustration of each theme
                     that draws from Seaver’s field work, followed by extended analysis and
                     interpretation that leverage constructs and insights from a broad body of humanities
                     scholarship. For example, in Chapter 1 he connects the origins of music
                     recommendation in the mid-20th century to
                     contemporaneous developments in computing, particularly the emergence of
                     Cybernetics. In Chapter 5 he compares the ways that technologists conceptualize the
                     “space” of music genres to anthropological and sociological theories of cultural
                     spaces (such as those of Bourdieu). A theoretical thread that runs throughout the
                     book is the insight from Technology Studies that we ought to think of technologies
                     as sociotechnical systems: assemblages of human and technical components [<a class="ref" href="#pinch_bijker1984">Pinch and Bijker 1984</a>]. Talk of “computer algorithms” too often obscures the human actors that
                     not only design the technical components but actively and continuously manage and
                     maintain them.</div>

                  <div class="ptext" id="p7">All six chapters bring insights, but several are particularly worth highlighting.
                     The
                     first two chapters provide a careful and novel analysis on the tensions that exist
                     in how designers think about the “captivating algorithms” that they create. In
                     Chapter 1, Seaver describes how recommendation systems are often positioned as
                     assisting audiophiles navigate the overwhelming catalog of music that they can
                     access. The concern that humans are practically drowning in a sea of information
                     (musical or otherwise) is, as Seaver points out, a perennial one, and he traces the
                     development of music recommendation services, since the early 1990s, that have
                     sought to help users navigate the problem of “too much music.” Contemporary
                     algorithmic methods are largely continuous with their predecessors, though their
                     technical methods differ. Their designers employ similar rhetoric about the goal of
                     helping users navigate a bewildering array of options. The enduring promise is that
                     recommendation systems will help users not only find the music they already like,
                     but discover new music that they never would have otherwise encountered.</div>

                  <div class="ptext" id="p8">Yet for all the rhetoric about helping users navigate and make new discoveries, there
                     is also a discourse about using algorithms to get users “hooked” on the music
                     service. This is not the algorithm of musical discovery, but the “captivating
                     algorithm ”of the attention economy. Much, of course, has been written on the
                     subject of attention-capturing algorithms [e.g., [<a class="ref" href="#zuboff2019">Zuboff 2019</a>]], and Seaver
                     acknowledges and discusses that work. But rather than critique the social
                     consequences of the algorithms, Seaver works to understand how their designers
                     square their captivating function with their goal of empowering users to explore the
                     vast “musical landscape” (Chapter 5 specifically addresses spatial metaphors of
                     music). </div>

                  <div class="ptext" id="p9">In Chapter 2, Seaver uses anthropological studies of traps as a lens to interpret
                     how
                     designers approach the task of captivation (building on work that he previously
                     published in 2019). The key insight is that the designer needs a model of
                     that-which-is-to-be-trapped, because the trap needs to be able to lure its intended,
                     and only its intended, prey. This is why designers of recommendation algorithms need
                     to model their users, including the different kinds of users that might exist. The
                     trap metaphor is also instructive because it draws attention to the array of traps
                     that can be made. A trap need not kill or even injure or even extensively confine
                     its prey. In fact, recommendation algorithms might be best conceptualized as the
                     “pastoral” form of trap:</div>

                           pastoralists, the makers of recommender systems do not want to annihilate their
                           prey. They want to keep them around and grow their numbers, through the artful
                           production of captivating environments that at once limit and facilitate life.

                     around” [<a class="ref" href="#seaver2022">Seaver 2022</a>, 50]. So, if you want users to hang around, do you give them
                     what is familiar, or try to broaden their horizons? Perhaps some users are content
                     to just stay in familiar territory while others actively want to discover new music.
                     Building the right pastoral enclosure means that designers need to model those
                     different user orientations – the subject of Chapter 3.</div>

                  <div class="ptext" id="p12">This brief overview illustrates the approach that Seaver takes throughout <span class="hi italic">Computing Taste</span>. He draws connections between how the

                     perspectives that provide insight into how the pieces fit together. He does not
                     hesitate to critique the technologists’ perspectives and beliefs when critique is
                     warranted, drawing attention to inconsistencies, blind spots, and misguided
                     assumptions. At the same time, he does not set the designers up as antagonists
                     (like, say, [<a class="ref" href="#rushkoff2022">Rushkoff 2022</a>]). Rather, Seaver creates a portrayal of earnest people
                     who are passionate about music and who believe wholeheartedly in the value of their
                     work. <span class="hi italic">Computing Taste</span> shows how those technologists use their
                     beliefs to navigate the challenges and complications of their technical projects.

                     scholarship more broadly, especially for inquiries into now-ubiquitous algorithmic
                     systems. Perhaps the most wide-reaching contribution is its call to take seriously
                     the beliefs, ways of thinking, and ways of talking (including the metaphors) of
                     technology designers. Those ways of thinking and speaking matter a great deal
                     because they wind up being knitted into the technical systems they create. And yes,
                     they are worthy of scrutiny and critique, but they are also worthy of being
                     understood. As Seaver shows, they are often far more complex than they at first
                     appear.</div>

                  <div class="ptext" id="p14">Exemplifying this point is Seaver’s examination (in Chapter 4) of the use of machine
                     learning to create systems that can detect musical genre. Machine learning systems
                     are often described as “black boxes” because it is extremely difficult to comprehend
                     why they produce the classifications (e.g., genre) that they do. And yet, Seaver’s
                     analysis reveals how machine learning remains a sociotechnical system. Human
                     designers decide not only what to feed into the machine learning algorithm, but
                     “tune” its outputs so that they conform to their expectations. The ways that the
                     designers think about genre and hear music become intertwined with the algorithm.
                     They use their ways of thinking and listening to detect, interpret, and correct
                     unexpected results. The designers are also “tuned” by their technologies as they
                     strain to listen for and comprehend what the algorithm is “hearing.”</div>

                     and
                     designer need to be central to our analyses and critiques of algorithmic systems
                     (machine learning or otherwise). Those systems are shaped and continuously
                     maintained by the beliefs, approaches, and discourses of the technologists who
                     develop them. A deeper understanding of those designers’ cultures can not only
                     enrich our analyses and critiques, but also point the way toward alternative
                     futures. What kinds of music streaming services might we have if they were built up
                     from a different set of beliefs and metaphors about music, taste, and computing? </div>
