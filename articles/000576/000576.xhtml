                  <p>Alterations in historical manuscripts such as letters represent a promising field
                     of research. On the one hand, 
                     they help understand the construction of text. On the other hand, topics that are
                     being considered sensitive at the 
                     time of the manuscript gain coherence and contextuality when taking alterations into
                     account, especially in the case
                     of deletions. The analysis of alterations in manuscripts, though, is a traditionally
                     very tedious work. In this paper,
                     we present a machine learning-based approach to help categorize alterations in documents.
                     In particular, we present a 
                     new probabilistic model (Alteration Latent Dirichlet Allocation, <em class="emph">alterLDA</em> in the following) that categorizes content-related
                     alterations. The method proposed here is developed based on experiments carried out
                     on the digital scholarly edition <cite class="title italic">Berlin
                        Intellectuals</cite>, for which <em class="emph">alterLDA</em> achieves high performance in the recognition of alterations on labelled data. On
                     unlabelled 
                     data, applying <em class="emph">alterLDA</em> leads to interesting new insights into the alteration behavior of authors, editors
                     and other manuscript
                     contributors, as well as insights into sensitive topics in the correspondence of Berlin
                     intellectuals around 1800. In addition
                     to the findings based on the digital scholarly edition <cite class="title italic">Berlin Intellectuals</cite>, we present a general framework for the analysis of 
                     text genesis that can be used in the context of other digital resources representing
                     document variants. To that end, we present 
                     in detail the methodological steps that are to be followed in order to achieve such
                     results, giving thereby a prime example of 
                     an Machine Learning application the Digital Humanities.</p>

                  <div class="ptext" id="p1">Classical scholarly editing has a long-standing tradition in
                     distinguishing between different types of editions [<a class="ref" href="#witkowski1924">Witkowski 1924</a>]. The
                     characteristics of specific edition forms usually align with the intended
                     readership, but they also take into account a bibliographic history that tends
                     to differentiate more and more along time according to linguistic areas. In the
                     German-speaking area, historical-critical editions that comprise an extensive
                     historical-critical apparatus are often distinguished - with a clear
                     hierarchical difference - from so-called study editions [<a class="ref" href="#plachta2006">Plachta 2006</a>]. The common
                     denominator between these two types of editions is that they aim to offer a
                     “reliable text” as a central component [<a class="ref" href="#plachta2006">Plachta 2006</a>]. In contrast to these types of editions, it
                     is also possible to publish a reproduction of the manuscript image (facsimile
                     edition). Plachta points out, however, that a facsimile edition is no substitute
                     for the above two types of editions [<a class="ref" href="#plachta2006">Plachta 2006</a>].</div>

                  <div class="ptext" id="p2">Another way of differentiating between types of editions is to
                     compare the intention in the text construction, which corresponds to the
                     philosophy according to which the anglo-saxon area has mainly structured their
                     approach. According to Andrews, “the ‘old’ methods that have their root in
                     classical philology” strive to assemble the “ideal” text, while the “new
                     philology” seeks to find the “real” text [<a class="ref" href="#andrews2013">Andrews 2013</a>]. In this conception, the ideal text tries to
                     approach the author's intention, while the real text seeks to emulate the
                     existing sources.</div>
                  
                  <div class="counter"><a href="#p3">3</a></div>
                  <div class="ptext" id="p3">The type of edition an editor goes for is often defined by
                     economic factors in printed editions, while in digital editions, this limitation
                     can be obsolete in terms of the amount of pages available, or located on a
                     different level (for instance due to the price of specific, cost-expensive
                     technologies). More generally, in digital scholarly editions, differentiation
                     characteristics can be renegotiated. As Andrews states, there are hardly any
                     technical limitations in digital editions with regard to the size of the
                     apparatus, and the number and resolution of facsimiles provided [<a class="ref" href="#andrews2013">Andrews 2013</a>].</div>
                  
                  <div class="counter"><a href="#p4">4</a></div>
                  <div class="ptext" id="p4">This is not the only specificity that distinguishes digital from
                     print editions. They also are machine-readable. With digital editions being
                     available in digital formats, computers can not only handle repetitive tasks in
                     the creation of the edition [<a class="ref" href="#andrews2013">Andrews 2013</a>], they can also be used to perform tasks that use the
                     edition as source material. The most obvious example for this type of use is the
                     full-text search, but the machine-readable form also allows the creation of a
                     multitude of statistics and customed visualizations with very little effort
                     [<a class="ref" href="#ralle2016">Ralle 2016</a>].
                     Furthermore, Ralle emphasizes that the digitization of editions and scholarly
                     editing in general allow to pay special attention to the processual aspects of
                     the edition [<a class="ref" href="#ralle2016">Ralle 2016</a>]. An edition can be extended or enriched after it
                     has been initially published and does not need to be “finished” at a
                     specific moment in time. A digital edition can be modified dynamically, for
                     instance like the Carl-Maria-von-Weber-Gesamtausgabe with a front page field
                     called “What happened today?” that connects to all instances of the current
                     date in the corpus and highlights them - a content that changes from day to
                     day and offers a different approach to the corpus than the traditional
                     keyword search. Also, user interaction can be funneled back into the
                     edition, for example when subsequent publications that are based on the
                     edition are listed there. Interaction in and of itself can also be included:
                     the search behaviour of users can be analyzed for better future suggestions
                     or the edition can be enriched by third-party data. Every user of a digital
                     edition, whether computer or human, is thus potentially able to engage in
                     one form of editorial participation or the other [<a class="ref" href="#schlitz2014">Schlitz 2014</a>] [<a class="ref" href="#siemens2012">Siemens et al. 2012</a>] [<a class="ref" href="#shillingsburg2013">Shillingsburg 2013</a>].</div>

                     research questions hence unexplored in the Humanities due to the lack of
                     tools and corpora allowing an automatic evaluation of alteration phenomena.
                     It enables for instance to thoroughly reconstruct the history of a document
                     by considering physical traces of alterations, meaning any smaller or larger
                     text modifications on the manuscript, performed either by the author himself
                     or herself or by others (see Methods). This approach provides insights into
                     the way in which authors, editors and other contributors work together,
                     hence impacting our understanding of text genesis as a collaborative

                     century. The connection these writers have to the intellectual networks in

                     Berlin) or indirect (editorial or epistolar relationship with Berlin-based
                     intellectuals). The originality of this digital scholarly edition is that it
                     is neither author-centered nor genre-based, but presents different types of
                     selected manuscripts that shed light on the intellectual activity of Berlin
                     at the turn of the 18th to the 19th century. This editorial choice is
                     presented at length in  [<a class="ref" href="#baillot2014">Baillot and Busch 2014</a>], where light is also shed
                     on the uniqueness of the Prussian Capital City in the context of the
                     period. While
                     correspondences play a key role in the edition, they are considered as a
                     part of the circulation of ideas that is at the core of the project, so that
                     letters, and more generally egodocuments, are complemented by drafts of
                     either literary works (among which two major romantic texts), scholarly
                     writings (one dissertation) or administrative documents (related to the
                     development of the Berlin University). A first editorial phase (2010-2016)
                     allowed to publish manuscripts that cover different thematic areas and
                     historical phases of the development of intellectual Berlin. They were
                     selected based mainly on their scholarly relevance and on their
                     accessibility (the publication policy of archives holding manuscripts having
                     a major impact on their integration to a digital edition that displays a
                     facsimile like this one does). Four main topics have emerged in this first
                     phase: French, e.g. Huguenot Culture, Berlin University, Literary
                     Romanticism and Women Writers. Depending on the topics, the letters
                     published were complemented by other types of texts that document the
                     circulation of ideas and of literary and scholarly works in the late
                     18th and

                           versions of the documents are depicted for each author. A Large number of

                           there are close to no alterations in the documents he authored. In (d),

                     that it combines genetic edition and entity annotation in order to gain
                     insight in intellectual networks, on the actual editing process of manuscripts (of
                     literary and scholarly works) and on the discourse about this editing
                     process (letters – most letters are interestingly also partly transformed
                     into literary works in their own right and subject to editing). The genetic
                     encoding gives precise information regarding deletions and additions in the

                     creation time. The investigation of this question is only made possible by
                     the meticulous (digital) annotation of the historical documents that
                     provides previously unavailable enrichments and perspectives on the sources.

                  <div class="ptext" id="p12">From the perspective of edition theory Ehrmann stresses that the
                     importance of analyzing the alterations in manuscripts for literary studies and
                     scholarly editing lies not only in the fact that they allow an insight into the
                     author's writing process in the case of author-made changes, but also in the
                     fact that they help identify the respective contribution in the case of
                     co-authorships [<a class="ref" href="#ehrmann2016">Ehrmann 2016</a>]. The first question that arises when examining every alteration is
                     the question of the underlying reason, be it for a minor correction of mistakes
                     or a wide-ranging content-related alteration. This leads to the question of the
                     originator of the alteration and, as Ehrmann stresses, whether the alteration is
                     wanted by the author [<a class="ref" href="#ehrmann2016">Ehrmann 2016</a>]. In the specific case of an edition of correspondence,
                     the intended readership is bound to change dramatically in the aftermath of
                     publication. A letter that was originally written to a friend is made public to
                     a large readership and in the process of preparation, the editor applies
                     alterations to the original letter, most of the time with a correction phase on
                     the original manuscript itself. This is the case for many manuscripts in the BI

                     method (alterLDA) presented here also offers new
                     opportunities for many other areas of automated analysis of variants of
                     sources, especially within the Digital Humanities. AlterLDA is based on the
                     topic model latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA). “Topic Modeling has proven immensely popular in
                     Digital Humanities” [<a class="ref" href="#schoch2017">Schöch 2017</a>]. LDA is particularly popular in
                     the DH because it is suitable for explorative text analysis. With the
                     automated compilation of word lists by LDA, new topics can be identified in
                     large text corpora whose existence was previously unknown. In this context,
                     it almost always forms the first analysis step on text data, but it can in
                     fact also be used for non-textual data [<a class="ref" href="#jelodar2019">Jelodar et al. 2019</a>] [<a class="ref" href="#liu2016">Lie et al. 2016</a>].
                     In addition to LDA, which provides the identification of the overall
                     relevant topics of the corpus to be examined and the specific topics of the
                     individual documents of the corpus, alterLDA is particularly concerned with
                     the variants of the documents. The starting
                     conditions for this work are as follows: from the point of view of edition
                     theory, the question of document variants is of major importance, and this
                     has not yet been sufficiently investigated with Distant Reading methods.
                     From a methodological point of view, there is a very widespread Topic Model
                     (LDA), which is already recognized and accepted practice in the Digital
                     Humanities. In this paper we therefore close the gap by adapting LDA in
                     order to model document variants.</div>

                     processual aspects of the edition itself. If a document in its past has already
                     been prepared for publication by an editor, then his or her notes in the TEI-XML
                     are annotated in the same way as when the editors of the BI Edition leave notes:

                     because the latter consists mainly of letters, which, especially around 1800 in
                     Germany, exhibit a strong tension between public and private sphere. The
                     framework presented here includes four methods that range from basic, well
                     established, rule-based methods to a specialized, novel machine learning method
                     (alterLDA) that was developed for exactly this purpose. From a methodological
                     point of view, this is a challenge for all disciplines involved, conceived as a
                     scenario optimized so that all sides benefit from each other. Finally, the newly
                     introduced method is also applied to discover alteration candidates in the
                     documents that are not yet altered. These findings led to, and hopefully will
                     continue to fuel, interesting discussions on parts of the edition that were

                     variants, which uses previously collected data and relates the observations
                     to it. Thus, these statistical transformations resemble human reading more
                     than purely deterministic approaches and therefore foster the methodological

                     in scenes of a play). However in recent years Machine Learning models are
                     being used more broadly for e.g. Named Entity Recognition [<a class="ref" href="#dalenoskam2016">Dalen-Oskam 2016</a>] [<a class="ref" href="#jannidis2015">Jannidis et al. 2015</a>].
                     The patterns that are used to identify entities
                     are not stated explicitly by a programmer but are learned from the data at
                     training time. In general, Machine Learning methods would then be
                     methodologically less strict than classical explicit algorithmic
                     transformations and therefore be possibly also more human-like. However,
                     when giving up this explicitness there has to be a more rigorous evaluation
                     of the machine’s output. For many applications, like the one presented in

                  <div class="ptext" id="p23">Given an arbitrary version of a
                     document, we define an alteration to be a local group of added and/or
                     deleted symbols that is performed by the author of an alteration. Basically,
                     any symbol appearing in the document could be regarded as a single addition,
                     but the state of the manuscript at the time of the investigation often makes
                     it impossible to identify beyond doubt which groups of symbols belong to a
                     particular writing session. The same problem exists with deletions: Was the
                     sentence completed first, or did the author pause in the middle and correct
                     something before completing the sentence? In BI, additions and deletions are
                     considered as such when they clearly stand out, for example when they are
                     crossed out or written to the margin. Sometimes co-occurring additions and
                     deletions are also referred to as replacements. The alteration may
                     range from a single character to whole passages of the document and can even be
                     a local group with non-altered symbols in between. An alteration author is a
                     single person or institution that alters the document, possibly the primary
                     author him or herself. The alteration author has an alteration reason for which
                     he or she decides to alter the document. This is a very specific reason, for
                     example “the alteration author thinks that a particular word is spelled
                     differently” or “a real person which is referred to in the document may not want
                     to be recognized by the readers, so this part is censored”.</div>

                  <div class="ptext" id="p24">Each alteration has a formal and content-related portion with
                     varying emphasis. For example, if the author of an alteration changes the
                     spelling of a single word this would not change the meaning of the document in
                     most cases. On the contrary, adding multiple sentences to a document may change
                     the content of the document significantly. Of course, whether an alteration is
                     rather positioned on the form side or on the content side of the axis depends on
                     the point of view of the recipient. Hence, the proposed method takes into
                     account the formal changes of the document as well as the content-related
                     changes. Smaller alterations tend to have a rather formal aspect, where longer
                     alterations almost always are content-related.</div>

                  <div class="ptext" id="p25">The set of alterations can be broken down into different
                     categories with respect to their alteration reason. One group of alterations is
                     (1) the group of paratexts, for example archival notes, such as numberings or
                     dates, or stamps and seals of the library or archival institution. Another group
                     of alterations is (2) corrections of mistakes which consists in spelling
                     alterations, grammatical changes and other corrections. (3) The third group
                     contains stylistic alterations, for example replacing a token with its synonym
                     or rearranging the word order. Of course, changing the word order is sometimes
                     more than just a stylistic change, but one could e.g. begin a sentence with <span class="foreign i">“Es
                        bedarf daher [..]”</span> as well as with <span class="foreign i">“Daher bedarf es [..]”</span> with very similar
                     intentions. The last group of alterations which we call (4) content-related
                     alterations incorporate alterations that either add new information to the
                     document or suppress information that was present in the document before.</div>

                     Figure 2
                     illustrates how the identification method works. All alterations are put into
                     the analysis pipeline, and after the initial distinction between author
                     alterations and non-author alterations, the four tests for different types are
                     performed on each alteration. As an example, there are four alterations depicted
                     in the illustration that are fed into the model. A detailed explanation for an
                     identification of the three non-content-related types of modifications is given
                     in the appendix. By elimination of all other possible categories, the remaining
                     alterations are of the content-related category. There are still a variety of
                     reasons in this category worthwhile to identify. Rather than the general
                     category we aim for providing a distinct reason for each alteration. The fourth
                     alteration which is marked in red is a longer deletion and a detailed facsimile
                     is shown in Figure 2. It is
                     performed with a pencil which is different from the primary ink of the letter.
                     It deals with the author’s sickness and with the sickness of the author’s
                     mother. The extent of the alteration already indicates that this is not a
                     correction of a mistake and since the part that is deleted is not replaced by
                     anything else, it can be assumed that this alteration changes the amount of
                     information provided. It is thus to be classified as a content-related
                     alteration. At this point it is still to be identified for which specific reason
                     the document has been altered. With alterLDA, the alteration is assigned to one
                     of a set of candidate reasons as a final step, in this case <em class="emph">Sickness</em>-reason.</div>

                     Dirichlet Allocation [<a class="ref" href="#blei2003">Blei et al. 2003</a>] and that is able to take into account the
                     structural information of alterations. LDA is a widely used topic model that
                     extends Latent Semantic Indexing [<a class="ref" href="#deerwester1990">Deerwester 1990</a>] which is capable of assigning a
                     distribution of topics to a document instead of only a single topic. LDA
                     takes advantage of the fact that a text is organized in documents. This
                     structural information is the reason for LDA to function. Based on this
                     structure of documents, LDA can learn which words tend to co-occur and thus
                     have a relation. Words that often occur with each other form a topic. In
                     this context, a topic is merely a distribution of word frequencies.</div>

                     An open circle denotes 
                     a model variable and a shaded circle denotes an observed variable. Symbols without
                     circle denote a hyper 
                     parameter. A rectangle indicates repetitions of the included variables. In this model,
                     β represents the 
                     topic histograms, θ represents the topic mixture for each document, z represents the

                     constrained iterative probabilistic model itself, where the current state
                     only depends on the previous. From this perspective, the stationary of the
                     Markov Chain represents the solution of the Gibbs Sampler. The source code
                     of our implementation of the Collapsed Gibbs Sampler for the alterLDA model
                     is <a href="gitlab.tubit.tu-berlin.de/david.lassner/shipping_alterLDA" onclick="window.open('gitlab.tubit.tu-berlin.de/david.lassner/shipping_alterLDA'); return false" class="ref">publicly available</a>. In the
                     appendix, derivation of the Collapsed Gibbs Sampler for the alterLDA model
                     is given.</div>

                     differ in the splitting between training and test data. As shown in Figure 5, three
                     settings are
                     chosen, S1 as a straightforward explorative demonstration, S3 to comply with the methodological
                     standards
                     of data splitting for the performance report, as well as S2 for offering
                     additional explorative results specific for this data set. We will first present
                     the evaluation results that investigate the performance of alterLDA on the given
                     data set and afterwards present explorative results that will be reconciled with
                     expert knowledge. Apart from these experiments on the BI data set, the first
                     experiments were performed on synthetic data, some results from these
                     experiments are listed in the appendix.</div>

                        Setting 2 (only one row) aims at finding alteration candidates in texts with
                        no alterations. For Setting 3, the process of creating the setting is
                        depicted in multiple rows. First, only documents that contain alterations
                        are chosen. Then, each individual document is shuffled and split into a

                     composition that represents sensitive
                     topics. This means that alteration topics may be a convolution of private

                     the outcome. These are the same parameters as for LDA: Number of topics and
                     the Dirichlet prior for the topic distribution η and the topic mixture α. There is
                     also another parameter, the Dirichlet prior for the
                     alteration tendency ξ. The default value for a Dirichlet prior is 1, but it can take
                     any
                     value greater than 0. The smaller the value, the more the variable tends to
                     be focussed on single values, the larger the value, the more different
                     values are considered. Using the topic mixture as an example, a small α would mean
                     that LDA is looking for a solution where each document
                     consists of only a few topics, a large α finds a solution with mixtures of many topics.
                     AlterLDA is initialized in this setting
                     with α = (.1, .1, …), η = (.1, .1, …) and ξ = (.05, .05, …) as well as K=10. We choose
                     ξ small in this setting to create a sparse 
                     ϒ so that alterLDA only learns one alteration topic.</div>

                     describe it: “<span class="foreign i">Sie Ich Brief schreiben</span>” this does not come as a surprise
                     since the corpus consists mainly of letters. However, it is also possible to

                     level, the performance for Hoffmann and especially H. Finckenstein is
                     weaker. In case of H. Finckenstein, this may be due to the fact that in the
                     corpus there is only a single letter. For E.T.A. Hoffmann, there is also
                     only one document in the corpus, but it presents two specialties. It is
                     considerably longer than most documents in the corpus: it is not a letter,
                     but the novella <cite class="title italic"><span class="foreign i">Der Sandmann</span></cite>. The larger size and the
                     differing properties due to the genre seem to trade off to a slightly better
                     performance than in the case of H. Finckenstein. We thus argue that the
                     performance of alterLDA depends on the size of the training set and on the
                     homogeneity of the documents.</div>

                  <div class="ptext" id="p49">In the explorative experiment (S2), the corpus is divided into
                     two parts: On the one hand, all documents that contain changes and, on the
                     other hand, all documents that do not contain any changes. The aim of the
                     experiment is to train the model on the part of the corpus that contains
                     changes and then let the model suggest which parts of the unchanged corpus
                     may be changed in a similar way. There may be different reasons why some
                     documents contain alterations and others do not. Assuming that all documents
                     were reviewed by the same person and that person was also so diligent that
                     he or she did not overlook a single passage, then alterLDA should at
                     best-case scenario not propose an additional passage to be altered. We
                     assume in this experiment that either not all documents have been reviewed
                     for the same criteria or that relevant positions have been overlooked.</div>

                        the prediction a lot for these authors. Chamisso wrote in German although
                        his mother tongue is French. Therefore there may be many minor mistakes that
                        are suggested to be altered. Dorothea Tieck wrote about her mothers’
                        sickness which the method recognized as a sensible topic and therefore as a
                        reason for alteration.</div>

                     the counts of the positions in documents with no alterations that have been
                     suggested by the method are displayed for each author/editor. The rows in
                     the table are sorted by the total amount of suggested alterations.
                     Interestingly, the authors with many suggested alterations are not
                     necessarily the ones that have a large share of total tokens of the corpus
                     (see Figure 1, (b) and
                     (c)). In the case of Euler and von Buch, this is due to the fact that their
                     documents are mostly in French, whereas the alterLDA model in this case is
                     primarily trained on German texts. For Boeckh, this is mainly due to the
                     fact that the corpus encompasses only a few yet long documents and
                     consequently there are not many documents present in the test set. Of
                     course, there are other reasons for each author's ratio of corpus portion
                     and number of suggested alterations. A person that altered all positions in
                     the training set also diligently edited all documents in the test set and
                     simply did not find any position that should be altered for the same reason:
                     That the method did not find the respective amount in the test set can
                     either mean that it was not able to find the right positions or that there
                     were none.</div>

                     suggested most alterations. As said, the texts by J. A. Euler and A. F. Buch
                     were mainly written in French which influenced the number of suggested

                     for D. Tieck the keyword “<span class="foreign i">Krankheit</span>” <em class="emph">Sickness</em>
                     appears. For Ad. Chamisso, words like e.g. “<span class="foreign i">schön</span>” and “<span class="foreign i">begehren</span>” can
                     be observed that may relate to the topic <em class="emph">Love Story</em>.
                     In the case of L. Tieck, a distinct convoluted alteration topic is not
                     immediately conceivable. In the case of A. Boeckh, the topic of the
                     documents in the corpus are mostly academia-related.</div>

                     and 1840. In the letters she repeatedly mentions her mother’s sickness until
                     her death in February 1837. Later, in March 1837, the father of F. Uechtritz
                     passed away as well, D. Tieck writes about this in Letter 28.</div>

                     complaints is suppressed in the second version - this discrepancy in detail
                     can be decisive for classification as a content-related alteration.</div>

                     Ad. Chamisso. Most of the letters are addressed to L. La Foye (Ad.

                     with regard to the number of alterations, letter 10, actually encompasses a
                     large number of alterations, whereas letter 11 is part of the test set and
                     thus does not have any (content-related) alterations. The alterLDA model
                     suggests an almost equally high number of alterations for letter 11,
                     presumably because it consists of topics that the alterLDA model estimates
                     to be altered accordingly - this shows that the alterLDA model captures
                     subtle changes of topics by the same author.</div>

                     occurs the third-highest number of altered tokens. By examining the letter,
                     it turns out that Tieck wrote about his financial problems and his plans to
                     sell his book collection to the Count Yorck von Wartenburg.<a class="noteRef" href="#d4e1109">[2]</a>

                     bars of the panel on the right), one letter from 1838 draws the most
                     attention just by the sheer number of suggested alterations. In this letter,
                     L. Tieck refers to disputes between the Catholic Church and the Prussian
                     state at that time.<a class="noteRef" href="#d4e1122">[3]</a> By arguing about this political
                     controversy, L. Tieck chooses his wording in such a way that alterLDA
                     suggests alterations. This could indicate that across the training corpus
                     there might be the same tendency to alter parts of the documents that deal
                     with a political controversy. The fact that alterLDA highlights a document
                     containing a mixture of political and religious topics supports the
                     hypothesis that the alterations in the BI corpus do not only consist of
                     privacy matters, but also involve a wider political dimension. This result
                     confirms and gives a novel dimension to the assertion that letters as a text
                     genre evolve, especially in the German context of the 1800s, at the
                     interface between private and public matters. In that sense, the role played
                     by alterations aiming at balancing private and public dimensions is central
                     and needs to be further delved into. AlterLDA provides a systematic approach
                     to this major issue in literary studies.</div>

                        deal with financial, political and religuous topics.</div>

                  <div class="ptext" id="p63">This paper presented a general framework for analyzing alterations
                     in historical documents, ranging from simple error corrections to stylistic
                     changes and even to content-related alterations. In addition to established
                     methods such as regular expressions, string distances and vector space
                     comparison, a new probabilistic model for the classification of reasons for
                     alterations has been introduced (alterLDA). </div>

                  <div class="ptext" id="p64">This work contributes to the understanding of text genesis, as it
                     provides insight into the layers of changes in documents. It also offers a
                     quantitative way of evaluating which topics are at what times prone to be
                     altered and are therefore sensitive. </div>

                  <div class="ptext" id="p65">From a machine learning point of view, the BI data set posed
                     special challenges because, on the one hand, the data set is very small and, on
                     the other hand, it comprises several languages, which also differ greatly from
                     the ones used today. Nonetheless, alterLDA was able to confidently find
                     alterations on unseen, labelled data. Exploratively, the method was able to find
                     characteristics on unseen, unlabeled data that in many cases match the expert
                     analysis. The method hence proves to be useful to draw the human reader's
                     attention to specific parts of the large corpus that may otherwise be unnoticed,
                     and by doing so serves as an example of how a machine learning method may assist
                     a scholar as a collaborating reader and a potential collaborating editor.</div>

                     first presented here, it is to be noted that the machine-readability of the
                     BI edition makes it possible to serve problem-specific, individualised
                     editions tailored to the research question of a reader/scholar. This project
                     showcases how machine learning methods radically transform the way in which
                     scholars engage historical documents, by taking advantage of the quality of
                     deeply-annotated data: editorial and machine learning expertise can be
                     brought together to explore in depth Humanities research questions.</div>

                     expert knowledge on the corpus as well as from novel ML methods that were
                     designed for this corpus. This collaboration therefore presents important
                     guidelines for practical and methodological steps that will help other
                     projects to enrich their digital editions with automated annotation or

                        alteration are very similar. This characteristic will be exploited for
                        the identification of corrections. Identifying corrections is a
                        considerably more difficult task because the corrected version does not
                        necessarily have to be correct from what we know today. The fact that
                        the alteration author corrected the text only means that he or she

                        comparing the second version of the text with what an automatic spell
                        checker would the first version correct to. Instead, we divided the
                        problem even further into spelling alterations and grammatical
                        alterations. For identifying spelling mistakes, the tokens of both
                        versions are fuzzy-string matched against the common dictionary of
                        lemmas. If both tokens match closely to the same lemma according to the
                        Levenshtein distance, the two tokens are considered two different
                        spellings of the same word. Fuzzy string matching of multiple tokens
                        against a large vocabulary can be costly in terms of computing time and
                        memory. For a larger data set an adjustment to this approach may be
                        necessary. However, this approach gave better results than simply
                        comparing Levenshtein distance of the tokens of both versions with each
                        other, due to smaller tokens that are very similar but mean different
                        things (e.g. “hate” and “fate” have Levenshtein distance of 1 but have a
                        very different meaning.) For identifying grammatical alterations, we
                        assume that the forms of the tokens in the sentence change and probably
                        punctuations are added or deleted, but the set of lemmas is preserved
                        for the most part. Hence, if the forms or the part of speech of the
                        tokens in the span change but the set of lemmas do not, this alteration
                        is a grammatical correction.</div>

                        corrections and paratexts are already labelled according to the
                        described method. Thus, there are only stylistic alterations and moral
                        censorships left to be labelled. In our understanding, a stylistic
                        alteration preserves the meaning of the text by only changing the way it
                        is posed which includes rearranging of words, the use of synonyms and
                        rephrasing. In recent years, a method gained a lot of attention that
                        strive to find a vector-space representation of words that capture its
                        meaning. Words or sentences projected to this space reveal a high
                        similarity (for example cosine-similarity) if they have the same
                        meaning. We introduce a threshold and consider all alterations for which
                        the vector-space embedding of the text before and after the alteration
                        reveal a smaller distance to be a stylistic alteration.</div>

                        the functionality of the model. To do this, first, the variables of the
                        model are initialized, and documents are generated. Now the variables are
                        initialized again and based on the previously generated documents the old
                        variable configurations are reconstructed. The performance of the inference

                        number of tokens were varied. Each cell shows the mean reconstruction of c
                        over two runs with a given set of parameter choices. The brighter the color
                        of the cell, the better the reconstruction. Overall, a smaller alpha yields
                        better results, independent of the size of the data set and the choice of
                        the other concentration factors. Interestingly, for fewer documents and α = 0.1, a
                        smaller concentration factor η performs better, wheras for either a larger number
                        of documents or
                        a larger α = 0.1 a larger η is to be preferred. The explanation for this result is
                        that with
                        more documents, the exact proportions of the topics can be inferred more
                        accurately, wheras for fewer documents, there is the chance of getting a few
