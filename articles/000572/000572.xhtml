                  <div class="ptext" id="p1">Shakespeare’s works and their relation to the language and texts of his culture are
                     hardly new arrivals in online digital scholarship or a new focus in the development
                     of digital methodologies and tools; indeed, the editors of <cite class="title italic">Shakespeare’s Language in Digital Media</cite> argue that “the state of computing
                     in Shakespeare studies” functions as “a benchmark of our scholarly digital literacy
                     in general: now, as ever, Shakespeare is the test bed for our latest remediation
                     technologies” [<a class="ref" href="#jensted2020">Jensted and Roberts-Smith 2020</a>, 2]. As a case in point,
                     the editors relate that twenty years ago, in 1997-8, a sort of precursor to their
                     collection appeared in the form of a pair of special issues of <cite class="title italic">Early Modern Literary Studies</cite>. The essays there focused on two new/nascent
                     digital scholarly resources: the <cite class="title italic">Early Modern English Dictionaries
                        Database</cite> (<cite class="title italic">EMEDD</cite>), under the editorship of Ian
                     Lancashire, and <cite class="title italic">Internet Shakespeare Editions</cite> (ISE), under
                     the editorship of Michael Best. Today, <cite class="title italic">EMEDD</cite> has been
                     superseded by <cite class="title italic">Lexicons of Early Modern English</cite> (<cite class="title italic">LEME</cite>), edited by Lancashire, and <cite class="title italic">ISE</cite>
                     (now under the editorship of Janelle Jensted) has been joined by sibling projects
                     like <cite class="title italic">Queen’s Men Editions</cite> (<cite class="title italic">QME</cite>), <cite class="title italic">Digital Renaissance Editions</cite> (<cite class="title italic">DRE</cite>) and
                     the <cite class="title italic">Map of Early Modern London</cite> (<cite class="title italic">MoEML</cite>). While the essays in the present collection bring together text editing
                     and historical linguistic analysis in digital scholarship, the editors point out
                     that a divergence persists between these two fields that is mirrored in the
                     differing directions that <cite class="title italic">LEME</cite> and <cite class="title italic">ISE</cite>
                     have taken towards their texts: the former along a “dynamic text” path facilitating
                     lexical research across a corpus of period glossaries, the latter along a
                     “hypertextual edition” path facilitating enhanced reading and study of individual
                     Shakespeare plays. The editors point to signs of convergence of these divergent
                     paths, and one of the sources of interest in this collection for the digital
                     humanist (Shakespearean and non-Shakespearean) is the ways the essays suggest how
                     –
                     in the digital humanities test bed that is digital Shakespeare – such diverging
                     scholarly activities and foci (the word and the text, the micro and the macro) might
                     be integrated in or across future digital scholarly environments. </div>

                     (and their interlinking) now compel editors of early modern play texts to rethink

                     contemporary readers might find obscure, but also identify words that Shakespeare’s
                     contemporaries would have found unfamiliar, and which therefore prompt closer
                     examination of the speeches and scenes in which these unfamiliar (or “hard”) words

                     Digital Resources and the Arden 3 <cite class="title italic">Cymbeline</cite>,” begins by
                     pointing out the reliance of editors of Shakespeare on the <cite class="title italic">Oxford
                        English Dictionary</cite> (<cite class="title italic">OED</cite>) in determining the
                     uniqueness of Shakespeare’s deployment and development of English vocabulary and
                     word usage, and the reliance of the <cite class="title italic">OED</cite> on Shakespeare (and
                     his editors) as a source for new usages of words and new coinages — the so-called
                     “<cite class="title italic">OED</cite> Loop.” One way around this loop is the <cite class="title italic">Early English Books Online-Text Creation Partnership</cite> (<cite class="title italic">EEBO-TCP</cite>), comprising (as of July 2016), 60,331 texts coded for searching,
                     which Wayne uses in conjunction with <cite class="title italic">LEME</cite> and the <cite class="title italic">OED</cite> to “assist in the recovery of words once thought to be
                     errors in early texts, correct claims for coinages, clarify occluded meanings, and
                     detect the most prevalent forms and spellings” [<a class="ref" href="#jensted2020">Jensted and Roberts-Smith 2020</a>, 15].
                     (As the following essay by Lancashire and Tersigni notes, as of 2018, <cite class="title italic">LEME</cite> comprised about “665,000 word-entries in 199 lexical
                     works from about 1475 to 1702,” with <cite class="title italic">LEME</cite> and the <cite class="title italic">OED</cite> “overlap[ping] by less that 5% in the quotations they
                     offer” [<a class="ref" href="#jensted2020">Jensted and Roberts-Smith 2020</a>, 29]). Wayne
                     proceeds to demonstrate how such documentary editing is done using specific examples
                     from <cite class="title italic">Cymbeline</cite>, in the process — even if only provisionally,
                     given the material still forthcoming on these resources — revealing doubtful
                     editorial emendations, clarifying cruxes in the interpretation of phrases, calling
                     into question Shakespeare as the coiner of certain words and word usages, recovering
                     often downplayed or not fully appreciated sexual meanings, and determining the usual
                     spelling of a proper name (it’s <cite class="title italic">Innogen</cite>, not <cite class="title italic">Imogen</cite>). As Wayne points out: “Both databases enable forms of
                     recovery and argument that were barely possible a decade or two ago and are of
                     immense help to an editor” [<a class="ref" href="#jensted2020">Jensted and Roberts-Smith 2020</a>, 24] who wants
                     to do a historically sensitive analysis of Shakespeare’s use of language.</div>

                  <div class="ptext" id="p5">Ian Lancashire and Elisa Tersigni’s “Shakespeare’s Hard Words, and Our Hard Senses,”
                     like Wayne’s essay, shows how <cite class="title italic">LEME</cite> can provide more
                     historically accurate and more coherent glosses on Shakespeare words. Noting that
                     “no editors have yet annotated Shakespeare’s works for the relative difficulty of
                     their words to his contemporaries” [<a class="ref" href="#jensted2020">Jensted and Roberts-Smith 2020</a>, 27],
                     they use <cite class="title italic">LEME</cite> to explore how Shakespeare’s contemporary
                     audiences understood his language and how that affected the perception of his
                     characters, focusing on <cite class="title italic">Richard III</cite> and <cite class="title italic">The
                        Tempest</cite>. They note a marked difference in what words contemporary editors
                     gloss and what words were considered “hard” by those who created glossaries in the
                     early modern period, and compare the differing deployment of hard words in the
                     speeches of Richmond and Richard to their troops before the Battle of Bosworth,
                     which, they argue, Shakespeare employed innovatively to “illuminate his
                     characters” [<a class="ref" href="#jensted2020">Jensted and Roberts-Smith 2020</a>, 28]. Using the <cite class="title italic">Hard Word
                        Annotator</cite>, a <cite class="title italic">LEME</cite> tool that accepts plaintext
                     versions of modern-spelling Early Modern texts and identifies the hard words in
                     them, they analyze the entirety of <cite class="title italic">The Tempest</cite> “to test
                     whether hard words are used consistently as part of the characterization,”
                     concluding that the “percentage of hard words used by characters reflects their
                     personality, occupation, race, gender, and social status” [<a class="ref" href="#jensted2020">Jensted and Roberts-Smith 2020</a>, both 32]. The bookish
                     Prospero, perhaps unsurprisingly, emerges as the leader in the use of hard words,
                     which Lancashire and Tersigni cleverly suggest explains Prospero’s repeated
                     interruption of his recounting of his past life in Act 1, Scene 2: to confirm that
                     Miranda (and the audience) are still paying attention to a speech peppered with
                     baffling words. Their analysis also supports the decision by some editors to
                     reassign to Prospero a speech (also in Act 1, Scene 2) assigned to Miranda in the
                     First Folio, given that the frequency of hard words is more in character with
                     Prospero’s vocabulary than his daughter’s.</div>

                     Gilly-vors”), and, in the latter, a comparison of hard words in <cite class="title italic">Hamlet</cite> against the diachronic evidence of the “enfranchisement” of hard
                     words in the English “mother tongue.” As with Lancashire and Tersigni’s analysis of
                     Richmond’s speech in <cite class="title italic">Richard III</cite>, Bernath argues that, in
                     Hamlet’s soliloquies, Shakespeare provides glosses, often synonyms, for (still) hard
                     words within the speeches themselves.</div>

                  <div class="ptext" id="p7">The essays of Part I together offer a compelling case for the important insights that
                     can result from textual databases whose encoding, data structures, and search tools
                     can enable sophisticated and wide-ranging linguistic research queries. The remaining
                     four essays (besides the Estill and Silva essay previously mentioned) broaden the
                     scope beyond words and language, shifting, in effect, from a ‘<cite class="title italic">LEME</cite> orientation’ to an ‘<cite class="title italic">ISE</cite> orientation.’ Andrew
                     Griffin’s “Text, Performance, and Multidisciplinarity: On a Digital Edition of <cite class="title italic">King Leir</cite>,” describes how the capaciousness of digital
                     editions enables the <cite class="title italic">Queen’s Men Editions</cite> (QME) to avoid the
                     prescriptivism that invariably manifests in print versions of performance editions,
                     given their limited ability to incorporate a full range of production examples.
                     Instead of a transhistorical or ahistorical or ideal conceptualization of a
                     performance of a play, the <cite class="title italic">QME</cite> of <cite class="title italic">King
                        Leir</cite>, by collaborating with a team who staged a production of the play, can
                     link to its specific production details (in the form of images and videos) within
                     the context of production notes that detail possible performance options considered,
                     discussion about these options, and what option was eventually chosen. Toby Malone’s
                     “A Digital Parallel-Text Approach to Performance Historiography” describes a

                     enabling comparative analysis of the Quarto 1 and Folio versions of <cite class="title italic">Richard III</cite>, plus 10 historical promptbooks and performance
                     editions ranging from the 18<span class="hi superscript">th</span> to 20<span class="hi superscript">th</span> centuries relating to historically significant
                     Shakespearean actors such as Colly Cibber, David Garrick, John Philip Kemble, Edmund
                     Kean, William Charles Macready, and Henry Irving. Malone argues that “[o]ne simple
                     and ubiquitous digital tool — a spreadsheet — makes the systematic, large-scale, and
                     flexible comparative close reading of performance texts possible ” [<a class="ref" href="#jensted2020">Jensted and Roberts-Smith 2020</a>, 122]
                     in ways that print parallel texts cannot.
                     While some digital humanities scholars might scoff at the use of a general-use
                     spreadsheet program for a (prototype) digital edition, such a tool has the advantage
                     of realizing and ensuring some degree of longevity to an digital edition than one
                     created through a digital humanities-specific comparison and collation tool like the
                     now-defunct <cite class="title italic">Juxta Commons</cite>, a web service that was until
                     recently offered by <cite class="title italic">NINE</cite>S (<cite class="title italic">Networked

                     Critics: Toward <cite class="title italic">Rhetorical Schematics</cite>,” can be regarded as
                     occupying a transitory place between a focus on word analysis and a focus on textual
                     editing, given its focus on rhetorical figures. In the essay, the authors discuss
                     their creation of a Python script designed to process plaintext corpora like Martin
                     Mueller’s <cite class="title italic">Shakespeare His Contemporaries</cite> (comprising
                     Shakespeare’s plays along with most of the plays written within a generation before
                     and after his active career as a playwright) to find a rhetorical scheme called <em class="emph">gradatio</em>, which is a series of <em class="emph">anadiploses</em>. The essay cites an example of <em class="emph">gradatio</em>
                     from <em class="emph">As You Like It</em> (Act 5, Scene 2): “For your brother and
                     my sister not sooner met but they <em class="emph">looked</em>; no sooner <em class="emph">looked</em> but they <em class="emph">loved</em>; no sooner <em class="emph">loved</em> but they <em class="emph">sighed</em>; no sooner <em class="emph">sighed</em> but they asked one another the <em class="emph">reason</em>; not sooner knew the <em class="emph">reason</em> but they sought
                     the remedy; and in these degrees have they made a pair of stairs to marriage.” While
                     the Python script itself is not included, a fairly clear description of it is: its
                     goal was “to break text files into sentences, to tokenize their words and lemmatize
                     their tokens, to insert clause breaks based on punctuation, and finally to use
                     Regular Expressions to look for matching lemmas…within four words of the clause
                     breaks” [Jensted, Kaethler, and Roberts-Smith 2020, 147]. The script identified 114
                     instances of what it was told was <em class="emph">gradatio</em> in 400 plays for
                     analysis and evaluation, leading the researchers to contemplate not only the
                     efficacy of the script, but their critical understanding of <em class="emph">graditio</em> itself. The authors concede that there might be instances of <em class="emph">gradatio</em> this script did not identify but argue that their
                     modest purpose was to obtain “more complete results than we could gather without the
                     algorithm.” They also concede that such scripts appear to only be effective at
                     identifying rhetorical schemes “of direct repetition and variation” [<a class="ref" href="#jensted2020">Jensted and Roberts-Smith 2020</a>, 147]
                     of words or phrases, and so cannot be
                     used to locate a broad spectrum of rhetorical figures in digital texts corpora.</div>

                     for Linked Editions,” which also takes up the topic of integration/interoperability,

                     Jakacki is alert to both the possibilities and the pitfalls of interoperable,
                     networked digital editions. The key challenge the essay addresses is “to what degree
                     we should engage in acts of editorial disruption that allow us to move forward
                     towards infinity [the infinity represented by other potential editions] while
                     maintaining editorial stability across digital projects” [<a class="ref" href="#jensted2020">Jensted and Roberts-Smith 2020</a>, 158].
                     As she considers her <cite class="title italic">Henry VIII</cite>
                     edition beyond the additional TEI encoding she has used and that she demonstrates
                     can be valuable for aiding an editor’s critical interpretation, and starts to
                     consider it as part of a network that ties it in with digital resources like <cite class="title italic">MoEML</cite> and <cite class="title italic">DRE</cite>, a digital edition of a
                     single play starts to stretch out towards an unfinishable infinity: Jakacki makes
                     reference to how a non-peer reviewed edition of Samuel Rowley’s <cite class="title italic">When You See Me You Know Me</cite> that she intended to include in her edition of
                     <cite class="title italic">Henry VIII</cite> (presumably as an appendix) was, with the
                     launch of <cite class="title italic">DRE</cite>, re-envisioned as a peer-reviewed edition of
                     Rowley’s play for <cite class="title italic">DRE</cite> that would serve as a companion edition
                     to her <cite class="title italic">ISE</cite> of <cite class="title italic">Henry VIII</cite>. She also
                     mentions the idea of creating a shared Personography of all the characters that
                     appear across <cite class="title italic">ISE</cite>, <cite class="title italic">QME</cite>, and <cite class="title italic">DRE</cite>. The challenge Jakacki points out, with legitimate
                     concern, is that considering the creation of an edition in light of how it can be
                     interoperable with other digital resources can significantly add to an editor’s task
                     and timelines to completion. Indeed, such work can potentially take an editor far
                     from their initial interest: the text(s) of a Shakespeare play. But where does
                     editing end in an interoperable digital environment?</div>

                     primarily interested in the technical side of digital humanities may find the essays
                     less than forthcoming (Ullyot and Bradley, for example, do not provide the actual
                     Python script they created, and so one cannot judge whether it could be modified or
                     extended to detect similar or other textual structures) and vague on future
                     directions and modes of development, especially regarding cyberinfrastructures for
                     interoperability, there is solid content and provocative ideas in this collection
                     about the possible paths (or perhaps path?) to making Shakespeare’s texts digitally
                     accessible in all their complexity as well as early modern English texts and culture
                     more broadly. If the editors’ claim that Shakespeare is the test bed for new
                     developments in digital humanities is true, we should continue to look to the
                     digital remediation of the author’s old texts for inspiring new digital tools.</div>
