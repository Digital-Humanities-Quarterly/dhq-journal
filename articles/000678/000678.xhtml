                  <p>This article summarises the aims, methods, information architecture, outputs, and
                     innovations of the Australian Cultural Data Engine 
                     (ACD-Engine), a project that harnesses leading cultural databases to build bridges
                     to research, industry, and government. The project 
                     investigates digital heritage collections, data ontologies, and interoperability,
                     building an information architecture to enhance the 
                     open sharing of Australian cultural data. Working with a cross-disciplinary team,
                     the ACD-Engine establishes conceptual and technical 
                     frameworks for better understanding the platforms and uses of cultural data across
                     a range of national and international contexts. This 
                     new cyber-infrastructure advances cultural data aggregation and interoperability whilst
                     prioritising data quality and domain 
                     distinctiveness to answer new research questions across disciplines. As such, the
                     ACD-Engine provides a novel approach to data 
                     management and data modelling in the arts and humanities that has significant implications
                     for digital collections, digital humanities, 
                     and data analytics.

                  <div class="ptext" id="p1">The Australian Cultural Data Engine (ACD-Engine) is a multidisciplinary project that
                     harnesses leading Australian cultural databases to 
                     analyse cultural production, artistic networks, and the socio-economic implications
                     and uses of arts and cultural data in the Australian 
                     context and internationally. Commencing in August 2021, the project received two years'
                     funding through the Australian Research Council 
                     (ARC) Linkage, Equipment, Infrastructure and Facilities (LIEF) program. Based at the
                     University of Melbourne, the 
                     ACD-Engine gathered a collaborative team of humanities and social science researchers,
                     data scientists, data engineers, and data 
                     visualisation specialists from the University of Melbourne, the University of Queensland, the 
                     University of New South Wales, Swinburne University of Technology, Curtin University, 
                     RMIT University, the University of Newcastle, Flinders University, and 
                     King's College London.

                  <div class="ptext" id="p2">The core ACD-Engine team in Melbourne worked closely with institutional partners and domain experts from diverse cultural
                     
                     data backgrounds (architecture, design, performing arts, and visual arts) to foster
                     improved data analytics and cross-disciplinary data 
                     sharing within the Australian arts and cultural sector. In line with approaches emerging
                     in Europe and the UK, 
                     as well as other research and data-intensive contexts in Australia, we investigated the data quality and data ontologies 
                     that inform Australia's cultural data landscape. To coordinate an interoperable model for linking, interpreting,
                     and using 
                     heterogeneous digital heritage data, the project team built a Research Software Engineering
                     (RSE) capacity that could interrogate the 
                     potential of more robust, larger-scale understandings of arts and cultural data in
                     future. The ACD-Engine has also examined how data 
                     analytics can provide meaningful insights to issues of national significance including
                     employment, heritage, and cultural policy.

                  <div class="ptext" id="p3">This article contributes to a growing genre of scholarship about collaborative research
                     design within the digital humanities, including

                     article we describe the project's objectives, design, and multi-stage approach to
                     the extraction, aggregation, and analysis of a wide 
                     range of cultural data. Reporting on the organisation of research design and activity
                     has been standard practice in government and the 
                     commercial sector for decades and helps to establish standardised and stable frameworks
                     for research 
                     [<a class="ref" href="#desfray_raymond_2014">Desfray and Raymond 2014</a>]. Continuing this developing best practice, we outline our project's aims and objectives,
                     
                     contextualise these among some major national and international cultural data aggregation
                     projects, and explain how we assembled our 
                     team. It was essential to establish principles for open data sharing among our project
                     partners, so this process is also explained. As 
                     the central outcome of the project, we then provide a detailed overview of the ACD-Engine
                     Architecture Construction Workflow that has 
                     resulted in the ACD-Engine information architecture prototype, as a significant contribution
                     towards a national data architecture for 
                     Australian artistic and cultural collections. Developing from our work in data exploration
                     and enrichment, we outline some cultural data 
                     outputs emerging from the ACD-Engine that illustrate how the discrete datasets developed
                     by the project offer productive applications in 
                     humanities research, creative industries, and cultural policy. Finally, we summarise
                     the project's key outcomes and suggest possible 
                     future directions for the generation, interoperability, and application of Australian
                     cultural data that might build upon the 
                     ACD-Engine's work.

                     “cyber-infrastructure” of humanities knowledges 
                     and expertise, but researchers and policymakers often lack the data literacies that
                     would enable this abundance of cultural data to

                        National e-Research Collaboration Tools and Researchers programme. The design framework

                        consisting of “the various annotations, tags, links, associations, ratings, reviews, and comments
                        produced

                        Australia also has a major centralised data repository, the Australian Data Archive (ADA).
                        The ADA provides a central 
                        searchable catalogue of more than 5,000 social science datasets. It holds data from
                        surveys, opinion polls, and censuses from 
                        Australia and the Asia-Pacific region

                        arts and culture, and its uncurated, user-submitted datasets are not necessarily immediately
                        suitable for computational analysis. A

                        bespoke technical approaches (often outsourced to private companies), which have led
                        to institution-specific issues relating to 
                        design, access, maintenance, and use of data. Inevitably, the diversity of cultural
                        data collections reflects different histories of 
                        data collection, management, curation, and maintenance, and can lead to intergenerational
                        and sometimes competitive misalignments of 
                        the potentiality in cultural data. Similarly, and in spite of national and international
                        calls for open data policies (see e.g.,

                        limited by idiosyncratic data structures, short-term political support, or survey

                     examine the larger 
                     problem space in a way that did not centre on acquiring more data, developing more
                     tools, or building another aggregation platform. 
                     Instead, the project undertook a detailed exploration of heterogeneous cultural data
                     collections, each with unique histories and 
                     infrastructures. We thus began with the same broad intent as the “Foundation” TaNC projects

                     databases with 
                     fewer institutional or historical barriers to cooperation (e.g., those committed to
                     an open API). In so doing, the project focused on 
                     assembling discrete, cleaned, augmented, and merged datasets that could become usable
                     in a variety of computational contexts and yet

                     data framework or model, this project sits 
                     alongside major initiatives that support open data in research. Before beginning technical
                     work, we needed to agree on how to share data 
                     between the project partners and the ACD-Engine central team as well as how to attribute
                     authorship to individual and co-authored 
                     datasets and data-informed publications. A central concern was achieving a balance
                     between energising new research by working across 
                     multiple data sources and making raw data available for wider users, while also honouring
                     the intellectual labour embedded in and the 
                     ongoing development of each partner database. Each partner database was built on unique
                     data that had been collected by domain experts 
                     and, as such, carried within it their labour, both conceptual and quotidian (who among
                     us has not dedicated extraordinary amounts of 
                     time to transcribing, annotating, and generating metadata!). Conversely, since each
                     database was at least partially funded by national 
                     research agencies and often supplemented by volunteer contributors, the data was in
                     a sense already public and designed to be shared 
                     with arts and humanities researchers as well as the public at large. Therefore, much
                     like other data aggregation and interdisciplinary 
                     projects, the ACD-Engine faced both the potentials and pitfalls of sharing data [<a class="ref" href="#smithies_millar_thomson_2015">Smithies, Millar, and Thomson 2015</a>] 
                     [<a class="ref" href="#millar_et_al_2018">Millar et al. 2018</a>].

                  <div class="ptext" id="p27">With these concerns in mind, we sought to develop a data-sharing agreement that outlined
                     a pipeline for recognition of contributors to 
                     ACD-Engine datasets and collaborative papers, as well as a model for citation of data
                     sources, that would adhere to recently released 
                     recommendations from the Australian Research Council for authorship of collaborative
                     publications. After surveying the existing 
                     literature and participating in an Australian Research Data Commons laboratory on
                     this topic, it became clear that most projects share 
                     general principles, but there was no well-established data sharing policy standard
                     that would meet our needs. Our final data sharing 
                     policy, one component of which is represented in the visual summary below, has enabled
                     us to rapidly determine responsibilities for work 
                     outputs and to appropriately assign authorship and acknowledge additional contributors.

                     is long-standing, initially based in the domain of 
                     digital libraries. The OAI-PMH protocol, one of the most widely deployed technologies
                     for digital library interoperability aimed to 
                     provide a very simple method for harvesting data from primarily digital libraries,
                     but it has several key shortcomings 
                     [<a class="ref" href="#van_de_sompel_et_al_2004">van de Sompel et al. 2004</a>]. As Carl Lagoze points out, OAI-PMH is “based on the premise 
                     that discovery occurs within the boundaries of the digital library”, thus “relying on a technology distinct 
                     from that in the mainstream web architecture”. OAI-PMH also presupposes that “structured metadata” are 
                     “necessary and fundamental to a digital library environment, and that the Dublin Core
                     vocabulary is the key to 
                     ‘semantic’ interoperability” [<a class="ref" href="#lagoze_2010">Lagoze 2010</a>, 216]. The tangible effect of these 
                     limitations is the prioritization of simplicity and efficiency at the cost of functionality
                     and robustness, as well as limited ability 
                     to implement feedback mechanisms to correct unusable or poor-quality data.

                  <div class="ptext" id="p31">Two core aims of the ACD-Engine were to improve the quality of cultural data and better
                     support the interoperability of cultural data 
                     across new disciplinary bridges and in new contexts outside the traditional institutional
                     repository domain. Our technique diverges from 
                     OAI-PMH in several ways. First, our approach is dynamic real-time access, working
                     in real time rather than on harvested, static data, 
                     using a method similar to the more sophisticated Z39.50 protocol [<a class="ref" href="#lynch_1997">Lynch 1997</a>]. Second, the access module for each 
                     collection normalises the format of data items, which again OAI-PMH does not require
                     but Z39.50 does. Neither difference, however, 
                     addresses the problems of data quality that pervade many collections accessible via
                     OAI-PMH [<a class="ref" href="#warwick_et_al_2009">Warwick et al. 2009</a>]. The 
                     ACD-Engine's current access modules can be set to discount incomplete (meta-)data,
                     and we anticipate that future iterations of the 
                     ACD-Engine platform will provide feedback mechanisms for data quality, in line with
                     emerging best practice in digital library

                     and enhanced by an integrated model. Working 
                     across multiple, heterogeneous data sources, we faced the challenges of bespoke and
                     discipline-specific metadata, varying levels of

                     what is delivered so conveniently through our

                     how to identify the relationships between diverse concepts across multiple artistic
                     disciplines, required close interrogation of the 
                     databases as knowledge domains that have been shaped by the affordances of their specific
                     information architecture, as well as detailed

                     Data Transformation stage involved creating an aggregated data dictionary that explained
                     the attributes and values for each data source, 
                     as well as a data mapping plan that outlined how the information from different sources
                     combined into the ACDEA.<a class="noteRef" href="#d4e1245">[6]</a>

                  <div class="ptext" id="p35">Having extracted data from our partner databases, the ACD-Engine team then enriched
                     selected subsets of the data. First, we asked the 
                     discipline experts on our research team to enter new data for selected key attributes
                     that had not been captured in the original 
                     databases but would facilitate more robust analyses across the ACD-Engine unified
                     datasets. In some cases, as much as 90% of a single 
                     attribute was missing from a dataset. For instance, while career commencement dates
                     and birth dates were commonly available in the 
                     “People” entity, very few career end dates or death dates were listed.

                  <div class="ptext" id="p36">We also cleaned the data by identifying and correcting errors and inconsistencies.
                     For example, due to the nature of integrating data 
                     from multiple sources, similar records with minor variations often appeared in multiple
                     places. It was crucial to identify and handle 
                     duplicated records appropriately to avoid skewing analysis results. We used artificial
                     intelligence and machine learning to accomplish 
                     these tasks, but for the most part undertook deduplication with a mix of simple automation
                     and manual correction. Future development of 
                     AI in this space would be fruitful, particularly when working with larger volumes
                     of data. Through this process, our data science team 
                     shared insights with our data partners and experts, who engaged in a generative back-and-forth
                     process around definitions, gaps, 
                     opportunities, and limitations.

                     models and entities 
                     (or, in non-digital language, cultural concepts) that shaped the different cultural
                     databases. A key finding was the extent to which 
                     each database was structured around a meaningful yet discrete entity<a class="noteRef" href="#d4e1269">[7]</a>: AusStage around events, DAAO around 
                     artist biographies, DAQA around oral history interviews, and so on. Each database
                     contained a wealth of front-facing data on people and
                     organisations — indeed, both DAAO and AusStage contribute to the “People and Organisations” sub-platform in Trove, which also draws in 
                     other collections such as the Australian Women's Register and the Encyclopaedia of
                     Australian Science — but the level of information 
                     and detail among these entities was markedly different across each database. We also
                     found, on the other hand, that the public-facing 
                     structure of each database to a degree obscured the richness of data entities and
                     relationships that existed embedded in their systems. 
                     DAQA, for instance, has front-end browse capacities for “Architects” (people), 
                     “Firms” (organisations) and “Projects” (works), but also contained substantial 
                     information that aligned with the events and places that appeared in the front ends
                     of DAAO and AusStage.

                  <div class="ptext" id="p38">A key aim for the ACDEA, therefore, was to ensure the people, organisations, works,
                     and events entities across the databases were 
                     interoperable, which necessitated a fixed, consistent set of minimum attributes. For
                     the person entity, for example, which invites 
                     biographical analysis, we recommend a minimum of first and last name, as well as date
                     and place of birth and death. Inevitably, as 
                     mentioned above, many of the people listed in our partner databases did not have all
                     of these basic attributes; as appropriate, we 
                     supplemented selected entries where new information was available (the “top 500” or “top 100”), and/or based our analyses on 
                     the most complete entries [<a class="ref" href="#cutter_fensham_sumner_2023">Cutter, Fensham, and Sumner 2023</a>]. Similarly, the interrogation of arts organisations and their 
                     histories required the collection of changing organisational names, establishment
                     dates, and locations — again, assembling a baseline 
                     of accurate data points was essential for comparative extraction and analysis. Each
                     entity inevitably generated a range of connections 
                     to other entities, which required their own set of attributes. Ultimately, we established
                     standardised definitions and attributes for 
                     eight entities: Person, Organisation, Work, Recognition, Place, Resource, and Relationship.
                     Each unified ACDEA entity corresponded to 
                     an entry atributed to a somewhat different name in our source datasets.

                              DAAO, which is a person-oriented data collection, whereas AusStage has a comprehensive

                              between the data models that are 
                              significant and add value to the data, while integrating similar data attributes and
                              unifying common elements to ensure 
                              consistency and usability. This approach helps to capture the unique characteristics
                              of each data source and ensure that ACDEA

                              “person” entity in ACDEA, and a common attribute called  “career”. Reading 
                              across these multiple elements of career allows ACDEA to capture as much information
                              as possible while still maintaining

                        significance of each entity in disciplinary 
                        histories. Each of the terms we use for these entities, we argue, has a firm basis

                        an intuitive, difficult-to-dispute accessibility. We arrived at these terms following
                        extensive debates about the meaning of various 
                        concepts (for the results of one discussion, see [<a class="ref" href="#cutter_fensham_sumner_2023">Cutter, Fensham, and Sumner 2023</a>]). Simultaneously, this data ontology

                     Careers, and Creativity; Cultural Hotspots and 
                     Local Scenes; Cultural Diffusion and Arts Diplomacy; and Environmental Politics and
                     the Arts. Each theme aligned with the high-level 
                     entities of our information architecture for the purposes of data extraction and analysis:
                     for instance, questions about gender and 
                     careers were to be answered through interrogation of the “People” entity of the ACDEA.  The first two themes 
                     in particular became fruitful sites for data experimentation, guided by specific research
                     questions raised by our domain experts. The 
                     core team of data scientists transformed data throughout this process by producing
                     data “experiments” that examined the robustness 
                     of specific data attributes within each dataset and showcasing them to research partners,
                     who provided feedback and drove further

                     a national data architecture for Australian 
                     cultural collections. The prototype information architecture, knowledge base, and
                     RSE capabilities developed by the ACD-Engine pave 
                     the way for future work on Australian cultural data, including record unification
                     (harmonising duplicated records, predicates in 
                     relationships, and place records across multiple data sources), identifying more implicit
                     data, integrating Australian cultural data 
                     with more data sources, and consideration of persistent identifiers for “Person” records across national

                     and inter-governmental levels extends  
                     expectations of greater utilisation of public resources. Greater integration should
                     not, however, diminish the important role that 
                     distinctive databases and curated collections have to their source communities and
                     disciplinary experts. Given the volume and 
                     complexity of cultural data in national collections, dissolving barriers between one
                     collection and another, as this project has 
                     identified, requires careful understanding of how cultural data might be organised
                     beyond each collection.

                  <div class="ptext" id="p55">If the goal of national collections involves expanding and enhancing (trans)-national
                     data resources, we would assert that more 
                     priority should be given to developing robust information architectures. As we have
                     found, cultural data sharing and interoperability 
                     is rich terrain for the digital humanities and will be more so as new cyber-infrastructures,
                     including artificial intelligence, 
                     transform the ways we engage with, reflect upon, and utilise cultural data. If we
                     are to grow research impact and public engagement, 
                     national collection projects ought to strenuously pursue best-practice data-sharing
                     approaches, particularly responsible attribution, 
                     documentation, and data contextualisation by collection owners [<a class="ref" href="#loukissas_2019">Loukissas 2019</a>] [<a class="ref" href="#lee_2023">Lee 2023</a>] 
                     [<a class="ref" href="#alkemade_et_al_2023">Alkemade et al. 2023</a>]. Without so doing, we risk developing an array of increasingly disparate data structures
                     and 
                     infrastructures that will inhibit both disciplinary and interdisciplinary research.
                     The intensive (and unavoidably expensive) 
                     investment of human labour and expertise is critical in this process to safeguard
                     database quality and disciplinary distinctiveness 
                     against the oversimplification too often wrought by external metadata structures,
                     especially as they are increasingly implemented by 
                     machines.

                  <div class="ptext" id="p56">In this context, the challenges we face for future research in this space are principally
                     structural. Research infrastructure for the 
                     Australian arts and humanities is maturing, but national and university-based funding
                     remains largely tied to short-term projects like 
                     the ACD-Engine, rather than medium- or long-term workforce and infrastructure development.
                     As longer term strategies slowly emerge, 
                     researchers (particularly those early in their careers) will continue to repeatedly
                     enter and exit the field as they pursue employment 
                     and funding, making it difficult to build a consistent approach to infrastructure
                     development for cultural data research. The 
                     ACD-Engine's exploratory work has already seeded new investment and opportunities
                     for further research collaboration that recognises 
                     the central role of data curation and aggregation in cultural collections to further
                     re-use, as well as knowledge exchange across 
                     industries, universities, and governments.

                  <div class="ptext" id="p57">Considering the future use of the ACD-Engine within the Australian and international
                     cultural data landscape, a number of possible 
                     scenarios present themselves. Though the ACDEA is based around text and metadata,
                     the process through which it was developed could be 
                     fruitfully applied to other digitalised media (images, film, audio recordings, digital
                     modelling). The ACD-Engine's federated model, 
                     in which nodes of disciplinary expertise and data collections interface with a central
                     hub of data science, information science, and 
                     digital humanities experts, could facilitate ongoing partnerships across disciplines
                     to further demonstrate the utility and analytical 
                     power of working across multiple collections in historical analysis of cultural production.
                     Future funding applications might focus on 
                     the testing and application of software tools (artificial intelligence, machine learning,
                     3D/4D modelling, immersive VR) in the 
                     enhancement and analysis of Australian cultural data, or on new collaborative projects
                     between researchers, industries, and 
                     governments to explore the quality of insights available from cultural data. At the
                     same time, we hope that funders will invest in 
                     maintaining and improving Australia's ecosystem of cultural databases, many of which rest principally on the 
                     custodianship of individual researchers and the current goodwill of university- or
                     community-based hosting providers. This project 
                     shows the potential of these databases, the necessity of human labour to extract and
                     interpret it, and how much may be lost should 
                     these databases disappear.
