            <head>Towards a National Data Architecture for Cultural Collections: Designing the Australian Cultural Data Engine</head>
            <div>
               <head>ABSTRACT</head>
               <p>This article summarises the aims, methods, information architecture, outputs and innovations of the Australian Cultural Data Engine (ACD-Engine), a project that harnessed leading cultural databases to build bridges to research, industry, and government. The project investigated digital heritage collections, data ontologies, interoperability, and built an information architecture to enhance the open sharing of Australian cultural data. Working with a cross-disciplinary team, the ACD-Engine established conceptual and technical frameworks for better understanding the platforms and uses of cultural data across a range of national and international contexts. This new cyber-infrastructure advances cultural data aggregation and interoperability whilst prioritising data quality and domain distinctiveness to answer new research questions across disciplines. As such, the ACD-Engine provides a novel approach to data management and data modelling in the arts and humanities that has significant implications for digital collections, digital humanities, and data analytics.</p>

               <head>INTRODUCTION</head>
               <p>The Australian Cultural Data Engine (ACD-Engine) is a multidisciplinary project that harnesses leading Australian cultural databases to analyse cultural production, artistic networks, and the socio-economic implications and uses of arts and cultural data in the Australian context and internationally. Commencing in August 2021, the project received two years’ funding through the Australian Research Council (ARC) Linkage, Equipment, Infrastructure and Facilities (LIEF) program. Based at the University of Melbourne, the ACD-Engine gathered a collaborative team of humanities and social science researchers, data scientists, data engineers, and data visualisation specialists from The University of Melbourne, The University of Queensland, University of New South Wales, Swinburne University of Technology, Curtin University, RMIT University, The University of Newcastle, Flinders University, and King’s College London. </p>
               <p>The core ACD-Engine team in Melbourne worked closely with institutional partners and domain experts from diverse cultural data backgrounds (architecture, design, performing arts and visual arts) to foster improved data analytics and cross-disciplinary data sharing within the Australian arts and cultural sector. In line with approaches emerging in Europe and the UK, and other research and data-intensive contexts in Australia, we investigated the data quality and data ontologies that inform Australia’s cultural data landscape. To coordinate an interoperable model for linking, interpreting, and using heterogeneous digital heritage data, the project team built a Research Software Engineering (RSE) capacity that could interrogate the potential of more robust, larger-scale understandings of arts and cultural data in future. The ACD-Engine has also examined how data analytics can provide meaningful insights to issues of national significance including employment, heritage, and cultural policy. </p>
               <p>This article contributes to a growing genre of scholarship about collaborative research design within the digital humanities, including Ahnert et al. (2023) and McGillivray et al. (2020). Writing from a cross-disciplinary perspective, in this article we describe the project’s objectives, design, and multi-stage approach to the extraction, aggregation, and analysis of a wide range of cultural data. Reporting on the organisation of research design and activity has been standard practice in government and the commercial sector for decades and helps to establish standardised and stable frameworks for research (Desfray and Raymond 2014). Continuing this developing best practice, we outline our project’s aims and objectives, contextualise these among some major national and international cultural data aggregation projects, and explain how we assembled our team. It was essential to establish principles for open data sharing among our project partners, so this process is also explained. As the central outcome of the project, we then provide a detailed overview of the ACD-Engine Architecture Construction Workflow that has resulted in the ACD-Engine information architecture prototype, as a significant contribution towards a national data architecture for Australian artistic and cultural collections. Developing from our work in data exploration and enrichment, we outline some cultural data outputs emerging from the ACD-Engine that illustrate how the discrete datasets developed by the project offer productive applications in humanities research, creative industries, and cultural policy. Finally, we summarise the project’s key outcomes, and suggest possible future directions for the generation, interoperability, and application of Australian cultural data that might build upon the ACD-Engine’s work.      </p>

               <head>AIMS AND WORK PROGRAMS</head>
               <p>Arts and cultural data accumulate in the catalogues of collecting institutions (e.g. museums, art galleries, and member organisations), bespoke disciplinary datasets (e.g. biographical indexes, or catalogues), curated digital repositories and archives (e.g. specialist libraries, or websites), and in a range of smaller-scale heritage, community, and creative industry organisations (Whitelaw 2015). It also exists in government reporting, census and statistical modelling of culture, and online digital platforms providing links to cultural events. These disparate systems represent a ‘cyber-infrastructure’ of humanities knowledges and expertise, but researchers and policymakers often lack the data literacies that would enable this abundance of cultural data to substantively contribute to global social and policy transformations (Smithies 2017).  </p>
               <p>The ACD-Engine emerged from recognition of the fragmented nature of cultural data collections and the different computational models upon which they have been built, and the distinctiveness, sensitivities, and vulnerabilities of specialist data repositories. In response to this, the project’s central aims were:  </p>
               <list rend="numbered">
                  <item>Improve the quality of existing Australian cultural data across a range of partner databases and cultural disciplines; </item>
                  <item>Support an expansion in the accessibility, use, and interoperability of cultural data in research, industry and government contexts; and</item>
                  <item>Demonstrate how new insights into arts and cultural production can emerge by improving cultural data interoperability across platforms, systems, and regions.  </item>
               </list>
               <p>To achieve these aims, we established the following overlapping programs of work. These programs generally moved from processes concerned with data integration and design to questions of capability, analysis, access, and public impact, but each program was iterative and informed the others as the ACD-Engine project developed.   </p>

                  <head>Cultural Data Aggregation in North America, Europe and the United Kingdom</head>
                  <p>National and international efforts to aggregate humanities databases are reshaping concepts of heritage, creativity, and cultural inclusion in the global sphere (Bettivia and Stainforth 2017; Smithies et al. 2023). However, as Lisa Given, Sara Polkinghorne and Joann Cattlin point out, ‘while cultural data initiatives are growing in number, globally, they lack a cohesive, sustainable, and healthy ecosystem to enable to enable collaboration and sharing across related contexts.’ (Given, Polkinghorne, and Cattlin 2023). Several international models for the expansion and interoperability of cultural data warrant consideration. The DARIAH-DE repository is a digital archive for the long-term preservation of humanities and cultural research data, aggregated across various services and applications (  <ref target="https://repository.de.dariah.eu/search/">https://repository.de.dariah.eu/search/</ref>). Similarly, Europeana PRO makes millions of cultural data assets from European galleries, libraries, archives and museums available for searching and downloading (<ref target="https://pro.europeana.eu/page/datasets">https://pro.europeana.eu/page/datasets</ref>). Similarly, The Digital Repository of Ireland (<ref target="https://dri.ie/about-us/">https://dri.ie/about-us/</ref>) was launched in 2015 to facilitate the ‘preservation, curation, and dissemination of Ireland’s humanities, social sciences, and cultural heritage data.’ In 2020, the United Kingdom launched Towards a National Collection (TaNC), an £18.9 million five-year program of investment aimed at ‘creating a unified virtual national collection’ of the UK’s museums, libraries, galleries and archives, ‘dissolving barriers between different collections’, and ‘opening UK heritage to the world’ (<ref target="https://www.ukri.org/what-we-offer/browse-our-areas-of-investment-and-support/towards-a-national-collection-opening-uk-heritage-to-the-world/">https://www.ukri.org/what-we-offer/browse-our-areas-of-investment-and-support/towards-a-national-collection-opening-uk-heritage-to-the-world/</ref>). Most of these platforms have elected either to combine data into a single unified search engine or to provide a collection of external links. However, seeking to develop best practices for data sharing and data flows, some international aggregation projects and research groups, such as DHARPA ( <ref target="https://dharpa.org/">https://dharpa.org/</ref>), have begun to grapple with how to productively interconnect diverse data sources without flattening the distinctiveness of domain-specific collection ontologies. Another dimension to data aggregation and interoperability is the export and generation of cultural heritage datasets, which until recently has been dominated by the Open Archives Initiative Protocol for Metadata Harvesting (<ref target="https://www.openarchives.org/pmh/">https://www.openarchives.org/pmh/</ref>), discussed in detail under ‘Program B: Technical Design and Methods’ below.</p>

                  <head>Cultural Data Aggregation and Interoperability in Australia</head>
                  <p>In Australia, the most important digital aggregator of cultural data is Trove, the National Library of Australia (NLA)’s search engine, which over the past several decades has evolved into a powerful platform offering access to the NLA’s own collections, as well as other registered collections. While not specifically designed as research cyber-infrastructure, Trove has nevertheless attracted a wide local and international user base, ranging from professional researchers to the general public (Stainforth 2019). Under its People and Organisations portal ( <ref target="https://trove.nla.gov.au/help/categories/people-and-organisations-category">https://trove.nla.gov.au/help/categories/people-and-organisations-category</ref>), Trove currently links to several cultural collections associated with the ACD-Engine, and NLA software developers as well as independent digital humanities experts have produced a range of tools that enable the searching and downloading of curated research datasets. <note> A key innovator in this space is Tim Sherratt, whose GLAM Workbench (<ref target="https://glam-workbench.net/">https://glam-workbench.net/</ref>) and Trove Data Guide (<ref target="https://wragge.github.io/trove-data-guide/home.html">https://wragge.github.io/trove-data-guide/home.html</ref>, in-progress at the time of writing) have been transformative for researchers in this space.</note> Historically, however, it has suffered from inadequate resourcing to maintain and renovate core infrastructure and develop research capability (Jones and Verhoeven 2022).<note> Completed in September 2023, the ‘Trove Enhancements’ project managed by the Australian Research Data Commons improved the Trove pages for researchers and updated the public Trove API to provide better support for Australian HASS researchers (<ref target="https://ardc.edu.au/project/trove-researcher-platform-for-advanced-research/">https://ardc.edu.au/project/trove-researcher-platform-for-advanced-research/</ref>). Trove development remains tied to fixed-term, outcome-focused projects, and ongoing funding is not assured.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>Another important project has been the Humanities Networked Infrastructure (HuNI, <ref target="https://huni.net.au/#/search">https://huni.net.au/</ref>), a platform developed as part of the Australian government’s National e-Research Collaboration Tools and Researchers programme. The design framework of HuNI recognises humanities data as consisting of ‘the various annotations, tags, links, associations, ratings, reviews, and comments produced during the humanities research process, together with the semantic “entities” to which these annotations refer: concepts, persons, places, and events’ (Burrows 2011). HuNI’s data-centred workflow, in a similar way to Trove, focuses on a ‘discovery environment’ that enables browsing and searching across disparate data sources, though it does not house the data itself (Burrows 2013; Burrows and Verhoeven 2016). Australia also has a major centralised data repository, The Australian Data Archive (ADA). The ADA provides a central searchable catalogue of more than 5000 social science datasets, and holds data from surveys, opinion polls and censuses from Australia and the Asia-Pacific region (https://ada.edu.au/about-ada/). However, the ADA hosts very little material on arts and culture, and its uncurated, user-submitted datasets are not necessarily immediately suitable for computational analysis. A more encouraging development in the Australian cultural data landscape has been the formation of an Indigenous Data Network in 2018 (https://mspgh.unimelb.edu.au/centres-institutes/onemda/research-group/indigenous-data-network), and, more recently, national investment in a HASS and Indigenous Research Data Commons within the Australian Research Data Commons (ARDC). These projects justly champion the importance of Aboriginal and Torres Straits Islander custodianship of rich cultural traditions as they are expressed in data and housed in cultural collections. </p>
                  <p>In Australia, as much as in Europe, North America, and the United Kingdom, the demand for quality data and online access to data-rich sources of information has grown exponentially, with more stakeholders entering the field each year. As such, the cultural data landscape in Australia is broad, yet fragmented, and has been supported for decades by fixed-term national investment grants made to individual Humanities, Arts and Social Sciences (HASS)-based digital tools, platforms, working groups, and labs  (such as the ARDC’s HASS Community Data Lab:   <ref target="https://ardc.edu.au/project/hass-community-data-lab/">https://ardc.edu.au/project/hass-community-data-lab/</ref>). As Mike Jones and Alana Piper (2023) point out, the ‘funding models set up for traditional projects normally rely on them having a clear end date for financial support, after which digital resource may not even be accessible, let alone updated. Moreover, many individual research collections and digital databases have been built using bespoke technical approaches (often outsourced to private companies), which have led to institution-specific issues relating to design, access, maintenance, and use of data. Inevitably, the diversity of cultural data collections reflects different histories of data collection, management, curation, and maintenance, and can lead to intergenerational and sometimes competitive misalignments of the potentiality in cultural data. Similarly, and in spite of national and international calls for open data policies (see e.g.   <ref target="https://inke.ca/">https://inke.ca/</ref>), the economic, cultural, and social data managed by governments is often limited by idiosyncratic data structures, short-term political support, or survey parameters (e.g. <ref target="https://www.arts.gov.au/cultural-data-online">https://www.arts.gov.au/cultural-data-online</ref>). </p>
                  <p>Nonetheless, the appetite for accessing, connecting, and telling stories with Australian cultural data in the creative industries continues apace, as evidenced by a reinvigorated national cultural policy, REVIVE, announced in 2023 (<ref target="https://www.arts.gov.au/publications/national-cultural-policy-revive-place-every-story-story-every-place">https://www.arts.gov.au/publications/national-cultural-policy-revive-place-every-story-story-every-place</ref>). Researchers across the humanities are also increasingly interested in the research possibilities to be realised by using structured cultural data and large digital collections. However, as Ahnert et al. (2023) rightly point out in their analysis of collaborative historical work using big data, relatively little research considers ‘the practical steps in getting hold of such data, and the restrictions with which it may come.’  </p>
               </div>
            </div>
            <div>
               <head>PROGRAM A.2: PROJECT STRUCTURE AND TEAM</head>
               <p>Rather than trying to ‘solve’ national collections in a single effort, we took a targeted, bottom-up approach to examine the larger problem space in a way that did not centre on acquiring more data, developing more tools, or building another aggregation platform. Instead, the project undertook a detailed exploration of heterogeneous cultural data collections, each with unique histories and infrastructures. We thus began with the same broad intent as the ‘Foundation’ TaNC projects ( <ref target="https://www.nationalcollection.org.uk/Foundation-Projects">https://www.nationalcollection.org.uk/Foundation-Projects</ref>), which sought to interconnect selected collections in vast, historic institutions including The National Archives, National Gallery, Victoria and Albert Museum, British Library, and Tate Gallery. The ACD-Engine benefitted from the agility afforded by working with smaller, discipline-based databases with fewer institutional or historical barriers to cooperation (e.g. those committed to an open API). In so doing, the project focused on assembling discrete, cleaned, augmented and merged datasets that could become usable in a variety of computational contexts, and yet retain each collection’s disciplinary distinctiveness and place within the national cultural data ecosystem (Zheng and Munoz 2023a).</p>
               <p>The ACD-Engine is, distinctively, a cyber-infrastructure that strategically built upon pre-existing projects, investments, and data models without erasing their unique affordances, histories, and investments. Centring on a skilled research software engineering and digital humanities team at the University of Melbourne, which experimented with innovative technical methods and theoretical interrogation, we established a multi-institutional network of discipline experts and digital humanities practitioners across Australia and the UK.<note> In addition to our partners, we have also engaged with a range of stakeholders in the sector including the Victorian Centre for Data Insights, Powerhouse Museum, National Association for the Visual Arts, National Museum of Australia, National Gallery of Australia, Centre for Artificial Intelligence and Digital Ethics, Robin Boyd Foundation, and <hi rend="italic">Art + Australia</hi> Magazine.</note> Harnessing this new capacity at the intersection of computation and cultural interpretation, we sought to enhance the contribution and impact of cultural data through focused interdisciplinary projects and themes.<note> These objectives align with those of the TaNC scheme in the UK and projects such as the British Library’s Living with Machines ( <ref target="https://www.bl.uk/projects/living-with-machines">https://www.bl.uk/projects/living-with-machines</ref>).</note>
               </p>
               <p>The following diagram explains how the contributing data sources were transformed through the ACD-Engine into new resources for a range of users and beneficiaries. </p>

Each chief investigator was tasked to the project at either half a day or one day per week, with research assistants on short-term part-time contracts. They provided five primary sources of cultural data across five different artistic fields, many of which developed from ARC investment in research and/or database construction, as follows:    </p>

               <head>PROGRAM A.3: OPEN DATA SHARING</head>
               <p>With its emphasis on the active construction and investigation of a shared cultural data framework or model, this project sits alongside major initiatives that support open data in research. Before beginning technical work, we needed to agree on how to share data between the project partners and the ACD-Engine central team as well as how to attribute authorship to individual and co-authored datasets and data-informed publications. A central concern was achieving a balance between energising new research by working across multiple data sources and making raw data available for wider users, while also honouring the intellectual labour embedded in, and the ongoing development of, each partner database. Each partner database was built on unique data that had been collected by domain experts and as such, carried within it their labour, both conceptual and quotidian (who among us has not dedicated extraordinary amounts of time to transcribing, annotating, and generating metadata!). Conversely, since each database was at least partially funded by national research agencies and often supplemented by volunteer contributors, the data was in a sense already public and designed to be shared with arts and humanities researchers as well as the public at large. Therefore, much like other data aggregation and interdisciplinary projects, the ACD-Engine faced both the potential and the pitfalls of sharing data (Smithies, Millar and Thomson 2015; Millar et al. 2018).  </p>
               <p>With these concerns in mind, we sought to develop a data-sharing agreement that outlined a pipeline for recognition of contributors to ACD-Engine datasets and collaborative papers, as well as a model for citation of data sources, that would adhere to recently released recommendations from the Australian Research Council for authorship of collaborative publications. After surveying the existing literature and participating in an Australian Research Data Commons laboratory on this topic, it became clear that most projects share general principles, but there was no well-established data sharing policy standard that would meet our needs. Our final data sharing policy, one component of which is represented in the visual summary below, has enabled us to rapidly determine responsibilities for work outputs, and to appropriately assign authorship and acknowledge additional contributors.     </p>

               </figure>
               <p>Following these paths in an Open Data landscape, the work of different kinds of contributors is made explicit, including work by volunteers who undertake substantial amounts of data entry, software engineers who clean and sort data into usable subsets, and those who provide domain expertise in the organisation of a data output. This method of distributed attribution for the collective authors of an open data artefact will inevitably shape the national arts and humanities research environment, and facilitate greater recognition of the intellectual work undertaken at different stages of cultural data projects by diverse contributors (for the full data sharing agreement, see  <ref target="https://www.acd-engine.org/policy-ethics-governance">https://www.acd-engine.org/policy-ethics-governance</ref>). </p>

               <head>PROGRAM B: TECHNICAL DESIGN AND METHODS</head>
               <p>To combine and harmonize data from multiple sources, formats, and structures into a single, unified framework, the ACD-Engine was informed by the long-standing technical data warehousing approach pursued in many fields of the sciences (see <ref target="https://www.ibm.com/topics/etl">https://www.ibm.com/topics/etl</ref>). For the humanities in Australia, this approach is relatively nascent, with the possible exception of PARADISEC ( <ref target="https://www.paradisec.org.au/">https://www.paradisec.org.au/</ref>), a consortium of language collections with a platform that warehouses a wide range of data inputs and outputs and provides tools to analyse across their content.</p>
               <p>Work to enable the interoperability of digital collections in the arts and humanities is long-standing, initially based in the domain of digital libraries. The OAI-PMH protocol, one of the most widely deployed technologies for digital library interoperability (de Sompel et al 2004) aimed to provide a very simple method for harvesting data from, primarily, digital libraries, but it has several key shortcomings. As Carl Lagoze (2010) points out, OAI-PMH is ‘based on the premise that discovery occurs within the boundaries of the digital library,’ thus ‘relying on a technology distinct from that in the mainstream web architecture’. OAI-PMH also presupposes that ‘structured metadata’ are ‘necessary and fundamental to a digital library environment, and that the Dublin Core vocabulary is the key to “semantic” interoperability’ (Lagoze 2010, 216). The tangible effect of these limitations is the prioritization of simplicity and efficiency at the cost of functionality and robustness, and limited ability to implement feedback mechanisms to correct unusable or poor-quality data. </p>
               <p>Two core aims of the ACD-Engine were to improve the quality of cultural data and better support the interoperability of cultural data across new disciplinary bridges and in new contexts outside the traditional institutional repository domain. Our technique diverges from OAI-PMH in several ways. First, our approach is dynamic real-time access, in a method similar to the more sophisticated Z39.50 protocol (Lynch, 1997), working in real time rather than on harvested, static data. Second, the access module for each collection normalises the format of data items, which again OAI-PMH does not require but Z39.50 does. Neither difference, however, addresses the problems of data quality that pervade many collections accessible via OAI-PMH (Warwick et al, 2009). The ACD-Engine’s current access modules can be set to discount incomplete (meta-)data, and we anticipate that future iterations of the ACD-Engine platform will provide feedback mechanisms for data quality, in line with emerging best practice in digital library infrastructures. </p>
               <p>Our approach to data management, while not unique, is pioneeringly applied to Australian artistic and cultural data, and provides an exemplar for undertaking future projects in this field:</p>

                  <item>Extracting encoded digital data from a range of separate, heterogeneous sources using APIs and various forms of web scraping in collaboration with project partners;</item>
                  <item>Identifying and resolving inconsistencies, redundancies, errors, and gaps in the data, specifically where a datapoint definition (attribute) had specific meanings in one dataset that were incompatible with a like unit in another dataset, or where significant limitations existed in the coverage of available data;</item>
                  <item>Structuring the data into a uniform architecture adapting recognised metadata schema relevant to the arts and humanities without flattening disciplinary distinctiveness;</item>
                  <item>Augmenting, expanding and enriching the data through a variety of methods including manual data entry (conducted by project partners and research assistants), data warehousing, and ETL (extract, transform, load) tools;</item>
                  <item>Transforming the data into machine-readable datasets that can be easily understood and deployed by end users.</item>
               </list>
               <p>We spent much of the first year of the project intensively investigating the contents and structure of our partner databases, to understand how their distinctive data attributes could be usefully extracted, processed, and enhanced by an integrated model. Working across multiple, heterogeneous data sources, we faced the challenges of bespoke and discipline-specific metadata, varying levels of accessibility, and distinct knowledge transfer capabilities, including custom-made and obsolete websites, APIs, and database backend structures.  We tackled these problems, to use Tim Sherratt’s terminology, by ‘digging down through layers of technology, descriptive practice, and institutional history, to understand what is delivered so conveniently through our browsers’. Respectful questioning of the relative weight to be given to a specific datapoint, or how to identify the relationships between diverse concepts across multiple artistic disciplines, required close interrogation of the databases as knowledge domains that have been shaped by the affordances of their specific information architecture, as well as detailed consultation with discipline experts. Only through this exhaustive, iterative process, scrutinising data science methods in their application to artistic research and vice versa, could we develop the depth of understanding necessary to build a robust and intellectually sophisticated integrative architecture. Seeking to guide our diverse team through this process of investigation and consultation, we gradually developed an easy-to-understand data integration workflow diagram (Figure 3).  </p>

               </figure>
               <p>As the project progressed, we added and trained skilled software engineers and data scientists to the team and hosted several research students and interns who each helped to refine the technical competency of the model. Some members of the team investigated existing data ontologies for Open-Linked Data, to align the data attributes selected for the ACD-Engine with best practice models in the arts and humanities (Liu, McKay and Buchanan 2023; Sumner et al. 2023), while others designed the components of the ACD-Engine’s Architecture for cultural data (ACDEA) featuring core entities and key attributes (Zheng and Munoz 2023).  The Data Transformation stage involved creating an aggregated data dictionary that explained the attributes and values for each data source, as well as a data mapping plan that outlined how the information from different sources combined into the ACDEA.<note> For this full data map, see <ref target="https://acd-engine.github.io/jupyterbook/Integration_ACDEA_Overview.html">https://acd-engine.github.io/jupyterbook/Integration_ACDEA_Overview.html</ref>.</note>
               </p>
               <p>Having extracted data from our partner databases, the ACD-Engine team then enriched selected subsets of the data. First, we asked the discipline experts on our research team to enter new data for selected key attributes that had not been captured in the original databases but would facilitate more robust analyses across the ACD-Engine unified datasets. In some cases, as much as 90% of a single attribute was missing from a dataset: for instance, while career commencement dates and birth dates were commonly available in the People entity, very few career end dates or death dates were listed. </p>
               <p>We also cleaned the data by identifying and correcting errors and inconsistencies. For example, due to the nature of integrating data from multiple sources, similar records with minor variations often appeared in multiple places. It was crucial to identify and handle duplicated records appropriately to avoid skewing analysis results. We used artificial intelligence and machine learning to accomplish these tasks, but for the most part undertook deduplication with a mix of simple automation and manual correction. Future development of AI in this space would be fruitful, particularly when working with larger volumes of data. Through this process, our data science team shared insights with our data partners and experts, who engaged in a generative back-and-forth process around definitions, gaps, opportunities, and limitations.</p>

               <head>PROGRAM C: ACD-ENGINE ARCHITECTURE</head>
               <p>Qualitative data modelling is now indispensable to the creation of federated digital humanities databases (Rankin et al. 2009). As we have shown, building the ACDEA required a close interrogation of the data models and entities (or, in non-digital language, cultural concepts) that shaped the different cultural databases. A key finding was the extent to which each database was structured around a meaningful, and yet discrete, entity<note> Or, to use a humanities term, a disciplinary construct: a definable object, actor or location around which a relational database can be constructed.</note>: AusStage around events, DAAO around artist biographies, DAQA around oral history interviews, and so on. Each database contained a wealth of front-facing data on people and organisations – indeed, both DAAO and AusStage contribute to the People and Organisations sub-platform in Trove, which also draws in other collections such as the Australian Women’s Register and the Encyclopaedia of Australian Science – but the level of information and detail among these entities was markedly different across each database. We also found, on the other hand, that the public-facing structure of each database to a degree obscured the richness of data entities and relationships that existed embedded in their systems: DAQA, for instance, has front-end browse capacities for Architects (people), Firms (organisations) and Projects (works), but also contained substantial information that aligned with the events and places that appeared in the front ends of DAAO and AusStage.</p>
               <p>A key aim for the ACDEA, therefore, was to ensure the people, organisations, works, and events entities across the databases were interoperable, which necessitated a fixed, consistent set of minimum attributes. For the person entity, for example, which invites biographical analysis, we recommend a minimum of first and last name, date and place of birth and death. Inevitably, as mentioned above, many of the people listed in our partner databases did not have all of these basic attributes; as appropriate, we supplemented selected entries where new information was available (the ‘top 500’ or ‘top 100’), and/or based our analyses on the most complete entries (see Cutter, Fensham <figure>

Similarly, the interrogation of arts organisations and their histories required the collection of changing organisational names, establishment dates, and locations – again, assembling a baseline of accurate data points was essential for comparative extraction and analysis. Each entity inevitably generated a range of connections to other entities, which required their own set of attributes. Ultimately, we established standardised definitions and attributes for eight entities: Person, Organisation, Work, Recognition, Place, Resource, and Relationship. Each unified ACDEA entity �<note>unable to handle picture here, no embed or link</note>Figure SEQ Figure \* ARABIC 3: ACDEA Conceptual Entitiescorresponded to an entity attributed to a somewhat different name in our source datasets. </p>

                  <head>ACDEA Construction Principles</head>
                  <p>We constructed the ACDEA based on the following principles (see Liu, McKay and Buchanan 2023):</p>
                  <list rend="bulleted">
                     <item>Refer to the Most Comprehensive Existing Data Models: For each entity’s basic metadata requirements, we looked to the database with most comprehensive orientation towards that entity. For example, to construct its own “Person” entity, ACDEA refers to the “person” data model from DAAO, which is a person-oriented data collection, whereas AusStage has a comprehensive approach to “Event” entity collection.</item>
                     <item>Keep Differences &amp; Unify Commonalities: Seeking then to integrate the central entity model with similar entities in the other datasets, ACDEA follows the principle of keeping differences between the data models that are significant and add value to the data, while integrating similar data attributes and unifying common elements to ensure consistency and usability. This approach helps to capture the unique characteristics of each data source and ensure that ACDEA includes all relevant information.</item>
                     <item>Fuzzy Mapping: This method involved mapping data attributes from each data source to a common attribute in the unified data model, even if they were not an exact match.<note> For a different context of interest, see <ref target="https://github.com/Living-with-machines/DeezyMatch">https://github.com/Living-with-machines/DeezyMatch</ref>.</note> For instance, the DAAO has an attribute called “other occupations” and AusStage has an attribute called “(contributor) functions.” These attributes can both be mapped to the “person” entity in ACDEA, and a common attribute called “career.” Reading across these multiple elements of career allows ACDEA to capture as much information as possible while still maintaining consistency and usability.</item>
                  </list>
                  <p>While remaining open to the inclusion of diverse or novel attributes, this model provided us with a view of the range and complexity of data from cultural databases across multiple disciplines, without diminishing the significance of each entity in disciplinary histories. Each of the terms we use for these entities, we argue, has a firm basis in existing cultural research methodologies, and an intuitive, difficult-to-dispute accessibility. We arrived at these terms following extensive debates about the meaning of various concepts (for the results of one discussion, see Cutter, Fensham and Sumner 2023). Simultaneously, this data ontology facilitates the potential future integration of datasets from other sources or search engines, of specific interest to a research project, whether they might be from urban design, music, or the art market. Each entity in ACDEA contains three essential identifying metadata: </p>
                  <list rend="bulleted">
                     <item>Record data, including the original (database) ID, URL, associated entity name, timestamps, and other important details. This metadata is crucial in maintaining the integrity and traceability of the data back to its original source.</item>
                     <item>Content details of the record type, provided as description.</item>
                     <item>Related records which refer to the one-dimensional connections to other records within the same entity. This feature provides easier access to the relationship network of a particular record.</item>

               <p>Developing from our work in data exploration and enrichment, the ACD-Engine set out to interrogate and test the interoperability of a range of cultural databases for use of cultural data in new analytic contexts. These included but were not limited to scholarly research, data analytics and public interest, statistical experimentation, and the informing of national infrastructure strategy and policy.</p>
               <p>In order to demonstrate the value of data analytics and speak to live debates in cultural scholarship that would engage researchers, we began our analytical program by investigating four themes: Working in the Arts: Women, Careers and Creativity; Cultural Hotspots and Local Scenes; Cultural Diffusion and Arts Diplomacy; and Environmental Politics and the Arts. Each theme aligned with the high-level entities of our information architecture for the purposes of data extraction and analysis: for instance, questions about gender and careers were to be answered through interrogation of the ‘People’ entity of the ACDEA.  The first two themes in particular became fruitful sites for data experimentation, guided by specific research questions raised by our domain experts. The core team of data scientists transformed data throughout this process by producing data “experiments” that examined the robustness of specific data attributes within each dataset and showcasing them to research partners, who provided feedback and drove further investigation. </p>

                  <p>In the process, we undertook investigations into each partner database, leading to a number of new insights and directions for future research. Each data partner explains some of their key findings below:</p>
                  <list rend="bulleted">
                     <item>DAAO/University of New South Wales<list rend="bulleted">
                           <item>Interfacing with data scientists around the material captured by DAAO, included new research to supplement information for 500 top artists (DAAO 500, see <ref target="https://acd-engine.github.io/jupyterbook/Analysis_DAAO500.html">https://acd-engine.github.io/jupyterbook/Analysis_DAAO500.html</ref>) and helped us understand the DAAO’s strengths and limitations. One application has been a statistical exploration of gendered name changes, and their impact on historical visibility of women and non-binary artists (Sumner et al. 2023; Cutter, Fensham and Sumner 2023).  </item>
                           <item>An analysis of data on visual arts events captured in DAAO enabled key features and trends in Australian cultural institutions to be identified quantitatively – for example, the boom in cultural institutions, such as experimental art spaces, in the late 1980s – and analysed against known historic trends.</item>
                           <item>Looking across all the ACD-Engine’s datasets helped us understand the interconnections (and duplications) of practitioners across different fields, offering insight into the well-known but little-analysed ‘portfolio career’ in the arts. For example, Elaine Haxton, Margaret Olley, Sidney Nolan, Frank Hinder, and George Gittoes all worked in theatre (mainly stage design) as well as the visual arts, while Sally Morgan is both a visual artist and a writer. We intend to investigate these connections, as well as the ‘other occupations’ field in DAAO, to consider new research questions: for example, what is the cultural impact of artists/actors/performers working as schoolteachers?</item>

                           <item>Collaborating on the Data Dictionary allowed the AusStage team to reconsider its data ontology, in particular redefining the category of Event to standardise its use, and to recognise that a single performance at one venue is different from a season. Factoring in duration and significance allows for future interoperability with other databases that hold Event data.</item>
                           <item>Tracing gendered career pathways through the dataset (see <ref target="https://acd-engine.github.io/jupyterbook/Analysis_AusStage.html">https://acd-engine.github.io/jupyterbook/Analysis_AusStage.html</ref>) revealed data transcription errors in the gender field of Contributor (in ACDEA, Person) records, compounded by a default to ‘Male’ when adding a new Contributor. The AusStage team developed a new gender policy, including a new Non-Binary category that can be used in defined circumstances and a gender field that defaults to ‘Unknown’.</item>
                           <item>We prepared an ‘AusStage 250’ (a dataset of 250 top performing arts practitioners analogous to the DAAO 500), which was enriched with basic biographical data including dates and places of birth and death, and person attributes not ordinarily captured in the AusStage database. This process focussed attention on how community data entry shapes what is recorded in cultural databases. Some of the best-documented Contributors were recognised not because of their general significance, but because particular AusStage authors were interested in supplementing their entries.  </item>
                           <item>We also undertook a focused investigation of the Circus Living Archive and enriched AusStage data relating to Circus Oz, some results of which can be found here:  <ref target="https://acd-engine.github.io/jupyterbook/Analysis_CircusOz.html">https://acd-engine.github.io/jupyterbook/Analysis_CircusOz.html</ref>. </item>

                     <item>DAQA/University of Queensland<list rend="bulleted">
                           <item>While recording the achievements of women architects was an aim of the original DAQA research project, the original database lacked gender metadata. By adding this attribute, a key facet of People profiles across the other ACD-Engine datasets, we were able to investigate the proportions of women practicing architecture in Queensland, which firms employed women, where historical shifts in participation and employment had happened, and consider a relationship to gender balance in the visual arts and design through comparisons with DAAO.</item>
                           <item>ACDEA enabled uses of DAQA that had not been envisaged in its design (see <ref target="https://acd-engine.github.io/jupyterbook/Analysis_DAQA_Part1.html">https://acd-engine.github.io/jupyterbook/Analysis_DAQA_Part1.html</ref> and <ref target="https://acd-engine.github.io/jupyterbook/Analysis_DAQA_Part2.html">https://acd-engine.github.io/jupyterbook/Analysis_DAQA_Part2.html</ref>). While DAQA recorded the names of architectural firms (in ACDEA, Organisations) and their predecessors, the ACD-Engine’s work enabled us to visually model and analyse the multiple progenitors and successors of key firms. By examining the top five longest lineages of firms in Queensland we gained a new understanding of the social and commercial structure of architectural culture across the twentieth century.</item>

                           <item>The team at Curtin generated a 360-degree panorama tour of the Subiaco Hotel in Perth, Western Australia, in order to investigate the potential of open linked data and panoramic tours to enhance the localised and contextual comprehension, virtual exploration, and spatial perception of architectural heritage locations. The Subiaco Hotel was chosen because the Summerhayes architecture collection documents its architectural history and repeated renovation by the Summerhayes family firm, and because it is linked with other architectural datasets that were being integrated into the ACDEA.  </item>
                           <item>This project revealed that when flexible, robust, and relational metadata is produced, exploration of datasets across national collections becomes feasible. By creating linked open datasets of varying media, the 360-panorama can enrich cultural heritage datasets. This allows for researchers as well as visitors to experience immersive, content-rich panoramic tours (Rahaman, Champion and McMeekin 2023).</item>

                           <item>Funding from the ACD-Engine allowed us to build a new function in TLCMap to combine map layers in a single map while preserving the structure of the components. With this new capability, TLCMap users can create a ‘Multilayer’ and see how patterns in a new layer fit with patterns in existing layers, or they can divide a new layer into multiple components to see how categories interact. One example of this functionality is a timeline map of Aboriginal Protection and Welfare Board sites in NSW overlaid with a historical map of railway stations, which reveals a correlation between the development of rail transport and the treatment of Aboriginal people in the late nineteenth and early twentieth century.</item>
                           <item>TLCMap also benefited from engagement with the ACD-Engine through a deeper understanding of data models. Individual Person entries were difficult to map on TLCMap since they require recognition of why place of birth or death – the most common mappable attributes – might be significant in artistic career paths, as a component of a larger cultural phenomenon with more self-evident geolocations. TLCMap now benefits from access to the ACD-Engine’s unified data structure (ACDEA) and datasets, with unlimited potential for map layers to be created from the newly curated data, and also from the lived experience of structuring rich but loose cultural and historical materials on secure foundations and sound principles. </item>

               <head>KEY PROJECT INNOVATIONS</head>
               <p>In summary, the ACD-Engine has made a distinctive and timely contribution to a complex and evolving national data ecosystem. In the two years designated for the project, a diverse range of intellectual, technical, and infrastructural advancements were made which addressed our original project aims, including but not limited to:  </p>
               <p>Aim 1: Improve the quality of existing cultural data in Australia across a range of partner databases and cultural disciplines.</p>
               <list rend="bulleted">
                  <item>Undertook unprecedented and comprehensive investigation of databases: collecting histories, shortcomings, funding histories, and workforce constraints; </item>
                  <item>Definitively established the coding logics, disciplinarity distinctives, sensitivities and vulnerabilities of specialist collections and their software capabilities;</item>
                  <item>Mapped and synthesised data ontologies critical to specific categories of cultural data across a range of fields, including history, cultural studies, literature, art and design history; and </item>
                  <item>Undertook systematic analyses of core categories of cultural data and documentation, identified the challenges for interpretation of cultural data, such as changing social norms (e.g. naming conventions, gender differences, career pathways, and organisational locations), and promoted solutions for localised aggregation methods. </item>
               </list>
               <p>Aim 2: Support an expansion in the accessibility, use, and interoperability of cultural data in research, industry and government contexts.</p>
               <list rend="bulleted">
                  <item>Built a sophisticated and integrated Research Software Engineering (RSE) team for wrangling, structuring, and interrogating large scale datasets; </item>
                  <item>Produced an interoperable data model (ACDEA) for linking and interpreting arts and cultural data between different systems and platforms;</item>
                  <item>Tested the suitability of ACDEA for interoperability with international cyber-infrastructures;</item>
                  <item>Delivered robust, cultural datasets suitable for re-use and further testing with a range of research tools and platforms; and</item>
                  <item>Produced dynamic visualisations and critical case studies exploring key research questions in arts and culture.</item>
               </list>
               <p>Aim 3: Demonstrate how new insights into arts and cultural production can emerge by improving cultural data interoperability across platforms, systems, and regions.</p>
               <list rend="bulleted">
                  <item>Developed a novel policy framework for data-sharing, in line with open access principles, for the attribution of data-led research in the humanities; and   </item>
                  <item>Promoted innovative and multidisciplinary ways of working across cultural collections, including topical analysis featured in public media outlets.<note> Several public-facing outputs of the Engine’s work in this space include Sumner and Fensham 2023, Sumner and Munoz 2023.

               </list>
               <p>These ACD-Engine outcomes lay significant groundwork for the future development of a national data architecture for Australian cultural collections. The prototype information architecture, knowledge base, and RSE capabilities developed by the ACD-Engine pave the way for future work on Australian cultural data including record unification (harmonising duplicated records, predicates in relationships, and place records across multiple data sources), identifying more implicit data, integrating Australian cultural data with more data sources, and consideration of persistent identifiers for Person records across national collections.  </p>

               <head>DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION</head>
               <p>National cultural collections continue to grow in significance as investment at government and inter-governmental levels extend the expectation of greater utilisation of public resources. Greater integration should not, however, diminish the important role that distinctive databases and curated collections have to their source communities and disciplinary experts. Given the volume and complexity of cultural data in national collections, dissolving barriers between one collection and another, as this project has identified, requires careful understanding of how cultural data might be organised beyond each collection.    </p>
               <p>If the goal of national collections involves expanding and enhancing (trans)-national data resources, we would assert that more priority should be given to developing robust information architectures. As we have found, cultural data sharing and interoperability is rich terrain for the digital humanities, and will be more so as new cyber-infrastructures, including artificial intelligence, transform the ways we engage with, reflect upon, and utilise cultural data. If we are to grow research impact and public engagement, national collection projects ought to strenuously pursue best-practice data-sharing approaches, particularly responsible attribution, documentation, and data contextualisation by collection owners (Loukissas 2019; Lee 2023; Alkemalde et al 2023). Without so doing, we risk developing an array of increasingly disparate data structures and infrastructures that will inhibit both disciplinary and interdisciplinary research. The intensive (and unavoidably expensive) investment of human labour and expertise is critical in this process, to safeguard database quality and disciplinary distinctiveness against the oversimplification too often wrought by external metadata structures, especially as they are increasingly implemented by machines.        </p>
               <p>In this context, the challenges we face for future research in this space are principally structural. Research infrastructure for the Australian arts and humanities is maturing, but national and university-based funding remains largely tied to short-term projects like the ACD-Engine, rather than medium- or long-term workforce and infrastructure development. As longer-term strategy slowly emerges, researchers (particularly those early in their careers) will continue to repeatedly enter and exit the field as they pursue employment and funding, making it difficult to build a consistent approach to infrastructure development for cultural data research. The ACD-Engine’s exploratory work has already seeded new investment and opportunities for further research collaboration that recognises the central role of data curation and aggregation in cultural collections to further re-use, and knowledge exchange across industry, universities and government.  </p>
               <p>Considering the future use of the ACD-Engine within the Australian and international cultural data landscape, a number of possible scenarios present themselves. Though the ACDEA is based around text and metadata, the process through which it was developed could be fruitfully applied to other digitalised media (images, film, audio recordings, digital modelling). The ACD-Engine’s federated model, in which nodes of disciplinary expertise and data collections interface with a central hub of data science, information science, and digital humanities experts, could facilitate ongoing partnerships across disciplines to further demonstrate the utility and analytical power of working across multiple collections in historical analysis of cultural production. Future funding applications might focus on the testing and application of software tools (artificial intelligence, machine learning, 3D/4D modelling, immersive VR) in the enhancement and analysis of Australian cultural data, or on new collaborative projects between researchers, industry, and government to explore the quality of insights available from cultural data. At the same time, we hope that funders will invest in maintaining and improving Australia’s ecosystem of cultural databases, many of which rest principally on the custodianship of individual researchers and the current goodwill of university- or community-based hosting providers. This project shows both the potential of these databases, the necessity of human labour to extract and interpret it, and how much may be lost should these databases disappear.  </p>
               <p>In this critical moment where automation is rapidly pervading the arts and cultural space, we both welcome the utopian possibilities and caution against a dystopian erosion of the contexts, histories, and community values embedded in digital cultural heritage. The ACD-Engine represents a pragmatic, stress-tested, and feasible model for comparative data extraction and attribution towards future cultural and critical enquiry.</p>
