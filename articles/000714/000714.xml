			<dhq:abstract>
				<p>Researchers in the complementary fields of the digital humanities and the
					environmental humanities have begun to collaborate under the auspices of the
					<term>digital environmental humanities</term> (DEH). The overarching aim of this
					emerging field is to leverage digital technologies in understanding and
					addressing the urgencies of the Anthropocene. Emphasizing DEH’s focus on natural
					and cultural vitality, this article begins with a historical overview of the
					field. Crafting an account of the field’s emergence, we argue that the present
					momentum toward DEH exhibits four broad thematic strains including perennial
					eco-archiving; Anthropocene narratives of loss; citizen ecohumanities; and
					human-plant-environment relations. Within each of the four areas, the article
					identifies how DEH ideas have been implemented in significant projects that
					engage with, envision, re-imagine, and devise communities for environmental
					action and transformation. We conclude with suggestions for further bolstering
					DEH by democratizing environmental knowledge through open, community-engaged
					methods. </p>

				<head>Introduction</head>
				<p>A hand-colored lithograph from the mid-nineteenth century features the common
					brushtail possum (<hi rend="italic">Trichosurus vulpecula</hi>), an Australian
					marsupial illustrated by artists H. C. Richter and Elizabeth Gould [see Figure
					1]. Naturalist John Gould included this illustration in his monumental
					three-volume compilation <hi rend="italic">The Mammals of Australia</hi> [1863],
					the first major survey of Australian mammals, some of which have declined
					dramatically in number or become extinct since its publication. In also
					depicting what appears to be a small banksia, a kind of wildflower common
					throughout Australia, the image suggests the ecological interactions between the
					native marsupial and the endemic plant. An engrossing visual record of
					environmental history and interspecies relations, the illustration and many
					others are freely available through the Biodiversity Heritage Library [BHL
					2021]. By “collaboratively making biodiversity literature openly available to
					the world as part of a global biodiversity community” [BHL 2021, para. 1], this
					open-access platform exemplifies the digital environmental humanities put into
					practice for engendering communities of action — in this instance, oriented
					toward biodiversity awareness and protection in Australia. While revealing early
					Anglo-European modes of visually representing Australian fauna, lithographs such
					as these today have the potential to catalyze ecological awareness and change,
					promote an appreciation of the country’s exceptional biodiversity, and serve as
					educational launching points for exploring the entangled histories of animals,
					plants, people, landscapes, ecologies, and technologies in Australia and
					elsewhere. </p>

				<p>This article provides a broad, comprehensive overview of current developments and
					prospective paths in the digital environmental humanities (abbreviated as DEH
					throughout). It begins by calling attention to DEH’s focus on natural and
					cultural vitality — or what theorists of heritage term “biocultural diversity”
					[Bridgewater and Rotherham 2019] — in an era of pervasive environmental decline.
					We turn retrospectively to a synopsis of the growth of DEH over the last decade
					as an integrative area of scholarship synthesizing the companionable aims of the
					digital and environmental humanities. Key theoretical and methodological
					elaborations of DEH — as well as recent developments in the field — will be
					delineated. Assembling a narrative of the field’s emergence, we argue that the
					current acceleration of DEH in response to the Anthropocene context reveals the
					following four broad thematic focal areas: (i) perennial eco-archiving (through
					the work of the Long Now Foundation); (ii) Anthropocene narratives of loss ( <hi
					rend="italic">What is Missing?</hi>); (iii) citizen ecohumanities (<hi
					rend="italic">Atlas of Living Australia</hi>); and (iv) human-plant-environment
					relations (<hi rend="italic">Native American Ethnobotany Archive</hi>). </p>
				<p>Within each area, we identify the ways in which DEH ideas and practices have been
					implemented in these especially illustrative projects that engage with,
					envision, re-imagine, and devise communities for environmental action and
					transformation. We conclude with recommendations for supporting and
					strengthening work in DEH by further democratizing biocultural knowledge via
					open, community-engaged, participatory approaches. Throughout the article, we
					view DEH as conceptualized within university contexts but extending beyond the
					academy to encompass the work of community organizations and concerned
					individuals. Furthermore, in selecting the four case studies above, we
					necessarily exclude related projects of relevance to DEH such as Anna L. Tsing
					and colleagues’ Feral Atlas: A More-Than-Human Anthropocene [2021], an archive
					of field reports from artists, humanists, and scientists on feral ecologies that
					continue to resist human control and have spread widely. </p>

				<head>DEH in the Anthropocene</head>
				<p>DEH encompasses diverse histories, theories, debates, practices, techniques, and
					projects internationally [Chang 2021, Cohen and LeMenager 2016, Jørgensen 2014,
					Posthumus, Sinclair, and Poplawski 2018]. As a case in point, Figure 2
					represents central Perth, Western Australia, illustrating how the area might
					have appeared in circa 1829, a year of intensive colonial activity during which
					James Stirling explored the Swan River and Charles Fremantle seized the area for
					the British Crown. In 2014, an interdisciplinary research team based at Edith
					Cowan University in Perth produced the visualization using GIS (Geographic
					Information System) and three-dimensional modelling techniques incorporating an
					array of source materials including Noongar (Aboriginal Australian) narratives,
					nineteenth-century Swan River Colony maps, aerial photography, European
					settlers’ accounts, artists’ impressions, literary representations, and
					geological and vegetation charts [Ryan, Brady, and Kueh 2019]. Given its
					inclusion in a public exhibition on wetlands at Perth Town Hall in 2014,
					followed by a permanent digital presence on the state museum website [Western
					Australian Museum 2021], this reconstructed perspective of central Perth offers
					a graphic means to consider the city’s historical development and envisage
					opportunities to prevent the further loss of Perth’s extant wetlands. The
					Re-imagining Perth’s Wetlands project is an example of the multifaceted,
					multidisciplinary, community-focused, and often-participatory orientation of DEH
					through initiatives aiming to broaden public awareness of the interlinked
					cultural and ecological urgencies of the present. Work in DEH has the potential
					to energize political, social, and community transformations including, as this
					case demonstrates, the conservation of rapidly disappearing urban wetland
					environments. In contrast to landscape visualizations such as this, other
					initiatives use different methods including the archival conservation of
					biocultural heritage through open-access, participatory digital platforms [see,
					for instance, GeoHumanities 2018, Herbaria 3.0 2021a]. </p>

				<p>DEH responds to the exigencies of the Anthropocene. As a provisional unit of the
					Geological Time Scale — a system of chronological dating based on changes in
					geological strata over vast periods of time — the Anthropocene “reflects
					profound and ongoing Earth System change” [Zalasiewicz et al. 2019, 331].
					Mounting geophysical data differentiates the Anthropocene from its precursor,
					the Holocene, beginning roughly 11,650 years ago. Geochronologists locate the
					historical boundary between epochs in the Great Acceleration — the rapid upsurge
					in human population — and the first nuclear bomb detonations, both in the
					mid-twentieth century [Zalasiewicz 2015]. The Anthropocene “represents a major
					change in trajectory of the Earth system from the more or less stable conditions
					that have seen human civilization develop and expand over the past few thousand
					years” [Zalasiewicz 2019, 500]. Nevertheless, the increasing circulation of the
					Anthropocene neologism has provoked proposals for alternative designations —
					from Capitalocene, Chthulucene, Homogenocene, and Myxocene to Plantationocene,
					Planthroposcene, Symbiocene, Thanatocene, and, even, Bandwaggonocene.
					Environmental historian Jason W. Moore [2017], for instance, advocates the term
					<hi rend="italic">Capitalocene</hi> to acknowledge the vast networks of human
					and nonhuman labor exploited under global capitalism while Science and
					Technology Studies scholar Donna Haraway [2016] employs <hi rend="italic"
					>Chthulucene</hi> to foreground the “ongoing multispecies stories and practices
					of becoming-with in times that remain at stake” [para. 24]. What’s more,
					anthropologist Natasha Myers [2017] has proposed <hi rend="italic"
					>Planthroposcene</hi> as “an aspirational episteme and way of doing life in
					which people come to recognize their profound interimplication with plants […]
					The Planthroposcene is a call to change the terms of encounter, to make allies
					with these green beings” [299–300]. As these lexical confutations suggest, a
					pressing task of the environmental humanities has been the formulation of novel
					vocabularies sufficient to articulate the formidable effects of rapid ecological
					change on shared natural-cultural thriving. </p>

				<head>Key Developments in the Digital Environmental Humanities: 2011–2016</head>
				<p>In the Anthropocene context, DEH confronts global precarities of climate
					disruption, biodiversity loss, environmental injustice, Indigenous peoples’
					diminished land rights, and the weakening of biocultural knowledge networks in
					the wake of ecological degradation. With its approximately ten-year history, DEH
					remains an emergent — and, even, contingent — area of scholarship and activism
					that brings the technological and digital expertise of the digital humanities
					(DH) into dialogue with the ecological and biospheric concerns of the
					environmental humanities (EH). During the five-year period between 2011 and
					2016, DEH made considerable progress toward integrating the digital and
					environmental spheres of interest represented by its constituent fields. In
					2011, members of the Munich-based Rachel Carson Center began the <hi
					rend="italic">Ant Spider Bee</hi> blog “to engage academics and practitioners in
					exploration, discussion, and reflection about digital practices, methodologies,
					and applications in environmental humanities work” [Rachel Carson Center 2011,
					para. 1]. The blog’s third section “Bee,” for example, features short articles
					reflecting on current advances and outlining notable projects in the field. As
					astrophysicist Chris Lintott [2015] explains in his contribution to “Bee,”
					digital tools such as Zooniverse, “the world’s largest and most popular platform
					for people-powered research” [Zooniverse 2021, para. 1], harness the
					considerable potential of citizen research across disciplines — from identifying
					endangered animals recorded in camera trap images to analyzing
					nineteenth-century mariners’ weather logs in order to comprehend climate change
					implications in the present. </p>
				<p>Alongside the <hi rend="italic">Ant Spider Bee</hi> forum, one of the field’s
					earliest initiatives was the Digital Environmental Humanities Network, or DEHN.
					With funding from Canada’s Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council, the
					DEHN convened a pivotal workshop in September 2013 at McGill University “to
					bring digital and the environmental humanities scholars together to showcase
					work that had already been done at the intersection of these two fields and to
					concretize the possible emergence of a new field” [Posthumus, Sinclair, and
					Poplawski 2018, 159]. Consolidating interest in the DEH nexus, the workshop
					included digital humanists as well as scholars specializing in particular areas
					of the environmental humanities, namely, ecocriticism and environmental history.
					At the time of writing, although listed as a research cluster on the McGill
					University website, the network appears largely inactive, illustrating the
					broader challenges of sustaining DEH initiatives over time in the light of
					research funding contingencies and ongoing institutional privileging of
					disciplinary specialization [Environment and Society Portal 2021, see also,
					Jørgensen 2014, 106]. </p>
				<p>Also in 2013, the editors of <hi rend="italic">Environmental Humanities</hi>—the
					field’s premier journal published since 2012 in an open-access format — in
					partnership with the Environmental and Society Portal at the Rachel Carson
					Center, issued a call for papers for a special issue “The Digital /
					Environmental Humanities Nexus: Challenges and Opportunities” [Rachel Carson
					Center 2013]. Although it appears to have never eventuated — or could have been
					diverted into other publications, projects, or forums — the issue promised “to
					reflect on intersections between digital and environmental humanities from a
					variety of perspectives [as well as to] enrich understandings of the extent to
					which digital technologies and resources are informing current environmental
					humanities scholarship” [Rachel Carson Center 2013, para. 3]. In one of the
					first DEH-related articles published in <hi rend="italic">Environmental
					Humanities</hi>, entitled “The Armchair Traveler’s Guide to Digital
					Environmental Humanities” [2014], environmental historian Finn Arne Jorgensen
					develops a persuasive argument for ongoing collaborative efforts between the
					history of technology, the environmental humanities, and the digital humanities. </p>
				<p>Between 2014 and 2016, DEH gained further standing as a focus of digital
					humanities conference presentations and special issues of academic journals. At
					the 2014 Digital Humanities Australasia (DHA) conference, for instance,
					environmental humanist (and an author of the current article) John C. Ryan
					presented “FloraCultures: The Nature of a Biodiversity Archive for Plant-Based
					Cultural Heritage,” characterizing the “eco-digital humanities” as a
					“possibility” [Ryan 2014a]. The presentation considered the use of digital
					archival technologies for the conservation of botanical — or plant-based —
					cultural heritage in Perth, Western Australia. A city of remarkable floristic
					diversity, Perth also faces formidable conservation challenges, including urban
					and suburban development in addition to the spread of native plant pathogens,
					exacerbated by climate precarities [Ryan 2014b]. As plants vanish, so do the
					irreplaceable heritage values associated with them. In advocating DEH as a
					response to botanical diversity loss, the presentation theorized <hi
					rend="italic">environmental poiesis</hi> as the making of digital artifacts
					informed by ideas of environmental ethics, ecological justice, ecofeminism,
					sustainability, bioregionalism, biodiversity conservation, and multispecies
					thinking. </p>
				<p>Special issues on DEH in the literary criticism journals <hi rend="italic">Green
					Letters</hi> [ed. Dobrin 2014] and <hi rend="italic">PMLA</hi> [eds. Cohen and
					LeMenager 2016] brought much-needed critical attention to the potential for
					dialogue between the digital and environmental humanities. Contributors to the
					<hi rend="italic">PMLA</hi> issue addressed concepts from language ecology to
					digital affect in addition to projects from the <hi rend="italic">Icelandic Saga
					Map </hi>to the online journal of Indigenous writing, <hi rend="italic">Dawnland
					Voices 2.0</hi>. During this period, as well, key conceptual analyses, notably
					Bethany Nowviskie’s “Digital Humanities in the Anthropocene” [2015], broadened
					the theoretical scope of the DEH debate. Nowviskie [2015] suggests that DEH
					orient toward the environmental and human implications of digital research —
					from the socio-political influence of device manufacturers to the carbon
					footprints of ostensibly low-impact digital projects. For Nowviskie and others,
					DEH entails addressing head-on the omnipresent urgencies of the Anthropocene,
					not the least of which is the widespread loss of nonhuman beings, species, and
					biodiverse ecosystems. </p>
			</div>
			<div>
				<head>Theoretical and Methodological Tenets: Technology, Story, Ecology, Temporality </head>
				<p>As a whole, the major theoretical and methodological elaborations of DEH attempt
					to synthesize the strengths — while redressing limitations — of the digital and
					environmental humanities as discrete fields [Chang 2021, Cohen and LeMenager
					2016, Cummings, Roh, and Callaway 2020, GeoHumanities 2018, Jørgensen 2014,
					Ladino 2018, Linley 2016, Nowviskie 2015, Posthumus and Sinclair 2014,
					Posthumus, Sinclair, and Poplawski 2018, Sinclair and Posthumus 2017, Travis and
					Holm 2016]. This section briefly addresses four areas of focus within current
					conceptualizations of DEH as an emergent, integrative, and transdisciplinary
					field of research and practice: technology, story, ecology, and temporality. The
					capacity of DEH to address these four deeply entangled areas — often
					simultaneously — demonstrates its potential in the present epoch. </p>
				<p>In an early elaboration of the field, Stephanie Posthumus and Stéfan Sinclair
					[2014] characterize DEH as “a new and burgeoning area that still remains largely
					undefined, but that asserts the importance of the humanities in responding to
					the ecological crisis while leveraging new tools and technologies” [254]. From
					their perspective, DEH brings the tools and methods of DH to bear on concerns
					within EH; conversely, EH’s planetary and political focus helps to elucidate
					aspects of digital tool-making and critique central to DH. For Posthumus and
					Sinclair [2014], EH promotes sustainable societal interactions with the natural
					world whereas DH has remained less critical of techno-scientific practices that
					carry the potential for ecological harm. In turn, DH problematizes what
					Posthumus and Sinclair identify as EH’s inherent bias against technocentric —
					and, even, technocratic — salves to social, cultural, linguistic, and
					environmental challenges. Moreover, DH’s long historical outlook on the
					emergence of technologies introduces critical considerations — “the possibility
					of new interactions, new collaborations” [Posthumus and Sinclair 2014, 260] — to
					the environmental humanities whereas, complementarily, EH’s emphasis on telling
					the stories of the natural world can transform the making of “digital archives,
					electronic editions and data visualisations” [269]. Posthumus and Sinclair
					propose <hi rend="italic">digital ecology</hi> as a concept that, by reconciling
					the entrenched binaries of hardware/software, computer/user, and real/virtual,
					discloses how digital environments facilitate novel interpretations of material
					environments, and vice versa. </p>
				<p> Posthumus and Sinclair’s privileging of stories and storytelling aligns with
					Jørgensen’s [2014] assertion that DEH centers on “new forms of storytelling and
					presentation” [110]. Indeed, innovations in new media technologies facilitate
					the emergence of multi-dimensional stories about the relations between people,
					nonhumans, landscapes, and technologies. In his analysis of the Norwegian
					Broadcasting Corporation’s “slow travel” series of digitally-enhanced television
					programs, Jørgensen [2014] argues that “distant natures, those that are not
					experienced through the body but distributed through data and media, need
					different modes of analysis and storytelling” [109]. At the same time,
					environmental humanists assert that biocultural values take shape through the
					stories individuals and communities tell about nature as well as the stories
					that nature tells about itself [Griffiths 2007]. As environmental historian Tom
					Griffiths [2007] explains in a seminal overview of the environmental humanities,
					“The stories we live by determine the future. So, in harnessing the power of
					narrative, in listening to, rediscovering and generating true stories, we change
					the world” [“Storytelling,” para. 2]. In similar terms, ecomusicologist Kate
					Galloway [2017] emphasizes the narrative possibilities of DEH for embracing the
					integral role of technology in comprehending and communicating ecological
					issues. Methods of aural-digital storytelling — audio-recorded soundwalks,
					multi-modal sound maps, and crowdsourcing techniques — expand audiences to
					comprise academics as well as community members grappling with the direct
					impacts of climate change, ecosystem degradation, and related urgencies. In
					particular, storytelling modes that incorporate the body and the multiple senses
					can engage the public more compellingly in environmental debates. For Galloway
					[2017], the creation of digital-narrative objects that “circulate in an
					open-access format and often contain research materials contributed by a
					research collective” constitutes an embodied, participatory process of social
					knowledge formation [52]. </p>
				<p>DEH introduces ecological concerns to DH and, reciprocally, digital concerns to
					EH through the analysis of human-technological impacts on the biosphere.
					Margaret Linley [2016] characterizes this recalibration as “the ecological turn
					in the digital humanities” [411]. Having an environmental orientation that
					centralizes nature-culture-technology intersections, DEH encourages “advocacy,
					engagement, action, and participation as well as an ethics of responsibility,
					sustainability, and conservation” [Linley 2016, 427]. Most crucially, DEH
					approaches ecology not as a metaphor, figuration, or abstraction but as a
					material certainty that shapes the lived experiences of humans and others.
					Echoing Posthumus and Sinclair’s elaboration of <hi rend="italic">digital
					ecology</hi>, other scholars have proposed the term <hi rend="italic">digital
					Anthropocene</hi> to signify the conjunction of the digital revolution, climate
					catastrophe, and social, political, and economic precarities [Travis and Holm
					2016]. While developing digital and environmental competencies, DEH facilitates
					generative exchanges across the arts, humanities, social sciences, and sciences
					[Travis and Holm, 2016, 203]. </p>
				<p>Correspondingly, Sidney Dobrin’s [2014] theorization of <hi rend="italic">digital
					environments</hi> calls into question the assumption that environmental crisis
					originates in technology and, more specifically, technological excess or
					technology-gone-astray. For Dobrin [2014], digital environments are “themselves
					natures and environments in and with which humans and non-humans forge
					relationships” [205]. As such, DEH presents a framework “emphasising the role of
					the humanities in responding to ecological crisis while also embracing new
					technologies and tools” [Dobrin, 2014, 206]. To be sure, recent theory and
					practice in DEH has grown along the three axes of technology, story, and
					ecology, particularly in relation to the growing urgency of climate disaster and
					ecosystem collapse. Open-access resources such as NASA’s Global Climate Change
					portal offer downloadable time-lapse visualizations, for instance, of ice mass
					loss in Greenland between 2002 and 2020 [see Figure 3]. Similarly, the

				<p>In many ways, the ten-year evolution of the landmark collection <hi rend="italic"
					>Ant Spider Bee: Chronicling Digital Transformations in Environmental
					Humanities</hi> [Coulter, von Hardenberg, and Jørgensen 2021a] parallels the
					development of DEH. The open-access book is the outcome of the eponymous blog
					begun in 2011 “to collect and reflect on ways technology was transforming the
					epistemologies, methods, and dissemination of environmental humanities research”
					[Coulter, von Hardenberg, and Jørgensen 2021c, 10]. Both the book and the blog
					demonstrate the ongoing interweaving of EH and DH theories and methods within
					the DEH nexus. Published by the Rachel Carson Center for Environment and Society
					— as noted, a leader in DEH globally — the collection comprises forty-two short,
					reflective chapters arranged in five sections: (i) Evolution; (ii) Engagement:
					New Voices; (iii) Mediations: New Forms; (iv) Metamorphoses: New Natures; and
					(v) An Experiment in Collecting and Curating. The editors characterize the <hi
					rend="italic">Ant Spider Bee</hi> initiative — from its origins as a blog to its
					present dissemination as a book — as an experiment in long-term collecting and
					curating. Cognizance of the longue durée and, by extension, deep temporality,
					underlies the project’s ethos of curation: “As the use of digital technologies
					to gather and process knowledge becomes increasingly natural, we hope that <hi
					rend="italic">this digital time capsule</hi> will offer insights about the past,
					for the future” [Coulter, von Hardenberg, and Jørgensen 2021b, 229, emphasis
					added]. As suggested in the following discussion of perennial eco-archiving and,
					specifically, the work of the Long Now Foundation, a deep temporal outlook is
					integral to the digital environmental humanities. </p>

				<head>Perennial Eco-Archiving: Deep Time Awareness and the Longue Durée of
					DEH</head>
				<p>Environmental humanists stress that understanding the implications of the
					Anthropocene for the future of life on Earth necessitates grappling with deep
					time as both a bewildering abstraction and an embodied immediacy [Ginn et al.
					2018]. Representing Earth or geological history, deep time is a sense of time
					that registers in <hi rend="italic">millionennia</hi>—millions of years —
					instead of millennia. In the Anthropocene context, paleobiologist Jan
					Zalasiewicz [2017] calls attention to “a peculiarity of geological time, which
					is that, at heart, it is simply time — albeit <hi rend="italic">in very large
					amounts</hi>” [124, emphasis added]. As a recent specialization within the
					environmental humanities, the paleoenvironmental humanities (or PEH) emphasizes
					the value of deep time narratives, ranging from hopeful stories of
					human-non-human resilience to tragic accounts of biocultural collapse. PEH
					responds to the urgency of engendering deep time awareness in the environmental
					humanities through empirical investigation of archaeological materials. The aim
					is “to reframe the wider discourse on climate change in terms of our quickly
					expanding deep-time knowledge and to demonstrate that humans can neither be
					characterized as beings fundamentally divorced from nature” [Hussain and Riede
					2020, 7]. Considering the challenge of comprehending deep, geological time, the
					objectives of PEH are estimable. In <hi rend="italic">Timefulness</hi> [2018],
					for example, geologist Marcia Bjornerud proposes the term <hi rend="italic"
					>chronophobia</hi> to signify the innate human aversion to deep time. For
					Bjornerud [2018], the perils of “temporal illiteracy” (7) are formidable. As an
					antidote to chronophobia, <hi rend="italic">timefulness</hi> situates human
					culture in Earth history, promoting deep time consciousness. </p>
				<p> Developed with respect to deep time, the idea of <hi rend="italic">perennial
					eco-archiving</hi> refers to temporally-expansive, <hi rend="italic"
					>timeful</hi> archival work that preserves knowledge of language, society, and
					environment. Perennial archiving involves high-resolution data, archiving
					servers, and other long-term conservation techniques and technologies [Andro
					2018, 122]. Perennial eco-archiving, then, applies comparable digital strategies
					to curate, conserve, and disseminate nature-culture interconnections, especially
					as related to theories and practices of sustainability. As a case in point, the
					Digital Matters Lab at the University of Utah adopted a four-year focus on
					sustainability in order to contribute to current debates within the digital
					humanities while addressing ecological challenges particular to Utah including
					long-term drought, water rights, air quality, and access to public lands
					[Cummings, Roh, and Callaway 2020]. The sustainability emphasis galvanized
					attention to issues of durability, temporality, and scale: “Sustainability not
					only prompts us to think of the durability of digital projects, but also asks us
					<hi rend="italic">to think differently about the timescales on which we usually
					consider technology</hi>; instead of thinking in processing times and
					milliseconds, sustainability might prompt us <hi rend="italic">to consider the
					millennia that our e-waste takes to degrade</hi>” [Cummings, Roh, and Callaway
					2020, para. 22, emphasis added]. The theme invited researchers to interrogate
					ecological issues — that is, to think in terms of environmental sustainability —
					while also critically considering the longevity of digital-activist projects. As
					an example of DEH research concerned with the longue durée, the Digital Matters
					Lab project highlights the integrated digital-environmental inflections of the
					term <hi rend="italic">conservation</hi>—that, rather than oppositional, digital
					and environmental conservation can go hand-in-hand. The <hi rend="italic"
					>digital environments</hi> resulting from DEH collaborations help to dismantle
					the longstanding division between the digital (disembodied, technological,
					abstract) and the ecological (corporeal, material, relational). </p>
				<p> The <hi rend="italic">timeful</hi> work of the Long Now Foundation concretizes
					the notion of perennial eco-archiving while highlighting some challenges
					surrounding the idea. The Foundation is a nonprofit dedicated to advancing
					long-term thinking at the scale of 10,000 years [The Long Now Foundation 2021a].
					The organization’s temporally-ambitious work includes The Clock of the Long Now,
					“a 10,000 year monument to long-term thinking,” and The Rosetta Project, “a
					living archive of 1,500 human languages” [The Long Now Foundation 2021b]. The
					latter is “a global collaboration of language specialists and native speakers
					working to build a publicly accessible digital [and post-digital] library of
					human languages” [The Rosetta Project 2021b]. The Rosetta Project responds to
					the looming problem of digital obsolescence and the pressing need to devise new
					archival techniques with long purviews. Techno-linguistic innovations such as
					the Rosetta Disk address the likelihood that global language loss will triple
					within forty years, marked by the extinction of one language on average per
					month [Bromham et al. 2021]. To avert the catastrophic disappearance of nearly
					1,500 languages by the century’s end, language documentation, multilingual
					education programs, and other community-based initiatives are required urgently
					[Bromham et al. 2021]. Toward this aim, the Rosetta Disk offers a post-digital
					solution. The three-inch diameter nickel disk encodes 14,000 pages of linguistic
					information microscopically on its surface. Rather than a digital encryption,
					however, each page constitutes an image, allowing the information to be
					retrieved through optical magnification. What’s more, the Rosetta Wearable Disk
					is a miniaturized version of the language archive, measuring merely two
					centimeters in diameter and designed to be worn comfortably on the human body —
					as an embodied, mobile repository of language, culture, and environment. </p>
				<p>The Rosetta Project illuminates the overlays between linguistic, cultural, and
					biological diversity. As global biological diversity decreases, linguistic and
					cultural diversity decline in response. This co-occurrence of linguistic and
					biological diversity underscores the importance of integrated, multidisciplinary
					strategies for conserving species, habitats, and languages concurrently
					[Gorenflo et al. 2012]. Understood in this context, environmental relations
					inhere within the project’s emphasis on “traditional culture,” “cultural
					diversity,” and “cultural and linguistic diversity” [The Rosetta Project 2021a,
					para. 9]. Simply put, the project reminds us that culture and nature are
					intrinsically related rather than diametrically opposed. Another perennial
					eco-archiving initiative of the Long Now Foundation — one with a deep-time,
					post-digital orientation comparable to The Rosetta Project — is the Clock of the
					Long Now. Under construction inside a mountain in western Texas, the clock will
					keep time for the longue durée of the Anthropocene. With more than 3.5 million
					possible sonic combinations, the device will yield a unique chime each day for
					ten thousand years. Incorporating principles of longevity, maintainability,
					transparency, evolvability, and scalability, the clock problematizes the
					short-term thinking underlying the global environmental crisis [The Clock of the
					Long Now 2021]. While foregrounding deep-time consciousness, the Clock of the
					Long Now — sequestered in the mountain area it has transformed materially
					through its construction — remains remote, inaccessible, and haunted by its own
					monumentalism. Although ambitious, the project appears to lack the
					participatory, community-minded focus that we see as essential to the digital —
					and, for that matter, post-digital — environmental humanities. </p>
				<p>Recognizing the geophysical implications of decisions, actions, and behaviors,
					the Anthropocene underscores the material-digital imbrications between human
					bodies, technological transformations, and ecological systems. Through its
					fostering of time-consciousness and temporal literacy, DEH imparts immediacy to
					the “human/digital/planetary interface” [Dawson 2021, 311]. Illustrated by the
					work of the Long Now Foundation, perennial eco-archiving, in particular, raises
					the crucial question, “How does understanding the digital [and post-digital]
					contribution to environmental crisis relate to digitally [and post-digitally]
					understanding environmental crisis?” [Dawson 2021, 311]. As eco-archives with
					very long temporal purviews, The Clock of the Long Now and The Rosetta Project
					draw attention to post/digital materialities. In other words, developed in
					digital environments, both projects anticipate post-digital urgencies of
					linguistic, cultural, and ecological loss. Weaving between the environmental and
					digital, these and other deep-time-oriented DEH platforms have the potential to
					“inspire more sustainable behaviors” [Gould, 2016, 3]. It is within this context
					that DEH also provides a vibrant basis for communicating Anthropocene narratives
					of loss, recovery, and hope especially through the engendering of affect. </p>
			</div>
			<div>
				<head>Anthropocene Narratives of Loss, Recovery, and Hope: Engendering Affect </head>
				<p>Affect is a potent confluence of feelings, senses, and memories with the capacity
					to energize the Anthropocene narratives of DEH. Arguing for the significance of
					affect in the digital environmental humanities, ecohumanists such as Jennifer
					Ladino focus on the ways in which digital environments facilitate affective
					responses to biocultural loss. From Ladino’s [2018] standpoint, DEH enables us
					to reimagine “how to represent, cope with, and deploy loss in the service of a
					more just present and perhaps even a livable future” [189]. Employing multimodal
					and multisensory strategies to communicate Anthropocene precarities, DEH
					embraces the transformative potential of affect, understood as “the powerful,
					visceral, pre- or even non-cognitive feelings that arise and are transmitted in
					both virtual and actual environments” [Ladino 2018, 189]. Consider, for
					instance, the affective work of the Climate Stories Project [2023], an online
					platform for sharing firsthand accounts of climate change through oral
					histories. In contrast to this project’s predominant focus on human experience,
					one of the aims of DEH is to understand how digital objects and environments
					narrate <hi rend="italic">other beings’ lives</hi> and, in doing so, nurture
					cross-species empathy [Ladino 2018, 199]. </p>
				<p>To be certain, Ladino’s ideas reflect the impact of the <hi rend="italic"
					>affective turn</hi> on the environmental humanities and cognate fields.
					Conceptualizations of affect in human geography, literary studies, social
					psychology, and other scholarly areas highlights the intercorporeal phenomenon
					of bodies being affected by — and reciprocally affecting — other bodies within
					ecological systems. Over the last twenty years, the field of critical affect
					studies has taken shape through the writings of Adam Frank, Brian Massumi, Eve
					Sedgwick, and other scholars. Interchangeable neither with emotion nor
					embodiment — but instead marked by the concurrence of both across time and space
					— affect has been described as “modulated intensities” [Ahern 2019, 1] and
					“embodied capacities — phenomena that arise and circulate as intensities among
					assemblages” [Bladow and Ladino 2018, 6]. Informed by affect theory, critical
					environmental approaches to cultural texts, digital objects, and social
					formations come to address what Karen Barad [2007] terms <hi rend="italic"
					>intra-action</hi> or “<hi rend="italic">the mutual constitution of entangled
					agencies</hi>” [33, italics original]. For, as Bladow and Ladino [2018] further
					contend, “bodies, human and nonhuman, are perhaps the most salient sites at
					which affect and ecocriticism come together” [3]. The preceding theoretical
					points imply that affective digital environments similarly offer “salient sites”
					— narrative nexuses — to which human and nonhuman agents contribute “<hi
					rend="italic">entangled agencies</hi>.” </p>
				<p>As Ladino [2018] observes, an affective framework is vital to understanding the
					<hi rend="italic">What Is Missing?</hi> memorial as representative of DEH work
					that confronts biocultural loss while attending to the potential for ecological
					recovery and community hope. Envisioned by American landscape architect and
					sculptor Maya Lin — who in 1981 also designed the Vietnam Veterans Memorial in
					Washington D.C. — the project is “a global memorial to the planet” dedicated, in
					particular, to species affected by the sixth mass extinction in global
					geological history [What Is Missing? 2021]. Also known as the Holocene or
					Anthropocene extinction, the sixth mass extinction is marked by more frequent
					incidences of biological extermination within the context of rapid ecological
					loss accelerating since the nineteenth century. As a result of human activities,
					species extinction rates are much faster now in comparison to the “normal”
					background rates of the last ten million years with, for example, an estimated
					four-hundred vertebrate species becoming extinct over the last century
					[Ceballos, Ehrlich, and Raven 2020]. Understood as a digital platform for
					telling stories of extinction and recuperation, <hi rend="italic">What Is
					Missing?</hi> is a nexus of objects (artworks, images, audio recordings, maps,
					cultural histories, and first-hand accounts) concerning animals, plants, birds,
					reptiles, and amphibians with imperiled futures. Users navigate the memorial
					according to the categories “species,” “habitat,” and “anthro,” where the latter
					facilitates exploration of the ecological successes and failures associated with
					particular cultures, regions, and places. </p>
				<p>As a case in point, <hi rend="italic">What Is Missing?</hi> features a short
					narrative of Wood’s cycad (<hi rend="italic">Encephalartos woodii</hi>), a plant
					species endemic to South Africa but which is presently extinct in the wild.
					Considered among the rarest plants in the world, the cycad exists ex situ in the
					form of clones of a male specimen collected from the wild in the early twentieth
					century. The memorial includes this intriguing biocultural history as a
					launching point for further delving into the cycad’s story: “In 1895, a single
					clump of this cycad was discovered by John Medley Wood on the edge of a forest
					in South Africa. In 1903, Wood sent his deputy, James Wylie, to collect some of
					the smaller offsets for cultivation in the Durban Botanic Garden, where they
					survive to this day…It is not known what drove Wood’s cycad to extinction in the
					wild, or indeed if it ever was abundant” [What Is Missing? 2021]. Accompanied by
					an image of the species from Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew, the narrative of Wood’s
					cycad implicates colonialism in botanical extinctions globally [Schiebinger
					2007]. There is also the account of the Franklin tree (<hi rend="italic"
					>Franklinia alatamaha</hi>), native to the state of Georgia in the U.S. Although
					extinct since the early-nineteenth century, the tree is now cultivated
					ornamentally. An illustration from the late-eighteenth century by naturalist
					William Bartram visually links the decline of the Franklin tree, in part, to
					widespread colonial prospecting of plant species. </p>
				<p>Lin’s digital memorial entreats users to “learn about what is being lost, what is
					being done to help, and what each one of us can do” [What Is Missing? 2021].
					Encouraging users to contribute personal memories of species, habitats, and
					places, the project exemplifies — at least in its ethos and design — a
					participatory digital environmental humanities. The Map of Memory, in
					particular, solicits contributions of individual stories, accounts, and
					anecdotes toward the ideal of assembling “a collective memory of the planet”
					[What Is Missing? 2021]. With an austere black-and-white design suggestive of
					mourning, grief, and other Anthropocene affects, Lin’s digital memorial elegizes
					the loss of more-than-human life while invigorating optimism for rescuing
					species on the brink of extinction. The project’s reach, nevertheless, remains
					limited by technical impediments, notably the beta version of the portal with
					broken links and navigational glitches that impede narrative flow and disrupt
					users’ engagement with the material. What’s more, much of the content originates
					in other open-access platforms, namely Wikimedia Commons, raising concerns about
					the memorial’s long-term viability within the larger digital ecosystem. As
					evident in other DEH initiatives [for instance, Herbaria 3.0 2021a], the
					project’s aim is impressive but ultimately shrouded by questions of durability,
					continuity, and usability. For the memorial to grow organically in response to
					the ongoing extinction crisis — in other words, to become a viable and enduring
					platform—<hi rend="italic">What Is Missing?</hi> might aim to become part of a
					wider online-offline community concerned with extinction and devoted to
					environmental justice. Engaging the public as participants in — and contributors
					to — the digital environmental humanities is critical work, as seen in relation
					to citizen ecohumanism and the example of the Atlas of Living Australia. </p>
			</div>
			<div>
				<head>Citizen Ecohumanities: Crowdsourcing, Community Co-Production, and DEH</head>
				<p>According to a set of principles developed by the European Citizen Science
					Association in partnership with other international organizations, citizen
					science engages “citizens in scientific endeavor that generates new knowledge or
					understanding” and results in “a genuine science outcome” [Robinson et al. 2018,
					29]. Usually associated with astronomy, biology, ecology, public health, and
					allied fields, citizen science addresses immediate issues while facilitating
					public participation in research and policymaking [Hecker et al. 2018, 2].
					Interacting with communities as participants in research, citizen scientists
					often become emissaries of their fields, translating technical findings into
					public discourse and advocating for science’s transformative role in society. As
					a result, citizen science has become integral to open scholarship as a framework
					for disseminating research outcomes with minimal barriers to access and for
					engaging the public in scientific practices [Hecker et al. 2018, 8]. In this
					regard, Muki Haklay [2018, 61] distinguishes between micro-engagement and deep
					engagement, arguing that public participation should be recognized at multiple
					levels — from the occasional assistance of untrained volunteers to substantial,
					ongoing contributions by citizens with established expertise in the field. </p>
				<p>In response to the steady growth of theory and practice in citizen science, the
					concept of <hi rend="italic">citizen humanities</hi> has developed in recent
					years [Adamson 2017, Adamson, LeMenager, and Sandilands 2018, Hedges and Dunn
					2017, Heinisch et al. 2021]. Citizen humanities entails citizen-inspired and
					citizen-engaged research in the humanities, particularly archaeology, history,
					and linguistics as well as interdisciplinary work that crosses between the arts,
					humanities, social sciences, and natural sciences [Heinisch et al. 2021].
					On-site and in digital environments, citizen humanists apply humanities methods
					including collecting, curating, interviewing, transcribing, and annotating
					[Heinisch et al. 2021, 99, 114]. Expanding research capacity through a community
					orientation, citizen humanists play “a crucial role in preserving and enriching
					cultural heritage” [Heinisch et al. 2021, 115]. Mark Hedges and Stuart Dunn
					[2017] emphasize community co-production in the citizen humanities while, for
					Joni Adamson [2017], citizen-engaged projects “complement what we mean by
					citizen science and contribute to the most important conversations about how to
					respond to global and local environmental change” [117]. Integrating research
					and activism through crowd-sourcing and narrative techniques, DEH offers a
					timely framework for conducting citizen humanities “by staging different kinds
					of stories, oscillating between scales, and involving diverse participants in
					unfolding and recording nonhuman phenomena” [Cohen and LeMenager, 2016, 341]. </p>
				<p>Building on principles of citizen science and citizen humanities, <hi
					rend="italic">citizen ecohumanities</hi> denotes the engagement of the public —
					broadly, inclusively, and ecocentrically defined — in work that attempts to
					understand, document, and disseminate place-based knowledge of human-nature
					relations. Extending Barad’s [2007] idea of <hi rend="italic">intra-action</hi>,
					we further conceptualize “the public” to include multispecies communities of
					human and other-than-human members contributing knowledge, expertise, and skills
					toward a specific research outcome. Community-engaged work in the citizen
					ecohumanities moves beyond a singular focus on building ecological awareness
					mentioned, for example, earlier in this article in reference to the Biodiversity
					Heritage Library. In <hi rend="italic">Climate Change as Class War</hi>, as a
					case in point, Matthew T. Huber [2019] observes that the sustainability movement
					tends to elevate the value of public awareness in climate mitigation. In
					contrast to the dominant approach, Huber maintains that environmentalist
					discourse needs to foreground the material advantages of climate mitigation
					efforts. While DEH certainly engenders biocultural awareness, there also exist
					manifold opportunities to develop projects in the citizen ecohumanities with
					more immediate and tangible impacts on communities.</p>
				<p>An example of the citizen ecohumanities with a significant and ongoing
					crowdsourcing element is the Atlas of Living Australia, or ALA, hosted by the
					Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organization (CSIRO) as “a
					collaborative, digital, open infrastructure that pulls together Australian
					biodiversity data from multiple sources, making it accessible and reusable”
					[Atlas of Living Australia 2021b, para. 1]. Regarded as Australia’s most
					comprehensive biodiversity database — and one of the world’s premier
					biodiversity data platforms — the ALA provides conservation information to
					federal, non-government, educational, and community organizations. Established
					in 2010 by the Australian Government’s National Collaborative Infrastructure
					Strategy, the ALA is an aggregated, open, Creative Commons-based infrastructure
					supplying data to over 80,000 researchers annually [Belbin et al. 2021, 2]. In
					December 2021, the ALA held approximately 102 million records and 10,000
					datasets on 111,000 species. Data includes taxonomic classification,
					geographical distribution, and conservation status as well as photographs,
					background information on natural history collections, traditional Aboriginal
					Australian ecological knowledge, and other diverse data categories [Belbin et
					al. 2021, 2]. Broad in historical scope, the earliest data comes from the late
					1600s while thousands of species distribution, or occurrence, records are
					contributed each day.</p>
				<p>According to the UN Biodiversity Convention, Australia is a megadiverse country
					with unusually high levels of species endemism resulting from millions of years
					of biogeographical isolation. With the majority of species endemic to the
					continent, native plants represent a significant portion of Australia’s
					megadiversity. The country’s outstanding biodiversity, however, remains
					increasingly vulnerable to climate variability, habitat degradation, invasive
					species, coastal pollution, population growth, and other factors [Convention on
					Biological Diversity 2021]. As biodiversity declines, its cultural, social, and
					community values also become endangered. Accordingly, environmental humanists
					[for instance, Ryan 2014b] argue that biodiversity data also encodes humanistic
					data about species, such as <hi rend="italic">Nuytsia floribunda</hi>, the
					Western Australia Christmas tree, a plant only found in the south-west corner of
					the state [Atlas of Living Australia 2021a]. As a case in point, vernacular
					plant names disclose botanical histories and shifting social perceptions of
					certain species over time. Anglo-European colonists, for example, applied the
					name “cabbage tree” to <hi rend="italic">Nuytsia floribunda</hi> because of the
					strong, acrid, somewhat rotten smell emitted when the trunk was cut often during
					the process of clearing land for agriculture and settlement. In contrast,
					Wudjari Noongar (Aboriginal) nomenclature such as <hi rend="italic"
					>moodjaar</hi> inscribe longstanding cultural traditions centralizing the tree.
					Furthermore, scientific reports from all historical periods often include
					cultural accounts of human-environment relations, allowing users of biodiversity
					data archives such as ALA to grasp not only the science of species but also
					their ecohumanistic resonances in culture, society, history, politics, and
					Indigenous communities. </p>
				<p>As an illustration of citizen science with vast potential for citizen
					ecohumanism, the ALA collaborates with citizen groups such as Climate Watch as
					data procurement partners to identify current distribution patterns of
					Australian species. Climate Watch is a global, citizen science-based initiative
					focused on assessing the environmental effects of climate change. The
					open-access platform aims “to empower policymakers, researchers, media, and
					other stakeholders with the open climate data, visualizations and resources they
					need to gather insights on national and global progress on climate change”
					[Climate Watch 2021, para. 1]. In conjunction with well-established
					crowdsourcing platforms like Climate Watch, the ALA could develop a
					companionable focus on biocultural data about Australian species, thereby
					further empowering and inspiring communities to act on behalf of the environment
					and pursue environmental justice. A promising emphasis for the ALA to adopt is
					citizen ecohumanism, for instance, allowing users to contribute first-hand
					narrative accounts of Australian species comprising, among other things,
					memories of species’ historical occurrences, affective responses to the decline
					of plants locally, references to artistic and literary depictions of animals,
					and Indigenous cultures’ knowledge of bushfoods. This heterogeneous biocultural
					information could be solicited, collated, and made available on a separate
					digital platform — a strategy developed by the Floracultures project in response
					to the open-access Florabase repository of scientific information about Western
					Australian plants [Ryan 2014b]. In this way, a complementary platform would
					facilitate the preservation of Australian biocultural data that might otherwise
					not be formally recorded during the procurement of occurrence records. </p>

				<head>Human-Plant-Environment Relations: Digital Stories from the Botanical
					Humanities</head>
				<p>The study of human-plant-environment relations historically has been the domain
					of ethnobotany. Leveraging social scientific methods in researching plants, the
					interdisciplinary field of ethnobotany examines the material and immaterial —
					physical and spiritual — interconnections between people and flora in places
					over time [Balick and Cox 2020, Schultes and Von Reis 1995]. Since its emergence
					in the 1890s at the crossroads of botany and anthropology, ethnobotany has
					focused largely on the classification, uses, and perceptions of flora in
					traditional, preindustrial societies, especially Native America and Aboriginal
					Australia. Utilitarian in emphasis, ethnobotany empirically investigates the
					uses of plant species as foods, medicines, fibers, dyes, materials, ornaments,
					decorations, and totems. Alongside ethnobotany, over the last decade in
					particular, the field of human-plant studies — increasingly called “the
					botanical humanities” — has taken shape through the work of cultural theorists,
					philosophers, literary critics, ecologists, and biologists [Ryan <hi
					rend="italic">forthcoming</hi>]. Botanical humanists problematize dominant
					Western characterizations of plant life as the passive, sessile, and silent
					backdrop to human activities. Scholarship in this area addresses a range of
					ethical concern, from the social consequences of genetically manipulating seeds
					to the moral implications of plant sentience for mainstream agriculture. </p>
				<p>While clearly embedded in the ethnobotanical paradigm, the Native American
					Ethnobotany Database, or NAED, also exemplifies the digital environmental
					humanities — or what could even be called the digital botanical humanities — in
					practice well before the circulation of the term. Illustrating the values of
					durability and evolvability in open-access DEH, the project demonstrates the
					movement from analog to digital archival strategies for understanding
					human-plant-environment networks and making ethnobotanical knowledge broadly
					available. Released in the late 1990s in partnership with the University of
					Michigan-Dearborn, the online repository of Native American uses of plants
					currently contains around 45,000 data items related to 4,000 plant species and
					300 Native American cultures [Native American Ethnobotany Database 2021].
					Beginning in the mid-1970s, however, the database’s earliest components were
					developed using edge-punched index cards. In 1977, a print-based forerunner of
					the archive with about 5,000 items was converted to a database management
					platform known as Taxir and dubbed <hi rend="italic">American Medical
					Ethnobotany: A Reference Dictionary</hi>. Developed over a decade with
					assistance from the National Endowment for the Humanities, the National Science
					Foundation, and UM-Dearborn, an expanded version named Medicinal Plants of
					Native America was released in 1986 by the Museum of Anthropology at UM. This
					iteration comprised roughly 18,000 items detailing the therapeutic uses of 2,000
					plant species by 123 Native American cultures. In 1998, moreover, a book version
					of the database was published as <hi rend="italic">Native American
					Ethnobotany</hi> [Moerman]. Then, in 2003, with the further support of the
					National Science Foundation, another update became available, linking species in
					NAED to the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s PLANTS Database and enabling users
					to access photos, distribution maps, conservation status, and other information
					[USDA 2021]. The database’s evolution since the 1970s points to the value of
					multidisciplinary exchange in DEH, for example, in the diverse funding bodies
					and supporting institutions that have made the project possible. </p>
				<p>By highlighting the relationships between North American plants and Native
					American cultures through an open-access medium, NAED can be understood as a
					precursor of the digital environmental humanities. The database features
					culturally-salient tree species such as the Pacific silver fir (<hi
					rend="italic">Abies amabilis</hi>), the traditional uses of which were first
					documented by ethnobiologist Nancy Turner in the early 1970s. In total, NAED
					enumerates twenty-seven uses of <hi rend="italic">A. amabilis</hi> by seven
					cultures. The Bella Coola people of British Columbia, for instance, applied
					Pacific silver fir as an eye medicine, gastrointestinal aid, throat aid, and
					tuberculosis remedy, whereas the Oweekeno used the tree as a medicine for colds.
					Each entry lists the scientific name, common name, plant family, use category,
					and use sub-category for each species along with notes such as “liquid pitch
					mixed with mountain goat tallow and used for infected eyes” in reference to the
					Bella Coola treatment of eye diseases with Pacific silver fir. As a research
					tool, NAED supplies complete bibliographic details for each entry’s source,
					guiding users seeking further ethnobotanical information about particular plants
					and cultures. By clicking the hyperlinked names “Bella Coola” and “Oweekeno,”
					moreover, users can access all species with recorded uses by these cultures. </p>
				<p>The case of the Native American Ethnobotany Database underscores the potential
					for DEH to engage with new technologies — including pre- and post-digital
					forms—</p>
				<p>an issue also raised in our discussion of perennial eco-archiving and the work of
					the Long Now Foundation. The platform Mukurtu, for instance, is a
					community-driven content management system that enables Indigenous communities
					to preserve and disseminate their digital heritage in keeping with cultural
					protocols. In response to worldwide movements toward decolonization and
					reconciliation, Mukurtu presents a dynamic digital environmental humanities tool
					for managing ethnobiological data and extending the ambit of longstanding
					databases such as NAED [Christen 2019]. Notwithstanding its accessibility,
					adaptability, and durability, NAED presents a non-participatory mode of telling
					stories about the botanical world. Furthermore, the project reinscribes the
					historical authority of ethnobotany as the foremost scholarly paradigm for
					understanding human-plant relations and, specifically, the culturally-sensitive
					botanical knowledge of Indigenous people. As a counter example, Herbarium 3.0
					offers a user-based platform for disseminating stories of plants, people, and
					places by pairing “historical herbarium specimens with contemporary stories
					about plants to […] restore the layered histories of plant-human interactions”
					[GeoHumanities 2018, para. 3]. Reimagining the herbarium tradition of botanical
					science as interactive and open-ended, Herbaria 3.0 is a collaboration between
					plant biologists, environmental humanists, and researchers in science pedagogy
					designed to foreground the significance of vegetal life in an era of climate
					disturbance and species dislocation. As the organizers remark, “these stories
					can draw our attention to the intertwined nature of human-plant relationships.
					Turning to these relationships helps us to remember plants and reconnect with
					them, acknowledging the pivotal role plants play in our lives” [Herbaria 3.0
					2021b]. Toward this aim, narratives are organized into three categories: Story
					Garden, Stay-At-Home Stories (with a pandemic focus), and Root Stories. The
					Story Garden Map depicts the geographical distribution of stories, the majority
					of which are located in North America. The most recent entry consulted, “Musing
					from Under a Moss Leaf,” dated June 17, 2021, uses a specimen plate of the
					common hair moss (<hi rend="italic">Polytrichum commune</hi>) from the Oxford
					University Herbarium as a starting point for meditating on the evolutionary and
					ecological importance of this diminutive species. As of early 2022, however,
					Herbaria 3.0 appears underpopulated — its potential not yet realized — calling
					attention to the critical issue of sustaining public participation in DEH
					initiatives over time. </p>

				<head>Conclusion: Bolstering the Digital Environmental Humanities</head>
				<p>The strains elaborated in this article — perennial eco-archiving, Anthropocene
					narratives of loss, citizen ecohumanities, and human-plant-environment relations
					— illustrate the range of work currently falling within the scope of the digital
					environmental humanities. Whereas projects such as Herbaria 3.0 and the Atlas of
					Living Australia engage members of the public centrally as knowledge-bearers and
					knowledge-contributors, The Clock of the Long Now, Native American Ethnobotany
					Database, and others largely preclude community participation. This section
					offers some recommendations for bolstering DEH’s critical capacity by
					democratizing biocultural knowledge via community-responsive, narratively-based,
					transdisciplinary strategies. In embracing diverse theories and practices, DEH
					brings decolonial, arts-based, and practice-led models into dialogue with
					qualitative and quantitative approaches. </p>
				<p> One of DEH’s foremost aims should be to foster inclusive participation in
					open-access digital environments. This begins by generally recognizing the value
					of citizen ecohumanism and encourages the development of novel approaches to
					sustaining long-term community contributions. Possible strategies include
					integrating emerging and established social media platforms into projects; using
					DEH infrastructure as a basis for designing learning programs tailored to
					different educational levels, from undergraduate training to professional
					development; and creating on-site and virtual skill development workshops to
					facilitate content contributions to particular projects, for instance, through
					the writing of Anthropocene narratives, the collecting of biocultural data
					through interviews, or the analysis of historical documents using crowdsourced
					annotations. Harnessing data through ethnographic techniques, text mining, data
					visualization, geographic information systems, and other methods, environmental
					humanists — academic specialists and citizen ecohumanists alike — can open up
					“new research questions, scales of analysis, visualizations, audiences, and
					means of interaction” [Woodruff Library Humanities Team Exhibit n.d., para. 1]. </p>
				<p> As the field progresses, DEH will need to examine the ethical implications of
					converting nature into data. In this context, Sean Cubitt characterizes the
					datafication of nature as the “remaking of nature as data” in which habitats and
					more-than-human beings are interpreted no longer as corporeal phenomena but as
					data representing those phenomena [Cubitt 2017, 163]. Cubitt observes that, in
					order to become data, nature must be reduced to “common arithmetical form”
					[Cubitt 2017, 159]. Indeed, datafication risks diminishing the material
					urgencies surrounding the preservation of species in their habitats.
					Nonetheless, in relation to DEH, Alenda Chang stresses that the environmental
					humanities has the potential to return “the material world to often immaterial
					theories and histories of technology” [Chang 2021, 384–85]. The stronger
					emphasis on materiality afforded by DEH will enable practitioners to address
					issues such as the energy demands of digital activities, the disposal of
					electronic waste, and the transformation of embodied beings into datasets [Chang
					2021, 388]. </p>
				<p>DEH should also aim to engage diverse communities in various ways. Postcolonial
					advances in the digital humanities emphasize the telling of new stories in
					decolonized spaces allowing communities to share their own knowledge. For
					Roopika Risam [2019], postcolonial DH entails “designing new workflows and
					building new archives, tools, databases, and other digital objects that actively
					resist reinscriptions of colonialism and neocolonialism” [4]. Postcolonial DH,
					moreover, centralizes “politically, ethically, and social justice-minded
					approaches to digital knowledge production” [Risam 2019, 4]. Extending
					postcolonial critique to DEH is crucial, as well, given the underrepresentation
					of Indigenous cultures and the Global South in the digital humanities [for
					example, see Gomez 2019, Noble 2019]. These points become even more critical in
					light of projects like the Native American Ethnobotany Database and The Clock of
					the Long Now, disseminating the traditional knowledge of marginalized
					communities and incurring physical alterations to Indigenous peoples’ lands,
					respectively. </p>
				<p>DEH might also strive to balance critiques of the techno-utopianism dominating
					current studies of environmental sustainability with the uptake of emerging
					technologies such as virtual and augmented reality, artificial intelligence,
					machine learning, and quantum computing. As DEH scholars have observed since
					that field’s inception over a decade ago, DH’s long historical perspective on
					new technologies is pertinent to EH. By extending humanities approaches to the
					ecological and technological issues of the Anthropocene, DEH contributes to
					contemporary debates about ecology, media, and technology while advocating for
					new ways of thinking about the humanities [Posthumus, Sinclair, and Poplawski
					2018]. DEH should thus maintain a critical stance on its adoption of interactive
					post/digital tools to research and communicate ecological concerns [Posthumus,
					Sinclair, and Poplawski 2018, 168]. </p>
				<p>Informed by the arts, humanities, social sciences, and natural sciences, DEH can
					become more inclusive and innovative. In broad agreement with other DEH
					theorists, Alenda Chang [2021] contends that “an EH perspective could show
					digital humanists how to broaden the scope and stakes of their work while
					mitigating some of the oversights characteristic of technical solutions, in
					particular false abstraction from the physical world and the valorization of
					speed — whether of innovation, development, or deployment — over deliberation”
					[379]. Facilitating collaboration between academics, activists, artists,
					writers, community stakeholders, and knowledge-bearers, DEH offers an adaptable
					framework supporting more inclusive scholarship in which disciplinary
					interactions underlie innovation. </p>
				<p>As an inclusive scholarly-activist framework, DEH calls attention to ecological
					concerns at DH events, and, conversely, digital issues at EH events. This could
					entail establishing digital environmental humanities working groups or special
					interest groups within professional structures, including, for example, the
					Alliance of Digital Humanities Organizations (ADHO) and its Constituent
					Organizations. Equally, digital working groups within leading environmental
					humanities organizations such as the American Society for Environmental History
					and the Association for the Study of Literature and Environment would reinforce
					digital concerns and awareness throughout different areas of EH. Increasingly
					inclusive and activist in emphasis, DEH is well-positioned to continue to
					address Anthropocene urgencies while imagining possibilities for human and
					more-than-human flourishing. </p>
