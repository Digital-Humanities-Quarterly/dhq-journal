				<p>Researchers in the complementary fields of the digital humanities and the environmental
					humanities have begun to collaborate under the auspices of the <term>digital environmental
					humanities</term> (DEH). The overarching aim of this emerging field is to leverage digital
					technologies in understanding and addressing the urgencies of the Anthropocene.
					Emphasizing DEH’s focus on natural and cultural vitality, this article begins with a
					historical overview of the field. Crafting an account of the field’s emergence, we argue
					that the present momentum toward DEH exhibits four broad thematic strains including
					perennial eco-archiving; Anthropocene narratives of loss; citizen ecohumanities; and
					human-plant-environment relations. Within each of the four areas, the article identifies
					how DEH ideas have been implemented in significant projects that engage with, envision,
					re-imagine, and devise communities for environmental action and transformation. We
					conclude with suggestions for further bolstering DEH by democratizing environmental
					knowledge through open, community-engaged methods.</p>

				<head>Introduction</head>
				<p>A hand-colored lithograph from the mid-nineteenth century features the common brushtail
					possum (<term>Trichosurus vulpecula</term>), an Australian marsupial illustrated by
					artists H. C. Richter and Elizabeth Gould (<ref target="#figure01">see Figure 1</ref>).
					Naturalist John Gould included this illustration in his monumental three-volume
					compilation <title rend="italic">The Mammals of Australia</title> (<ref
					target="#gould1863">1863</ref>), the first major survey of Australian mammals, some of
					which have declined dramatically in number or become extinct since its publication. In
					also depicting what appears to be a small banksia, a kind of wildflower common throughout
					Australia, the image suggests the ecological interactions between the native marsupial and
					the endemic plant. An engrossing visual record of environmental history and interspecies
					relations, the illustration and many others are freely available through the Biodiversity
					Heritage Library <ptr target="#bhl2021"/>. By <cit><quote rend="inline">collaboratively
					making biodiversity literature openly available to the world as part of a global
					biodiversity community</quote><ptr loc="¶1" target="#bhl2021"/></cit>, this open-access
					platform exemplifies the digital environmental humanities put into practice for
					engendering communities of action — in this instance, oriented toward biodiversity
					awareness and protection in Australia. While revealing early Anglo-European modes of
					visually representing Australian fauna, lithographs such as these today have the potential
					to catalyze ecological awareness and change, promote an appreciation of the country’s
					exceptional biodiversity, and serve as educational launching points for exploring the
					entangled histories of animals, plants, people, landscapes, ecologies, and technologies in
					Australia and elsewhere.</p>

				<p>This article provides a broad, comprehensive overview of current developments and
					prospective paths in the <term>digital environmental humanities</term> (abbreviated as DEH
					throughout). It begins by calling attention to DEH’s focus on natural and cultural
					vitality — or what theorists of heritage term <cit><quote rend="inline">biocultural
					diversity</quote><ptr target="#bridgewater_etal2019"/></cit> — in an era of pervasive
					environmental decline. We turn retrospectively to a synopsis of the growth of DEH over the
					last decade as an integrative area of scholarship synthesizing the companionable aims of
					the digital and environmental humanities. Key theoretical and methodological elaborations
					of DEH — as well as recent developments in the field — will be delineated. Assembling a
					narrative of the field’s emergence, we argue that the current acceleration of DEH in
					response to the Anthropocene context reveals the following four broad thematic focal
					areas: <list type="ordered">
					<item>Perennial eco-archiving (through the work of the Long Now Foundation)</item>
					<item>Anthropocene narratives of loss (<title rend="italic">What is
						Missing?</title>)</item>
					<item>Citizen ecohumanities (<title rend="italic">Atlas of Living
						Australia</title>)</item>
					<item>Human-plant-environment relations (<title rend="italic">Native American Ethnobotany
						Archive</title>)</item>
					</list></p>
				<p>Within each area, we identify the ways in which DEH ideas and practices have been
					implemented in these especially illustrative projects that engage with, envision,
					re-imagine, and devise communities for environmental action and transformation. We
					conclude with recommendations for supporting and strengthening work in DEH by further
					democratizing biocultural knowledge via open, community-engaged, participatory approaches.
					Throughout the article, we view DEH as conceptualized within university contexts but
					extending beyond the academy to encompass the work of community organizations and
					concerned individuals. Furthermore, in selecting the four case studies above, we
					necessarily exclude related projects of relevance to DEH such as Anna L. Tsing and
					colleagues’ <title rend="italic">Feral Atlas: A More-Than-Human Anthropocene</title> (<ref
					target="#tsing_etal2021">2021</ref>), an archive of field reports from artists, humanists,
					and scientists on feral ecologies that continue to resist human control and have spread
					widely.</p>

				<p>DEH encompasses diverse histories, theories, debates, practices, techniques, and projects
					internationally <ptr target="#chang2021"/> <ptr target="#cohen_etal2016"/> <ptr
					target="#jorgensen2014"/> <ptr target="#posthumus_etal2018"/>. As a case in point, <ref
					target="#figure02">Figure 2</ref> represents central Perth, Western Australia,
					illustrating how the area might have appeared in circa 1829, a year of intensive colonial
					activity during which James Stirling explored the Swan River and Charles Fremantle seized
					the area for the British Crown. In 2014, an interdisciplinary research team based at Edith
					Cowan University in Perth produced the visualization using GIS (Geographic Information
					System) and three-dimensional modelling techniques incorporating an array of source
					materials including Noongar (Aboriginal Australian) narratives, nineteenth-century Swan
					River Colony maps, aerial photography, European settlers’ accounts, artists’ impressions,
					literary representations, and geological and vegetation charts <ptr
					target="#ryan_etal2019"/>. Given its inclusion in a public exhibition on wetlands at Perth
					Town Hall in 2014, followed by a permanent digital presence on the state museum website
					<ptr target="#australian_museum2021"/>, this reconstructed perspective of central Perth
					offers a graphic means to consider the city’s historical development and envisage
					opportunities to prevent the further loss of Perth’s extant wetlands. The <title
					rend="quotes">Re-imagining Perth’s Wetlands</title> project is an example of the
					multifaceted, multidisciplinary, community-focused, and often-participatory orientation of
					DEH through initiatives aiming to broaden public awareness of the interlinked cultural and
					ecological urgencies of the present. Work in DEH has the potential to energize political,
					social, and community transformations including, as this case demonstrates, the
					conservation of rapidly disappearing urban wetland environments. In contrast to landscape
					visualizations such as this, other initiatives use different methods including the
					archival conservation of biocultural heritage through open-access, participatory digital
					platforms (see, for instance, <ref target="#geohumanities2018">GeoHumanities 2018</ref>
					and <ref target="#herbaria2021a">Herbaria 3.0</ref>).</p>

				<p>DEH responds to the exigencies of the Anthropocene. As a provisional unit of the
					<term>Geological Time Scale</term> — a system of chronological dating based on changes in
					geological strata over vast periods of time — the Anthropocene <cit><quote rend="inline"
					>reflects profound and ongoing Earth System change</quote><ptr loc="p. 331"
					target="#zalasiewicz_etal2019"/></cit>. Mounting geophysical data differentiates the
					Anthropocene from its precursor, the Holocene, beginning roughly 11,650 years ago.
					Geochronologists locate the historical boundary between epochs in the Great Acceleration —
					the rapid upsurge in human population — and the first nuclear bomb detonations, both in
					the mid-twentieth century <ptr target="#zalasiewicz2015"/>. The Anthropocene <cit><quote
					rend="inline">represents a major change in trajectory of the Earth system from the more or
					less stable conditions that have seen human civilization develop and expand over the past
					few thousand years</quote><ptr loc="p. 500" target="#zalasiewicz2019"/></cit>.
					Nevertheless, the increasing circulation of the Anthropocene neologism has provoked
					proposals for alternative designations — from Capitalocene, Chthulucene, Homogenocene, and
					Myxocene to Plantationocene, Planthroposcene, Symbiocene, Thanatocene, and, even,
					Bandwaggonocene. Environmental historian Jason W. Moore (<ref target="#moore2017"
					>2017</ref>), for instance, advocates the term <term>Capitalocene</term> to acknowledge
					the vast networks of human and nonhuman labor exploited under global capitalism while
					Science and Technology Studies scholar Donna Haraway (<ref target="#haraway2016"
					>2016</ref>) employs <term>Chthulucene</term> to foreground the <cit><quote rend="inline"
					>ongoing multispecies stories and practices of becoming-with in times that remain at
					stake</quote><ptr loc="¶24" target="#haraway2016"/></cit>. What’s more, anthropologist
					Natasha Myers (<ref target="#myers2017">2017</ref>) has proposed
					<term>Planthroposcene</term> as <cit><quote rend="inline">an aspirational episteme and way
					of doing life in which people come to recognize their profound interimplication with
					plants […] The Planthroposcene is a call to change the terms of encounter, to make allies
					with these green beings</quote><ref target="#myers2017">pp. 299–300</ref></cit>. As these
					lexical confutations suggest, a pressing task of the environmental humanities has been the
					formulation of novel vocabularies sufficient to articulate the formidable effects of rapid
					ecological change on shared natural-cultural thriving.</p>

				<head>Key Developments in the Digital Environmental Humanities: 2011–2016</head>
				<p>In the Anthropocene context, DEH confronts global precarities of climate disruption,
					biodiversity loss, environmental injustice, Indigenous peoples’ diminished land rights,
					and the weakening of biocultural knowledge networks in the wake of ecological degradation.
					With its approximately ten-year history, DEH remains an emergent — and, even, contingent —
					area of scholarship and activism that brings the technological and digital expertise of
					the digital humanities (DH) into dialogue with the ecological and biospheric concerns of
					the environmental humanities (EH). During the five-year period between 2011 and 2016, DEH
					made considerable progress toward integrating the digital and environmental spheres of
					interest represented by its constituent fields. In 2011, members of the Munich-based
					Rachel Carson Center began the <title rend="italic">Ant Spider Bee</title> blog
					<cit><quote rend="inline">to engage academics and practitioners in exploration,
					discussion, and reflection about digital practices, methodologies, and applications in
					environmental humanities work</quote><ptr loc="¶1" target="#carson_center2011"/></cit>.
					The blog’s third section <title rend="quotes">Bee</title>, for example, features short
					articles reflecting on current advances and outlining notable projects in the field. As
					astrophysicist Chris Lintott (<ref target="#lintott2015">2015</ref>) explains in his
					contribution to <title rend="quotes">Bee</title>, digital tools such as Zooniverse,
					<cit><quote rend="inline">the world’s largest and most popular platform for people-powered
					research</quote><ptr loc="¶1" target="#zooniverse2021"/></cit>, harness the considerable
					potential of citizen research across disciplines — from identifying endangered animals
					recorded in camera trap images to analyzing nineteenth-century mariners’ weather logs in
					order to comprehend climate change implications in the present.</p>
				<p>Alongside the <title rend="italic">Ant Spider Bee</title> forum, one of the field’s
					earliest initiatives was the Digital Environmental Humanities Network, or DEHN. With
					funding from Canada’s Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council, the DEHN convened a
					pivotal workshop in September 2013 at McGill University <cit><quote rend="inline">to bring
					digital and the environmental humanities scholars together to showcase work that had
					already been done at the intersection of these two fields and to concretize the possible
					emergence of a new field</quote><ptr loc="p. 159" target="#posthumus_etal2018"/></cit>.
					Consolidating interest in the DEH nexus, the workshop included digital humanists as well
					as scholars specializing in particular areas of the environmental humanities, namely,
					ecocriticism and environmental history. At the time of writing, although listed as a
					research cluster on the McGill University website, the network appears largely inactive,
					illustrating the broader challenges of sustaining DEH initiatives over time in the light
					of research funding contingencies and ongoing institutional privileging of disciplinary
					specialization <ptr target="#environment_society_portal2021"/> <ptr loc="p. 106"
					target="#jorgensen2014"/>.</p>
				<p>Also in 2013, the editors of <title rend="italic">Environmental Humanities</title> — the
					field’s premier journal published since 2012 in an open-access format — in partnership
					with the Environmental and Society Portal at the Rachel Carson Center, issued a call for
					papers for a special issue <title rend="quotes">The Digital / Environmental Humanities
					Nexus: Challenges and Opportunities</title> <ptr target="#carson_center2013"/>. Although
					it appears to have never eventuated — or could have been diverted into other publications,
					projects, or forums — the issue promised <cit><quote rend="inline">to reflect on
					intersections between digital and environmental humanities from a variety of perspectives
					[as well as to] enrich understandings of the extent to which digital technologies and
					resources are informing current environmental humanities scholarship</quote><ptr loc="¶3"
					target="#carson_center2013"/></cit>. In one of the first DEH-related articles published in
					<title rend="italic">Environmental Humanities</title>, entitled <title rend="quotes">The
					Armchair Traveler’s Guide to Digital Environmental Humanities</title> (<ref
					target="#jorgensen2014">2014</ref>), environmental historian Finn Arne Jørgensen develops
					a persuasive argument for ongoing collaborative efforts between the history of technology,
					the environmental humanities, and the digital humanities.</p>
				<p>Between 2014 and 2016, DEH gained further standing as a focus of digital humanities
					conference presentations and special issues of academic journals. At the 2014 Digital
					Humanities Australasia (DHA) conference, for instance, environmental humanist (and an
					author of the current article) John C. Ryan presented <title rend="quotes">FloraCultures:
					The Nature of a Biodiversity Archive for Plant-Based Cultural Heritage</title>,
					characterizing the <quote rend="inline" source="#ryan2014a">eco-digital humanities</quote>
					as a <cit><quote rend="inline">possibility</quote><ptr target="#ryan2014a"/></cit>. The
					presentation considered the use of digital archival technologies for the conservation of
					botanical — or plant-based — cultural heritage in Perth, Western Australia. A city of
					remarkable floristic diversity, Perth also faces formidable conservation challenges,
					including urban and suburban development in addition to the spread of native plant
					pathogens, exacerbated by climate precarities <ptr target="#ryan2014b"/>. As plants
					vanish, so do the irreplaceable heritage values associated with them. In advocating DEH as
					a response to botanical diversity loss, the presentation theorized <term>environmental
					poiesis</term> as the making of digital artifacts informed by ideas of environmental
					ethics, ecological justice, ecofeminism, sustainability, bioregionalism, biodiversity
					conservation, and multispecies thinking.</p>
				<p>Special issues on DEH in the literary criticism journals <title rend="italic">Green
					Letters</title> <ptr target="#dobrin2014"/> and <title rend="italic">PMLA</title> <ptr
					target="#cohen_etal2016"/> brought much-needed critical attention to the potential for
					dialogue between the digital and environmental humanities. Contributors to the <title
					rend="italic">PMLA</title> issue addressed concepts from language ecology to digital
					affect in addition to projects from the <title rend="italic">Icelandic Saga Map</title> to
					the online journal of Indigenous writing, <title rend="italic">Dawnland Voices
					2.0</title>. During this period, as well, key conceptual analyses, notably Bethany
					Nowviskie’s <title rend="quotes">Digital Humanities in the Anthropocene</title> (<ref
					target="#nowviskie2015">2015</ref>), broadened the theoretical scope of the DEH debate.
					Nowviskie (<ref target="#nowviskie2015">2015</ref>) suggests that DEH orient toward the
					environmental and human implications of digital research — from the socio-political
					influence of device manufacturers to the carbon footprints of ostensibly low-impact
					digital projects. For Nowviskie and others, DEH entails addressing head-on the omnipresent
					urgencies of the Anthropocene, not the least of which is the widespread loss of nonhuman
					beings, species, and biodiverse ecosystems.</p>
			</div>
			<div>
				<head>Theoretical and Methodological Tenets: Technology, Story, Ecology, Temporality </head>
				<p>As a whole, the major theoretical and methodological elaborations of DEH attempt to
					synthesize the strengths — while redressing limitations — of the digital and environmental
					humanities as discrete fields <ptr target="#chang2021"/> <ptr target="#cohen_etal2016"/>
					<ptr target="#cummings_etal2020"/> <ptr target="#geohumanities2018"/> <ptr
					target="#jorgensen2014"/> <ptr target="#ladino2018"/> <ptr target="#linley2016"/> <ptr
					target="#nowviskie2015"/> <ptr target="#posthumus_etal2014"/> <ptr
					target="#posthumus_etal2018"/> <ptr target="#sinclair_etal2017"/> <ptr
					target="#travis_etal2016"/>. This section briefly addresses four areas of focus within
					current conceptualizations of DEH as an emergent, integrative, and transdisciplinary field
					of research and practice: technology, story, ecology, and temporality. The capacity of DEH
					to address these four deeply entangled areas — often simultaneously — demonstrates its
					potential in the present epoch.</p>
				<p>In an early elaboration of the field, Stephanie Posthumus and Stéfan Sinclair (<ref
					target="#posthumus_etal2014">2014</ref>) characterize DEH as <cit><quote rend="inline">a
					new and burgeoning area that still remains largely undefined, but that asserts the
					importance of the humanities in responding to the ecological crisis while leveraging new
					tools and technologies</quote><ref loc="p. 254" target="#posthumus_etal2014">p.
					254</ref></cit>. From their perspective, DEH brings the tools and methods of DH to bear on
					concerns within EH; conversely, EH’s planetary and political focus helps to elucidate
					aspects of digital tool-making and critique central to DH. For Posthumus and Sinclair
					(<ref target="#posthumus_etal2014">2014</ref>), EH promotes sustainable societal
					interactions with the natural world whereas DH has remained less critical of
					techno-scientific practices that carry the potential for ecological harm. In turn, DH
					problematizes what Posthumus and Sinclair identify as EH’s inherent bias against
					technocentric — and, even, technocratic — salves to social, cultural, linguistic, and
					environmental challenges. Moreover, DH’s long historical outlook on the emergence of

					Posthumus and Sinclair propose <term>digital ecology</term> as a concept that, by
					reconciling the entrenched binaries of hardware/software, computer/user, and real/virtual,
					discloses how digital environments facilitate novel interpretations of material
					environments, and vice versa.</p>
				<p> Posthumus and Sinclair’s privileging of stories and storytelling aligns with Jørgensen’s
					(<ref target="#jorgensen2014">2014</ref>) assertion that DEH centers on <cit><quote
					rend="inline">new forms of storytelling and presentation</quote><ref loc="p. 110"
					target="#jorgensen2014">p. 110</ref></cit>. Indeed, innovations in new media technologies
					facilitate the emergence of multi-dimensional stories about the relations between people,
					nonhumans, landscapes, and technologies. In his analysis of the Norwegian Broadcasting
					Corporation’s <q>slow travel</q> series of digitally-enhanced television programs,
					Jørgensen (<ref target="#jorgensen2014">2014</ref>) argues that <quote rend="inline"
					source="#jorgensen2014">distant natures, those that are not experienced through the body
					but distributed through data and media, need different modes of analysis and
					storytelling</quote> (<ref loc="p. 109" target="#jorgensen2014">p. 109</ref>). At the same
					time, environmental humanists assert that biocultural values take shape through the
					stories individuals and communities tell about nature as well as the stories that nature
					tells about itself <ptr target="#griffiths2007"/>. As environmental historian Tom
					Griffiths (<ref target="#griffiths2007">2007</ref>) explains in a seminal overview of the
					environmental humanities, <cit><quote rend="inline">The stories we live by determine the
					future. So, in harnessing the power of narrative, in listening to, rediscovering and
					generating true stories, we change the world</quote><ptr loc="¶2" target="#griffiths2007"
					/></cit>. In similar terms, ecomusicologist Kate Galloway (<ref target="#galloway2017"
					>2017</ref>) emphasizes the narrative possibilities of DEH for embracing the integral role
					of technology in comprehending and communicating ecological issues. Methods of
					aural-digital storytelling — audio-recorded soundwalks, multi-modal sound maps, and
					crowdsourcing techniques — expand audiences to comprise academics as well as community
					members grappling with the direct impacts of climate change, ecosystem degradation, and
					related urgencies. In particular, storytelling modes that incorporate the body and the
					multiple senses can engage the public more compellingly in environmental debates. For
					Galloway (<ref target="#galloway2017">2017</ref>), the creation of digital-narrative
					objects that <quote rend="inline" source="#galloway2017">circulate in an open-access
					format and often contain research materials contributed by a research collective</quote>
					constitutes an embodied, participatory process of social knowledge formation (<ref loc="
					p. 52" target="#galloway2017">p. 52</ref>).</p>
				<p>DEH introduces ecological concerns to DH and, reciprocally, digital concerns to EH through
					the analysis of human-technological impacts on the biosphere. Margaret Linley (<ref
					target="#linley2016">2016</ref>) characterizes this recalibration as <cit><quote
					rend="inline">the ecological turn in the digital humanities</quote><ref loc="p. 411"
					target="#linley2016">p. 411</ref></cit>. Having an environmental orientation that
					centralizes nature-culture-technology intersections, DEH encourages <cit><quote
					rend="inline">advocacy, engagement, action, and participation as well as an ethics of
					responsibility, sustainability, and conservation</quote><ptr loc="p. 427"
					target="#linley2016"/></cit>. Most crucially, DEH approaches ecology not as a metaphor,
					figuration, or abstraction but as a material certainty that shapes the lived experiences
					of humans and others. Echoing Posthumus and Sinclair’s elaboration of <term>digital
					ecology</term>, other scholars have proposed the term <term>digital Anthropocene</term> to
					signify the conjunction of the digital revolution, climate catastrophe, and social,
					political, and economic precarities <ptr target="#travis_etal2016"/>. While developing
					digital and environmental competencies, DEH facilitates generative exchanges across the
					arts, humanities, social sciences, and sciences <ptr loc="p. 203"
					target="#travis_etal2016"/>.</p>
				<p>Correspondingly, Sidney Dobrin’s (<ref target="#dobrin2014">2014</ref>) theorization of
					<term>digital environments</term> calls into question the assumption that environmental
					crisis originates in technology and, more specifically, technological excess or
					technology-gone-astray. For Dobrin (<ref target="#dobrin2014">2014</ref>), digital
					environments are <cit><quote rend="inline">themselves natures and environments in and with
					which humans and non-humans forge relationships</quote><ref loc="p. 205"
					target="#dobrin2014">p. 205</ref></cit>. As such, DEH presents a framework <cit><quote
					rend="inline">emphasising the role of the humanities in responding to ecological crisis
					while also embracing new technologies and tools</quote><ptr loc="p. 206"
					target="#dobrin2014"/></cit>. To be sure, recent theory and practice in DEH has grown
					along the three axes of technology, story, and ecology, particularly in relation to the
					growing urgency of climate disaster and ecosystem collapse. Open-access resources such as
					NASA’s Global Climate Change portal offer downloadable time-lapse visualizations, for
					instance, of ice mass loss in Greenland between 2002 and 2020 (<ref target="#figure03">see
					Figure 3</ref>). Similarly, the Smithsonian Institution National Museum of Natural
					History’s <title rend="quotes">Eruptions, Earthquakes, and Emissions</title> (E3)
					application presents a time-lapse visualization of 250,000 volcanic eruptions and
					earthquakes since 1960 <ptr target="#smithsonian2013"/>. Originating in the sciences,
					these and other digital environments — to invoke Dobrin’s term — constitute invaluable
					storytelling platforms for EH-related research, pedagogy, and outreach in response to the
					Anthropocene.</p>

				<p>In many ways, the ten-year evolution of the landmark collection <title rend="italic">Ant
					Spider Bee: Chronicling Digital Transformations in Environmental Humanities</title> <ptr
					target="#coulter_etal2021a"/> parallels the development of DEH. The open-access book is

					reflect on ways technology was transforming the epistemologies, methods, and dissemination
					of environmental humanities research</quote><ptr loc="p. 10" target="#coulter_etal2021c"
					/></cit>. Both the book and the blog demonstrate the ongoing interweaving of EH and DH
					theories and methods within the DEH nexus. Published by the Rachel Carson Center for
					Environment and Society — as noted, a leader in DEH globally — the collection comprises
					forty-two short, reflective chapters arranged in five sections: <list type="ordered">
					<item>Evolution</item>
					<item>Engagement: New Voices</item>
					<item>Mediations: New Forms</item>
					<item>Metamorphoses: New Natures</item>
					<item>An Experiment in Collecting and Curating</item>
					</list>The editors characterize the <title rend="italic">Ant Spider Bee</title> initiative
					— from its origins as a blog to its present dissemination as a book — as an experiment in
					long-term collecting and curating. Cognizance of the longue durée and, by extension, deep
					temporality, underlies the project’s ethos of curation: <cit><quote rend="inline">As the
					use of digital technologies to gather and process knowledge becomes increasingly natural,
					we hope that <emph>this digital time capsule</emph> will offer insights about the past,
					for the future</quote><ptr loc="p.      229" target="#coulter_etal2021b"/></cit> (emphasis
					added). As suggested in the following discussion of perennial eco-archiving and,
					specifically, the work of <title rend="none">The Long Now Foundation</title>, a deep
					temporal outlook is integral to the digital environmental humanities.</p>
			</div>
			<div>
				<head>Perennial Eco-Archiving: Deep Time Awareness and the Longue Durée of DEH</head>
				<p>Environmental humanists stress that understanding the implications of the Anthropocene for
					the future of life on Earth necessitates grappling with deep time as both a bewildering
					abstraction and an embodied immediacy <ptr target="#ginn_etal2018"/>. Representing Earth
					or geological history, deep time is a sense of time that registers in
					<term>millionennia</term> — millions of years — instead of millennia. In the Anthropocene
					context, paleobiologist Jan Zalasiewicz (<ref target="#zalasiewicz2017">2017</ref>) calls
					attention to <cit><quote rend="inline">a peculiarity of geological time, which is that, at
					heart, it is simply time — albeit <emph>in very large amounts</emph></quote><ref loc="p.
					124" target="#zalasiewicz2017">p. 124</ref></cit> (emphasis added). As a recent
					specialization within the environmental humanities, the paleoenvironmental humanities (or
					PEH) emphasizes the value of deep time narratives, ranging from hopeful stories of
					human-non-human resilience to tragic accounts of biocultural collapse. PEH responds to the
					urgency of engendering deep time awareness in the environmental humanities through
					empirical investigation of archaeological materials. The aim is <cit><quote rend="inline"
					>to reframe the wider discourse on climate change in terms of our quickly expanding
					deep-time knowledge and to demonstrate that humans can neither be characterized as beings
					fundamentally divorced from nature</quote><ptr loc="p.      7" target="#hussain_etal2020"
					/></cit>. Considering the challenge of comprehending deep, geological time, the objectives
					of PEH are estimable. In <title rend="italic">Timefulness</title> (<ref
					target="#bjornerud2018">2018</ref>), for example, geologist Marcia Bjornerud proposes the
					term <term>chronophobia</term> to signify the innate human aversion to deep time. For
					Bjornerud (<ref target="#bjornerud2018">2018</ref>), the perils of <cit><quote
					rend="inline">temporal illiteracy</quote><ref loc="p. 7" target="#bjornerud2018">p.
					7</ref></cit> are formidable. As an antidote to chronophobia, <emph>timefulness</emph>
					situates human culture in Earth history, promoting deep time consciousness.</p>
				<p> Developed with respect to deep time, the idea of <term>perennial eco-archiving</term>
					refers to temporally-expansive, <emph>timeful</emph> archival work that preserves
					knowledge of language, society, and environment. Perennial archiving involves
					high-resolution data, archiving servers, and other long-term conservation techniques and
					technologies <ptr loc="p. 122" target="#andro2018"/>. Perennial eco-archiving, then,
					applies comparable digital strategies to curate, conserve, and disseminate nature-culture
					interconnections, especially as related to theories and practices of sustainability. As a
					case in point, the Digital Matters Lab at the University of Utah adopted a four-year focus
					on sustainability in order to contribute to current debates within the digital humanities
					while addressing ecological challenges particular to Utah including long-term drought,
					water rights, air quality, and access to public lands <ptr target="#cummings_etal2020"/>.
					The sustainability emphasis galvanized attention to issues of durability, temporality, and
					scale: <cit><quote rend="inline">Sustainability not only prompts us to think of the
					durability of digital projects, but also asks us <emph>to think differently about the
					timescales on which we usually consider technology</emph>; instead of thinking in
					processing times and milliseconds, sustainability might prompt us <emph>to consider the
					millennia that our e-waste takes to degrade</emph></quote><ptr loc="¶22"
					target="#cummings_etal2020"/></cit> (emphasis added). The theme invited researchers to
					interrogate ecological issues — that is, to think in terms of environmental sustainability
					— while also critically considering the longevity of digital-activist projects. As an
					example of DEH research concerned with the longue durée, the Digital Matters Lab project
					highlights the integrated digital-environmental inflections of the term
					<term>conservation</term> — that, rather than oppositional, digital and environmental
					conservation can go hand-in-hand. The <term>digital environments</term> resulting from DEH
					collaborations help to dismantle the longstanding division between the digital
					(disembodied, technological, abstract) and the ecological (corporeal, material,
					relational).</p>
				<p> The <emph>timeful</emph> work of <title rend="none">The Long Now Foundation</title>
					concretizes the notion of perennial eco-archiving while highlighting some challenges
					surrounding the idea. The Foundation is a nonprofit dedicated to advancing long-term
					thinking at the scale of 10,000 years <ptr target="#long_now2021a"/>. The organization’s
					temporally-ambitious work includes <title rend="quotes">The Clock of the Long Now</title>,
					<quote rend="inline" source="#long_now2021a">a 10,000 year monument to long-term
					thinking,</quote> and <title rend="quotes">The Rosetta Project</title>, <cit><quote
					rend="inline">a living archive of 1,500 human languages</quote><ptr
					target="#long_now2021b"/></cit>. The latter is <cit><quote rend="inline">a global
					collaboration of language specialists and native speakers working to build a publicly
					accessible digital [and post-digital] library of human languages</quote><ptr
					target="#long_now2021b"/></cit>. <title rend="quotes">The Rosetta Project</title> responds
					to the looming problem of digital obsolescence and the pressing need to devise new
					archival techniques with long purviews. Techno-linguistic innovations such as the Rosetta
					Disk address the likelihood that global language loss will triple within forty years,
					marked by the extinction of one language on average per month <ptr
					target="#bromham_etal2021"/>. To avert the catastrophic disappearance of nearly 1,500
					languages by the century’s end, language documentation, multilingual education programs,
					and other community-based initiatives are required urgently <ptr
					target="#bromham_etal2021"/>. Toward this aim, the Rosetta Disk offers a post-digital
					solution. The three-inch diameter nickel disk encodes 14,000 pages of linguistic
					information microscopically on its surface. Rather than a digital encryption, however,
					each page constitutes an image, allowing the information to be retrieved through optical
					magnification. What’s more, the Rosetta Wearable Disk is a miniaturized version of the
					language archive, measuring merely two centimeters in diameter and designed to be worn
					comfortably on the human body — as an embodied, mobile repository of language, culture,
					and environment.</p>
				<p><title rend="quotes">The Rosetta Project</title> illuminates the overlays between
					linguistic, cultural, and biological diversity. As global biological diversity decreases,
					linguistic and cultural diversity decline in response. This co-occurrence of linguistic
					and biological diversity underscores the importance of integrated, multidisciplinary

					target="#gorenflo2012"/>. Understood in this context, environmental relations inhere
					within the project’s emphasis on <q>traditional culture,</q> <q>cultural diversity,</q>
					and <q>cultural and linguistic diversity</q> <ptr loc="¶9" target="#long_now2021a"/>.
					Simply put, the project reminds us that culture and nature are intrinsically related
					rather than diametrically opposed. Another perennial eco-archiving initiative of <title
					rend="none">The Long Now Foundation</title> — one with a deep-time, post-digital
					orientation comparable to <title rend="quotes">The Rosetta Project</title> — is the Clock
					of the Long Now. Under construction inside a mountain in western Texas, the clock will
					keep time for the longue durée of the Anthropocene. With more than 3.5 million possible
					sonic combinations, the device will yield a unique chime each day for ten thousand years.
					Incorporating principles of longevity, maintainability, transparency, evolvability, and
					scalability, the clock problematizes the short-term thinking underlying the global
					environmental crisis <ptr target="#clock2021"/>. While foregrounding deep-time
					consciousness, the Clock of the Long Now — sequestered in the mountain area it has
					transformed materially through its construction — remains remote, inaccessible, and
					haunted by its own monumentalism. Although ambitious, the project appears to lack the
					participatory, community-minded focus that we see as essential to the digital — and, for
					that matter, post-digital — environmental humanities.</p>
				<p>Recognizing the geophysical implications of decisions, actions, and behaviors, the
					Anthropocene underscores the material-digital imbrications between human bodies,
					technological transformations, and ecological systems. Through its fostering of
					time-consciousness and temporal literacy, DEH imparts immediacy to the <cit><quote
					rend="inline">human/digital/planetary interface</quote><ptr loc="p. 311"
					target="#dawson2021"/></cit>. Illustrated by the work of <title rend="none">The Long Now
					Foundation</title>, perennial eco-archiving, in particular, raises the crucial question,
					<cit><quote rend="inline">How does understanding the digital [and post-digital]
					contribution to environmental crisis relate to digitally [and post-digitally]
					understanding environmental crisis?</quote><ptr loc="p. 311" target="#dawson2021"/></cit>.
					As eco-archives with very long temporal purviews, <title rend="quotes">The Clock of the
					Long Now</title> and <title rend="quotes">The Rosetta Project</title> draw attention to
					post/digital materialities. In other words, developed in digital environments, both
					projects anticipate post-digital urgencies of linguistic, cultural, and ecological loss.
					Weaving between the environmental and digital, these and other deep-time-oriented DEH
					platforms have the potential to <cit><quote rend="inline">inspire more sustainable
					behaviors</quote><ptr loc="p.      3" target="#gould2016"/></cit>. It is within this
					context that DEH also provides a vibrant basis for communicating Anthropocene narratives
					of loss, recovery, and hope especially through the engendering of affect.</p>
			</div>
			<div>
				<head>Anthropocene Narratives of Loss, Recovery, and Hope: Engendering Affect </head>
				<p>Affect is a potent confluence of feelings, senses, and memories with the capacity to
					energize the Anthropocene narratives of DEH. Arguing for the significance of affect in the
					digital environmental humanities, ecohumanists such as Jennifer Ladino focus on the ways
					in which digital environments facilitate affective responses to biocultural loss. From
					Ladino’s (<ref target="#ladino2018">2018</ref>) standpoint, DEH enables us to reimagine
					<cit><quote rend="inline">how to represent, cope with, and deploy loss in the service of a
					more just present and perhaps even a livable future</quote><ref loc="p. 189"
					target="#ladino2018">p. 189</ref></cit>. Employing multimodal and multisensory strategies
					to communicate Anthropocene precarities, DEH embraces the transformative potential of
					affect, understood as <cit><quote rend="inline">the powerful, visceral, pre- or even
					non-cognitive feelings that arise and are transmitted in both virtual and actual
					environments</quote><ptr loc="p. 189" target="#ladino2018"/></cit>. Consider, for
					instance, the affective work of the Climate Stories Project (<ref
					target="#climate_stories2023">2023</ref>), an online platform for sharing firsthand
					accounts of climate change through oral histories. In contrast to this project’s
					predominant focus on human experience, one of the aims of DEH is to understand how digital
					objects and environments narrate <emph>other beings’ lives</emph> and, in doing so,
					nurture cross-species empathy <ptr loc="p. 199" target="#ladino2018"/>.</p>
				<p>To be certain, Ladino’s ideas reflect the impact of the <term>affective turn</term> on the
					environmental humanities and cognate fields. Conceptualizations of affect in human
					geography, literary studies, social psychology, and other scholarly areas highlight the
					intercorporeal phenomenon of bodies being affected by — and reciprocally affecting — other
					bodies within ecological systems. Over the last twenty years, the field of critical affect
					studies has taken shape through the writings of Adam Frank, Brian Massumi, Eve Sedgwick,
					and other scholars. Interchangeable neither with emotion nor embodiment — but instead
					marked by the concurrence of both across time and space — affect has been described as
					<cit><quote rend="inline">modulated intensities</quote><ptr loc="p. 1" target="#ahern2019"
					/></cit> and <cit><quote rend="inline">embodied capacities — phenomena that arise and
					circulate as intensities among assemblages</quote><ptr loc="p. 6"
					target="#bladow_etal2018"/></cit>. Informed by affect theory, critical environmental
					approaches to cultural texts, digital objects, and social formations come to address what
					Karen Barad (<ref target="#barad2007">2007</ref>) terms <term>intra-action</term> or
					<cit><quote rend="inline"><emph>the mutual constitution of entangled
					agencies</emph></quote><ref loc="p. 33" target="#barad2007">p. 33</ref></cit> (italics
					original). For, as Bladow and Ladino (<ref target="#bladow_etal2018">2018</ref>) further
					contend, <cit><quote rend="inline">bodies, human and nonhuman, are perhaps the most
					salient sites at which affect and ecocriticism come together</quote><ref loc="p. 3"
					target="#bladow_etal2018">p. 3</ref></cit>. The preceding theoretical points imply that
					affective digital environments similarly offer <q>salient sites</q> — narrative nexuses —
					to which human and nonhuman agents contribute <quote rend="inline"
					source="#bladow_etal2018"><term>entangled agencies</term></quote>.</p>
				<p>As Ladino (<ref target="#ladino2018">2018</ref>) observes, an affective framework is vital
					to understanding the <title rend="italic">What Is Missing?</title> memorial as
					representative of DEH work that confronts biocultural loss while attending to the
					potential for ecological recovery and community hope. Envisioned by American landscape
					architect and sculptor Maya Lin — who in 1981 also designed the Vietnam Veterans Memorial
					in Washington D.C. — the project is <quote rend="inline" source="#missing2021">a global
					memorial to the planet</quote> dedicated, in particular, to species affected by the sixth
					mass extinction in global geological history <ptr target="#missing2021"/>. Also known as
					the Holocene or Anthropocene extinction, the sixth mass extinction is marked by more
					frequent incidences of biological extermination within the context of rapid ecological
					loss accelerating since the nineteenth century. As a result of human activities, species
					extinction rates are much faster now in comparison to the <q>normal</q> background rates
					of the last ten million years with, for example, an estimated four-hundred vertebrate
					species becoming extinct over the last century <ptr target="#ceballos_etal2020"/>.
					Understood as a digital platform for telling stories of extinction and recuperation,
					<title rend="italic">What Is Missing?</title> is a nexus of objects (artworks, images,
					audio recordings, maps, cultural histories, and first-hand accounts) concerning animals,
					plants, birds, reptiles, and amphibians with imperiled futures. Users navigate the
					memorial according to the categories <q>species,</q> <q>habitat,</q> and <q>anthro,</q>
					where the latter facilitates exploration of the ecological successes and failures
					associated with particular cultures, regions, and places.</p>
				<p>As a case in point, <title rend="italic">What Is Missing?</title> features a short
					narrative of Wood’s cycad (<term>Encephalartos woodii</term>), a plant species endemic to
					South Africa but which is presently extinct in the wild. Considered among the rarest
					plants in the world, the cycad exists ex situ in the form of clones of a male specimen
					collected from the wild in the early twentieth century. The memorial includes this
					intriguing biocultural history as a launching point for further delving into the cycad’s
					story: <cit><quote rend="block">In 1895, a single clump of this cycad was discovered by
					John Medley Wood on the edge of a forest in South Africa. In 1903, Wood sent his deputy,
					James Wylie, to collect some of the smaller offsets for cultivation in the Durban Botanic
					Garden, where they survive to this day…It is not known what drove Wood’s cycad to
					extinction in the wild, or indeed if it ever was abundant.</quote><ptr
					target="#missing2021"/></cit> Accompanied by an image of the species from Royal Botanic
					Gardens, Kew, the narrative of Wood’s cycad implicates colonialism in botanical
					extinctions globally <ptr target="#schiebinger2007"/>. There is also the account of the
					Franklin tree (<term>Franklinia alatamaha</term>), native to the state of Georgia in the
					U.S. Although extinct since the early-nineteenth century, the tree is now cultivated
					ornamentally. An illustration from the late-eighteenth century by naturalist William
					Bartram visually links the decline of the Franklin tree, in part, to widespread colonial
					prospecting of plant species.</p>
				<p>Lin’s digital memorial entreats users to <cit><quote rend="inline">learn about what is
					being lost, what is being done to help, and what each one of us can do</quote><ptr
					target="#missing2021"/></cit>. Encouraging users to contribute personal memories of
					species, habitats, and places, the project exemplifies — at least in its ethos and design
					— a participatory digital environmental humanities. The Map of Memory, in particular,
					solicits contributions of individual stories, accounts, and anecdotes toward the ideal of
					assembling <cit><quote rend="inline">a collective memory of the planet</quote><ptr
					target="#missing2021"/></cit>. With an austere black-and-white design suggestive of
					mourning, grief, and other Anthropocene affects, Lin’s digital memorial elegizes the loss
					of more-than-human life while invigorating optimism for rescuing species on the brink of
					extinction. The project’s reach, nevertheless, remains limited by technical impediments,
					notably the beta version of the portal (at time of writing) with broken links and
					navigational glitches that impede narrative flow and disrupt users’ engagement with the
					material. What’s more, much of the content originates in other open-access platforms,
					namely Wikimedia Commons, raising concerns about the memorial’s long-term viability within
					the larger digital ecosystem. As evident in other DEH initiatives (for instance, <ref
					target="#herbaria2021a">Herbaria 3.0</ref>), the project’s aim is impressive but
					ultimately shrouded by questions of durability, continuity, and usability. For the
					memorial to grow organically in response to the ongoing extinction crisis — in other
					words, to become a viable and enduring platform — <title rend="italic">What Is
					Missing?</title> might aim to become part of a wider online-offline community concerned
					with extinction and devoted to environmental justice. Engaging the public as participants
					in — and contributors to — the digital environmental humanities is critical work, as seen
					in relation to citizen ecohumanism and the example of the <title rend="italic">Atlas of
					Living Australia</title>.</p>

				<head>Citizen Ecohumanities: Crowdsourcing, Community Co-Production, and DEH</head>
				<p>According to a set of principles developed by the European Citizen Science Association in

					scholarship as a framework for disseminating research outcomes with minimal barriers to
					access and for engaging the public in scientific practices <ptr loc="p. 8"
					target="#hecker_etal2018"/>. In this regard, Muki Haklay (<ref target="#haklay2018"

				<p>Building on principles of citizen science and citizen humanities, <term>citizen
					ecohumanities</term> denotes the engagement of the public — broadly, inclusively, and
					ecocentrically defined — in work that attempts to understand, document, and disseminate
					place-based knowledge of human-nature relations. Extending Barad’s (<ref
					target="#barad2007">2007</ref>) idea of <term>intra-action</term>, we further
					conceptualize <term>the public</term> to include multispecies communities of human and
					other-than-human members contributing knowledge, expertise, and skills toward a specific
					research outcome. Community-engaged work in the citizen ecohumanities moves beyond a
					singular focus on building ecological awareness mentioned, for example, earlier in this
					article in reference to the Biodiversity Heritage Library. In <title rend="italic">Climate
					Change as Class War</title>, as a case in point, Matthew T. Huber (<ref
					target="#huber2022">2019</ref>) observes that the sustainability movement tends to elevate
					the value of public awareness in climate mitigation. In contrast to the dominant approach,
					Huber maintains that environmentalist discourse needs to foreground the material
					advantages of climate mitigation efforts. While DEH certainly engenders biocultural
					awareness, there also exist manifold opportunities to develop projects in the citizen
					ecohumanities with more immediate and tangible impacts on communities.</p>
				<p>An example of the citizen ecohumanities with a significant and ongoing crowdsourcing
					element is the <title rend="italic">Atlas of Living Australia</title>, or ALA, hosted by
					the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organization (CSIRO) as <cit><quote
					rend="inline">a collaborative, digital, open infrastructure that pulls together Australian
					biodiversity data from multiple sources, making it accessible and reusable</quote><ptr
					loc="¶1" target="#atlas2021b"/></cit>. Regarded as Australia’s most comprehensive
					biodiversity database — and one of the world’s premier biodiversity data platforms — the
					ALA provides conservation information to federal, non-government, educational, and
					community organizations. Established in 2010 by the Australian Government’s National
					Collaborative Infrastructure Strategy, the ALA is an aggregated, open, Creative
					Commons-based infrastructure supplying data to over 80,000 researchers annually <ptr
					loc="p. 2" target="#belbin_etal2021"/>. In December 2021, the ALA held approximately 102
					million records and 10,000 datasets on 111,000 species. Data includes taxonomic
					classification, geographical distribution, and conservation status as well as photographs,
					background information on natural history collections, traditional Aboriginal Australian
					ecological knowledge, and other diverse data categories <ptr loc="p.      2"
					target="#belbin_etal2021"/>. Broad in historical scope, the earliest data comes from the
					late 1600s while thousands of species distribution, or occurrence, records are contributed
					each day.</p>
				<p>According to the UN Biodiversity Convention, Australia is a megadiverse country with
					unusually high levels of species endemism resulting from millions of years of
					biogeographical isolation. With the majority of species endemic to the continent, native
					plants represent a significant portion of Australia’s megadiversity. The country’s
					outstanding biodiversity, however, remains increasingly vulnerable to climate variability,
					habitat degradation, invasive species, coastal pollution, population growth, and other
					factors <ptr target="#convention2021"/>. As biodiversity declines, its cultural, social,
					and community values also become endangered. Accordingly, environmental humanists for
					instance, <ptr target="#ryan2014b"/> argue that biodiversity data also encodes humanistic
					data about species, such as <term>Nuytsia floribunda</term>, the Western Australia
					Christmas tree, a plant only found in the south-west corner of the state <ptr
					target="#atlas2021a"/>. As a case in point, vernacular plant names disclose botanical
					histories and shifting social perceptions of certain species over time. Anglo-European
					colonists, for example, applied the name <q>cabbage tree</q> to <term>Nuytsia
					floribunda</term> because of the strong, acrid, somewhat rotten smell emitted when the
					trunk was cut often during the process of clearing land for agriculture and settlement. In
					contrast, Wudjari Noongar (Aboriginal) nomenclature such as <term>moodjaar</term> inscribe
					longstanding cultural traditions centralizing the tree. Furthermore, scientific reports
					from all historical periods often include cultural accounts of human-environment
					relations, allowing users of biodiversity data archives such as ALA to grasp not only the
					science of species but also their ecohumanistic resonances in culture, society, history,
					politics, and Indigenous communities.</p>
				<p>As an illustration of citizen science with vast potential for citizen ecohumanism, the ALA
					collaborates with citizen groups such as Climate Watch as data procurement partners to
					identify current distribution patterns of Australian species. Climate Watch is a global,
					citizen science-based initiative focused on assessing the environmental effects of climate
					change. The open-access platform aims <cit><quote rend="inline">to empower policymakers,
					researchers, media, and other stakeholders with the open climate data, visualizations and
					resources they need to gather insights on national and global progress on climate
					change</quote><ptr loc="¶1" target="#climate_watch2021"/></cit>. In conjunction with
					well-established crowdsourcing platforms like Climate Watch, the ALA could develop a
					companionable focus on biocultural data about Australian species, thereby further
					empowering and inspiring communities to act on behalf of the environment and pursue
					environmental justice. A promising emphasis for the ALA to adopt is citizen ecohumanism,
					for instance, allowing users to contribute first-hand narrative accounts of Australian
					species comprising, among other things, memories of species’ historical occurrences,
					affective responses to the decline of plants locally, references to artistic and literary
					depictions of animals, and Indigenous cultures’ knowledge of bushfoods. This heterogeneous
					biocultural information could be solicited, collated, and made available on a separate
					digital platform — a strategy developed by the Floracultures project in response to the
					open-access Florabase repository of scientific information about Western Australian plants
					<ptr target="#ryan2014b"/>. In this way, a complementary platform would facilitate the
					preservation of Australian biocultural data that might otherwise not be formally recorded
					during the procurement of occurrence records.</p>

				<head>Human-Plant-Environment Relations: Digital Stories from the Botanical Humanities</head>
				<p>The study of human-plant-environment relations historically has been the domain of
					ethnobotany. Leveraging social scientific methods in researching plants, the
					interdisciplinary field of ethnobotany examines the material and immaterial — physical and
					spiritual — interconnections between people and flora in places over time <ptr
					target="#balick_etal2020"/> <ptr target="#schultes_etal1995"/>. Since its emergence in the
					1890s at the crossroads of botany and anthropology, ethnobotany has focused largely on the
					classification, uses, and perceptions of flora in traditional, preindustrial societies,
					especially Native America and Aboriginal Australia. Utilitarian in emphasis, ethnobotany
					empirically investigates the uses of plant species as foods, medicines, fibers, dyes,
					materials, ornaments, decorations, and totems. Alongside ethnobotany, over the last decade
					in particular, the field of human-plant studies — increasingly called <quote rend="inline"
					source="#ryan2023">the botanical humanities</quote> — has taken shape through the work of
					cultural theorists, philosophers, literary critics, ecologists, and biologists <ptr
					target="#ryan2023"/>. Botanical humanists problematize dominant Western characterizations
					of plant life as the passive, sessile, and silent backdrop to human activities.
					Scholarship in this area addresses a range of ethical concern, from the social
					consequences of genetically manipulating seeds to the moral implications of plant
					sentience for mainstream agriculture.</p>
				<p>While clearly embedded in the ethnobotanical paradigm, the <title rend="italic">Native
					American Ethnobotany Database</title>, or NAED, also exemplifies the digital environmental
					humanities — or what could even be called the digital botanical humanities — in practice
					well before the circulation of the term. Illustrating the values of durability and
					evolvability in open-access DEH, the project demonstrates the movement from analog to
					digital archival strategies for understanding human-plant-environment networks and making
					ethnobotanical knowledge broadly available. Released in the late 1990s in partnership with
					the University of Michigan-Dearborn, the online repository of Native American uses of
					plants currently contains around 45,000 data items related to 4,000 plant species and 300
					Native American cultures <ptr target="#ethnobotany_database2021"/>. Beginning in the
					mid-1970s, however, the database’s earliest components were developed using edge-punched
					index cards. In 1977, a print-based forerunner of the archive with about 5,000 items was
					converted to a database management platform known as Taxir and dubbed <title rend="italic"
					>American Medical Ethnobotany: A Reference Dictionary</title>. Developed over a decade
					with assistance from the National Endowment for the Humanities, the National Science
					Foundation, and UM-Dearborn, an expanded version named Medicinal Plants of Native America
					was released in 1986 by the Museum of Anthropology at UM. This iteration comprised roughly
					18,000 items detailing the therapeutic uses of 2,000 plant species by 123 Native American
					cultures. In 1998, moreover, a book version of the database was published as <title
					rend="italic">Native American Ethnobotany</title> <ptr target="#moerman1998"/>. Then, in
					2003, with the further support of the National Science Foundation, another update became
					available, linking species in NAED to the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s PLANTS Database
					and enabling users to access photos, distribution maps, conservation status, and other
					information <ptr target="#usda2021"/>. The database’s evolution since the 1970s points to
					the value of multidisciplinary exchange in DEH, for example, in the diverse funding bodies
					and supporting institutions that have made the project possible.</p>
				<p>By highlighting the relationships between North American plants and Native American
					cultures through an open-access medium, NAED can be understood as a precursor of the
					digital environmental humanities. The database features culturally-salient tree species
					such as the Pacific silver fir (<term>Abies amabilis</term>), the traditional uses of
					which were first documented by ethnobiologist Nancy Turner in the early 1970s. In total,
					NAED enumerates twenty-seven uses of <term>A. amabilis</term> by seven cultures. The Bella
					Coola people of British Columbia, for instance, applied Pacific silver fir as an eye
					medicine, gastrointestinal aid, throat aid, and tuberculosis remedy, whereas the Oweekeno
					used the tree as a medicine for colds. Each entry lists the scientific name, common name,
					plant family, use category, and use sub-category for each species along with notes such as
					<quote rend="inline" source="#ethnobotany_database2021">liquid pitch mixed with mountain
					goat tallow and used for infected eyes</quote> in reference to the Bella Coola treatment
					of eye diseases with Pacific silver fir. As a research tool, NAED supplies complete
					bibliographic details for each entry’s source, guiding users seeking further
					ethnobotanical information about particular plants and cultures. By clicking the
					hyperlinked names <title rend="quotes">Bella Coola</title> and <title rend="quotes"
					>Oweekeno</title>, moreover, users can access all species with recorded uses by these
					cultures.</p>
				<p>The case of the <title rend="italic">Native American Ethnobotany Database</title>
					underscores the potential for DEH to engage with new technologies — including pre- and
					post-digital forms — an issue also raised in our discussion of perennial eco-archiving and
					the work of <title rend="none">The Long Now Foundation</title>. The platform <title
					rend="italic">Mukurtu</title>, for instance, is a community-driven content management
					system that enables Indigenous communities to preserve and disseminate their digital
					heritage in keeping with cultural protocols. In response to worldwide movements toward
					decolonization and reconciliation, <title rend="none">Mukurtu</title> presents a dynamic
					digital environmental humanities tool for managing ethnobiological data and extending the
					ambit of longstanding databases such as NAED <ptr target="#christen2019"/>.
					Notwithstanding its accessibility, adaptability, and durability, NAED presents a
					non-participatory mode of telling stories about the botanical world. Furthermore, the
					project reinscribes the historical authority of ethnobotany as the foremost scholarly
					paradigm for understanding human-plant relations and, specifically, the
					culturally-sensitive botanical knowledge of Indigenous people. As a counter example,
					<title rend="none">Herbarium 3.0</title> offers a user-based platform for disseminating
					stories of plants, people, and places by pairing <cit><quote rend="inline">historical
					herbarium specimens with contemporary stories about plants to […] restore the layered
					histories of plant-human interactions</quote><ptr loc="¶3" target="#geohumanities2018"
					/></cit>. Reimagining the herbarium tradition of botanical science as interactive and
					open-ended, <title rend="none">Herbaria 3.0</title> is a collaboration between plant
					biologists, environmental humanists, and researchers in science pedagogy designed to
					foreground the significance of vegetal life in an era of climate disturbance and species
					dislocation. As the organizers remark, <cit><quote rend="inline">these stories can draw
					our attention to the intertwined nature of human-plant relationships. Turning to these
					relationships helps us to remember plants and reconnect with them, acknowledging the
					pivotal role plants play in our lives</quote><ptr target="#herbaria2021b"/></cit>. Toward
					this aim, narratives are organized into three categories: Story Garden, Stay-At-Home
					Stories (with a pandemic focus), and Root Stories. The Story Garden Map depicts the
					geographical distribution of stories, the majority of which are located in North America.
					The entry consulted, <title rend="quotes">Musing from Under a Moss Leaf</title>, dated
					June 17, 2021, uses a specimen plate of the common hair moss (<term>Polytrichum
					commune</term>) from the Oxford University Herbarium as a starting point for meditating on
					the evolutionary and ecological importance of this diminutive species. Overall, however,
					<title rend="none">Herbaria 3.0</title> appears underpopulated — its potential not yet
					realized — calling attention to the critical issue of sustaining public participation in
					DEH initiatives over time.</p>

				<head>Conclusion: Bolstering the Digital Environmental Humanities</head>
				<p>The strains elaborated in this article — perennial eco-archiving, Anthropocene narratives
					of loss, citizen ecohumanities, and human-plant-environment relations — illustrate the
					range of work currently falling within the scope of the digital environmental humanities.
					Whereas projects such as <title rend="none">Herbaria 3.0</title> and the <title
					rend="italic">Atlas of Living Australia</title> engage members of the public centrally as
					knowledge-bearers and knowledge-contributors, <title rend="quotes">The Clock of the Long
					Now</title>, <title rend="italic">Native American Ethnobotany Database</title>, and others
					largely preclude community participation. This section offers some recommendations for
					bolstering DEH’s critical capacity by democratizing biocultural knowledge via
					community-responsive, narratively-based, transdisciplinary strategies. In embracing
					diverse theories and practices, DEH brings decolonial, arts-based, and practice-led models
					into dialogue with qualitative and quantitative approaches.</p>
				<p> One of DEH’s foremost aims should be to foster inclusive participation in open-access
					digital environments. This begins by generally recognizing the value of citizen
					ecohumanism and encourages the development of novel approaches to sustaining long-term
					community contributions. Possible strategies include integrating emerging and established
					social media platforms into projects; using DEH infrastructure as a basis for designing
					learning programs tailored to different educational levels, from undergraduate training to
					professional development; and creating on-site and virtual skill development workshops to
					facilitate content contributions to particular projects, for instance, through the writing
					of Anthropocene narratives, the collecting of biocultural data through interviews, or the
					analysis of historical documents using crowdsourced annotations. Harnessing data through
					ethnographic techniques, text mining, data visualization, geographic information systems,
					and other methods, environmental humanists — academic specialists and citizen ecohumanists
					alike — can open up <cit><quote rend="inline">new research questions, scales of analysis,
					visualizations, audiences, and means of interaction</quote><ptr loc="¶1"
					target="#woodruff_library2021"/></cit>.</p>
				<p> As the field progresses, DEH will need to examine the ethical implications of converting
					nature into data. In this context, Sean Cubitt characterizes the datafication of nature as
					the <quote rend="inline" source="#cubitt2017">remaking of nature as data</quote> in which
					habitats and more-than-human beings are interpreted no longer as corporeal phenomena but
					as data representing those phenomena <ptr loc="p. 163" target="#cubitt2017"/>. Cubitt
					observes that, in order to become data, nature must be reduced to <cit><quote
					rend="inline">common arithmetical form</quote><ptr loc="p. 159" target="#cubitt2017"
					/></cit>. Indeed, datafication risks diminishing the material urgencies surrounding the
					preservation of species in their habitats. Nonetheless, in relation to DEH, Alenda Chang
					stresses that the environmental humanities has the potential to return <cit><quote
					rend="inline">the material world to often immaterial theories and histories of
					technology</quote><ptr loc="pp. 384–85" target="#chang2021"/></cit>. The stronger emphasis
					on materiality afforded by DEH will enable practitioners to address issues such as the
					energy demands of digital activities, the disposal of electronic waste, and the
					transformation of embodied beings into datasets <ptr loc="p. 388" target="#chang2021"
					/>.</p>
				<p>DEH should also aim to engage diverse communities in various ways. Postcolonial advances in
					the digital humanities emphasize the telling of new stories in decolonized spaces allowing
					communities to share their own knowledge. For Roopika Risam (<ref target="#risam2019"
					>2019</ref>), postcolonial DH entails <cit><quote rend="inline">designing new workflows
					and building new archives, tools, databases, and other digital objects that actively
					resist reinscriptions of colonialism and neocolonialism</quote><ref loc="p. 4"
					target="#risam2019">p. 4</ref></cit>. Postcolonial DH, moreover, centralizes <cit><quote
					rend="inline">politically, ethically, and social justice-minded approaches to digital
					knowledge production</quote><ptr loc="p. 4" target="#risam2019"/></cit>. Extending
					postcolonial critique to DEH is crucial, as well, given the underrepresentation of
					Indigenous cultures and the Global South in the digital humanities <ptr
					target="#gomez2019"/> <ptr target="#noble2019"/>. These points become even more critical
					in light of projects like the <title rend="italic">Native American Ethnobotany
					Database</title> and <title rend="quotes">The Clock of the Long Now</title>, disseminating
					the traditional knowledge of marginalized communities and incurring physical alterations
					to Indigenous peoples’ lands, respectively.</p>
				<p>DEH might also strive to balance critiques of the techno-utopianism dominating current
					studies of environmental sustainability with the uptake of emerging technologies such as
					virtual and augmented reality, artificial intelligence, machine learning, and quantum
					computing. As DEH scholars have observed since that field’s inception over a decade ago,
					DH’s long historical perspective on new technologies is pertinent to EH. By extending
					humanities approaches to the ecological and technological issues of the Anthropocene, DEH
					contributes to contemporary debates about ecology, media, and technology while advocating
					for new ways of thinking about the humanities <ptr target="#posthumus_etal2018"/>. DEH
					should thus maintain a critical stance on its adoption of interactive post/digital tools
					to research and communicate ecological concerns <ptr loc="p.      168"
					target="#posthumus_etal2018"/>.</p>
				<p>Informed by the arts, humanities, social sciences, and natural sciences, DEH can become
					more inclusive and innovative. In broad agreement with other DEH theorists, Alenda Chang
					(<ref target="#chang2021">2021</ref>) contends that <cit><quote rend="inline">an EH
					perspective could show digital humanists how to broaden the scope and stakes of their work
					while mitigating some of the oversights characteristic of technical solutions, in
					particular false abstraction from the physical world and the valorization of speed —
					whether of innovation, development, or deployment — over deliberation</quote><ref loc="p.
					379" target="#chang2021">p. 379</ref></cit>. Facilitating collaboration between academics,
					activists, artists, writers, community stakeholders, and knowledge-bearers, DEH offers an
					adaptable framework supporting more inclusive scholarship in which disciplinary
					interactions underlie innovation.</p>
				<p>As an inclusive scholarly-activist framework, DEH calls attention to ecological concerns at
					DH events, and, conversely, digital issues at EH events. This could entail establishing
					digital environmental humanities working groups or special interest groups within
					professional structures, including, for example, the Alliance of Digital Humanities
					Organizations (ADHO) and its Constituent Organizations. Equally, digital working groups
					within leading environmental humanities organizations such as the American Society for
					Environmental History and the Association for the Study of Literature and Environment
					would reinforce digital concerns and awareness throughout different areas of EH.
					Increasingly inclusive and activist in emphasis, DEH is well-positioned to continue to
					address Anthropocene urgencies while imagining possibilities for human and more-than-human
					flourishing.</p>
