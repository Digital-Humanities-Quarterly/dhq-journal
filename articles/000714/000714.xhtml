                  <p>Researchers in the complementary fields of the digital humanities and the
                     					environmental humanities have begun to collaborate under the auspices of the
                     					<em class="term">digital environmental humanities</em> (DEH). The overarching aim of this
                     					emerging field is to leverage digital technologies in understanding and
                     					addressing the urgencies of the Anthropocene. Emphasizing DEH’s focus on natural
                     					and cultural vitality, this article begins with a historical overview of the
                     					field. Crafting an account of the field’s emergence, we argue that the present
                     					momentum toward DEH exhibits four broad thematic strains including perennial
                     					eco-archiving; Anthropocene narratives of loss; citizen ecohumanities; and
                     					human-plant-environment relations. Within each of the four areas, the article
                     					identifies how DEH ideas have been implemented in significant projects that
                     					engage with, envision, re-imagine, and devise communities for environmental
                     					action and transformation. We conclude with suggestions for further bolstering
                     					DEH by democratizing environmental knowledge through open, community-engaged
                     					methods.</p>

                     					illustrated by artists H. C. Richter and Elizabeth Gould [see Figure 1].
                     					Naturalist John Gould included this illustration in his monumental three-volume
                     					compilation <cite class="title italic">The Mammals of Australia</cite> (<a href="#gould1863">1863</a>), the first major survey of Australian mammals,
                     					some of which have declined dramatically in number or become extinct since its
                     					publication. In also depicting what appears to be a small banksia, a kind of
                     					wildflower common throughout Australia, the image suggests the ecological
                     					interactions between the native marsupial and the endemic plant. An engrossing

                     					part of a global biodiversity community” [<a class="ref" href="#bhl2021">BHL 2021</a>, ¶1], this open-access platform exemplifies the digital environmental
                     					humanities put into practice for engendering communities of action — in this

                     					While revealing early Anglo-European modes of visually representing Australian
                     					fauna, lithographs such as these today have the potential to catalyze ecological
                     					awareness and change, promote an appreciation of the country’s exceptional
                     					biodiversity, and serve as educational launching points for exploring the
                     					entangled histories of animals, plants, people, landscapes, ecologies, and

                     					prospective paths in the digital environmental humanities (abbreviated as DEH
                     					throughout). It begins by calling attention to DEH’s focus on natural and
                     					cultural vitality — or what theorists of heritage term “biocultural diversity” [<a class="ref" href="#bridgewater_etal2019">Bridgewater and Rotherham 2019</a>] — in

                     					synthesizing the companionable aims of the digital and environmental humanities.
                     					Key theoretical and methodological elaborations of DEH — as well as recent

                     to
                     					the Anthropocene context reveals the following four broad thematic focal areas:

                     					geological strata over vast periods of time — the Anthropocene “reflects profound and ongoing Earth System change” [<a class="ref" href="#zalasiewicz_etal2019">Zalasiewicz et al 2019</a>, p. 331]. Mounting geophysical data

                     					with unusually high levels of species endemism resulting from millions of years
                     					of biogeographical isolation. With the majority of species endemic to the
                     					continent, native plants represent a significant portion of Australia’s
                     					megadiversity. The country’s outstanding biodiversity, however, remains
                     					increasingly vulnerable to climate variability, habitat degradation, invasive
                     					species, coastal pollution, population growth, and other factors [<a class="ref" href="#convention2021">Convention on Biological Diversity 2021</a>]. As biodiversity declines, its cultural, social, and
                     					community values also become endangered. Accordingly, environmental humanists
                     					for instance, [<a class="ref" href="#ryan2014b">Ryan 2014(b)</a>] argue that biodiversity data also
                     					encodes humanistic data about species, such as <em class="term">Nuytsia floribunda</em>,
                     					the Western Australia Christmas tree, a plant only found in the south-west
                     					corner of the state [<a class="ref" href="#atlas2021a">Atlas of Living Australia 2021(a)</a>]. As a case in point, vernacular
                     					plant names disclose botanical histories and shifting social perceptions of
                     					certain species over time. Anglo-European colonists, for example, applied the
                     					name “cabbage tree” to <em class="term">Nuytsia floribunda</em> because of the
                     					strong, acrid, somewhat rotten smell emitted when the trunk was cut often during

                     					flora in traditional, preindustrial societies, especially Native America and

                     					an era of climate disturbance and species dislocation. As the organizers remark,
                     					“these stories can draw our attention to the
                     					intertwined nature of human-plant relationships. Turning to these relationships
                     					helps us to remember plants and reconnect with them, acknowledging the pivotal
                     					role plants play in our lives” [<a class="ref" href="#herbaria2021b">Herbaria 3.0 2021(b)</a>].
                     					Toward this aim, narratives are organized into three categories: Story Garden,
                     					Stay-At-Home Stories (with a pandemic focus), and Root Stories. The Story Garden
                     					Map depicts the geographical distribution of stories, the majority of which are
                     					located in North America. The most recent entry consulted, “Musing from Under a Moss Leaf”, dated June 17, 2021, uses a specimen
                     					plate of the common hair moss (<em class="term">Polytrichum commune</em>) from the Oxford
                     					University Herbarium as a starting point for meditating on the evolutionary and
                     					ecological importance of this diminutive species. As of early 2022, however,
                     					Herbaria 3.0 appears underpopulated — its potential not yet realized — calling
                     					attention to the critical issue of sustaining public participation in DEH

                     					narratives of loss, citizen ecohumanities, and human-plant-environment relations
                     					— illustrate the range of work currently falling within the scope of the digital
                     					environmental humanities. Whereas projects such as Herbaria 3.0 and the Atlas
                     of
                     					Living Australia engage members of the public centrally as knowledge-bearers

                     					offers some recommendations for bolstering DEH’s critical capacity by
                     					democratizing biocultural knowledge via community-responsive, narratively-based,
                     					transdisciplinary strategies. In embracing diverse theories and practices, DEH
                     					brings decolonial, arts-based, and practice-led models into dialogue with
                     					qualitative and quantitative approaches.</div>

                  <div class="ptext" id="p38"> One of DEH’s foremost aims should be to foster inclusive participation in
                     					open-access digital environments. This begins by generally recognizing the value
                     					of citizen ecohumanism and encourages the development of novel approaches to
                     					sustaining long-term community contributions. Possible strategies include
                     					integrating emerging and established social media platforms into projects; using
                     					DEH infrastructure as a basis for designing learning programs tailored to
                     					different educational levels, from undergraduate training to professional
                     					development; and creating on-site and virtual skill development workshops to
                     					facilitate content contributions to particular projects, for instance, through
                     					the writing of Anthropocene narratives, the collecting of biocultural data
                     					through interviews, or the analysis of historical documents using crowdsourced
                     					annotations. Harnessing data through ethnographic techniques, text mining, data
                     					visualization, geographic information systems, and other methods, environmental
                     					humanists — academic specialists and citizen ecohumanists alike — can open up
                     					“new research questions, scales of analysis,
                     					visualizations, audiences, and means of interaction” [<a class="ref" href="#woodruff_library2021">Woodruff Library Humanities Team Exhibit      2021</a>, ¶1].</div>
                  				
                  <div class="counter"><a href="#p39">39</a></div>
                  <div class="ptext" id="p39"> As the field progresses, DEH will need to examine the ethical implications of
                     					converting nature into data. In this context, Sean Cubitt characterizes the
                     					datafication of nature as the “remaking of nature as
                     					data” in which habitats and more-than-human beings are interpreted no
                     					longer as corporeal phenomena but as data representing those phenomena [<a class="ref" href="#cubitt2017">Cubitt 2017</a>, p. 163]. Cubitt observes that, in order to become
                     					data, nature must be reduced to “common arithmetical
                     					form” [<a class="ref" href="#cubitt2017">Cubitt 2017</a>, p. 159]. Indeed, datafication
                     					risks diminishing the material urgencies surrounding the preservation of species
                     					in their habitats. Nonetheless, in relation to DEH, Alenda Chang stresses that
                     					the environmental humanities has the potential to return “the material world to often immaterial theories and histories of
                     					technology” [<a class="ref" href="#chang2021">Chang 2021</a>, pp. 384–85]. The
                     					stronger emphasis on materiality afforded by DEH will enable practitioners to
                     					address issues such as the energy demands of digital activities, the disposal
                     of
                     					electronic waste, and the transformation of embodied beings into datasets [<a class="ref" href="#chang2021">Chang 2021</a>, p. 388].</div>

                  <div class="ptext" id="p40">DEH should also aim to engage diverse communities in various ways. Postcolonial
                     					advances in the digital humanities emphasize the telling of new stories in
                     					decolonized spaces allowing communities to share their own knowledge. For
                     					Roopika Risam (<a href="#risam2019">2019</a>), postcolonial DH entails
                     					“designing new workflows and building new archives,
                     					tools, databases, and other digital objects that actively resist reinscriptions
                     					of colonialism and neocolonialism” (<a href="#risam2019">p.
                        					4</a>). Postcolonial DH, moreover, centralizes “politically, ethically, and social justice-minded approaches to digital
                     					knowledge production” [<a class="ref" href="#risam2019">Risam 2019</a>, p. 4].
                     					Extending postcolonial critique to DEH is crucial, as well, given the
                     					underrepresentation of Indigenous cultures and the Global South in the digital
                     					humanities for example, see [<a class="ref" href="#gomez2019">Gomez 2019</a>] [<a class="ref" href="#noble2019">Noble 2019</a>]. These points become even more critical in light of projects like the Native
                     					American Ethnobotany Database and “The Clock of the Long Now”, disseminating the
                     					traditional knowledge of marginalized communities and incurring physical
                     					alterations to Indigenous peoples’ lands, respectively.</div>
                  				
                  <div class="counter"><a href="#p41">41</a></div>
                  <div class="ptext" id="p41">DEH might also strive to balance critiques of the techno-utopianism dominating
                     					current studies of environmental sustainability with the uptake of emerging
                     					technologies such as virtual and augmented reality, artificial intelligence,
                     					machine learning, and quantum computing. As DEH scholars have observed since
                     					that field’s inception over a decade ago, DH’s long historical perspective on
                     					new technologies is pertinent to EH. By extending humanities approaches to the
                     					ecological and technological issues of the Anthropocene, DEH contributes to
                     					contemporary debates about ecology, media, and technology while advocating for
                     					new ways of thinking about the humanities [<a class="ref" href="#posthumus_etal2018">Posthumus, Sinclair, and Poplawski      2018</a>].
                     					DEH should thus maintain a critical stance on its adoption of interactive
                     					post/digital tools to research and communicate ecological concerns [<a class="ref" href="#posthumus_etal2018">Posthumus, Sinclair, and Poplawski      2018</a>, p. 168].</div>

                  <div class="ptext" id="p42">Informed by the arts, humanities, social sciences, and natural sciences, DEH can
                     					become more inclusive and innovative. In broad agreement with other DEH
                     					theorists, Alenda Chang (<a href="#chang2021">2021</a>) contends that
                     					“an EH perspective could show digital humanists how to
                     					broaden the scope and stakes of their work while mitigating some of the
                     					oversights characteristic of technical solutions, in particular false
                     					abstraction from the physical world and the valorization of speed — whether of
                     					innovation, development, or deployment — over deliberation” (<a href="#chang2021">p. 379</a>). Facilitating collaboration
                     					between academics, activists, artists, writers, community stakeholders, and
                     					knowledge-bearers, DEH offers an adaptable framework supporting more inclusive
                     					scholarship in which disciplinary interactions underlie innovation.</div>
                  				
                  <div class="counter"><a href="#p43">43</a></div>
                  <div class="ptext" id="p43">As an inclusive scholarly-activist framework, DEH calls attention to ecological
                     					concerns at DH events, and, conversely, digital issues at EH events. This could
                     					entail establishing digital environmental humanities working groups or special
                     					interest groups within professional structures, including, for example, the
                     					Alliance of Digital Humanities Organizations (ADHO) and its Constituent
                     					Organizations. Equally, digital working groups within leading environmental
                     					humanities organizations such as the American Society for Environmental History
                     					and the Association for the Study of Literature and Environment would reinforce
                     					digital concerns and awareness throughout different areas of EH. Increasingly
                     					inclusive and activist in emphasis, DEH is well-positioned to continue to
                     					address Anthropocene urgencies while imagining possibilities for human and
                     					more-than-human flourishing.</div>
