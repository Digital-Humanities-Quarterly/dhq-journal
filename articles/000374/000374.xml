                <p>In the last decade tremendous advances have been made in the tools and platforms
                    available for the digital study of manuscripts. Much work, however, remains to
                    be done in order to address the wide range of pedagogical, cataloging,
                    preservation, scholarly (individual and collaborative), and citizen science
                    (crowdsourcing) workflows and use cases in a user-friendly manner. This study
                    (1) summarizes the feedback of dozens of technologists, manuscript experts, and
                    curators obtained through survey data and workshop focus groups; (2) provides a
                        <soCalled>state of the field</soCalled> report which assesses the current
                    tools available and their limitations; and, (3) outlines principles to help
                    guide future development. The authors in particular emphasize the importance of
                    producing tool-independent data, fostering intellectual <soCalled>trading
                        zones</soCalled> between technologists, scholars, librarians, and curators,
                    utilizing a code base with an active community of users, and re-conceptualizing
                    tool-creation as a collaborative form of humanistic intellectual labor.</p>

                <head>I. Introduction</head>
                <p>On 4 November 2016 the Roshan Institute for Persian Studies at the University of
                    Maryland (UMD), College Park hosted the <title rend="quotes">Manuscripts in the
                        Digital Age Workshop,</title> which was co-sponsored by Tufts Universityâ€™s
                    Perseids Project, UMDâ€™s Arts and Humanities Center for Synergy, UMDâ€™s School of
                    Languages, Literatures, and Cultures (SLLC), and Kent State Universityâ€™s School
                    of Library and Information Science. The two-day workshop was born out of a
                    concern that the existing digital infrastructure and tools for manuscript
                    studies are failing to address the wide range of workflows, use cases, and
                    research and pedagogical needs of scholars and curators in the field. Some of
                    these issues arise from technological barriers. For example, many of the best
                    solutions currently available require a level of technical knowledge that the
                    vast majority of scholars and curators do not possess, and some solutions even
                    require developer time to be properly set up (a financial hurdle that further
                    stymies utilization of these tools by many at smaller institutions). Other
                    problems, however, are the result of language-specific issues (e.g., poor
                    display of non-Latin script and right-to-left languages) and persistent gaps in
                    and atomization of functions and workflows. </p>
                <p>The organizers had four primary objectives for the workshop: <list type="ordered">
                        <item>to assess the current state of tools, services and infrastructure for

                            manuscripts, images, and related data objects;</item>
                        <item>to determine the extent to which those tools, services and
                            infrastructure that come closest to meeting the needs of our respective

                                suggests a model for cross-boundary collaboration through the
                                development of new shared cultures and languages. He argues that
                                different subcultures can collaborate and exchange knowledge at the
                                local level, without global agreement, by developing an
                                interlanguage that groups share and use to communicate.</note> to
                            foster dialogue between researchers, technologists, and librarians in
                            the university, gallery, library, archive, and museum (GLAM) contexts

                        This is not a criticism of the pioneering efforts of the developers of the
                        existing tools and platforms. It is the result of the fact that there are an
                        incredible number of diverse use cases, each of which demands different
                        functionality and workflows. Users are also working with a wide variety of
                        different sized collections and linguistic traditions that are not all well
                        supported by current tools and platforms. </p>
                    <p>This has led to a proliferation of tools and platforms that are specific to a
                        particular collection or perform a discrete task (e.g., display, cataloging,
                        transcription) â€” or, in some of the more well-developed tools, a
                            <term>set</term> of discrete tasks â€” for the user. The tools and
                        platformsÂ listed in <ref target="#table01">Table 1</ref> are just some of
                        the more popular tools and platforms that manuscript scholars report
                        utilizing in their research.</p>

                    <p>All of these platforms and tools have certain virtues and do certain tasks
                        well. Ultimately, however, their content, functionality, and workflows are
                        too often siloed/atomized so that the user must either learn numerous
                        different tools and platforms or have the technological skills necessary to
                        link them together or export and manipulate their data post-analysis. This
                        points to one of the biggest problems for users: none of the current tools
                        or platforms reproduces the scholarly, curatorial, or pedagogical workflow
                        in a single, integrated, digital space. As such, they are not always time
                        saving in the same way that other more widely adopted digital technologies
                        are.</p>

                    <p>Prior to the workshop we distributed a survey to colleagues in the Digital
                        Humanities, Classics, Middle Eastern/Islamic Studies, and library science
                        communities via the popular listservs associated with each.<note> For full
                            list of the survey questions, see Appendix I.</note> Twenty-seven
                        respondents completed the entire survey. Admittedly, this was not a
                        scientific or comprehensive survey, but its results are instructive and were
                        echoed by many of the participants in the workshop itself. Before delving
                        into the specific requirements of scholars, curators, and technologists,
                        there are a couple general insights that emerged from this survey. </p>
                    <p>First, the sizes of the manuscript collections with which users are working
                        vary widely. As can be seen in <ref target="#figure01">Figure 1</ref>, the
                        respondents to our survey are relatively evenly divided into the categories
                        of small (&lt; 100 mss), medium (100-999 mss), and large-scale (&gt; 1,000
                        mss) users. The diversity in collection size is not surprising given the
                        range of users â€” from scholars interested in studying a dozen manuscripts of
                        one work to librarians and curators at large institutions with thousands of
                        digital manuscripts â€” however, it should serve as a cautionary note for
                        those looking to develop a universal, end-to-end solution for the diverse
                        forms of manuscript study, display, and curation, which each have their own
                        use cases and requisite workflows.</p>
                    <figure xml:id="figure01">
                        <head>Response to survey question #9 regarding the approximate size of the
                            manuscript collections with which the respondent works.</head>
                        <graphic url="resources/images/figure01.png"/>
                    </figure>
                    <p>Secondly, users do not feel they personally have the technical expertise or
                        access to technical staff required for installing and running tools or
                        platforms. Almost 83 percent of survey respondents indicated that they
                        prefer an online, fully hosted site that does not require them to seek
                        assistance from technical staff at their universities in order to install
                        and run. This is an important consideration for future development efforts,
                        especially those aiming to cultivate a large and active community of
                        users.</p>
                    <p>Beyond these general observations, there was a wide array of other specific
                        insights that emerged from both the survey responses and the workshop. Below
                        is a synthesis of the answers provided by both survey participants and
                        workshop attendees (we have elected not to publish the survey responses
                        verbatim due to privacy concerns). Our division of these responses into
                        requirements of scholars, curators/librarians, and technologists is purely
                        heuristic. </p>

                    <p>Much hard work has been devoted over the past decade to building digital
                        infrastructure and tools for manuscript display and study. The tools and
                        platforms we reviewed represent some of the best of the field currently.
                        There are, however, user requirements that are still not being met. </p>
                    <p>We recognized from the outset that each of the tools selected for review in
                        the workshop was designed with its own use case in mind, and coding for
                        general purpose and reuse very likely was not explicitly in scope for many,
                        or even any, of them. The goals and guidelines we used for the evaluations
                        (presented in full in Appendix II) were developed with the aim of helping us
                        surface some key characteristics that would help us better understand the
                        potential of each tool as a starting point for further work. In particular,
                        we tried to answer these questions for each tool:</p>

                    <p>Our review in the workshop â€” reproduced in summary form below â€” was not
                        comprehensive; it focused on the principal uses and characteristics of each
                        tool, to the extent we were able to discern them in the very limited time we
                        had available to us. In preparation for the workshop we had each tool
                        pre-installed in a virtual environment that workshop participants then used
                        collectively to evaluate the tools. It is important to note that preparing a
                        fully optimized configuration of each tool was not possible, so while our
                        results are certainly of value in identifying some important features and
                        gaps and in prioritizing what should happen next, they should only be
                        considered as a jumping off point and not taken as fully informed analyses
                        or judgments of any of these tools and platforms. While some tools we
                        analyzed have a well-documented code base, in this study we did not do a
                        thorough inspection of the code and documentation of each platform. Future
                        studies will need to investigate these platforms in this regard, considering
                        specific workflows and use cases to evaluate the extensibility of each
                        platform and to discuss development strategies and necessary next steps.</p>
                    <p><title rend="italic">Scriptorium</title> was designed specifically for the
                        task of annotation and transcription of manuscript images. Preservation and
                        curation are not among its intended use cases. It supports import of images
                        via externally referenced IIIF manifests <ptr target="#IIIF2017"/>. It uses
                        custom metadata fields to describe manuscripts, and its metadata is limited
                        to the text â€” i.e., physical manuscript details, such as bindings, are not
                        included. Curation of metadata is not supported. The user interface was
                        designed specifically for scholarly and pedagogical workflows. Collaborative
                        features are in place, although not fully fleshed out. The code relies on
                        the Meteor javascript framework <ptr target="#meteor2017"/> and was not
                        developed with the intent of being reused for other purposes. Both of these
                        factors have implications for the long-term sustainability of the codebase.
                        Of all the tools we surveyed, Scriptoriumâ€™s user interface had the most
                        appeal to the scholars in the group. The user interface design is a
                        candidate for reuse, even if the underlying code itself might not be.</p>
                    <p><title rend="italic">Omeka</title> was the most mature and well supported of
                        the platforms we looked at, with a large community of open source developers
                        contributing plugins and enhancements to the code base. It was also the most
                        general purpose. It is primarily intended for display and publication of
                        modest collections of digital materials. Support for real-time collaboration
                        or pedagogical workflows is not inherent in the platform, although there may
                        be plugins to provide some of this functionality. Omeka does offer excellent
                        support for metadata standards, providing built-in templates using Dublin
                        Core but allowing for easy extension with other controlled vocabularies. It
                        also has good data management support, offering the ability to supply your
                        own persistent identifiers (of any format, including Handles, URNs, DOIs,
                        etc.) for collection items, not restricting you to database specific node
                        identifiers. An existing IIIF plugin is not well integrated, but a current
                        effort to develop new support for IIIF, led by University of Toronto <ptr
                            target="#uot2017"/> is focused specifically on working with manuscripts.
                        The Toronto work supports import of images via IIIF Manifest URLs and treats
                        IIIF annotations on those images as items in an Omeka collection. There is
                        not currently native support for working extensively with manuscript text,
                        outside of annotations on images, and this would need to be added for many
                        use cases. The use of PHP and Javascript as the primary programming
                        languages, and the level of documentation and support available for
                        developers makes it a strong candidate for extension and reuse. It should be
                        noted, though, that Omeka is not intended for long term preservation of
                        data. Omeka is also available as a hosted online platform through a
                        subscription model at <ref target="omeka.net">omeka.net</ref>. Opportunities
                        for project-specific customizations are limited in the hosted version,
                        though, and depend upon the plan chosen.</p>

                        to the Drupal Content Management System <ptr target="#drupal2017"/> which
                        aims to provide a research environment for art historians. It adds tools to
                        Drupal for creating bibliographies, grouping and comparing images, and for
                        creating transcriptions, essays and annotations. It has some support for
                        collaboration, based upon Drupalâ€™s role-based permissions, but no
                        pedagogical workflows. Standards supported include Dublin Core for
                        taxonomies, but IIIF was not supported. Digital publication is explicitly
                        excluded from the scope of the application, although it does support export
                        of data in JSON, XML or CSV, which could then be used to create a static
                        website from the data via the Getty Publicationâ€™s static web resource
                        generator. By leveraging the underlying flexibility and configurability of
                        Drupal, together with the Getty tools, it is possible to create a fairly
                        sophisticated digital publication adhering to good data citation practices
                        (such as assigning external Persistent Identifiers to the data items and
                        providing citation guidance to users), but the toolset itself does not
                        provide any guidance on how to do this. In our exploration, for example, we
                        could not easily determine exactly how the collection of tools was
                        configured and used to produce the demonstration site, <title rend="quotes"
                            >Pietro Melliniâ€™s Inventory in Verse, 1681.</title>
                        <ptr target="#gri2016"/> PHP programming skills would be needed to customize
                        the toolset for specific use cases. There is good user documentation
                        provided on the installation and use of the workspaceâ€™s features, and a
                        Docker image to get up and running easily, so it does have some potential
                        for reuse. We could envision, for example, building themes which provide
                        preset defaults for data management, organization and eventual publication.
                        There are already other existing plugins that provide IIIF support to
                        Drupal, so these could potentially be added to a Getty workspace
                        installation to round out the image support. The primary advantage over
                        Omeka might be that Drupal, serving such a wide multidisciplinary user base,
                        has a large number of plugins available, ranging from the very general to
                        the very specific, but this could also be a drawback for less technical
                        users because taking advantage of them can require significant programming
                        expertise. Resources such as <title rend="italic">Drupal for
                            Humanists</title>
                        <ptr target="#drupal2017"/> could prove useful here.</p>
                    <p><title rend="italic">vHMML</title> is a virtual reading room and cataloging
                        environment designed specifically for the Hill Museum and Manuscript
                        Library, with modules for display of reference material, images and other
                        digital resources. It supports a cataloging workflow and metadata standard
                        that is specific to its core use case. It supports IIIF for image viewing
                        and annotation, via the Mirador viewer and the OpenSeaDragon library. The
                        core application itself is written in Java and deployed on Tomcat with a
                        MySQL database, and uses Elastic Search for indexed searching. It uses
                        w3id.org to provide stable links to the resources published on it. It does
                        not include support for collaborative scholarly or pedagogical workflows.
                        The code, while available in an open source GitHub repository, is not
                        currently intended to be collaboratively maintained or developed. It is,
                        however, available for forking and repurposing, and the technologies used
                        are fairly standard. One important thing to evaluate when looking at the
                        code with an eye towards reuse would be the extent to which the
                        vHMML-specific workflows, data formats, and use cases are tightly coupled to
                        the design of the code. If they are baked into the design, it would likely
                        not be worth the effort to try to reuse, but if done generally it might be
                        possible.</p>
                    <p><title rend="italic">Collective Access</title> is a web-based suite of
                        applications that provides a framework for management, description, and
                        discovery of complex physical and digital collections. It is designed as a
                        collection management system with a front end that can be used for public
                        exhibitions. Archives and museums are the intended users of the system,
                        especially ones who need to support both physical and digital collections.
                        Creating and publishing collection catalogs and exhibitions are its core use
                        cases. It is clear that archivists and librarians are the primary intended
                        consumers of the tool and it is not designed for the casual user who does
                        not have an understanding of metadata and cataloguing activities. It does
                        support a wide variety of metadata standards preconfigured in the
                        installation, such as Dublin Core, EAD (Encoding Archival Description), VRA
                        Core (Visual Resources Association metadata standard), and CDWA-Lite
                        (Categories for the Description of Works of Art). The metadata scheme is
                        also easily extendable through the user interface (UI). The system provides
                        control over the exposure of different metadata elements to the end user. A
                        series of controlled vocabularies such as LCSH (Library of Congress Subject
                        Headings) and Getty vocabularies are already integrated into the system. It
                        provides a full tracking system for collections such as insurance valuation,
                        location tracking, and provenance. Extensive logs for changes to each
                        object/collection are also accessible through UI. Collective Access comes
                        with a series of built-in workflows for batch import, export, and editing.
                        There is no support for real-time collaboration or pedagogical workflows in
                        the platform; however, there may be plugins to provide some of this
                        functionality. The platform also provides granular levels of search such as
                        objects, collections, events, and exhibitions. Collective access can use
                        different viewers for access to media. Its default media viewer can allow
                        access to still images, audio, video, and multi-page documents in PDF
                        format. It has a built-in annotation tool for single images and audio/video
                        but not for multipage documents. At the time of our workshop, the
                        development team was in the process of modularizing the viewer and adding
                        support for IIIF image server and multi-page document viewers such as
                        Mirador and Universal Viewer <ptr target="#digirati2017"/>. The code is
                        written in PHP and there is both user and developer documentation available
                        on the project wiki, as well as consulting services offered by the
                        Collective Access development team. The use of PHP as the primary
                        programming language, and the level of documentation and support available
                        for developers make it a strong candidate for extension and reuse.
                        Collective Access is also available as a hosted online platform through a
                        subscription model at <ref target="collectiveaccess.org"
                            >collectiveaccess.org</ref>. Along with Omeka, these are the only
                        options of the tools we looked at which are publicly offered via this model.
                        The heavy focus on the physical collection and cataloguing use case, and the
                        complexity of the interface, led us to the initial conclusion that it was
                        not a likely candidate for reuse for the manuscripts-centered use cases. It
                        can, however, be used by archivists interested in managing their physical
                        and digital collections through a single platform.</p>
                    <p><title rend="italic">Mirador</title> is a client-side javascript image viewer
                        designed around and for the IIIF standard. It can run as an embedded library
                        in an HTML page, and is designed to be integrated into larger applications.
                        It was used in a number of the platforms discussed above. There is technical
                        documentation available, but using and deploying it does require minimal
                        competence with Javascript and HTML. It is an obvious candidate for reuse.
                        When combined with an IIIF image server and an annotation server it could
                        provide a complete environment for image display and annotation, but it does
                        not aim to cover any other use cases (e.g. such as transcription or
                        cataloging). <ref target="#table02">Tables 2-3</ref> provide a summary of

                <head>III. Observations and Recommendations for the Field</head>
                <p>The technology and standards needed to support digital manuscript studies and
                    publication are in place. While we may still be lacking some standardization
                    around highly specific metadata, standards such as IIIF for images, TEI (Text
                    Encoding Initiative) for text, Dublin Core for metadata, and the newly approved
                    W3C Web Annotation Data Model <ptr target="#w3c2017"/> cover a large majority of
                    needs. While freely available tools and services for open source development,
                    such as GitHub and various cloud infrastructures, have removed some
                    infrastructure barriers and reduced the overhead required for development and
                    deployment, the depth and diversity of scholarly and pedagogical workflows, the
                    fast pace of technological change, and the shortage of software development
                    expertise are challenges that still need to be overcome. A one-size-fits-all
                    solution for digital manuscript studies remains difficult to envision, but
                    modular infrastructures which allow for tools to be combined in different ways
                    are possible and show a great deal of potential.</p>
                <p> The following are our concluding insights and recommendations for future
                    development efforts.</p>

                                        work. Therefore, some tools may use a shared base platform
                                        (e.g., Omeka or Drupal) and add different workflows as
                                        modules or plugins for the base platform. This approach
                                        makes it easier to reuse and repurpose existing

                                        example, it became clear that there are a number of types of

                                        existing solutions and have not even been thought about
                                        before. Developers of such platforms will benefit from such

                                        of needs and workflows, it might be tempting to think about
                                        building a platform from scratch. We believe it is better to
                                        resist such temptations. There are many platforms (e.g.,
                                        Omeka and Drupal) which can serve as the base infrastructure
                                        for development of tools. Designers and developers can use
                                        those platforms and add modules and plugins to extend their
                                        functionalities to serve particular workflows and use
                                        cases.</item>

                    <p>These insights and recommendations emerged from a collective effort of
                        scholars, curators, and technologists to survey the state of digital tools
                        available for manuscript study and curation. Through such <quote
                            rend="inline" source="#x">trading zones</quote> we can come to a better
                        understanding of the different emerging needs of these communities and
                        increase their awareness about the status of digital infrastructure and the
                        existing and emerging technologies. Such attempts can reduce redundancies
                        and increase technological convergence. We hope these observations and
                        recommendations encourage further collaboration between these communities
                        and foster efforts aimed at co-creating shared extensible
                        infrastructure.</p>

                <p>Our basic goals for the workshop are to evaluate a selection of platforms for use
                    in digital manuscript studies. The use cases are diverse and the platforms weâ€™ve
                    selected to review each have different objectives and core constituencies.</p>
