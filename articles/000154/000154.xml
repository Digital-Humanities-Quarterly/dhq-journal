        <body>
            <p>The Digital Humanities depends in large part upon the literary. English departments,
                the institutional homes of literary studies, have been fundamental to the
                development of much of the content that constitutes the emerging canon of digital
                humanities research. Path-blazing projects combining humanities scholarship with
                digital computing have often centered upon literary subjects (such as The Victorian
                Web, The Whitman Archive, The Nines Project, and more); this short list suggests
                that literature and literary figures are often the subject of important initiatives
                in digital humanities archiving, such as these recent ventures in born-digital
                literature in the United States: The Deena Larsen Collection at Maryland Institute
                for Technology in the Humanities, The Michael Joyce archive at The Harry Ransom
                Center at the University of Texas at Austin, and the Stephanie Strickland Papers at
                Duke University. In an essay titled <title rend="quotes">What is Digital Humanities
                    and What’s It Doing in English Departments?</title> republished in the recent
                collection <title rend="italic">Debates in the Digital Humanities</title>, Matthew
                Kirschenbaum posits two reasons why the DH has been centered in English departments
                and focused on the literary: <quote rend="inline" source="#kirschenbaum2011">First,
                    after numerical input, text is the most traceable type of data for computers to
                    manipulate,</quote> and, second, <cit>
                    <quote rend="inline" source="#kirschenbaum2011">there is the long association
                        between computers and composition</quote>
                    <ptr target="#kirschenbaum2011" loc="8, 9"/>
                </cit>. No wonder, then, that data analysis in the form of Humanities Computing has
                proven to be such a boon, not only to scholars of literature in English, but to
                scholars of literature and letters, writ large.<note>For example, see the Perseus
                    Project at Tufts, the Cervantes Project at Texas A&amp;M, as well as a variety
                    of corpus linguistics projects for a sampling of projects that use computational
                    analysis to shed light on textual data.</note> But in the years since the
                emergence of the Digital Humanities from Humanities Computing, both computing and
                literary studies have changed in significant ways.<note>For more on this particular
                    angle to the history of the digital humanities, see Kirschenbaum in <title
                        rend="italic">Debates in the Digital Humanities</title> and, in the same

                </note> Digital data and databases have become indisputable resources for literary
                study, not just for archival research but also literary interpretation, and the
                amount of data available in text form — think Google Books, Project Gutenberg, and
                UPenn’s Online Books Page — continues to grow at an astonishing rate. Big data is
                big news, and visualizations have attracted the attention of those usually focused
                on text.<note> There are many examples of this trend, but consider this recent,
                    exemplary one: Andrew Goldstone and Ted Underwood’s visualizations of <title
                        rend="italic">PMLA</title> content in a blog post titled <title
                        rend="quotes">What can topic models of PMLA teach us about the history of
                        literary scholarship?</title>
                </note> This situation begs the questions: What constitutes literary data, and what
                is the role of the literary in the digital humanities? These questions inspire this
                special issue of the DHQ.</p>
            <p>We employ <q>the literary</q> in this issue to describe content but also approaches,
                methods, and perspectives for examining the formal aesthetics and reflexive
                practices of engaging with literature and literary criticism. But <q>the
                    literary</q> is not limited to literature, to canonical texts, or even, for that
                matter, to texts and words. Rather, our focus on the literary assumes the
                inseparability of praxis and theory, art and criticism, and, of course, the
                operative binary in current DH debates — making and interpreting — across
                linguistic, visual, and data-driven platforms. This special issue seeks to show how
                the digital humanities can and should be understood as including and supporting
                literary interpretation. The digital humanities is not just a means of acquiring and
                accessing data about literary genres, literary history, and the reading and writing
                practices enabled by them. As the essays in this issue demonstrate, the conjunction
                of the literary and the digital humanities produce a rich set of provocations: What
                kind of scholarly endeavors are possible when we think of the digital humanities as
                not just supplying the archives and data-sets for literary interpretation but also
                as promoting literary practices with an emphasis on aesthetics, on intertextuality,
                and writerly processes? What kind of scholarly practices and products might emerge
                from a decisively literary perspective and practice in the digital humanities? The
                essays in this issue engage with these questions and demonstrate ways of answering
                them. Before turning to them, we first want to further contextualize our rationale
                behind this issue. </p>
            <div>
                <head>I.</head>
                <p>In <q>the information age,</q> as our period is known, data is king. Statistics
                    and polling data overwhelm our airwaves and news outlets. <q>Transcendental
                        data</q> is, Alan Liu claims, the central precept and ideology of our
                    digital culture <ptr target="#liu2004"/>. Specifically, Liu argues, digital data
                    is thought to transcend specific material contexts and configurations. According
                    to this logic, data needs no contextual frame to explain or process it; in and
                    of itself, it is and means. In the cultural context of the <quote rend="inline"
                        source="#liu2004">discourse network 2000</quote> (as Liu calls it, updating
                    Friedrich Kittler’s media-based epistemology), one might infer that information,
                    not interpretation, counts. Medium, not meaning, matters. This entire paradigm
                    runs counter to the rationale behind literary studies, a field dedicated to the
                    interpretation and explication of meaning. Literary critics explain and
                    interpret how meaning is made. They analyze texts in ways that illuminate the
                    ideologies texts contain and thereby enable critique of them. Literary critics
                    don’t take data at its word. The tools of literary critical exegesis, such as
                    close reading, can help re-frame the problem of <q>transcendental data.</q> But
                    to what extent might literary studies <emph>itself</emph> be considered a
                    data-driven discipline? Recent innovations in the field of literary studies
                    provide avenues towards answering this question in meaningful ways. In
                    particular, the work of two literary scholars influence the essays contained in
                    this collection.</p>
                <p>Franco Moretti and Jerome McGann present very different interpretative
                    methodologies and are rarely described in the same sentence, but these two
                    scholars thoroughly inform how authors in this issue think through the
                    relationship between the literary and the digital humanities.<note>In
                        particular, see Morretti’s <title rend="italic">Graphs, Maps, and
                            Trees</title> and McGann’s <title rend="italic">The Textual
                            Condition</title>.</note> Moretti pursues a move <q>from texts to
                        models,</q> from close reading individual texts to <q>distant reading</q>
                    data sets of literary information from a given period and location. McGann leads
                    the way towards considering the <q>textual condition</q> of print publication
                    and thus the various data-sets (textual edition, type of paper, geographic
                    location of production, etc.) that constitute the material and bibliographic
                    entity known as <q>a text.</q> We might think of McGann and Moretti as occupying

                    reading: McGann pursues up-close analysis that focuses on the material details
                    and particularities of an individual text while Moretti zooms out to a far
                    distance and maps the dataset comprised of many data-points known as
                        <q>texts.</q> Yet, when we consider these strategies as working in tandem,
                    as the essays in this volume prompt us to do, we see that these two thinkers
                    share a critical strategy or, more appropriately, a critical agenda. They each
                    show how the literary matters in our increasingly data-driven, digital culture
                    by showing how literature possesses and provides data for interpretation.</p>
                <p> Even the most traditional forums for literary scholarly discourse seem to be
                    exploring the relationship between the literary and the digital humanities. The
                    DH has been inescapable as a subject at recent conferences of the Modern
                    Language Association (MLA). The MLA’s central publication, <title rend="italic"
                        >PMLA</title>, presented a special issue, <title rend="quotes">Literary
                        Criticism for the Twenty-First Century,</title> with an introduction by
                    Jonathan Culler that asks a series of poignant questions: <cit>
                        <quote rend="inline" source="#culler2010">Will criticism continue to be
                            primarily interpretive? Are there new models of interpretation? Will
                            literary studies and hence literary criticism need to take new forms?
                            Will the move from a print-based to an electronic-based culture have
                            repercussions for the concept of literature and hence for
                            criticism?</quote>
                        <ptr target="#culler2010" loc="907"/>
                    </cit>. Culler’s questions and the conversation they initiated, were, in part, a
                    continuation from a previous issue of <title rend="italic">PMLA</title> (Oct.
                    2007) that approached these questions through a more specific focus: <q>Database
                        as Genre.</q>
                    <note> The debate was held in <title rend="quotes">The Changing
                            Profession</title> section of <title rend="italic">PMLA</title> (October
                        2007). </note> Central to the debate in this issue, and in the larger
                    discourse about the relationship between the literary and the DH, is the
                    question of what constitutes knowledge production in the DH. It has been argued
                    that the DH is about hands-on production of digital objects (archives, tools,
                    images, etc.). This stance positions the DH in opposition to traditional models
                    of literary scholarship, specifically to the practices of an individual reading,
                    thinking, and writing to produce a textual or discursive product. This
                    definition of the DH also proposes problematic distinctions between
                        <q>making</q> an argument and making a digital object. After all, don’t
                    websites, archives, visualizations, and algorithms also contain arguments? (And,
                    if they don’t, how can DH scholars argue for such work to validate promotion?).
                    The tension between traditional literary practices of interpretation and those
                    of the DH motivates discussion about the present and future shape of the
                        humanities.<note> For recent thoughtful and lucid explorations of these

                    the MLA recently created a new executive position that marks a signal shift in
                    the MLA’s directive to engage with digitality and address the relationship
                    between the literary and the DH. Kathleen Fitzpatrick (former professor of Media
                    Studies and English at Pomona College) is now the MLA’s Director of Scholarly
                    Communication, a position that is decidedly focused on digital forms of
                    communication and/as scholarly <q>products</q> and practices. This is not an
                    isolated decision on the part of upper-management for the governing organization
                    of literary studies. The necessity is evidenced by the fact that in the midst of
                    a financial crisis that resulted in a dearth of new positions in higher
                    education, the 2012 MLA job market list included well over thirty positions for
                    professors with a research specialty in the Digital Humanities (not including
                    fellowships and non-tenured jobs with this emphasis). This robust number
                    reflects the fact that Digital Humanities is one of the few areas within
                    literary studies to see job growth in the midst of an economic downturn. </p>
                <p>Scholars within institutions of higher education are not the only ones
                    considering the relationship between the literary and the digital. Consider, for
                    example, the debut (in June 24, 2011) of the <title rend="italic">New York
                        Times’ Book Review</title> column entitled the <title rend="quotes">The

                    literary critical history, focusing particularly upon the figure of Hugh Kenner,

                    gives the column its name. Stanley Fish has also used his op-ed space in <title
                        rend="italic">The New York Times</title> to chime into the discourse about
                    the recent influx of the digital humanities to literary studies.<note> More

                        <title rend="quotes">Technology</title> section. </note> Writing about the
                    2012 MLA conference, Fish calls the digital humanities <quote rend="inline"

                        everyone’s applecart.</quote> Fish notes that more than 40 sessions at the
                    2012 conference were devoted to the digital humanities, and this fact leads him
                    to claim, <cit>
                        <quote rend="inline" source="#fish2011">The digital humanities is the name
                            of the new dispensation and its prophets tell us that if we put our

                    </cit>. Fish is right to acknowledge the importance of the digital humanities’
                    presence at MLA and in the future of literary studies more generally; but, as
                    our special issue suggests, the digital humanities should not be understood as a
                    new insurgent group retaliating against an older order. Instead, the DH
                    identifies an emergent perspective for seeing how traditional literary
                    scholarship provides the means for asking and pursuing interpretative questions,
                    both about digital culture but also about other, older, and non-digital objects
                    of study. It is not that the digital humanities can save literary studies but
                    that, when viewed through a digital humanities perspective, literary studies
                    does not need saving. </p>

                <p>The impetus behind this special issue is an unabashed attempt to stake a claim
                    for the importance of the humanities in our digital culture and, more
                    specifically, a reminder about the crucial significance of literary studies. We
                    took as our starting point a belief that the digital humanities and literary
                    studies are intersecting and co-dependent. By the time our submission deadline
                    approached, we realized that we were far from alone in this conclusion. We
                    received an outstanding number of high-quality submissions: 45 abstracts
                    submitted by scholars from 12 countries working across diverse disciplines —
                    from English to legal studies, communication to psychology, education to
                    computing, art history to information science. The essays herein explore points
                    of intersection between the literary and the digital humanities from diverse
                    perspectives. Some update close reading; others probe the boundaries of what
                    counts as literary data. They make use of diverse humanities computing tools —
                    mark-up, tagging, data-mining, and other forms of coding — and show how such
                    tools can serve interpretive ends. Through a perspective informed by the
                    digital, these writers analyze individual literary texts as well as the digital
                    tools involved in reading them.</p>

                    one that has assumed multiple variations and has been largely undervalued by
                    literary criticism. Cordell excavates the publication and reprinting history of
                    Hawthorne’s short story <title rend="quotes">The Celestial Railroad,</title> and
                    he uses widely accessible word-tracking technologies and online research tools
                    to do so. He then practices what he calls <q>zoomable reading,</q> tracing the
                    history of the text’s reprinting even as he close reads its content in ways that

                    data-mining can help us draw new conclusions about older literary works. Like
                    Cordell, Ed Finn also pursues a middle ground between distant and close reading
                    as well as between traditional literary criticism and emergent practices made
                    possible by digital technologies. Finn uses online book reviews and
                    recommendations culled from sites such as Amazon and LibraryThing as research
                    data to propose a strategy for examining the larger networks involved in canon
                    formation and the production of literary value. <title rend="quotes">

                    structures the literary archive. Kirschenbaum reminds us that the archive is not
                    just its content but also its metadata. <q>A writer working today will not and
                        cannot be studied in the future in the same way as writers of the past,</q>
                    Kirschenbaum claims, <q>because the basic material evidence of their authorial
                        activity — manuscripts and drafts, working notes, correspondence, journals —
                        is, like all textual production, increasingly migrating to the electronic
                        realm.</q> This simple fact has vast implications for how we understand
                    archiving and access, and Kirschenbaum’s essay suggests that the DH has lead the
                    way in exposing and explaining this new terrain.</p>
                <p>The material fact that digital texts are, at their core, composed of code and
                    executed via sets of instructions processed by the digital machine inspires
                    another point of intersection in this issue: a focus on code. Close reading
                    computer code is a central and concrete way that digital humanities and literary
                    studies intersect. Three essays in this issue illuminate this intersection by
                    engaging and explicating the textual contexts and poetics of programming code.

                    models a method of experimenting with the forms used to encode discourse about
                    the literary. It pushes criticism about the digital and about the digital
                    humanities to move beyond describing the specificities of materiality in order
                    to engage with it in the form and function of a critical essay. In the related

                    and in a very different way. Instead of a commercial game, Marino analyzes the

                    reading the paratextual or marginal comments within the code, as does Sample,
                    Marino argues that the code is itself poetry. Marino makes this argument while
                    pursuing the political critique of his object of study, demonstrating that the
                    study of code is not the study of rarified abstraction but, on the contrary, the
                    consideration of a viable platform for enacting social change.</p>

                            >The End of Literature: Digital Forensics and Amitav Ghosh's The
                            Calcutta Chromosome</ref>
                    </title> Mike Frangos pursues a postcolonial critical approach to considering
                    the relationship between literary criticism and the digital humanities. He reads
                    Amitav Ghosh’s novel <title rend="italic">The Calcutta Chromosome</title> as an
                    entry point for considering critical theories of reading, specifically Moretti’s
                    strategy of distant reading and Kirschenbaum’s notion of digital forensics.
                    Frangos argues that although such strategies might imply the <q>not-reading</q>
                    of literary texts, they actually reinforce formalism — and thus, close reading —
                    in a different capacity. Frangos suggests that not-reading can be understood as
                    a way of figuring political (and postcolonial) relationships and their effect on
                    concepts of <q>the literary,</q>
                    <q>world literature,</q> and the archive in ways that open new avenues for
                    critique. <ref

                        >Jacqueline Wernimont</ref> offers a feminist perspective on the complicated
                    claim that digital humanities tools, and digital archives in particular, enable
                    access in ways that democratize. Taking two central digital archives devoted to
                    women writers as her objects of analysis, <title rend="italic">Orlando</title>
                    and the <title rend="italic">Women Writers Project</title>, Wernimont discusses
                    the ways in which the production, use, and theorization of digital archives is
                    always already social and political. Her essay offers a model for thinking
                    through the relationship between digital technologies and feminist thought as a
                    means of offering an expansion, not a replacement, of social theory and
                    networks. <ref

                        >Robin Wharton</ref> demonstrates the urgency of thinking through the
                    relationship between the literary and digital technology in the legal sphere.
                    Rather than rewrite a history of copyright, her essay examines how judicial
                    assumptions are informed by the literary and how the literary has influenced
                    legal decision-making. She pursues an understanding of the feedback loop of
                    production and reception of legal judgments in ways that also illuminate how
                    academic arguments about the literary affect the larger society. </p>
                <p>Finally, Sandy Baldwin’s meditative and idiosyncratic essay, <title rend="quotes">
                        <ref
                            target="http://www.digitalhumanities.org/dhq/vol/7/1/000155/000155.html"
                            >The Idiocy of the Digital Literary (And What Does It Have to Do with
                            Digital Humanities)?</ref>
                    </title> speaks to the meaningful tension at the center of the conflictual
                    relationship between the digital humanities and traditional hermeneutic
                    practice. For a burgeoning yet fledgling field that depends upon constant
                    redefinition, such reflection is urgent and also complicated. Baldwin tackles
                    this challenge in the form and content of his playful yet serious essay.</p>
                <p>The essays that follow explore the effects of the digital humanities on the
                    literary and, conversely, the influence of literary studies on the digital
                    humanities. They are all exemplary attempts to consider how literary studies
                    matters to digital culture. Collectively, they show how the humanities are,
                    indeed, already digital. Gathering them together in this special issue, we hope
                    to highlight and promote consideration of the scholarly opportunities that
                    emerge at the interstice between the literary and the DH, which is the position
                    of the humanities in an ever-increasing digital age. </p>
