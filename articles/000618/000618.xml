         <dhq:abstract>
            <p>Looking through the intersectional feminist lens, Catherine D’Ignazio and Lauren
               Klein introduce data as a tool of power in the past and present world in their book
                  <title rend="italic">Data Feminism</title> (MIT Press, 2020) and reveal how
               authorities have used data as a weapon to maintain a hierarchy of power in favor of
               their position in the unequal status quo. By calling <term>data</term> a part of the
               problem, they also conceive of it as a part of the solution by analyzing how <q>data
                  justice</q> can and ought to be redeployed to challenge power.</p>

            <p><title rend="italic">Data Feminism</title> brings an intersectional feminist approach
               to any task having to do with data. Collecting, analyzing, creating datasets and
               later algorithms – it rightfully questions them all. The introduction provides
               readers with the logic behind why we need an intersectional feminist approach to data
               science and what the term offered by the authors, <term>data feminism,</term> means.
               Immediately explaining their approach in the Introduction, <title rend="italic">Data
                  Feminism</title>
               <quote rend="inline">“is a book about power in data science. Because feminism,
                  ultimately, is about power too”</quote>
               <ptr target="#dignazio2019"/>. The term <term>feminism</term> in the title is
               demystified upfront as well: the authors believe that <title rend="italic">Data
                  Feminism</title>
               <quote rend="inline">isn’t only about women … it isn’t only for women … it isn’t only
                  about gender either. Feminism is about power – who has it and who doesn’t.</quote>
               <ptr target="#dignazio2019" loc="14"/>. <title rend="italic">Data
               Feminism</title> uses feminism as a tool and critical thinking method to look at
               communities who have long benefited from data and those who were pushed out to
               margins by it.</p>
            <p>The book offers a list of seven comprehensive acts to prompt data activism. To make
               Data Feminism possible, the authors provide seven main principles – examining the
               power, challenging it, elevating emotion and embodiment, rethinking binaries and
               hierarchies, embracing pluralism, considering context, and eventually making labor
               visible – and go through them in each of the seven chapters. <title rend="italic"
                  >Data Feminism</title>, both as a book and now as a hopefully known term, is the
               best example of bridging the theory-work produced in academia with the outside world
               in a real-life setting. It calls for tangible action and not merely reflection from
               our minds and classrooms to policymakers and data policies. The book is neither an
               answer to data injustices nor an explanation of data ethics; it is a step-by-step
               guide to employing the reader’s logic for forming better questions while moving ahead
               for a more just society because <quote rend="inline">None of us are free if some of
                  us are not</quote>
               <ptr target="#forrest2021"/> as the authors put it well. </p>
         </div>
         <div>
            <head>Seven Principles</head>
            <p>The first chapter’s core idea is the exclusion of some communities caused by
                  the <q>privilege hazard</q>, meaning ignorance of being on top. While the chapter
               is grounded around the concept of the <q>matrix of domination</q> originally offered
               by Patricia Collins, with the main aim to identify and <hi rend="bold">examine the
                  power</hi>, it explains how data are extracted by dominant groups of people and
               mostly extracted from others. The authors find it crucial to understand how systems
               of oppression work with data as one main ingredient before taking the next step, <hi
                  rend="bold">challenging the power</hi>. </p>
            <p>In the second chapter, the language employed to address the questions of ethics and
               values when discussing data and supporting algorithms is analyzed to reform those
               discussions. <q>Imagined objectivity</q> and concepts that uphold it are compared and
               contradicted with <q>real objectivity</q> and intersectional feminist concepts that
               strengthen it. The authors argue that the first <quote rend="inline">locates the
                  source of the problem in individuals or technical systems</quote> while the
                  latter <quote rend="inline">acknowledges structural power differentials and works
                  toward dismantling them</quote> <ptr target="#dignazio2020" loc="60"/>. For both,
               a terms table that distinguishes the two objectivities: <term>ethics</term> vs.
                  <term>justice</term>, <term>bias</term> vs. <term>oppression</term>,
                  <term>fairness</term> vs. <term>equity</term>, <term>accountability</term> vs.
                  <term>co-liberation</term>, and <term>transparency</term> vs.
                  <term>reflexivity</term> is offered to equip their readers with better terms.</p>
            <p>The third chapter, a favorite, challenges the possibility of pure objectivity and
               neutrality of data visualization in order to <hi rend="bold">elevate emotion and
                  embodiment</hi>. It attempts to remind readers of the partiality of knowledge,
               drawing from Sandra Harding and Donna Haraway’s <quote rend="inline">god
                  trick</quote><ptr target="#haraway1988"/>. It argues that demonstrating
               uncertainty in data visualizations is feasible but still hard for people to
               understand. Therefore, regardless of how hard data graphics try to stay neutral and
               rational, individuals recognize them differently. One excellent and straightforward
               example is shown in weather forecasts and how the phrase <said>There is a 30% chance
                  of rain tomorrow</said> can be interpreted in various ways by the public to mean
                  <said>It will rain 30% of the time</said> or <said>It will rain in 30% of my
                  area</said>
               <ptr target="#dignazio2020" loc="267"/>. On the other hand, it is discussed that
               devaluing emotion and affect and centering rationality as the authoritative mode of
               communication in reading data visualization might tell us about <quote rend="inline"
                  >who and what the system is trying to exclude</quote> <ptr target="#dignazio2020"
                  loc="95"/>. By assuming that rationality is assigned to male bodies and emotion to
               female bodies, the chapter criticizes the gendered binary of normative / derivative
               assigned to male bodies / female bodies.</p>
            <p>As the fourth chapter quotes from Joni Seager, <quote rend="inline">What gets counted
                  counts,</quote> and it stands for <hi rend="bold">rethinking binaries and
                  hierarchies</hi>. Classification of knowledge and constructed social categories
               used in science are introduced as other tools of power in data science. The Seager
               principle explains how binaries and constructed categories are the product of
               cultural and historical sets of values and biases of societies, and are therefore not
               only unreliable but also different from one society or community to another. Such
               binaries and classification systems are not extensible and need to be questioned and
               reconsidered. The peril lies where binaries are translated to codes and then encoded
               to technical systems. Such technical systems use data and datasets gathered and
               processed in the mentioned categories as input, process them into deliverable social
               policies or decisions, and perform them on human bodies and individuals. The authors
               invite readers to think of categories that, if left unquestioned, might be reductive,
               incomplete, or exclusive, and so too the policies and their deliverables.</p>
            <p>Seeking multiple perspectives, the fifth principle and chapter, <hi rend="bold"
                  >embracing pluralism</hi>, takes up the fourth chapter’s argument with the same
               concern of the possible exclusion of local, Indigenous, or experiential ways of
               knowing. Through stories of projects such as the Anti-Eviction Mapping Project and
               the EJ Atlas, the chapter shows how not leaving the data work entirely to the ones
               who are aliens to the subject of a project – assuming that their neutrality in
               relation to the subject of the project is the only necessity – can be beneficial.
               Employing the communities, including marginalized ways of thoughts, and making the
               process more pluralistic by <quote rend="inline">synthesizing multiple
                  perspectives</quote> <ptr target="#dignazio2020" loc="125"/> can direct data
               projects toward more co-liberated models of data. Intending to make data models
               that promote <term>co-liberation</term> rather than <term>accountability</term>
               (terms that were counterposed with each other and discussed in the second chapter) is
               another way of feminist-thinking-through-data-work that makes Data Feminism
               possible. </p>
            <p>The sixth chapter discusses one of the most critical and challenging principles: <hi
                  rend="bold">considering context</hi>. The authors discuss how numbers, or raw
               data, are alone not enough to show results in works of research that have to deal
               with humans. They offer that <quote rend="inline">raw data</quote> are, in fact,
               already <quote rend="inline">cooked</quote> in previous systems of bias or exclusion
               before becoming a number or data because they are obtained from people, regardless of
               the context in which the datasets were produced. Considering, acknowledging, and
               naming the systems of oppression at work is essential when talking about numbers,
                  as <quote rend="inline">they do not speak for themselves</quote>
               <ptr target="#dignazio2020" loc="159"/>. The authors show through various examples
               how a simple bar label and caption can point out context and make a difference in how
               it will be comprehended. Although tricky, a feminist approach can be taken to
               interpret or, in other words, speak for the numbers in different projects. <quote
                  rend="inline">Letting the numbers speak for themselves</quote> is viewed as
               unethical and undemocratic, with the potential to do more harm than good by
               reinforcing the unjust status quo <ptr target="#dignazio2020" loc="159"/>. </p>
            <p>Reminiscently, if nothing else, Data Feminism is a valuable project that by itself
               starts practicing the seventh principle of <hi rend="bold">making the labor
                  visible</hi>. If read between the lines, the authors leave to the audience two
               valuable lists as proof: first, a list of activists and scholars who are members of
               previously colonized nations, LGBTQIA+ and Indigenous communities and people of
               color, and second, a list of corporations and projects led by people of color. <quote
                  rend="inline">Nearly two-thirds of their citations are from women or non-binary
                  people; almost every chapter has a project from the Global South; a third of all
                  citations are from people of color, and nearly half of all projects mentioned in
                  the book are led by people of color</quote>

            <p>There is no doubt that the consistency of their chain of thoughts and the logic that
               accompanies it are best presented in the threads of real-world well-researched
               stories. D’Ignazio and Klein master the art of storytelling in their scholarship by
               sublimely taking the readers’ hands and walking them through one question to another.
               Each question begins with a story and slowly leads the readers to the following
               question, then the story leaves the readers for another story. Questions and stories,
               with a touch of the desire to discover a part of the truth behind data industry and
               its history, take the reader line by line and chapter by chapter with an excellent
               suspension element to find the complete picture of the main idea. D’Ignazio and Klein
               are not the first people who point out intersectionality, data ethics, or the history
               of colonialism, sexism, or racism, but they are some of the very few who treat them
               all as simple layers patiently and gradually added to a body of knowledge, forming an
               understandable array of new settings and concepts. As examples they define the
                  <q>matrix of domination</q> in the first chapter and <q>auditing the
                  algorithms</q> in the second chapter.</p>
            <p>Among the readers’ comments and reviews online from across the world, there is one
               question everybody asks, and many try to answer: who is this book <emph>for</emph>? A
               variety of answers have been given: teachers, sociology classes, or feminists in the
               digital age who work with data <ptr target="#garbee2020"/>. I firmly believe that
               this book is for <emph>everyone</emph>, and maybe that is why it offers such a
               consistent, easy-to-read, and easy-to-follow language. For scholars, teachers, or
               students in the humanities or social sciences, its main ideas raised on the
               intersectionality of race and sex might not be new. However, actively engaging with
               the book and considering teaching it in undergraduate or master’s courses is
               suggested because of its valuable and essential intersection of theory with the most
               powerful asset of today: data.</p>
            <p>For data scientists, engineers, managers, or anyone <emph>in</emph> the tech world or
               directly working with data, <title rend="italic">Data Feminism</title> is an
               essential read. Not requiring the ability to read wordy, slowly-nuanced essays
               typical to the humanities, this book will neither disappoint experts in corporations
               nor confuse them. The book is full of straightforward anecdotes about tech companies
               and projects, both governmental and voluntary, big and small, that are good or bad
               examples of practicing what the authors call <term>data justice</term>. Important
               thematic and primary questions are raised by the authors and formerly by
               intersectional feminists such as Kimberlé Crenshaw, Donna Haraway, and others. Indeed
               this book will make readers ask the basic <emph>wh-</emph> questions, <quote
                  rend="inline">data science for whom?, data science by whom?,</quote> and <quote
                  rend="inline">data science with whose interests and goals?</quote> <ptr
                  target="#dignazio2020" loc="26, 33, 39"/>.  </p>
            <p>For the ones who neither work with data nor the humanities, it is still worth the
               read because of the very simple fact that data surrounds everybody, or it will sooner
               or later in life no matter where people live – if it hypothetically has not yet. It
               gives readers invaluable insight into the social and data structure of the present
               world: how an individual is, or sometimes is not, being counted, what individuals
               count and sometimes do not, how an individual is being [mis]presented, and how the
               world around is being modeled, displayed and shown to them. It makes the reader think
               twice or more critically about <quote rend="inline">god tricks</quote><ptr
                  target="#haraway1988"/> or the <q>facts</q> one has already accepted as their
                  lifetime <q>assumptions.</q></p>
            <p>Out of the scope of this book, the authors seemingly continue the work while engaging
               other scholars. There is a workspace on Slack with more than 300 members from all
               over the world, on which anyone can share ideas, news, articles, tweets related to
               the data economy <quote rend="inline">to nurture the imagination of what an equitable
                  data economy might look like</quote> <ptr target="#remakeddw2021"/>. The battle to
               unlock the invisible black boxes of data and biases, and fight against their effects
               has begun and it calls for active contributions and a great deal of critical thinking
               for everyone.</p>
