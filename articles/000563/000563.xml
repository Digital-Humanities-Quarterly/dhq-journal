                <p>The World Wide Web has introduced a massive change in the cognitive processes of
                    reading: skimming has become the most popular way in which readers interact with
                    written texts on digital support, with possible enormous consequences on how
                    human beings process information and articulate complex thought <ptr
                        target="#wolf2018"/>. On the other hand, digital environments have an
                    immense, often underdeveloped, potential to improve interactive engagement and
                    exploration of information, integrating very different media and conveying
                    extremely complex and multifaceted messages. Readers of the future should be
                    educated to critically approach a text through digital technologies, making full
                    use of this potential, and going beyond the reading processes conceived for
                    texts encoded on static supports. In this paper, we propose the application of
                    text alignment as one method to empower the reflective engagement with digital
                    texts, specifically in the context of language learning.</p>
                <p>Text alignment, and more specifically translation alignment, is a type of
                        annotation,<note>In digital environments, annotation is the operation of
                        attaching additional information to a resource or a specific part of it: an
                        annotation can be unstructured, such as a comment, or structured, such as a
                        machine-actionable citation identifying a text <ptr target="#romanello2013"
                        />.</note> which consists in analytically matching a word or expression in a
                    text with the corresponding ones in another text, often in a different language,
                    in environments created to collect aligned word pairs. This is an exceptionally
                    complex hermeneutic task, by which readers are induced to problematize the
                    function and implications of morphosyntactic, semantic, and expressive devices
                    of a language, even of their own native tongue.</p>
                <p>This paper collects a set of preliminary observations on groups of students that
                    have used translation alignment in the framework of language courses at various
                    levels of expertise. We propose text alignment as a way to empower the
                    perception of the complexity of a written source, but also as a method to
                    leverage usual obstacles in the process of reading in a different language by
                    directly engaging with original literary texts.</p>

                <head>Principles of Translation Alignment</head>
                <p>Translation alignment is one of the most popular applications of Natural Language
                    Processing. It is defined as the comparison of two or more texts in different
                    languages, also called parallel texts or parallel corpora <ptr target="#kay1993"/>
                    <ptr target="#veronis2000"/>,<note>A text and its translation or translations
                        placed alongside are defined as parallel texts. Large collections of
                        parallel texts are called parallel corpora, such as the European Parliament
                        Proceedings (<ref target="http://www.statmt.org/europarl/"
                            >http://www.statmt.org/europarl/</ref>) or the Bible Corpus <ptr
                            target="#christodouloupoulos2015"/>. Large research infrastructures like
                        CLARIN (<ref
                            target="https://www.clarin.eu/resource-families/parallel-corpora"
                            >https://www.clarin.eu/resource-families/parallel-corpora</ref>) host
                        big collections of parallel corpora in multiple languages as a resource for
                        automatic translation and linguistic research. The use of parallel corpora
                        in translation management systems is increasingly popular: commercial tools
                        like SDL Trados (<ref target="https://www.sdltrados.com/"
                            >https://www.sdltrados.com/</ref>), MemoQ (<ref
                            target="https://www.memoq.com/">https://www.memoq.com/</ref>), or Across
                            (<ref target="https://www.across.net/">https://www.across.net/</ref>)
                        allow professional translators to manually align sentences while performing
                        their work, at the same time keeping consistency in the translation.</note>
                    by means of automated or semi-automated methods. The main purpose is to define
                    which parts in a source text correspond to which parts of a second text in a
                    different language. The result often takes the form of a list of pairs of items,
                    which can be words, sentences, or larger text chunks like paragraphs or
                    documents. This task is often performed automatically through various methods,
                    which often require large amounts of training data: one of the most traditional
                    methods for automated translation alignment is statistical machine translation
                        <ptr target="#brown1990"/>, which uses statistical methods to extract and
                    identify correspondences of words and phrases in two parallel texts, based on
                    already available aligned pairs.</p>
                <p>The alignment of texts in different languages, however, is an exceptionally
                    complex task, because of the several variables involved. It is often difficult
                    to find perfect correspondences across languages that express ideas through
                    different morphosyntactic constructs, with variations in word order, sentence
                    length, and even underlying cultural significance. Machine-actionable systems
                    are often inefficient in providing equivalences for wordplays, metaphors, and
                    other rhetorical devices. The resulting aligned pairs may be one-to-one (one
                    word in the source text corresponds to one word in the translation), but often
                    align as one-to-many, many-to-many, or many-to-one. Each word correspondence may
                    be complete or perfect (with complete overlap between two words), but also
                    possible or incomplete (partial overlap, or both words being a translation of
                    each other only in certain contexts <ptr target="#graca2008"/>).</p>
                <p>For these reasons, manually aligned word pairs are one of the main sources of
                    training data, and are not only employed for the implementation of machine
                    translation systems, but are increasingly useful for many other purposes,
                    including information extraction and automated creation of bilingual lexica <ptr
                        target="#dagan1999"/>
                    <ptr target="#melamed1998"/>. Therefore, large corpora of manually aligned word
                    pairs are a much desired resource, which remains, however, extremely rare.</p>
                <p>The operation of collecting training data is often configured as a Citizen
                    Science effort: for example, Glosbe (<ref target="https://glosbe.com/"
                        >https://glosbe.com/</ref>) provides thousands of dictionaries created from
                    the manual alignment of word pairs performed by a community of users.<note>For
                        current issues in using Glosbe for statistical machine translation, see <ref
                            target="#berti2015">Berti (2015)</ref>.</note> However, because of the
                    hermeneutic complexity implied in the alignment across different languages,
                    translation alignment has also a powerful pedagogical potential. We have
                    implemented a specific web-based environment, called Ugarit, to provide a
                    framework for language learning applications through translation alignment.</p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <head>The Ugarit Translation Alignment Editor</head>
                <p>The first public web-based environment for manual text alignment of parallel
                    corpora was conceived within the Alpheios Project (<ref
                        target="http://alpheios.net/">http://alpheios.net/</ref>), and is currently
                    hosted by the Perseids Project (<ref target="https://www.perseids.org/"
                        >https://www.perseids.org/</ref>). The editor offers an easy environment to
                    manually match corresponding words in two parallel texts.</p>
                <p>The Ugarit Translation Alignment Editor (<ref
                        target="http://ugarit.ialigner.com/">http://ugarit.ialigner.com/</ref>),
                    developed in 2016 by Tariq Yousef at the University of Leipzig, was conceived as
                    the first version of an improved interface that could perform more extensive
                    alignment tasks than the Alpheios editor: it allows alignment in up to three
                    texts, incorporates transliteration of non-Latin alphabets, and collects
                    manually aligned pairs as training datasets <ptr target="#yousef2019"/>
                    <ptr target="#yousef2020"/>. Moreover, it allows almost immediate visible online
                    publication of the material.</p>
                <p>The first version of the tool was made public in March 2017. Since then, Ugarit
                    has registered an ever-increasing number of visits and new users.</p>
                <p>Originally, Ugarit was developed to collect training data for the implementation
                    of statistical machine translation of historical languages, mainly Ancient
                    Greek, Latin, and Persian, for which few to none aligned datasets exist.
                    Ideally, historical languages are closed systems with a finite number of words
                    and very limited change in the foreseeable future. Therefore, it should be
                    possible to create adequately efficient automated methods of statistical machine
                    translation based on a relatively small training dataset.</p>
                <p>However, after the tool was made public, the number and variety of languages
                    included by the users has steadily increased and has gone far beyond the
                    original intent: at the moment this article is being written, 45 languages are
                    included in Ugarit, including Ancient Greek, Latin, Arabic, Persian, English,
                    French, German, Italian, Portuguese, Croatian, Armenian, Japanese, Chinese,
                    Syriac, Sanskrit, Coptic, Egyptian, Akkadian, and Ethiopic; 465 unique users,
                    and about 24,500 parallel texts, are currently hosted.</p>
                <p>The home page of Ugarit offers a quick overview of the languages currently
                    available (the graph showing the proportions of the respective corpora), the
                    number of users and texts, the available word pairs, and the newest
                    alignments.</p>

                <p>The workflow is simple: users can upload their corpus in text format, or import
                    it by calling its CTS URN from the Perseus Digital Library (<ref
                        target="http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/"
                        >http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/</ref>) <ptr target="#babeu2019"/>.
                    Then, the parallel texts can be manually aligned by matching words or groups of
                    words. Resulting pairs are automatically stored in the database, and can then be
                    exported in XML or tabular format.</p>
                <p>Currently, Ugarit works with up to three texts in different languages, and there
                    is virtually no limit to the amount and length of texts that can be uploaded. A
                    clickable option enables the user to decide whether the alignment can be
                    publicly visible on the website or not. When the default value is kept, the text
                    appears in the homepage of the website, and other users can inspect the
                    alignment by hovering with the mouse on individually paired tokens, which are
                    automatically highlighted. The proportion of aligned tokens is indicated in the
                    colored bar below the text: the green indicates the rate of matching words, the
                    red the rate of non-matching words.</p>
                <p>For languages with non-Latin alphabets, Ugarit offers automatic transliteration,
                    which is visible when the pointer hovers on the desired word. This feature is
                    currently available for Greek, Arabic, Persian,<note>Since the short vowels in
                        Arabic and Persian are not written, the model used here needs to be improved
                        to increase the readability of the transliterated text.</note> Armenian, and

                <p>Translation pairs are stored in a local database that gathers data from the
                    manually aligned texts, but also from bilingual dictionaries and automatically
                    aligned texts with GIZA++.<note>GIZA++ (<ref

                            >http://statmt.org/moses/giza/GIZA++.html</ref>) is a popular program,
                        created as an implementation of the famous IBM models 1-5, which provides
                        automatic alignments of words or phrases to implement statistical machine
                        translation.</note> This database would form the bulk of training data to
                    improve automatic translation alignment methods focusing on historical
                    languages.</p>
                <figure xml:id="figure04">

                </figure>
                <p>As such, the database of translation pairs serves two main functions: first, it
                    serves search queries to provide information on all the available translations
                    of a word. Therefore, if the user looks for a word (for instance, <q>life</q>)
                    with the search function available on the home page, the output displays all the
                    available aligned pairs currently hosted in Ugarit. In this way, the user can
                    access an extended number of translations of a word in many different
                    languages.</p>
                <figure xml:id="figure05">
                    <head/>
                    <graphic url="resources/images/figure05.png"/>
                </figure>
                <p>Second, Ugarit provides training data to the Dynamic Lexicon (<ref
                        target="http://dynamiclexicon.com/">http://dynamiclexicon.com/</ref>), which
                    applies the principle of triangulation to extract bilingual pairs across Ancient
                    Greek, Persian, and Latin, using bridge pairs in Greek/English, Persian/English,
                    and Latin/English: the Dynamic Lexicon fetches alignment information from all
                    available aligned corpora, and it uses aligned languages as pivot to fetch
                    translated words in other languages that may bear the same meaning <ptr
                        target="#berti2015"/>. So, each aligned pair functions as a translation
                    vector to access more matches in other languages that are not directly aligned.
                    This method is based on the assumption that two words in two given languages are
                    more likely to match if they are translations of the same word in a third
                    language <ptr target="#kumar2007"/>. The accuracy of the triangulation can be
                    improved by expanding the available corpus of translation pairs, considering
                    available part-of-speech classification, or adding more pivot languages <ptr
                        target="#yousef2015"/>.</p>

                </figure>
                <p>In other words, Ugarit was designed as a Citizen Science resource to collect
                    training datasets on historical languages from a variety of sources and
                    projects. One of the most important initiatives in this regard was the Hafez
                    Project (<ref target="http://dynamiclexicon.com/hafez/"
                        >http://dynamiclexicon.com/hafez/</ref>; <ref
                        target="http://www.divan-hafez.com">http://www.divan-hafez.com</ref>) led by
                    Maryam Foradi at the University of Leipzig <ptr target="#foradi2017"/>, which
                    tested how German and Persian speakers aligned textual portions of Hafez using
                    English as a bridge language. The results indicated that, provided with the
                    appropriate scaffolding by using English as a bridge language, users with no
                    knowledge of the source language could generate word alignments with the same
                    output accuracy generated by expert users in both languages of source and target
                    texts. The study showed that, while the long-term pedagogical effectiveness of
                    this method is comparable with learning vocabulary with flashcards, the
                    vocabularies learned both intentionally with flashcards and incidentally through
                    text alignment had a significantly better retention <ptr target="#foradi2019"
                    />.</p>
                <p>These results suggested that alignment could serve as a pedagogical tool with a
                    certain effect of long-term retention of vocabulary. Between 2017 and 2019, we
                    conducted a pilot study investigating how students of historical languages could
                    use translation alignment to improve their learning experience through direct
                    engagement with original texts. The lack of scholarship on the pedagogical
                    application of alignment as a tool for language learning, and the complexity
                    involved in the reproducibility of the experience, compel us to start with
                    pre-experimental observations from specific cases, where translation alignment
                    has been applied as a standard method during language courses. Our initial
                    observations provide the justification for a more experimental design.</p>

                <p>Ugarit was used in graduate and undergraduate semester-long Classics courses at
                    the Universities of Tufts and Furman, with different focuses: language (mainly
                    Ancient Greek and Latin) at elementary, intermediate, and upper level,
                    literature in translation, literature surveys, and individual research
                        projects.<note>See, for instance, <ref target="#example1">Example 1 of Case
                            1</ref>, where alignment was part of a complete digital project.</note>
                    The use of translation alignment was incorporated in the teaching practice as a
                    structural element: <list type="unordered">
                        <item>The students made continuous use of Ugarit in class, using and
                            creating aligned translations as a reading support.</item>
                        <item>The task of aligning more lengthy chosen texts against one or two
                            translations constituted the main type of assignment, in the form of
                            individual research projects at various degrees of complexity: depending
                            on the course and level, the students produced bilingual and trilingual
                            alignments, whose accuracy was graded accordingly.</item>
                        <item>The results were discussed in the form of research papers and
                            presentations, in class and also in public venues.<note>In 2018, Furman
                                students presented their projects at two undergraduate conferences,
                                at UNC Greensboro and University of South Carolina
                                respectively.</note></item>
                    </list> The students reported their observations on the process, evaluated how
                    it affected their understanding of the source, and performed a qualitative
                    analysis on the languages in question, examining specific morphosyntactic,
                    semantic, and expressive phenomena.</p>
                <p>We observed the application of this workflow on students with very diverse
                    language skills, including those who mastered other modern languages, and those
                    whose native language was not English. We propose three cases of study: <list
                        type="ordered">
                        <item>Students who were proficient in the source language and had complete
                            mastery of one other language (including the native tongue).</item>
                        <item>Students who were proficient in two different languages, and had basic
                            knowledge of a third one.</item>
                        <item>Students who were proficient in one or more languages, but had no
                            prior knowledge of the source language.</item>
                    </list> In the following paragraphs, we report the considerations formulated by
                    the students themselves, and our observations on the outcomes of the
                    process.</p>

                    <head>Case 1: Students of the source language</head>
                    <p>Students of Case 1 were enrolled in intermediate and upper level courses in
                        historical languages, mainly Ancient Greek or Latin. They performed two
                        tasks: <list type="ordered">
                            <item>Pairwise alignment between the source text and one chosen
                                translation in a modern language.</item>
                            <item>Alignment of the source text against two different
                                translations.</item>
                        </list> The purpose of the first exercise was to set the groundwork for a
                        structural analysis of the most important morphosyntactic and semantic
                        devices of the source language, comparing how those features were rendered
                        in a different language (often English), of which the students had complete
                        mastery. In the second exercise, they built upon this experience to draw an
                        evaluation of two competing translations, focusing on the different ways in
                        which complex linguistic phenomena can be rendered in another language.</p>

                            performed a three-text alignment of a passage from the <title

                            original and two chosen English translations (A.S. Kline, 2016 and R.
                            Graves, 1950), to discover differences in translation strategies in a
                            very complex and rhetorically skilful literary work. The focus of the
                            observation was the semantics of different words and expressions with
                            potential ambiguity, but also the different ways the translators
                            addressed the challenges of rendering Latin syntactical structures in a
                            completely different linguistic system. The student then created a new
                            English translation, discussing where it distanced itself from the
                            original and which aspects were instead retained. The comparison between
                            two very different authorial translations proved useful to understand
                            different strategies of addressing relevant linguistic and semantic
                            problems, but also to help the student to find their own <q>translator’s

                            translations, in prose and poetry respectively (A.T. Murray, 1919 and S.
                            Lombardo, 2000). The student used the correspondences in meaning and
                            words across the two English renderings to individuate possible matching
                            words in the Greek, specifically focusing on the potentially discrepant
                            translation strategies between prose and verse. Overall, the prose
                            translation revealed a slightly better alignment rate, but typical Greek
                            stopwords, such as <foreign xml:lang="grc">δέ</foreign> or <foreign
                                xml:lang="grc">τε</foreign>, were consistently not translated in
                            both English versions.</p>

                    <head>Case 2: Students of a third language</head>
                    <p>The typical case for trilingual alignment was a student who was proficient in
                        two languages, and wished to improve a third one. The student would perform
                        a trilingual alignment (possibly preceded by a pairwise alignment between
                        the two better-known languages), systematically comparing a lesser-known
                        language against two translations. The student would use the knowledge of
                        the first two languages to leverage the obstacles in understanding the third
                        one, by recognizing common syntactical patterns, morphologies, or
                        similarities in vocabulary.</p>
                    <p>Interestingly, this case was not limited to the study of historical
                        languages: a collateral advantage of trilingual alignment was that students
                        with proficiency in a historical language could use this opportunity to
                        focus on another language that they knew less, often a second modern
                        language that they were studying at the same time.</p>

                            comparing German and Latin resulted easier than English and Latin. The
                            English translation chosen was, on the other hand, approached with some
                            criticism, because of its lengthy rendering of expressions that resulted
                            equivalent in German and Latin.</p>

                        literature, who had no prior knowledge of the source language and were also
                        not studying it. The students were given short sections of a source text and
                        corresponding translations in various languages, and performed several tasks
                        aimed at gradually building a critical approach to the original: <list

                                corresponding words in a translation in a chosen language. The goal
                                of this exercise was to develop an understanding of the depth of
                                crucial cultural concepts, by assessing the many different ways in
                                which the same word in the source text could be translated.</item>

                                assess the linguistic differences between the languages in question,
                                and partly to demonstrate to them that they could, in fact, approach
                                a text in a language that they did not know at all, by means of
                                translation alignment.</item>
                        </list> Interestingly, we observed that students who had mastery of more
                        than one language almost immediately learned to use trilingual alignment to
                        leverage the difficulties in dealing with a language that they had never
                        seen before. This strategy proved effective in various cases: many students
                        completed the first two assignments using both English and a third modern
                        language (often Spanish or French); non-native English speakers used their
                        native language to better understand complex words and expressions; students
                        who mastered another classical language tested if they could use it to
                        better engage with phenomena like inflected forms, participial uses, and
                        subordination. Overall, trilingual alignment proved to be an effective
                        strategy to engage with the source text, as already assessed in <ref
                            target="#case2">Case 2</ref>. By the end of the course, students were
                        able to align relatively long passages against one or more translations.</p>

                            The student used trilingual alignment to verify whether the knowledge of
                            Greek, with English as a bridge language, could serve to leverage the
                            unfamiliarity with a text in Latin. The passage chosen, from Herodotus’
                                <title rend="italic">Histories</title>, was aligned in the original
                            Greek, against the English translation by A.D. Godley (1920), and the
                            Latin version by J. Schweighaeuser (1824). The experiment proved
                            successful: the student was able to recognize cognate words and match
                            them with the corresponding Greek, and to use the knowledge of inflected
                            languages to compare parts of speech between Latin and Greek (for

                                >http://jelks.nu/libri/classics/bacchae.html</ref>) and a revised
                            Chinese version based on the English (as there were no available Chinese
                            translations of the original Greek). As a Chinese native speaker, the
                            student used Chinese as a bridge to establish accurate correspondences
                            between the English and the Ancient Greek words that had never been seen
                            before. The result was an investigation into the meaning of Ancient
                            Greek concepts through a meaningful comparison with similar Chinese
                            terms, often with an emphasis on imperfect grammatical and semantic
                            correspondences between the Greek and its translation (such as <foreign

                        critical recognition that they could convey in-depth knowledge of critical
                        cultural concepts expressed in the source language, by contrasting them with
                        their modern language translation and investigating into their various
                        meanings <ptr target="#crane2019"/>. The recognition of the limited
                        capabilities of translation to efficiently convey concepts in Classical
                        languages, while at first caused disappointment and criticism, convinced the
                        students of the need to look more in depth into the original language to
                        understand its inherent characteristics and the way it expressed ideas <ptr

                    <p>Students of the source language developed a tangible sense for the fluidity
                        of translation by evaluating different strategies employed by professional
                        scholars to approach complex phenomena; they systematically approached
                        complex morphosyntactic constructs and were compelled to discuss their
                        function and significance, while assessing the necessary imperfect character
                        of any translation of them. In addition, students who were experimenting
                        with learning a new modern language could approach unknown expressions and
                        vocabulary by using their skills in other languages as a bridge to convey
                        similar constructs.</p>
                    <p>One of the most relevant outcomes of this study was that students with no
                        prior knowledge of the source language could start learning it by directly
                        reading original literary texts. This approach could be revolutionary in the
                        field of slow reading and language learning, and it also promises
                        non-trivial consequences for passive users: readers with no knowledge of a
                        source language could easily use already available alignments to perform a
                        dynamic reading of the original aligned with its translation, gaining a
                        basic understanding of vocabulary and syntax in the original.</p>

                    <head>Limitations and Future Work</head>
                    <p>We hope to have shown the pedagogical potential of translation alignment.
                        However, we are also aware that significant implementation needs to be
                        pursued to improve some underdeveloped aspects and to allow a more
                        systematic use of a translation alignment interface in teaching
                        practices.</p>
                    <p>We recognize that at the moment the tool is open to every category of user,
                        and the aligned pairs are partly the result of unsupervised work, which may
                        affect the quality and consistency of the information collected in the
                        database. The lack of a suitable evaluation/correction workflow not only
                        makes the dataset not accurate enough for machine translation, but also
                        prevents organic teacher supervision. Therefore, the integration of a voting
                        system for the evaluation of the accuracy by teachers or expert users is one
                        of the most needed implementations. A related problem is the current
                        impossibility of working on collaborative projects, where multiple users can
                        work together on the same corpus.</p>
                    <p>Secondly, not all translation pairs are equally useful as training data. We
                        should expect alignment to produce conflicting, mutually exclusive, results:
                        after all, translation alignment is the result of interpretation, and not
                        all cases are easily classifiable as <q>right</q> or <q>wrong</q>. In some
                        cases, typically literary texts, it is extremely difficult to establish
                        perfect or even partial correspondences between expressions and concepts in
                        potentially very different languages: we have found that, in lack of
                        specific guidelines or gold standards for each single language pair, users
                        tend to create their own set of rules to keep a consistent alignment
                        strategy, but these rules tend to be very different according to the
                        particular purpose of the alignment. Therefore, we need a system to filter
                        translation pairs: an option would be to allow users to classify different
                        kinds of translation pairs, for example distinguishing categories such as
                            <q>perfect/complete</q> or <q>partial/incomplete</q>, and <q>literal</q>
                        or <q>free/poetical</q>.</p>
                    <p>Finally, we recognize that immediate access to part-of-speech tagging and
                        available word pairs while performing the alignment would enormously impact
                        on the work of non-specialized users and students, and obviously on the
                        improvement of analytical passive reading. This very desirable additional
                        feature is also included in our future implementation.</p>
