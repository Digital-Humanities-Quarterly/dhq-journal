                  <p>This article describes <em class="emph">Mediate: An Annotation Tool for Audiovisual Media</em>,
                     developed at the University of Rochester, and emphasizes the platform as a source
                     for the
                     understanding of film, television, poetry, pop songs, live performance, music, and
                     advertising as shown in three cases studies from film and media studies, music history,
                     and linguistics. In each case collaboration amongst students was not only key, but
                     also
                     enabled by <em class="emph">Mediate</em>, which allows students to work in groups to generate large
                     amounts of data about audiovisual media. Further, the process of data generation produces
                     quantitative and qualitative observation of the mediated interplay of sight and sound.
                     A
                     major outcome of these classes for the faculty teaching them has been the concept
                     of
                     <em class="emph">audiovisualities</em>: the physically and culturally interpenetrating modes of
                     audiovisual experience and audiovisual inscription where hearing and seeing remediate
                     one
                     another for all of us as sensory and social subjects. Throughout the article, we chart
                     how
                     audiovisualities have emerged for students and ourselves out of digital annotation
                     in

                     when we
                     view movies, watch television, listen to live or recorded music, read or hear poems
                     read
                     aloud, and consume advertising, whether in print or on screens [<a class="ref" href="#benjamin1939">Benjamin 1939</a>]

                     [<a class="ref" href="#hansen2004">Hansen 2004</a>]. Since the late twentieth century, the interplay of seeing and
                     hearing has yielded richly variegated writing and thinking about, on the one hand,
                     vision
                     and visuality and, on the other, the acoustic, the audible, and the aural. In this
                     essay,
                     we pursue this interplay into the digital humanities. More specifically, we advance
                     the
                     concept of <em class="emph">audiovisualities</em> in order to describe that interplay in the
                     context of digital annotation of time-based media. In these media, seeing and hearing
                     are
                     inseparable and our goal is to understand how processes of digital annotation can
                     help
                     scholars and students investigate this entanglement. To do this, we describe a platform
                     we
                     have named <em class="emph">Mediate: An Annotation Tool for Audiovisual Media</em>, which was
                     developed with the Digital Scholarship Lab at the University of Rochester and has
                     been
                     used in undergraduate courses across the humanities and social sciences there. In
                     these
                     settings, <em class="emph">Mediate</em> has enabled our students and ourselves to see and hear the
                     data of our eyes and ears in reflexively collective and recursively interdisciplinary
                     ways. This collective process in a variety of classrooms is what has brought us —
                     three
                     faculty members (two tenure track, one instructional track), two students (an
                     undergraduate and a graduate student), and two staff members from the library (the
                     programmer and the Director of the Digital Scholarship Lab) — to the concept of
                     audiovisualities we explore in this essay.

                  <div class="ptext" id="p2">That concept cannot be disaggregated from visual studies and sound studies, two fields
                     that have developed alongside their more disciplinary counterparts in art history,
                     film
                     studies, musicology, and music theory. Broadly conceived, visual studies offers a
                     means of
                     understanding the expansive domain of the visual beyond what disciplines such as art
                     history or film studies allow us to see. Wildly diverse in the directions it has taken
                     since emerging in the late twentieth century, one of the central legacies of visual
                     studies has been the concept of "visuality," or "sight as a social fact," which cannot
                     be
                     disaggregated from the act of "vision," or "sight as a physical operation" [<a class="ref" href="#foster1988">Foster 1988</a>]. Adapting W. J. T. Mitchell, we can think of visuality as a
                     "dialectical concept" in which the study of "visual culture cannot rest content with
                     a
                     definition of its object as the social construction of the visual field, but must
                     insist
                     on exploring the chiastic reversal of this proposition, <em class="emph">the visual construction of
                        the social field</em>. It is not just that we see the way we do because we are social
                     animals, but also that our social arrangements take the forms they do because we are
                     seeing animals" [<a class="ref" href="#mitchell2002">Mitchell 2002</a>].

                     in
                     the early twenty-first century, refuse to be content with a definition of its object
                     as
                     solely the social construction of the sonic field, but also account for the sonic

                     frameworks in various established disciplines, sound studies treats the audible and
                     the
                     aural, as Jonathan Sterne has put it, as "an artifact of the messy and political human
                     sphere" [<a class="ref" href="#sterne2003">Sterne 2003</a>]. Pondering that "artifact," three researchers
                     exploring what they call "digital sound studies," including one of the authors of
                     this
                     article, have posed a question about the assumed modes in scholarship itself. "How,"
                     they
                     ask, "can scholars write about sound <em class="emph">in sound</em>?" [<a class="ref" href="#lingold2018">Lingold et al. 2018</a>].

                     we
                     hear. While Sterne's work in <em class="emph">The Audible Past</em> has systematized and
                     historicized this sight-sound relation, film theorists such as Michel Chion [<a class="ref" href="#chion1994">Chion 1994</a>] and Kaja Silverman [<a class="ref" href="#silverman1988">Silverman 1988</a>] and media

                     generatively tracked the dialectic of the visual and the audible in their work. We
                     think
                     of this dialectic as producing the audiovisualities — the physically and culturally
                     interpenetrating modes of audiovisual experience and audiovisual inscription where
                     hearing

                     cinematic, televisual, musical, literary, and commercial media in courses housed in
                     the
                     Film and Media Studies Program, the Musicology Department, and the Department of
                     Linguistics. In these courses, the audiovisual specificities of a given medium become
                     radically legible to students in the data they yield by annotating in

                     medium-specific qualities of film or music or advertising in their unique material
                     forms,
                     cultural contexts, and social functions, we have unexpectedly ended up in a broader
                     concept of audiovisuality that cuts across disciplinary differences. To riff on Mitchell
                     one last time, <em class="emph">Mediate</em> allows us to examine the audiovisual construction of

                     longer immediately intuited through our senses, but turned into an object of analysis
                     — an
                     audible and visible "exteriority" [<a class="ref" href="#sterne2003">Sterne 2003</a>] that allows us to grasp the
                     interplay of seeing and hearing beyond the often self-contained ways in which we process
                     sensory data internally and individually.

                  <div class="counter"><a href="#p6">6</a></div>
                  <div class="ptext" id="p6"><em class="emph">Mediate</em> arose out of Joel Burges's desire to have a digital tool that would
                     enable the collection of large amounts of data about how time works on television.
                     Originally working with Nora Dimmock, Jeff Suszczynski, and Joshua Romphf by experimenting
                     with digital humanities projects in the classes "The Poetics of Television," "Film
                     History, 1989-Present," and "Clocks and Computers: Visualizing Cultural Time" between
                     2012
                     and 2016, this desire gave way to the still ongoing project of developing a digital
                     annotation tool for audiovisual media that would be of more general use. As it did,
                     we
                     moved from combining software such as Jubler, DaVinci Resolve, and Adobe Encore to
                     building our own platform, primarily through the labor of Romphf [<a class="ref" href="#burges2016">Burges et al. 2016</a>]. <em class="emph">Mediate</em> is a web-based platform that allows users to upload audiovisual
                     media; produce real-time notes; generate automated and manual annotations (which we
                     also
                     call markers) on the basis of customized schema; preserve the annotations as data
                     that can
                     be queried; and export the data in CSV and JSON formats for further exploration,
                     interpretation, and visualization. The platform is built in Python and JavaScript,
                     and it
                     makes use of several open source libraries, including Django, OpenCV, FFMPEG, and
                     React.
                     Through websockets tied together by a REST API, <em class="emph">Mediate</em> supports concurrent
                     updates of annotations added by multiple users. <em class="emph">Mediate</em> provides a real-time
                     system for annotating and analyzing myriad genres that yield audiovisualities in which
                     sight and sound come into chiastic interplay in medium-specific ways.

                  <div class="ptext" id="p7">There are other tools like <em class="emph">Mediate</em>, including ELAN and NVivo, the subjects
                     of a recent study of the audiovisual state of digital annotation [<a class="ref" href="#melgar2017">Melgar et al. 2017</a>]. The build of ELAN and NVivo, however, make them technologically and methodologically
                     distinct from <em class="emph">Mediate</em>. NVivo is not open source, while ELAN is — we hope
                     <em class="emph">Mediate</em> will be open source and widely accessible in the future. Both ELAN
                     and NVivo are desktop-based programs and have limited collaborative capabilities,
                     whereas
                     synchronous and asynchronous collaboration are foregrounded in <em class="emph">Mediate</em>. ELAN
                     projects can only contain one media file whereas NVivo has a more multimodal approach
                     and
                     supports a variety of file formats, similar to <em class="emph">Mediate</em>. ELAN provides tiers
                     (like the schema we use in <em class="emph">Mediate</em>, described below) with controlled
                     vocabularies (akin to markers that make up schema in <em class="emph">Mediate</em>, again described
                     below), whereas the categorization in NVivo is done after annotating through a code
                     book
                     approach common in the social sciences. Neither tool offers, as <em class="emph">Mediate</em> does,
                     automated shot detection, and the ease of querying and exporting data across projects,
                     media, and/or schema. Furthermore, they both feature high learning curves.
                     <em class="emph">Mediate</em> adopts a more streamlined approach to consuming media in the design
                     of its interface, which echoes familiar interfaces from our historical moment.

                     ELAN and NVivo: "making the analytic procedures more explicit," can generate "more
                     self-reflection about scholarly work." The authors suggest that digital annotation's
                     greatest strength is its reflexive ability to draw users' attention to various units
                     of

                     datum is captured when digitally annotating audiovisual media is itself invented.
                     The
                     invented dimension of these units are revealed whenever students discuss and debate
                     marker
                     definitions, as we have seen in all of our classes.

                     that
                     exist in cultural contexts and have some social function, as is reflected in our schemas.
                     These schemas emerge from discipline-specific frameworks, with some of us stressing
                     material form, cultural context, or social function more when teaching with
                     <em class="emph">Mediate</em>. In this section we provide three case studies. The first draws on
                     a number of film and media studies classes where Burges wanted students to understand
                     how
                     a range of audiovisual media — television, poetry, and pop songs in the two cases
                     discussed here — work formally such that they can be materially differentiated from
                     another medium, even if they share certain properties. While Mueller and Armoskaite
                     share
                     this concern to varying degrees, their expertise has driven them to underscore questions
                     of cultural context and social function more prominently in the study of audiovisual
                     media. In his history class for music majors, Mueller asks students to interpret how
                     a
                     range of historical contingencies influences the creation and performance of specific
                     musical sounds. Here, <em class="emph">Mediate</em> is a prompt to redirect assumptions about music
                     that students already think they "know." Bringing together questions of material form
                     and
                     cultural context, Armoskaite uses <em class="emph">Mediate</em> to spark students to delve into how
                     language in advertising itself is audiovisual — or more precisely, how language has
                     a
                     social function in commercial media that turns on how it activates the interplay of
                     hearing and seeing vis-à-vis linguistic and discursive content meant to induce an
                     action

                        for the College of Arts, Sciences, and Engineering at the University of Rochester,
                        including the two I discuss here: "The Poetics of Television" and "Introduction to
                        Media
                        Studies". In "The Poetics of Television", for example, we spend significant time
                        studying the different ways in which the episode is a form of inscription that organizes
                        the audiovisual experience of television in narratively open and closed ways. In
                        "Introduction to Media Studies," we discuss television not only from this narrative
                        perspective, but also from the perspective of television as a historically variable
                        technology for transmitting sounds and images onto a screen that was, for many decades,
                        primarily part of the TV set. These are both material to the form of television, with
                        the latter especially providing the specific audiovisual means by which television
                        mediates and materializes narrative, information, and advertising for its viewers.
                        In my
                        classes, the question of material form — of how a medium is a matter of form — is
                        not
                        reducible to solely inquiring into these means in order to secure that which is, to
                        recall Clement Greenberg [<a class="ref" href="#greenberg1960">Greenberg 1960</a>], irreducibly exclusive to it. It
                        instead involves pursuing lines of inquiry with students in which we explore the
                        specificity of a range of media — from television and film to poetry and song — through
                        the shifting constellations of qualities constrained and enabled by diverse audiovisual
                        means in the first place [<a class="ref" href="#doane2007">Doane 2007</a>].

                        were designed around aural, visual, and narrative qualities in order to show how sound,

                        in
                        groups of four to six people to annotate on the basis of the schema or schemas that
                        group was assigned, building toward long papers in which they explored a wide range
                        of
                        topics through distant and close readings performed in writing and through
                        visualizations. Regardless of the topic, these papers almost universally exhibited
                        a
                        deep knowledge of the material form of the audiovisual medium under study; the specific
                        interplay of sight and sound embodied by TV, for instance, became "second nature"
                        to one
                        student, "so much so that when I watch TV now I automatically mark the episode in
                        the
                        back of my mind" [<a class="ref" href="#crumrine2016">Crumrine et al. 2016</a>]. This is the result of what the students
                        characterize as the "immersive" dimension of <em class="emph">Mediate</em> in which time spent
                        marking, however "irritating" and "monotonous" and "tedious" in its slowness over

                        semester, generates a profound concept of the qualities that give material form to
                        their
                        audiovisual experience [<a class="ref" href="#allen2016">Allen et al. 2016</a>]. This is most palpable when one looks
                        more closely at final projects students completed, in which their collaborative efforts
                        yielded a remarkable level of quantitative data and qualitative observation worth
                        understanding in greater nuance.<a class="noteRef" href="#d4e688">[3]</a></div>

                     <div class="ptext" id="p19">In an essay for "The Poetics of Television" entitled "The Formal Nucleus of Television,
                        and Its Subservience to Narrative" [<a class="ref" href="#allen2016">Allen et al. 2016</a>], the students argued that
                        dialogue is a key element of the "formal nucleus" of TV by exploring the nexus of
                        sound
                        and story in four historically and generically variable series defined by open narration
                        (<em class="emph">Game of Thrones</em>, <em class="emph">Dark Shadows</em>, <em class="emph">Guiding Light</em>,
                        and <em class="emph">Robotech</em>). On the basis of hundreds of markers the students in this
                        group annotated, they argue that dialogue is an elementally generative feature of
                        the
                        "aural design" of television that "advance[s] the narrative progression of an episode."
                        This is due to dialogue allowing "all details pertinent to the comprehension of the
                        narrative, in terms of both plot and character, to be enumerated in explicit,
                        unequivocal, and economical terms." This group further contends that the television
                        camera often obeys the human voice, suggesting that visual design flows from aural
                        design, for instance, on the basis of the 54 on-offscreen and off-onscreen shifts
                        of
                        sound vis-à-vis the image and diegesis that the group marked in the infamous Red Wedding
                        scene of <em class="emph">Game of Thrones</em> while annotating in the Aural Schema. While both
                        the visible and the audible are subservient to narrative in the argument this group's
                        paper makes, it nonetheless richly charts the interplay of sight and sound within
                        storytelling on TV, revealing how that mediated interplay — that audiovisuality —
                        lets
                        narrative take material form on screen.

                        than focusing on one audiovisual medium to achieve this end, as in "The Poetics of
                        Television," I used a comparative approach in which I asked students to work in groups
                        to annotate poetry and pop songs to which they listened closely and repeatedly in
                        <em class="emph">Mediate</em>. Students were not allowed to pull print versions of the poems
                        they were annotating on the basis of oral renditions by their authors, forcing them
                        to
                        use their ears to grasp the differences between poems and songs marked using schemas
                        developed for each of these genres. What one group observed about those differences
                        will
                        sound obvious: while rhythmically structured and lineated language is the medium of
                        poetry, pop songs are much more musical in their means, depending on instrumentation,
                        chord progression, beat groupings and so on [<a class="ref" href="#colberg2019">Colberg et al. 2019</a>].

                     <div class="ptext" id="p21">But what is less obvious is how the students in this group came to experience this
                        difference because <em class="emph">Mediate</em> introduced annotation into audition. In
                        annotating, they <em class="emph">heard</em> what was material to the form of poetry and pop
                        songs as a fixed and motivated structure of aural notation. The songs went from being
                        an
                        internal experience of sound and music to appearing as an externalized — because now
                        annotated — form of audiovisual inscription. Thus the long paper this group produced
                        focused less on material form in favor of trying to pinpoint what constellation of
                        audible qualities inscribe what they call "intensity." For this group, intensity refers
                        to how "affective response" and "aesthetic emotion" in a mediated genre of sound turns
                        upon medium-specific features, as in their LP record player-inspired visualizations
                        of
                        two songs, Troye Sivan's "Wild" and Taylor Swift's "This Love." Audiovisualities in
                        their own right, these experimental data visualizations show how distinct kinds of
                        vocal
                        stress, chord changes, back-up singing, and instrumentation not only mark the form
                        of
                        these songs, but also form the possibility of having a musically "intense" reaction
                        to

                        hear the material form of a range of audiovisual media. It is important that they

                        working together, collaborating to annotate such that both within and across their

                        quantitative and qualitative effects. On the one hand, the quantitative dimension
                        of
                        their collaborative efforts is visible in the plenitude of markers that each group

                        by other groups marking in the same class to understand the annotation that has occurred
                        in a given group. On the other hand, the repeated marking required to yield thousands
                        of
                        data points they can share with one another engenders a quality of description and

                        television, poetry, and pop songs from multiple audiovisual angles of seeing and
                        hearing. As we have more fully argued elsewhere [<a class="ref" href="#burges2016">Burges et al. 2016</a>], however,
                        that "truth" depends upon the discussions that often emerge over how to collectively
                        define and collaboratively mark a unit of analysis within and across groups as they
                        annotate features of material form; these discussions over how to see and hear, though,
                        only further shore up both that no medium is a natural given, and that every audiovisual
                        experience is mediated.

                        from the rest of the university in terms of its student population, educational goals,
                        and curriculum. All of ESM's approximately 500 undergraduate students are music majors,
                        with a primary focus on Western classical music.<a class="noteRef" href="#d4e762">[4]</a> Our students are some of
                        the best young musicians in the world, meaning that most view their classroom activities
                        through the lens of their future careers in performance, composition, and pedagogy.
                        To
                        even gain admittance, they need to have remarkable expertise and years of specialized
                        training in a tradition built around individual composers and master performers. So,
                        while these students bring a strong passion for music into the classroom, doing academic
                        work often forces them to confront viewpoints and approaches that are frequently taken
                        as natural rather than culturally constructed.

                     <div class="ptext" id="p24">Most of the traditions represented at ESM are heavily reliant on musical notation,
                        a
                        highly advanced system of written symbols that has, over many centuries, enabled the
                        development and circulation of music that originated in Western Europe. In many
                        respects, the very presence of notation constitutes the tradition [<a class="ref" href="#taruskin2005">Taruskin 2005</a>]. Musical notation can also be understood as a form of
                        audiovisual inscription that communicates specific information about both how to perform
                        music and also how an individual piece functions melodically, harmonically,
                        rhythmically, and formally [<a class="ref" href="#moseley2015">Moseley 2015</a>]
                        [<a class="ref" href="#rehding2017">Rehding et al. 2017</a>]
                        [<a class="ref" href="#kittler1999">Kittler 1999</a>]. Reading music, as we would say, is a presumed skill that
                        students rely upon as they move through the robust series of classes in music theory
                        and
                        history, both of which differently emphasize score-based analysis of internal (within
                        a
                        piece) and external (within a tradition) musical features. As a result, students are
                        very comfortable working with written music, as well as the specialized language used
                        to
                        describe it. Still, the culture surrounding classical music has calcified certain
                        perspectives, especially on what it means to do analysis. For many students, music
                        analysis is too often conceived of as an action solely in visual terms, rather than
                        an
                        act that takes place in a far more expanded audiovisual realm.

                     <div class="ptext" id="p25">In Fall 2019, I introduced <em class="emph">Mediate</em> into my "Experiments at the Edges of
                        20th Century Music," a required course within the undergraduate music history core.
                        My
                        goal was to foreground listening, rather than reading, as the primary means of analysis.
                        As exceptional performers already, my students listen with an expertly attuned
                        understanding of musical performance. But while they continually analyze music while
                        listening, they do not always listen historically — that is, attend to how specific
                        musical moments express historically contingent beliefs about culture, society, or
                        the
                        many processes of music making. There is no inherent problem with their modality of
                        listening. However, it is not always congruous with my major pedagogical goal: to
                        examine and interpret how music and its written tradition are both heavily mediated
                        creations, dependent on historically situated actors with different investments and
                        values. By asking students to pay attention differently, <em class="emph">Mediate</em> not only
                        foregrounds listening but also asks students to translate that listening into specific
                        observations represented visually. In effect, this reverses the standard audiovisual
                        direction of music making. Rather than move from visual inscription (notation) to
                        aural
                        expression (performance), <em class="emph">Mediate</em> renders what is heard into specific
                        visual markings of that performance. Unsettling the assumed relationships between
                        the
                        visual and the aural — by putting listening first — encourages alternative viewpoints
                        to
                        come into the forefront of the analytical process.

                        of the semester. First, the slow, sometimes-tedious markup process requires active
                        listening. Many students discussed how they came to notice subtle details and
                        complexities precisely because the marking up process made "passive" or "casual"
                        listening impossible. The intensity involved with repeated listening did not always
                        change their initial opinions, but rather increased the precision and specificity
                        of
                        their observations. One student remarked with surprise about "how much could happen
                        within one tiny second." Second, the processes of collective listening encouraged
                        individuals to consider multiple vantage points. Collaboration through group work
                        is not
                        always smooth or easy, and it is sometimes unpopular. But by learning from or being
                        challenged by their colleagues — perhaps even by becoming a "cultural context" in
                        miniature — many students reported that the dialogic experience enabled them to make
                        connections that were perhaps not obvious to them before.

                        remained hidden by only looking at the written notation — the particular use of vibrato,
                        the background noise in a recording, a reoccurring timbre, or the use of space or
                        a
                        particular texture in the orchestration. Through the analysis of seemingly discrete

                        students then found ways to relate what happens musically to what that performance
                        might
                        mean more broadly, which is to say historically. As one student commented, the analysis
                        provided a way to understand how music functioned as an interconnected web of historical
                        events, musical influences, and experiences of "real life people." In comparison with
                        previous semesters, the written work of the students in this class was at once more
                        precise and bolder in their conclusions.

                        the
                        context of audiovisual marketing against the backdrop of current social trends. While
                        Linguistics does not have a Business or Marketing track, the course routinely is taken
                        by business majors and consistently is a popular elective among other non-Linguistics
                        majors. I face a diverse group of students with different backgrounds, skills, and
                        assumptions, though united by the three common denominators. First, the ubiquity of
                        advertising in their lives gives them a false sense of familiarity and assumed knowledge
                        of the medium; second, they want to learn the nuts and bolts of the advertising machine;
                        and third, they possess limited knowledge of linguistics. Over the course of the
                        semester, they learn that the social function of language in advertising is to
                        manipulate, with commercial media, working to apply psychological pressure through
                        a
                        mode of audiovisuality that depends on influencing our emotions and circumventing

                        linguistics — necessarily slows down the students. They learn to analyze the linguistic
                        components that, to call back to the film and media studies case above, "make" the
                        medium. The material form that interests a linguist, however, includes not only sounds
                        and images of the kind that interest Burges and Mueller in their courses, but also
                        the
                        very structure of language as humans speak, read, and hear it. For example, each of
                        the
                        following posters can be deciphered in the linguistic terms of sound, form, and meaning,
                        which shows that even print advertising functions as an audiovisual medium.

                        and
                        dynamic sounds. The latter contains hundreds of speech patterns in addition to
                        innumerable cues for our ears and eyes. Superimposed on moving images, these patterns
                        and cues come at a viewer at a speed that barely allows them to register the component
                        parts, let alone perform a thorough analysis. <em class="emph">Mediate</em> creates a space for
                        such analysis external to the ephemerally immediate modes in which we normally consume
                        commercial media. In so doing, it makes legible that language plays a constitutive
                        part
                        in the interplay of sight and hearing — that all three of these human abilities

                        brilliant acts of commodified audiovisuality that want us to buy or buy into something.

                        linguistics using similar examples to the print advertisements discussed above. Building
                        on this print unit, we then turned to the challenge of analyzing commercials using
                        <em class="emph">Mediate</em>. The students began by analyzing an ad without the use of
                        <em class="emph">Mediate</em>. Then I modeled the slow and detailed analysis conducted through
                        <em class="emph">Mediate</em> by providing them with samples of my own marked-up commercial. We
                        discussed their observations, along with my own, which gently lets them understand

                        many details they've missed in their own observations. The students were then trained
                        on
                        the platform and introduced to the schema over two class sessions. After that initial
                        introduction, the students took charge of their own learning with only a light editorial

                        have
                        realized that more sophisticated ways of tuning into the linguistic, visual, and sonic

                        manipulation. For example, thus far, I have left out musical aspects completely as
                        I
                        lack relevant training. In the future iterations of this course, I think about the

                        students define the auditory components, if Burges could work with students to delve
                        further into the visual form — that is, if students benefitted not only from their
                        collective defining through marking, but also the collective expertise of a more
                        intentionally cross-disciplinary approach to teaching and research.

                  <div class="ptext" id="p48">Across our individual classes, we have seen our students more fully enter the study
                     of
                     audiovisual media as they are defined by material form, cultural context, and social
                     function within our respective disciplinary frameworks. In sharing these experiences
                     with
                     one another across our disciplines, we have been reminded that, when it comes to the
                     audiovisual field, a film and media studies scholar should sometimes see and hear
                     that
                     field <em class="emph">like</em> a music historian who should sometimes see and hear it
                     <em class="emph">like</em> a linguist. In noticing that we should see and hear like each other
                     more, even as we explored medium-specific matters with our students, we have arrived
                     at
                     the cross-disciplinary concept of audiovisualities. Pedagogically and intellectually
                     segregated from another due to the division of labor that organizes the modern research
                     university, this concept allows us to think about the interplay of sight and sound
                     more
                     promiscuously and productively, overcoming the binaries that too often divide the
                     audible
                     and the visual and the divides that splinter disciplines from one another institutionally.
                     In working together the last few years on digital annotation, we have learned to think
                     more comprehensively across our respective fields about the (re)mediated sites where
                     the
                     physical and cultural operations of audiovisual experience converge. It is these locations
                     of convergence that construct not only sensory and social subjectivities grounded
                     in
                     seeing and hearing, but also material forms and collective technics that set the
                     conditions of possibility to see and hear to begin with — in short, that construct
                     a
                     manifold of audiovisualities. Our work on <em class="emph">Mediate</em> has helped us to estrange,
                     even to alienate, the "natural order" that has been imposed on our experience of that
                     manifold, or what Michel Chion describes as the "audiovisual contract" [<a class="ref" href="#chion1994">Chion 1994</a>, 9].
                  </div>
                  
                  <div class="counter"><a href="#p49">49</a></div>
                  <div class="ptext" id="p49">As this gesture to Chion telegraphs, we are not the first group of scholars to explore
                     such conditions. The cross-disciplinary concept of audiovisualities on which we have
                     landed already has a genealogy of thinkers — many of them cited at the outset of this
                     essay — associated with visual studies and sound studies, not to mention film and
                     media
                     studies, behind it. Indebted to them, we nonetheless think the practice of digital
                     annotation that <em class="emph">Mediate</em> provides contributes a collaborative model of
                     learning through collective reading that allows our students to conceptualize
                     audiovisualities beyond their individual selves (and our individual disciplines).
                     It may
                     do this, as well, for any scholars that take it up, especially, if not only in a
                     collective and collaborative form. The collectivity of digital annotation can take
                     that
                     which feels intuitive and internal and remake it as unfamiliar and external; the
                     collective act of exteriorizing that occurs in <em class="emph">Mediate</em> brings a new awareness
                     to the qualities and characteristics of a given audiovisual medium.

                  <div class="ptext" id="p50">"History is nothing but exteriorities," writes Jonathan Sterne in <em class="emph">The Audible
                        Past,</em> by which he means that we can only know the "sonic world" of the past
                     through its "efforts, expressions, and reactions" [<a class="ref" href="#sterne2003">Sterne 2003</a>].
                     <em class="emph">Mediate</em> embraces this point of view. Digital annotation in
                     <em class="emph">Mediate</em> asks students to exteriorize their reactions to audiovisual media
                     not only by slowing down their consumption of them, but also by turning what feels
                     subjectively intuitive, immediate, and internal (listening to and even playing music,
                     taking in a poem, consuming an advertisement, watching a TV show) into a mediated
                     object
                     to be analyzed collaboratively and collectively beyond oneself. Vivid examples of
                     this
                     process of exteriorizing abound in our case studies. In "Experiments at the Edges
                     of 20th
                     Century Music," students produce digital "notations," so to speak, through their use
                     of
                     <em class="emph">Mediate</em>, thus resituating the ocularcentric primacy of musical notation
                     through careful listening and historicizing. Similarly, in "Language and Advertising,"
                     the
                     interface renders commercials a constellation of elements that act on us linguistically,
                     visually, and musically in ways students can tangibly analyze. And the experimental
                     visualizations of two pop songs for "Introduction to Media Studies" draw on data produced
                     collectively through digital annotation about the aural experience of intensity to
                     visually represent the material form of that intensity.

                  <div class="ptext" id="p51"><em class="emph">Mediate</em> therefore enables a defamiliarized perception of audiovisialities,
                     first and foremost, by challenging the consumption of media as an individual and discrete
                     act atomized from others. The work of collaborative annotation, which sets
                     <em class="emph">Mediate</em> apart from platforms such as ELAN and NVivo, reveals not only the
                     potential for different experiences of the same mediums, but that the criteria through
                     which we name and identify media — and indeed, our respective disciplines — can, and
                     perhaps should, be subject to the scrutiny made possible by collective re-examination.
                     Our
                     respective fields are built upon often now unspoken agreements about what constitutes
                     film
                     or poetry or music or television or advertising or language. <em class="emph">Mediate</em> shows
                     how "agreeing to disagree" on a given medium's properties remains a necessary move
                     within
                     and across disciplines, especially if we are to take into account critiques of both
                     collaboration and computation leveled at the digital humanities. The reverse of the
                     earlier claim, in other words, is also true. Our students often debate what a unit
                     analysis means when marking, mobilizing the differences amongst themselves in
                     collaborating on digital annotation. Similarly, when it comes to the cross-disciplinary
                     concept of audiovisualities, a film and media studies scholar should see and hear
                     the
                     interplay of sight <em class="emph">unlike</em> a music historian who should sometimes see and hear
                     it <em class="emph">unlike</em> a linguist as much as we should see and hear it <em class="emph">like</em>
                     each other.

                  <div class="ptext" id="p52">The case studies recounted in this article reflect this collaborative process of
                     disagreement — the self-aware reflection upon "units of analysis" — as a pedagogically
                     necessary exercise in understanding the audiovisual world we inhabit in the present.
                     However, such a practice is not limited to the undergraduate classroom alone. The
                     collaborative nature of digital annotation breaks down a process that scholars, at
                     all
                     levels, often take for granted: the terms and tools through which we analyze media,
                     especially within our respective fields. By making us be both like and unlike each
                     other,
                     <em class="emph">Mediate</em> has allowed us to take hold of those terms and tools anew,
                     discovering audiovisualities out of annotation as a concept that unsettles what we
                     do with
                     the interplay of sight and sound inscribed everywhere into experience at present.
