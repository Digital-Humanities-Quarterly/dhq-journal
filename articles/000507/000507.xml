          <p>This article describes <emph>Mediate: An Annotation Tool for Audiovisual
            Media</emph>, developed at the University of Rochester, and emphasizes the
            platform as a source for the understanding of film, television,
            poetry, pop songs, live performance, music, and advertising as
            shown in three cases studies from film and media studies, music
            history, and linguistics. In each case collaboration amongst
            students was not only key, but also enabled by <emph>Mediate</emph>, which
            allows students to work in groups to generate large amounts of
            data about audiovisual media. Further, the process of data
            generation produces quantitative and qualitative observation of
            the mediated interplay of sight and sound. A major outcome of these
            classes for the faculty teaching them has been the concept of
            <emph>audiovisualities</emph>: the physically and culturally interpenetrating
            modes of audiovisual experience and audiovisual inscription where
            hearing and seeing remediate one another for all of us as sensory
            and social subjects. Throughout the article, we chart how
            audiovisualities have emerged for students and ourselves out of
            digital annotation in <emph>Mediate</emph>.</p>

        <div><head>Introduction</head>
        <p>It has long been a premise in the study of media that multiple senses are
        in play when we view movies, watch television, listen to live or recorded
        music, read or hear poems read aloud, and consume advertising, whether in
        print or on screens <ptr target="#benjamin1939"/>
        <ptr target="#mcluhan1964"/>
        <ptr target="#hansen2004"/>. Since the
        late twentieth century, the interplay of seeing and hearing has yielded richly
        variegated writing and thinking about, on the one hand, vision and visuality
        and, on the other, the acoustic, the audible, and the aural. In this essay,
        we pursue this interplay into the digital humanities. More specifically, we
        advance the concept of <emph>audiovisualities</emph> in order to describe that
        interplay in the context of digital annotation of time-based media. In these
        media, seeing and hearing are inseparable and our goal is to understand how
        processes of digital annotation can help scholars and students investigate this
        entanglement. To do this, we describe a platform we have named <emph>Mediate:
        An Annotation Tool for Audiovisual Media</emph>, which was developed with
        the Digital Scholarship Lab at the University of Rochester and has been used
        in undergraduate courses across the humanities and social sciences there. In
        these settings, <emph>Mediate</emph> has enabled our students and ourselves
        to see and hear the data of our eyes and ears in reflexively collective and
        recursively interdisciplinary ways. This collective process in a variety of
        classrooms is what has brought us — three faculty members (two tenure track, one
        instructional track), two students (an undergraduate and a graduate student),
        and two staff members from the library (the programmer and the Director of the
        Digital Scholarship Lab) — to the concept of audiovisualities we explore in this
        essay.</p>
        <p>That concept cannot be disaggregated from visual studies and sound studies,
        two fields that have developed alongside their more disciplinary counterparts
        in art history, film studies, musicology, and music theory. Broadly conceived,
        visual studies offers a means of understanding the expansive domain of the
        visual beyond what disciplines such as art history or film studies allow
        us to see. Wildly diverse in the directions it has taken since emerging in
        the late twentieth century, one of the central legacies of visual studies
        has been the concept of "visuality," or "sight as a social fact," which
        cannot be disaggregated from the act of "vision," or "sight as a physical
        operation" <ptr target="#foster1988"/>. Adapting W. J. T. Mitchell, we can think of visuality
        as a "dialectical concept" in which the study of "visual culture cannot rest
        content with a definition of its object as the social construction of the
        visual field, but must insist on exploring the chiastic reversal of this
        proposition, <emph>the visual construction of the social field</emph>. It is
        not just that we see the way we do because we are social animals, but also
        that our social arrangements take the forms they do because we are seeing
        animals" <ptr target="#mitchell2002"/>.</p>
        <p>As in visual studies, scholars working in sound studies, which took
        identifiable shape in the early twenty-first century, refuse to be content
        with a definition of its object as solely the social construction of the
        sonic field, but also account for the sonic construction of the social field
        <ptr target="#bull2013"/>
        <ptr target="#novak2015"/>
        <ptr target="#pinch2012"/>
        <ptr target="#sterne2012"/>. Pushing beyond logocentric and ocularcentric theoretical frameworks
        in various established disciplines, sound studies treats the audible and
        the aural, as Jonathan Sterne has put it, as "an artifact of the messy and
        political human sphere" <ptr target="#sterne2003"/>. Pondering that "artifact," three
        researchers exploring what they call "digital sound studies," including one of
        the authors of this article, have posed a question about the assumed modes in
        scholarship itself. "How," they ask, "can scholars write about sound <emph>in
        sound</emph>?" <ptr target="#lingold2018"/>.</p>
        <p>A key effect that sound studies has had on visual studies has been to remind
        those working in the latter that the sights we see often go hand in hand with
        the sounds we hear. While Sterne's work in <emph>The Audible Past</emph> has
        systematized and historicized this sight-sound relation, film theorists such
        as Michel Chion <ptr target="#chion1994"/> and Kaja Silverman <ptr target="#silverman1988"/>
        and media
        archeologists such as Siegfried Zielinski <ptr target="#zielinski1999"/>
        <ptr target="#zielinski2006"/>
        and Bernard Stiegler <ptr target="#stiegler2014"/> have generatively tracked the dialectic
        of the visual and the audible in their work. We think of this dialectic as
        producing the audiovisualities — the physically and culturally interpenetrating
        modes of audiovisual experience and audiovisual inscription where hearing
        and seeing remediate one another for all of us as sensory and social
        subjects — that this essay aims to chart in relation to digital annotation in
        <emph>Mediate</emph>.</p>
        <p>At the University of Rochester, students have used <emph>Mediate</emph>
        to annotate cinematic, televisual, musical, literary, and commercial media
        in courses housed in the Film and Media Studies Program, the Musicology
        Department, and the Department of Linguistics. In these courses, the
        audiovisual specificities of a given medium become radically legible to
        students in the data they yield by annotating in <emph>Mediate</emph>. Further,
        as we will show in this article, in exploring the medium-specific qualities of
        film or music or advertising in their unique material forms, cultural contexts,
        and social functions, we have unexpectedly ended up in a broader concept of
        audiovisuality that cuts across disciplinary differences. To riff on Mitchell
        one last time, <emph>Mediate</emph> allows us to examine the audiovisual
        construction of the social field as much as the social construction of the
        audiovisual field. Through the annotation it supports, <emph>Mediate</emph>
        provides a platform in which that field is no longer immediately intuited
        through our senses, but turned into an object of analysis — an audible and
        visible "exteriority" <ptr target="#sterne2003"/> that allows us to grasp the interplay of
        seeing and hearing beyond the often self-contained ways in which we process
        sensory data internally and individually.</p>
        </div>
        <div><head><emph>Mediate</emph> and the Audiovisual State of Digital
        Annotation</head>
        <p><emph>Mediate</emph> arose out of Joel Burges's desire to have a digital
        tool that would enable the collection of large amounts of data about how time
        works on television. Originally working with Nora Dimmock, Jeff Suszczynski,
        and Joshua Romphf by experimenting with digital humanities projects in the
        classes "The Poetics of Television," "Film History, 1989-Present," and "Clocks
        and Computers: Visualizing Cultural Time" between 2012 and 2016, this desire
        gave way to the still ongoing project of developing a digital annotation tool
        for audiovisual media that would be of more general use. As it did, we moved
        from combining software such as Jubler, DaVinci Resolve, and Adobe Encore
        to building our own platform, primarily through the labor of Romphf
        <ptr target="#burges2016"/>. <emph>Mediate</emph> is a web-based platform that allows users
        to upload audiovisual media; produce real-time notes; generate automated and
        manual annotations (which we also call markers) on the basis of customized
        schema; preserve the annotations as data that can be queried; and export the
        data in CSV and JSON formats for further exploration, interpretation, and
        visualization. The platform is built in Python and JavaScript, and it makes use
        of several open source libraries, including Django, OpenCV, FFMPEG, and React.
        Through websockets tied together by a REST API, <emph>Mediate</emph> supports
        concurrent updates of annotations added by multiple users. <emph>Mediate</emph>
        provides a real-time system for annotating and analyzing myriad genres that
        yield audiovisualities in which sight and sound come into chiastic interplay in
        medium-specific ways.</p>
        <p>There are other tools like <emph>Mediate</emph>, including ELAN and
        NVivo, the subjects of a recent study of the audiovisual state of digital
        annotation <ptr target="#melgar2017"/>. The build of ELAN and NVivo, however, make
        them technologically and methodologically distinct from <emph>Mediate</emph>.
        NVivo is not open source, while ELAN is — we hope <emph>Mediate</emph> will
        be open source and widely accessible in the future. Both ELAN and NVivo
        are desktop-based programs and have limited collaborative capabilities,
        whereas synchronous and asynchronous collaboration are foregrounded in
        <emph>Mediate</emph>. ELAN projects can only contain one media file whereas
        NVivo has a more multimodal approach and supports a variety of file formats,
        similar to <emph>Mediate</emph>. ELAN provides tiers (like the schema we
        use in <emph>Mediate</emph>, described below) with controlled vocabularies
        (akin to markers that make up schema in <emph>Mediate</emph>, again described
        below), whereas the categorization in NVivo is done after annotating through
        a code book approach common in the social sciences. Neither tool offers, as
        <emph>Mediate</emph> does, automated shot detection, and the ease of querying
        and exporting data across projects, media, and/or schema. Furthermore,
        they both feature high learning curves. <emph>Mediate</emph> adopts a more
        streamlined approach to consuming media in the design of its interface, which
        echoes familiar interfaces from our historical moment.</p>
        <p>When a user logs into the <emph>Mediate</emph> website (username:
        mediate_guest password: mediate2019!), they encounter the User Interface that
        displays their research groups. Each group includes the initials of the members
        along with the media assigned to the group. The media thumbnails include a
        count in the upper right-hand corner for annotations already generated.</p>
        <figure xml:id="figure01">
          <head>User Interface as seen at login with the research group name, collaborators’ initials, and available media.</head>
          <graphic url="resources/images/figure01.png"/>
        </figure>
        <p>Selecting, for example, <emph>I Love Lucy</emph>, the user enters the
        Annotation Interface. Here they can watch the media in an interface akin to
        familiar streaming services, but with the addition of a vertical column of time
        coded annotations that scroll as the media plays.</p>
        <figure xml:id="figure02">

          <graphic url="resources/images/figure02.png"/>
        </figure>
        <p>Clicking on the blue marker button in the upper left-hand corner reveals the
        Schema Pane. Here, users select markers and set short-cuts, which enables the
        marking process once the user returns to the Annotation Interface. This process
        can take weeks, especially if a group is marking across multiple objects. The
        repetitive work of collaborative marking not only helps students comprehend
        the forms they are analyzing, but also reveals the necessary judgments involved
        in deciding how and when to mark. As a result, it emerges that each marker and
        the concepts it represents become legible as a formal construct instead of a
        natural given.</p>
        <figure xml:id="figure03">
          <head>Schema Pane displays available markers for that schema and allows the user to assign markers to specific short-cuts for ease of marking.</head>
          <graphic url="resources/images/figure03.png"/>
        </figure>
        <p>At a high level of frequency across seven years and twelve classes,
        Armoskaite, Burges, and Mueller have observed that <emph>Mediate</emph>
        encourages a process of learning that slows down the rapid-fire consumption
        of everyday media, upending the seemingly intuitive and immediate dimensions
        of the audiovisual field.<note>Enrollments for courses at University
        of Rochester using <emph>Mediate</emph> are as follows: "Poetics of
        Television" (Joel Burges) 2012 (27 students), 2013 (28 students), 2016 (58
        students); "Film History 1989-Present" (Joel Burges) 2014 (29 students);
        "Introduction to Media Studies" (Joel Burges) 2019 (67 students); "Clocks
        and Computers" (Joel Burges) 2013 (20 students), 2015 (8 students);
        "Recording 20th Century Music" (Darren Mueller) 2018 (8 students);
        "Experiments at the Edges of 20th Century Music" (Darren Mueller)
        2019 (29 students); "Language and Advertising" (Solveiga Armoskaite) 2018
        (48 students), and 2019 (35 students); "Signature Hitchcock/Hitchcock's

        Luehmann) 2020 (9 students).</note> Recursive and reflexive, digital annotation
        in <emph>Mediate</emph> has made our students tune into the audiovisualities
        that construct them as seeing and hearing subjects through a range of material
        forms that operate in different cultural contexts and with differing social
        functions. The digital annotation in <emph>Mediate</emph> align with what
        Liliana Melgar Estrada et al. <ptr target="#melgar2017"/> conclude is "the most
        significant methodological impact" of using ELAN and NVivo: "making the
        analytic procedures more explicit," can generate "more self-reflection about
        scholarly work." The authors suggest that digital annotation's greatest
        strength is its reflexive ability to draw users' attention to various units of
        analysis that they might not otherwise notice. Similarly, <emph>Mediate</emph>
        allows users to slowly comprehend what makes a film or poem or composition
        what it is as a mediated genre unto itself, but also to grasp how this
        medium-specificity turns on "units of analysis" <ptr target="#melgar2017"/> that are
        subjectively chosen in the first place. Just as all data are capta <ptr target="#drucker2011"/>,
        the unit of analysis by which a datum is captured when digitally
        annotating audiovisual media is itself invented. The invented dimension
        of these units are revealed whenever students discuss and debate marker
        definitions, as we have seen in all of our classes.</p>
        <p>The collaborative process of digital annotation enabled by
        <emph>Mediate</emph>, starts to address one of the concerns raised by Melgar
        et al. in their analysis of the current state of digital annotation: that more
        "collaborative" and "systematic" efforts might allow scholars to transcend
        "small scale" analyses easily replicated on paper <ptr target="#melgar2017"/>. In
        this, they acknowledge what has long been a both celebrated and critiqued
        feature of the digital humanities: its problematically neoliberal stress on
        teamwork that we hope might be rescued as a project of collective reading and
        collaborative curriculum <ptr target="#burges2016"/> <ptr target="#sebok2014"/>.
        Significant as
        the debate over the political economy and research efficacy of the digital
        humanities is <ptr target="#allington2016"/>
        <ptr target="#da2019a"/>
        <ptr target="#da2019b"/>, we nonetheless
        want to stress that in our courses we have found that scaling up — collectivizing
        and collaborating on digital annotation through groups of students producing
        and sharing data with one another about audiovisual media — has allowed those
        students to arrive at analytic findings that go beyond what they are able or
        willing to do otherwise.</p>
        <p>To arrive here, we must not assume that our students are "digital natives"
        who are naturally better at studying and thinking with computational devices
        than with pen and paper. None of us believes this lazy assumption; some of us
        actively work against it in our classes. As we will show, we have nonetheless
        seen outcomes that are educationally remarkable, especially due to the
        collaborative learning that <emph>Mediate</emph> enables, when it comes to how
        digital annotation in <emph>Mediate</emph> fuels our students' grasp of a range
        of audiovisual media in medium-specific ways. Often such medium-specificity is
        tethered to the discipline-specific approaches that we use in our courses, as
        we chart in the next section. But something interdisciplinary has arisen across
        our courses too: the cross-disciplinary concept of audiovisualities that this
        essay advances.</p>
        </div>
        <div><head>Three Disciplinary Case Studies in Digital Annotation</head>
        <p>In our courses, we position individual mediums as possessing unique
        material forms that exist in cultural contexts and have some social function,
        as is reflected in our schemas. These schemas emerge from discipline-specific
        frameworks, with some of us stressing material form, cultural context, or
        social function more when teaching with <emph>Mediate</emph>. In this section
        we provide three case studies. The first draws on a number of film and media
        studies classes where Burges wanted students to understand how a range of
        audiovisual media — television, poetry, and pop songs in the two cases discussed
        here — work formally such that they can be materially differentiated from another
        medium, even if they share certain properties. While Mueller and Armoskaite
        share this concern to varying degrees, their expertise has driven them to
        underscore questions of cultural context and social function more prominently
        in the study of audiovisual media. In his history class for music majors,
        Mueller asks students to interpret how a range of historical contingencies
        influences the creation and performance of specific musical sounds. Here,
        <emph>Mediate</emph> is a prompt to redirect assumptions about music that
        students already think they "know." Bringing together questions of material
        form and cultural context, Armoskaite uses <emph>Mediate</emph> to spark
        students to delve into how language in advertising itself is audiovisual — or
        more precisely, how language has a social function in commercial media that
        turns on how it activates the interplay of hearing and seeing vis-à-vis
        linguistic and discursive content meant to induce an action in someone.</p>
        <div><head>Case Study 1: Material Form in Film and Media Studies
        (Burges)</head>
        <p>Questions of material form are central in the film and media studies classes
        I teach for the College of Arts, Sciences, and Engineering at the University
        of Rochester, including the two I discuss here: "The Poetics of Television"
        and "Introduction to Media Studies". In "The Poetics of Television", for
        example, we spend significant time studying the different ways in which the
        episode is a form of inscription that organizes the audiovisual experience
        of television in narratively open and closed ways. In "Introduction to Media
        Studies," we discuss television not only from this narrative perspective,
        but also from the perspective of television as a historically variable
        technology for transmitting sounds and images onto a screen that was, for many
        decades, primarily part of the TV set. These are both material to the form
        of television, with the latter especially providing the specific audiovisual
        means by which television mediates and materializes narrative, information,
        and advertising for its viewers. In my classes, the question of material
        form — of how a medium is a matter of form — is not reducible to solely inquiring
        into these means in order to secure that which is, to recall Clement Greenberg
        <ptr target="#greenberg1960"/>, irreducibly exclusive to it. It instead involves pursuing
        lines of inquiry with students in which we explore the specificity of a range
        of media — from television and film to poetry and song — through the shifting
        constellations of qualities constrained and enabled by diverse audiovisual
        means in the first place <ptr target="#doane2007"/>.</p>
        <p>Digital annotation in <emph>Mediate</emph> indelibly contributes to this
        pursuit, especially through the schemas that provide the basis of the highly
        collaborative — as we will show — marking that students do over the course of
        a semester in classes such as "The Poetics of Television" and "Introduction
        to Media Studies." The schemas we have designed so far try to capture the
        constellations of qualities that make up any medium one might annotate in
        <emph>Mediate</emph>. In "The Poetics of Television," the schemas were designed
        around aural, visual, and narrative qualities in order to show how sound,
        image, and story are respectively constructed on TV.</p>

        </figure>
        <p>The schemas for "Introduction to Media Studies," were designed with
        comparison in mind, so one focused on a set of markers for annotating poems
        read aloud by their authors, the other on a set of markers for annotating pop
        songs by individual singers and bands.</p>

          <graphic url="resources/images/figure11.png"/>
        </figure>
        <p>Over the course of a semester, students in these two classes worked
        collaboratively in groups of four to six people to annotate on the basis of
        the schema or schemas that group was assigned, building toward long papers in
        which they explored a wide range of topics through distant and close readings
        performed in writing and through visualizations. Regardless of the topic,
        these papers almost universally exhibited a deep knowledge of the material
        form of the audiovisual medium under study; the specific interplay of sight
        and sound embodied by TV, for instance, became "second nature" to one student,
        "so much so that when I watch TV now I automatically mark the episode in
        the back of my mind" <ptr target="#crumrine2016"/>. This is the result of what the
        students characterize as the "immersive" dimension of <emph>Mediate</emph>
        in which time spent marking, however "irritating" and "monotonous" and
        "tedious" in its slowness over the semester, generates a profound concept of
        the qualities that give material form to their audiovisual experience
        <ptr target="#allen2016"/>. This is most palpable when one looks more closely at final
        projects students completed, in which their collaborative efforts yielded
        a remarkable level of quantitative data and qualitative observation worth
        understanding in greater nuance.<note>We believe it is important not only to
        include these specifics, but also to attribute the papers to the students
        themselves. Moreover, as needed, we obtained permission from various students
        in the groups cited from "The Poetics of Television" and "Introduction to
        Media Studies" to share their work; in the latter, we conducted focus groups
        where students also signed off on us sharing their feedback and ideas.
        The comments from students in "Experiments at the Edges of 20th
        Century Music" and "Linguistics and Advertising," however, have remained
        anonymous since we had less of this infrastructure in place.</note></p>
        <p>In an essay for "The Poetics of Television" entitled "The Formal Nucleus
        of Television, and Its Subservience to Narrative" <ptr target="#allen2016"/>,
        the students argued that dialogue is a key element of the "formal nucleus"
        of TV by exploring the nexus of sound and story in four historically
        and generically variable series defined by open narration (<emph>Game of
        Thrones</emph>, <emph>Dark Shadows</emph>, <emph>Guiding Light</emph>, and
        <emph>Robotech</emph>). On the basis of hundreds of markers the students in
        this group annotated, they argue that dialogue is an elementally generative
        feature of the "aural design" of television that "advance[s] the narrative
        progression of an episode." This is due to dialogue allowing "all details
        pertinent to the comprehension of the narrative, in terms of both plot and
        character, to be enumerated in explicit, unequivocal, and economical terms."
        This group further contends that the television camera often obeys the human
        voice, suggesting that visual design flows from aural design, for instance, on
        the basis of the 54 on-offscreen and off-onscreen shifts of sound vis-à-vis the
        image and diegesis that the group marked in the infamous Red Wedding scene of
        <emph>Game of Thrones</emph> while annotating in the Aural Schema. While both
        the visible and the audible are subservient to narrative in the argument this
        group's paper makes, it nonetheless richly charts the interplay of sight and
        sound within storytelling on TV, revealing how that mediated interplay — that
        audiovisuality — lets narrative take material form on screen.</p>
        <p>"Introduction to Media Studies" similarly attuned students to material
        form. But rather than focusing on one audiovisual medium to achieve this end,
        as in "The Poetics of Television," I used a comparative approach in which I
        asked students to work in groups to annotate poetry and pop songs to which
        they listened closely and repeatedly in <emph>Mediate</emph>. Students were
        not allowed to pull print versions of the poems they were annotating on the
        basis of oral renditions by their authors, forcing them to use their ears to
        grasp the differences between poems and songs marked using schemas developed
        for each of these genres. What one group observed about those differences
        will sound obvious: while rhythmically structured and lineated language is the
        medium of poetry, pop songs are much more musical in their means, depending on
        instrumentation, chord progression, beat groupings and so on <ptr target="#colberg2019"/>.</p>
        <p>But what is less obvious is how the students in this group came to
        experience this difference because <emph>Mediate</emph> introduced annotation
        into audition. In annotating, they <emph>heard</emph> what was material
        to the form of poetry and pop songs as a fixed and motivated structure of
        aural notation. The songs went from being an internal experience of sound
        and music to appearing as an externalized — because now annotated — form of
        audiovisual inscription. Thus the long paper this group produced focused less
        on material form in favor of trying to pinpoint what constellation of audible
        qualities inscribe what they call "intensity." For this group, intensity
        refers to how "affective response" and "aesthetic emotion" in a mediated
        genre of sound turns upon medium-specific features, as in their LP record
        player-inspired visualizations of two songs, Troye Sivan's "Wild" and Taylor
        Swift's "This Love." Audiovisualities in their own right, these experimental
        data visualizations show how distinct kinds of vocal stress, chord changes,
        back-up singing, and instrumentation not only mark the form of these songs, but
        also form the possibility of having a musically "intense" reaction to them as
        well.</p>

        <p>In classes such as "The Poetics of Television" and "Introduction to Media
        Studies," digital annotation in <emph>Mediate</emph> enables students to
        work together to see and hear the material form of a range of audiovisual
        media. It is important that they are working together, collaborating to
        annotate such that both within and across their groups they are able to
        explore audiovisuality in a collective way that has both quantitative and
        qualitative effects. On the one hand, the quantitative dimension of their
        collaborative efforts is visible in the plenitude of markers that each group
        generates as a working collective, and in how they draw on the audiovisual
        data produced by other groups marking in the same class to understand the
        annotation that has occurred in a given group. On the other hand, the repeated
        marking required to yield thousands of data points they can share with one
        another engenders a quality of description and interpretation that shows how
        close they understand the material forms of film, television, poetry, and pop
        songs from multiple audiovisual angles of seeing and hearing. As we have more
        fully argued elsewhere <ptr target="#burges2016"/>, however, that "truth" depends
        upon the discussions that often emerge over how to collectively define and
        collaboratively mark a unit of analysis within and across groups as they
        annotate features of material form; these discussions over how to see and hear,
        though, only further shore up both that no medium is a natural given, and that
        every audiovisual experience is mediated.</p>
        </div>
        <div><head>Case Study 2: The Cultural Contexts of Music History
        (Mueller)</head>
        <p>Although connected institutionally, Eastman School of Music (ESM) is
        quite different from the rest of the university in terms of its student
        population, educational goals, and curriculum. All of ESM's approximately
        500 undergraduate students are music majors, with a primary focus on
        Western classical music.<note>At the undergraduate level, ESM also
        offers robust degree programs in jazz performance and jazz composition.
        Graduate degree tracks include music leadership, conducting, early music,
        film composition, opera, music theory, ethnomusicology, and musicology.</note>
        Our students are some of the best young
        musicians in the world, meaning that most view their classroom activities
        through the lens of their future careers in performance, composition, and
        pedagogy. To even gain admittance, they need to have remarkable expertise and
        years of specialized training in a tradition built around individual composers
        and master performers. So, while these students bring a strong passion for
        music into the classroom, doing academic work often forces them to confront
        viewpoints and approaches that are frequently taken as natural rather than
        culturally constructed.</p>
        <p>Most of the traditions represented at ESM are heavily reliant on musical
        notation, a highly advanced system of written symbols that has, over many
        centuries, enabled the development and circulation of music that originated in
        Western Europe. In many respects, the very presence of notation constitutes the
        tradition <ptr target="#taruskin2005"/>. Musical notation can also be understood as a form
        of audiovisual inscription that communicates specific information about both
        how to perform music and also how an individual piece functions melodically,
        harmonically, rhythmically, and formally <ptr target="#moseley2015"/>
        <ptr target="#rehding2017"/>
        <ptr target="#kittler1999"/>. Reading music, as we would say, is a presumed skill that
        students rely upon as they move through the robust series of classes in music
        theory and history, both of which differently emphasize score-based analysis of
        internal (within a piece) and external (within a tradition) musical features.
        As a result, students are very comfortable working with written music, as well
        as the specialized language used to describe it. Still, the culture surrounding
        classical music has calcified certain perspectives, especially on what it means
        to do analysis. For many students, music analysis is too often conceived of as
        an action solely in visual terms, rather than an act that takes place in a far
        more expanded audiovisual realm.</p>
        <p>In Fall 2019, I introduced <emph>Mediate</emph> into my "Experiments at
        the Edges of 20th Century Music," a required course within the undergraduate
        music history core. My goal was to foreground listening, rather than reading,
        as the primary means of analysis. As exceptional performers already, my
        students listen with an expertly attuned understanding of musical performance.
        But while they continually analyze music while listening, they do not always
        listen historically — that is, attend to how specific musical moments express
        historically contingent beliefs about culture, society, or the many processes
        of music making. There is no inherent problem with their modality of listening.
        However, it is not always congruous with my major pedagogical goal: to
        examine and interpret how music and its written tradition are both heavily
        mediated creations, dependent on historically situated actors with different
        investments and values. By asking students to pay attention differently,
        <emph>Mediate</emph> not only foregrounds listening but also asks students
        to translate that listening into specific observations represented visually.
        In effect, this reverses the standard audiovisual direction of music making.
        Rather than move from visual inscription (notation) to aural expression
        (performance), <emph>Mediate</emph> renders what is heard into specific visual
        markings of that performance. Unsettling the assumed relationships between
        the visual and the aural — by putting listening first — encourages alternative
        viewpoints to come into the forefront of the analytical process.</p>
        <p>Inspired by previous uses of <emph>Mediate</emph> in the classroom, I had
        students complete a semester-long collective analysis project. Our work began
        before I introduced the <emph>Mediate</emph> platform by continually asking
        students during class discussions and daily responses to listen through a
        series of five interrelated questions oriented towards cultural contexts:</p>
        <list type="ordered">
        <item><p>Who or what shaped this particular music or performance?</p></item>
        <item><p>What would it be like to perform this music?</p></item>
        <item><p>What are the musical materials used in the creation of this
        piece?</p></item>
        <item><p>How does this musical material transform?</p></item>
        <item><p>What do you think the creators were trying to say or accomplish
        with this music?<note>I adapted these questions from composer
        David Kirkland Garner (University of South Carolina).</note> </p></item>
        </list>
        <p>For their <emph>Mediate</emph> project, students organized into groups
        of two to four. Each student within those groups picked one or more of
        these questions and marked up their audio in <emph>Mediate</emph> from those
        perspectives. I developed specific markers for each question to aid in this
        process, but also encouraged students to develop others to meet their specific
        needs.</p>

        <p>As they listened, students would mark everything from the seemingly
        obvious — what they might otherwise notice without thinking — to those details
        obscured by the rapid unfolding of any time-based art. After creating several
        hundred markers, each group began to decipher their efforts and develop a
        thesis for their written analysis with the same five questions again providing
        a road map. The class went through this process in two different iterations.
        First, all groups analyzed the first movement of William Grant Still's Symphony
        No. 1. Then, each group picked a piece of music or specific performance from a
        given list of artists and composers.</p>

          <graphic url="resources/images/figure15.png"/>
        </figure>
        <p>Two general observations emerged out of the individual reflections written
        at the end of the semester. First, the slow, sometimes-tedious markup process
        requires active listening. Many students discussed how they came to notice
        subtle details and complexities precisely because the marking up process
        made "passive" or "casual" listening impossible. The intensity involved with
        repeated listening did not always change their initial opinions, but rather
        increased the precision and specificity of their observations. One student
        remarked with surprise about "how much could happen within one tiny second."
        Second, the processes of collective listening encouraged individuals to
        consider multiple vantage points. Collaboration through group work is not
        always smooth or easy, and it is sometimes unpopular. But by learning from
        or being challenged by their colleagues — perhaps even by becoming a "cultural
        context" in miniature — many students reported that the dialogic experience
        enabled them to make connections that were perhaps not obvious to them
        before.</p>
        <p>The written work of each group also proved how valuable doing analysis away
        from the score could be. Many groups wrote about meaningful moments that would
        have otherwise remained hidden by only looking at the written notation — the
        particular use of vibrato, the background noise in a recording, a reoccurring
        timbre, or the use of space or a particular texture in the orchestration.
        Through the analysis of seemingly discrete details in relation to the
        background of the composer or other cultural influences, students then found
        ways to relate what happens musically to what that performance might mean more
        broadly, which is to say historically. As one student commented, the analysis
        provided a way to understand how music functioned as an interconnected web of
        historical events, musical influences, and experiences of "real life people."
        In comparison with previous semesters, the written work of the students in this
        class was at once more precise and bolder in their conclusions.</p>
        <p>The slow and collective process of listening through <emph>Mediate</emph>
        allows students to re-situate their otherwise expert ears towards music as
        a form of audiovisual inscription. Music is a time-based art that exists in
        performance, yet it nevertheless remains heavily dependent on the visual realm.
        The specialized language used in traditional forms of analysis — a Neapolitan
        sixth chord, for one example — describes both what music sounds and looks like.
        As a digital platform that creates a method for analysis, <emph>Mediate</emph>
        makes the audiovisualities of music clear. Musical culture is and has always
        been an audiovisual culture as well, and new possibilities surface for students
        about this fact when they experience music through <emph>Mediate</emph>.</p>
        </div>
        <div><head>Case Study 3: <emph>Social Function in Linguistics
        (Armoskaite)</emph></head>
        <p>The Department of Linguistics in the College of Arts, Sciences, and
        Engineering at the University of Rochester, while a part of the social
        sciences, is a hub of interdisciplinary research with ties to other
        departments, including Music (with a focus on perception and production of
        sounds), Brain and Cognitive Science (with a focus on meaning and language
        processing), Anthropology (with focus on culture and language intersections),
        and Psychology (with a focus of child language acquisition). As a field,
        linguistics covers a vast number of topics and methodologies, hence it is
        impossible to provide a general description that would fit the range. For the
        purposes of this case study, it will suffice to state (i) that linguistics
        focuses on of the makeup of grammar, which is a set of sub-systems of sound,
        form and meaning; (ii) and that these subsystems are used for communication,
        a function that interacts with social conventions and societal values, a.o.
        <ptr target="#fasold2014"/>.</p>
        <p>My course "Language and Advertising," requires students to consider language
        use in the context of audiovisual marketing against the backdrop of current
        social trends. While Linguistics does not have a Business or Marketing track,
        the course routinely is taken by business majors and consistently is a popular
        elective among other non-Linguistics majors. I face a diverse group of students
        with different backgrounds, skills, and assumptions, though united by the
        three common denominators. First, the ubiquity of advertising in their lives
        gives them a false sense of familiarity and assumed knowledge of the medium;
        second, they want to learn the nuts and bolts of the advertising machine; and
        third, they possess limited knowledge of linguistics. Over the course of the
        semester, they learn that the social function of language in advertising is
        to manipulate, with commercial media, working to apply psychological pressure
        through a mode of audiovisuality that depends on influencing our emotions and
        circumventing our rational mind, a.o. <ptr target="#sedivy2011"/>
        <ptr target="#lewis2013"/>
        <ptr target="#poels2006"/>.</p>
        <p>Situating a familiar medium — advertising — within a likely unfamiliar
        field — linguistics — necessarily slows down the students. They learn to analyze
        the linguistic components that, to call back to the film and media studies
        case above, "make" the medium. The material form that interests a linguist,
        however, includes not only sounds and images of the kind that interest Burges
        and Mueller in their courses, but also the very structure of language as humans
        speak, read, and hear it. For example, each of the following
        posters can be deciphered in the linguistic terms of sound, form, and meaning,
        which shows that even print advertising functions as an audiovisual medium.</p>
        <p><ref
        target="https://www.redcrossblood.org/content/dam/redcrossblood/campaigns/missing-types/Missing%20Types%20Campaign%20Partner%20Style%20Guide.pdf">The
        American Red Cross "Missing Types" campaign (2018)</ref> presents a sound-based
        puzzle for the viewer to acoustically fill in, whether in silence or out
        loud: all the missing elements are vowels. The viewer goes in search of those
        vowels, enjoying a language game that depends on visual absence engendering
        audio presence. And because the vowels are associated with types of blood,
        this audiovisual play becomes a linguistic mechanism for soliciting blood
        donations.</p>
        <p><ref
        target="https://www.adsoftheworld.com/media/print/snickers_satisfectellent">The
        Snickers "Satisfectellent" (TBWA 2007)</ref> advertisement plays upon another
        element of grammar, namely, derivation of words. In this case, a word that is
        possible, but does not exist, is created. The novelty of the coined word is the
        striking — and strikingly audiovisual —  feature of the advertisement: the joy of
        recognition of the brand of the snack is fused with the unexpectedness of the
        word.</p>
        <p>Finally, the <ref
        target="https://www.adsoftheworld.com/media/print/greenpeace_straws_suck_gull">Greenpeace
        "Straws Suck: Gull" (Rethink 2018)</ref> advertisement exploits the shades of
        meaning of the verb "to suck." The painful visual is certainly not the first
        association we have about sucking through straws, which we may think about in
        sonic and/or tactile terms primarily. But the unexpected visual connotation is
        meant to shock us into changing our habits of consumption.</p>
        <p>However, language in print advertising engenders audiovisual experience in
        a far more static way than the advertising that flows across our many screens
        as moving images and dynamic sounds. The latter contains hundreds of speech
        patterns in addition to innumerable cues for our ears and eyes. Superimposed on
        moving images, these patterns and cues come at a viewer at a speed that barely
        allows them to register the component parts, let alone perform a thorough
        analysis. <emph>Mediate</emph> creates a space for such analysis external
        to the ephemerally immediate modes in which we normally consume commercial
        media. In so doing, it makes legible that language plays a constitutive part
        in the interplay of sight and hearing — that all three of these human abilities
        contribute to the social function of manipulation that is the raison d'etre of
        often brilliant acts of commodified audiovisuality that want us to buy or buy
        into something. <emph>Mediate</emph> gets students to treat the audiovisuality
        of advertising as a constellation of elements variously linguistic, optical,
        and aural — as an object of analysis.</p>
        <p>This takes time over the course of the semester. In "Language and
        Advertising" (Fall 2018 and Fall 2019), I spent three weeks teaching
        students the fundamentals of linguistics using similar examples to the print
        advertisements discussed above. Building on this print unit, we then turned
        to the challenge of analyzing commercials using <emph>Mediate</emph>. The
        students began by analyzing an ad without the use of <emph>Mediate</emph>. Then
        I modeled the slow and detailed analysis conducted through <emph>Mediate</emph>
        by providing them with samples of my own marked-up commercial. We discussed
        their observations, along with my own, which gently lets them understand how
        many details they've missed in their own observations. The students were then
        trained on the platform and introduced to the schema over two class sessions.
        After that initial introduction, the students took charge of their own learning
        with only a light editorial supervision.</p>
        <p>Circumventing the top-down didacticism of the traditional lecture,
        <emph>Mediate</emph> allowed the students to immerse themselves into the
        material on their own. Working in groups, they were tasked with selecting
        and analyzing at least two video ads, splitting up the work of marking
        (what we call "coding" in the field of linguistics) amongst themselves.
        Rather than a traditional linguistic analysis of a video ad that might
        include a transcription of the text divorced from the audio and visual cues,
        <emph>Mediate</emph> facilitated a holistic approach to the interplay and
        interdependencies of the audiovisualities commercial media employ.</p>
        <figure xml:id="figure16">
          <head>A sample of markers and observations generated using the Linguistics Schema on Cadillac's "The Future is Here" 60 second spot.</head>
          <graphic url="resources/images/figure16.png"/>
        </figure>
        <p>In slowing down their observations, they are forced to think about each
        element in the totality of the advertisement such that it emerges as a
        linguistic object of audiovisual analysis, with the manipulative properties
        of this object becoming ever clearer as its social function over the time they
        spend in <emph>Mediate</emph>. As one student noted, "there is no escape but
        to analyze." At the end of the semester, the groups presented their analyses
        of commercial media, with the entire class responding. This collective response
        included debates over how each group defined certain linguistic, audio, and
        visual units of analysis, and about the conclusions about manipulation in
        commercial media that each group reached. These discussions — aided by the
        carefully coded examples in <emph>Mediate</emph> — were paramount in helping
        students build an applied understanding of the social function of advertising
        from an audiovisual angle grounded in linguistics as an interdisciplinary
        field.</p>
        <p>Despite their engagement and increased capacity with audiovisual analysis
        through <emph>Mediate</emph>, there still is room for greater interdisciplinary
        collaboration in "Language and Advertising", especially in light of the
        cross-disciplinary sense of audiovisuality we are advancing in this article.
        In my course, I welcome film experts as occasional invited speakers. But
        through my discussions with Burges and Mueller, I have realized that more
        sophisticated ways of tuning into the linguistic, visual, and sonic patterns
        would offer further opportunities to explore the range and means of consumer
        manipulation. For example, thus far, I have left out musical aspects completely
        as I lack relevant training. In the future iterations of this course, I think
        about the potential for more nuanced analysis if I could harness Mueller's
        expertise in helping students define the auditory components, if Burges could
        work with students to delve further into the visual form — that is, if students
        benefitted not only from their collective defining through marking, but also
        the collective expertise of a more intentionally cross-disciplinary approach to
        teaching and research.</p>
        </div></div>
        <div><head>Audiovisualities out of Annotation</head>
        <p>Across our individual classes, we have seen our students more fully enter
        the study of audiovisual media as they are defined by material form, cultural
        context, and social function within our respective disciplinary frameworks.
        In sharing these experiences with one another across our disciplines, we have
        been reminded that, when it comes to the audiovisual field, a film and media
        studies scholar should sometimes see and hear that field <emph>like</emph>
        a music historian who should sometimes see and hear it <emph>like</emph> a
        linguist. In noticing that we should see and hear like each other more, even
        as we explored medium-specific matters with our students, we have arrived
        at the cross-disciplinary concept of audiovisualities. Pedagogically and
        intellectually segregated from another due to the division of labor that
        organizes the modern research university, this concept allows us to think
        about the interplay of sight and sound more promiscuously and productively,
        overcoming the binaries that too often divide the audible and the visual and
        the divides that splinter disciplines from one another institutionally. In
        working together the last few years on digital annotation, we have learned to
        think more comprehensively across our respective fields about the (re)mediated
        sites where the physical and cultural operations of audiovisual experience
        converge. It is these locations of convergence that construct not only sensory
        and social subjectivities grounded in seeing and hearing, but also material
        forms and collective technics that set the conditions of possibility to see and
        hear to begin with — in short, that construct a manifold of audiovisualities. Our
        work on <emph>Mediate</emph> has helped us to estrange, even to alienate, the
        "natural order" that has been imposed on our experience of that manifold, or
        what Michel Chion describes as the "audiovisual contract" <ptr target="#chion1994" loc="9"/>.</p>
        <p>As this gesture to Chion telegraphs, we are not the first group of scholars
        to explore such conditions. The cross-disciplinary concept of audiovisualities
        on which we have landed already has a genealogy of thinkers — many of them
        cited at the outset of this essay — associated with visual studies and sound
        studies, not to mention film and media studies, behind it. Indebted to them, we
        nonetheless think the practice of digital annotation that <emph>Mediate</emph>
        provides contributes a collaborative model of learning through collective
        reading that allows our students to conceptualize audiovisualities beyond
        their individual selves (and our individual disciplines). It may do this, as
        well, for any scholars that take it up, especially, if not only in a collective
        and collaborative form. The collectivity of digital annotation can take that
        which feels intuitive and internal and remake it as unfamiliar and external;
        the collective act of exteriorizing that occurs in <emph>Mediate</emph> brings
        a new awareness to the qualities and characteristics of a given audiovisual
        medium.</p>
        <p>"History is nothing but exteriorities," writes Jonathan Sterne in <emph>The
        Audible Past,</emph> by which he means that we can only know the "sonic
        world" of the past through its "efforts, expressions, and reactions" <ptr target="#sterne2003"/>.
        <emph>Mediate</emph> embraces this point of view. Digital annotation
        in <emph>Mediate</emph> asks students to exteriorize their reactions to
        audiovisual media not only by slowing down their consumption of them, but
        also by turning what feels subjectively intuitive, immediate, and internal
        (listening to and even playing music, taking in a poem, consuming an
        advertisement, watching a TV show) into a mediated object to be analyzed
        collaboratively and collectively beyond oneself. Vivid examples of this
        process of exteriorizing abound in our case studies. In "Experiments at the
        Edges of 20th Century Music," students produce digital "notations,"
        so to speak, through their use of <emph>Mediate</emph>, thus resituating
        the ocularcentric primacy of musical notation through careful listening
        and historicizing. Similarly, in "Language and Advertising," the interface
        renders commercials a constellation of elements that act on us linguistically,
        visually, and musically in ways students can tangibly analyze. And the
        experimental visualizations of two pop songs for "Introduction to Media
        Studies" draw on data produced collectively through digital annotation about
        the aural experience of intensity to visually represent the material form of
        that intensity.</p>
        <p><emph>Mediate</emph> therefore enables a defamiliarized perception of
        audiovisialities, first and foremost, by challenging the consumption of
        media as an individual and discrete act atomized from others. The work
        of collaborative annotation, which sets <emph>Mediate</emph> apart from
        platforms such as ELAN and NVivo, reveals not only the potential for different
        experiences of the same mediums, but that the criteria through which we name
        and identify media — and indeed, our respective disciplines — can, and perhaps
        should, be subject to the scrutiny made possible by collective re-examination.
        Our respective fields are built upon often now unspoken agreements about what
        constitutes film or poetry or music or television or advertising or language.
        <emph>Mediate</emph> shows how "agreeing to disagree" on a given medium's
        properties remains a necessary move within and across disciplines, especially
        if we are to take into account critiques of both collaboration and computation
        leveled at the digital humanities. The reverse of the earlier claim, in other
        words, is also true. Our students often debate what a unit analysis means when
        marking, mobilizing the differences amongst themselves in collaborating on
        digital annotation. Similarly, when it comes to the cross-disciplinary concept
        of audiovisualities, a film and media studies scholar should see and hear the
        interplay of sight <emph>unlike</emph> a music historian who should sometimes
        see and hear it <emph>unlike</emph> a linguist as much as we should see and
        hear it <emph>like</emph> each other.</p>
        <p>The case studies recounted in this article reflect this collaborative
        process of disagreement — the self-aware reflection upon "units of analysis" — as
        a pedagogically necessary exercise in understanding the audiovisual world
        we inhabit in the present. However, such a practice is not limited to the
        undergraduate classroom alone. The collaborative nature of digital annotation
        breaks down a process that scholars, at all levels, often take for granted:
        the terms and tools through which we analyze media, especially within
        our respective fields. By making us be both like and unlike each other,
        <emph>Mediate</emph> has allowed us to take hold of those terms and tools anew,
        discovering audiovisualities out of annotation as a concept that unsettles
        what we do with the interplay of sight and sound inscribed everywhere into
        experience at present.</p>
