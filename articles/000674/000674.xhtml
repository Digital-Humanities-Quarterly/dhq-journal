                     university history department, this paper analyzes two history harvest events 
                     undertaken in a split-level digital history course. By examining the results of 
                     two local History Harvests, specifically through participation of the greater 
                     community, outside the university, and the preservation and digitization of the 
                     local historical items, we discuss the impact history harvests can have on a 
                     community, as well as history students. The primary goal of both History 
                     Harvests outlined in this paper was to work with the local community 
                     surrounding the university to preserve pieces of local history. This article 
                     provides guidelines for conducting a History Harvest including suggestions for 
                     community outreach, local university involvement with the greater community, and
                     digitizing issues that might occur while conducting the Harvest.</p>

                  <div class="ptext" id="p1">As a component of regional education, a central mission of regional universities
                     is to connect with the greater community surrounding the institution. As a potential
                     
                     member of the future workforce of a community, it is likewise important to provide
                     
                     opportunities for students to engage with people outside the university in meaningful
                     
                     and impactful ways to facilitate the creation of enduring relationships. Community
                     
                     engaged learning is a useful method for introducing and fostering these connections
                     
                     between students and the greater community. One way to accomplish this 
                     student-community engagement is to involve the community in the production of their
                     
                     own history through the organization of a History Harvest event. In a History 
                     Harvest, members of the local community are invited to bring their artifacts and 
                     family histories together in one place for the purpose of creating a historical 
                     collection. Usually organized around a particular theme, Harvest materials are 
                     typically arranged to create a digital repository documenting the community history
                     
                     based on the theme.</div>

                     at East Tennessee State University (ETSU) [<a class="ref" href="#etsu2022b">ETSU 2022b</a>], a mid-size regional university located 
                     in northeast Tennessee that has been serving communities throughout Western North
                     
                     Carolina, Southwest Virginia, and East Tennessee for over a century (“Department 
                     of History” 2022). Approaching this topic through the lens of digital history and
                     
                     community archiving, this paper offers a case study for engaging undergraduate and
                     
                     graduate students in the practice of digital history and community outreach while
                     offering the local community the opportunity to participate in the creation of 
                     their history using History Harvest events. The final goals for the History Harvest
                     
                     projects are to share the results with the local community by creating a digital 
                     repository which will allow the community as well as scholars to make use of 
                     materials collected through the harvests. Some of the items mentioned in this 
                     study are also scheduled to be on display in the museum at East Tennessee State 
                     University. The long-term goal of this paper is that this case study will provide
                     
                     helpful guidelines to others wishing to involve their community and local 
                     universities in preserving their own history and reveal issues that might occur 
                     while conducting a Harvest.</div>

                  <div class="ptext" id="p3">The History Harvest movement began in 2010 to serve as an open-access, 
                     community-based project. The movement was created by William Thomas and Patrick 
                     Jones in the Department of History at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln. The 
                     goal of a History Harvest, according to its founders, is to “create a new model 
                     of undergraduate learning in the humanities that is team-oriented, student-led, 
                     community-based and integrated through digital technologies” and to “democratize 
                     history by creating public conversation about the materials of history and their 
                     meaning, as well as through the creation of an online public archive, which makes
                     
                     available new material — the artifacts of everyday life — for historical study” 
                     (Thomas and Jones 2013, 327). As such, a History Harvest can serve as a way for 
                     undergraduate and graduate history students to put the practice of history into 
                     action, as well as connect with the greater community. From a pedagogical 
                     standpoint, a History Harvest, according to their webpage, can serve as
                     “an innovative new authentic learning initiative. The collaborative, 
                     team-oriented, student-centered and community-based project seeks to 
                     create a popular movement to democratize and open American history by 
                     utilizing digital technologies to share the experiences and artifacts 
                     of everyday people and local historical institutions” (“The History Harvest” 2022).</div>
                  
                  
                  <div class="counter"><a href="#p4">4</a></div>
                  <div class="ptext" id="p4">The “Harvest” means just that. The concept is that a team of public historians go
                     
                     out into the community and invite members of that community to bring artifacts they
                     wish to share with the greater community. Community members are also invited to share
                     their knowledge and experience with the artifacts that they wish to have shared onto
                     the open-source website where the digital archive of the community collection will
                     
                     in turn serve as an open source for the purpose of public education. Although the
                     
                     movement began in the Great Plains region, the goal of the creators of the History
                     
                     Harvest movement is that the movement would spread across the US, allowing for a 
                     national digital archive (“The History Harvest” 2022). The digital collections 
                     contained on the History Harvest Project website serve as a repository for educators
                     
                     to use in their classrooms as well as a community archive containing the collective
                     
                     memories of local people.  </div>

                  <div class="ptext" id="p5"> Defining a community can be a daunting task. The variables are many and membership
                     often crosses the traditional markers such as ethnicity, race, gender, religion, a
                     nd geography, to include social justice issues. Community, for the purpose of this
                     case study, is defined by geographic location and includes life-long residents and
                     local business owners within Johnson City, as well as those living nearby in the 
                     Appalachian Highland region. Conducting a History Harvest allows for the introduction
                     of new members into an existent community, in this instance, university students 
                     who may be living in the area just for the duration of their studies, planning to
                     
                     remain within the area after graduation, or are already life-long members of the 
                     community. As Richard Cox (2009, 251) writes, “Community is seen by many to be an
                     
                     asset; to not belong to a community is a problem, a detriment to living out life 
                     to its fullest. The point here is that being part of some sort of community is 
                     deemed to be a normal part of humanity, and it is seen as an essential objective 
                     if one seems disconnected from a community.” Whether the members of the community
                     
                     are temporary or life-long, connection and investment in the community are the 
                     essential factors, no matter the duration of membership.</div>
                  
                  
                  <div class="counter"><a href="#p6">6</a></div>
                  <div class="ptext" id="p6">The term community archive, likewise, is difficult to discern and is often used 
                     interchangeably with terms like “local history group, oral history project, 
                     community history project, and community memory project” (Flinn 2008, 152). Other
                     
                     scholars, when defining community archives emphasize, “the community or group’s 
                     own self-definition and self-identification by locality, ethnicity, faith, 
                     sexuality, occupation, ideology, shared interest or any combination of the above”
                     (Flinn and Stevens, 2009, 5). Community archives are deliberate and careful in 
                     their placement and role within an area or region and even their presence within a
                     community suggests their social importance. For archival activists like Michelle 
                     Caswell, Marika Cifor, and Mario H. Ramirez (2016, 61), community archives formed
                     
                     as “alternatives to mainstream repositories through which communities can make 
                     collective decisions about what is of enduring value to them, shape collective 
                     memory of their own pasts, and control the means through which stories of their 
                     past are constructed.” Jeanette Bastian (2003, 5) claims, the archives of a 
                     community are often a mirror of that society and are therefore “evidence of the 
                     actions and transactions of the individuals within the community but also define 
                     the public consciousness of the community itself.”</div>

                  <div class="ptext" id="p7">As a primary component of the two History Harvests discussed in this paper, the 
                     goal was to connect history students to the greater Johnson City community 
                     through the process of digital history and community archiving to promote enduring
                     connections while documenting the history of the area. The Harvest purpose here 
                     is closely related to Rebecka Sheffield’s (2017, 351) point that, “Community 
                     archives grow out of the desire to collect documentary heritage that reflects our
                     
                     common identities, experiences, and interests.” As such, students gain a valuable
                     
                     learning experience which offers them knowledge about the practical aspects of 
                     conducting public history, history of the region, the value of history to the 
                     greater community, and the importance of members of the community giving voice to
                     
                     its own history.</div>

                  <div class="ptext" id="p8">The main purpose of a History Harvest is to preserve local historical items for future
                     
                     generations. The second purpose includes community outreach and community-based 
                     education. Thirdly, History Harvests can support and implement education initiatives
                     
                     for students and educators at all levels of learning. Finally, a History Harvest 
                     can help a local community connect to the larger American historical experience 
                     and explore those connections through the sharing of memory and preservation of 
                     history. Ultimately, a History Harvest allows individuals to create and preserve 
                     their community history. Faye Sayer (2019, 114), defines community history as “the
                     engagement of a community, usually geographically determined, with their local 
                     history.” History Harvests encourage communities to participate in the sharing of
                     
                     not only individual history but also the combination of the individual and the 
                     local community history to form a more complete historical record.</div>

                  <div class="ptext" id="p9">The History Harvest projects discussed here centered on two different themes, but
                     
                     with the same goal in mind. The overall purpose and scope of the Harvests was to 
                     get students and the local community involved in collecting and preserving local 
                     history. The first History Harvest, held in Spring 2017, was a component of an 
                     Instructional Development Grant awarded to members of the History department at 
                     East Tennessee State University. This Instructional Development Grant is a grant 
                     is meant to promote and support innovative teaching projects. The History Harvest
                     
                     project in Spring 2017 consisted of two components, a Digital History Course, and
                     
                     a History Harvest. The Digital History course, which ran in the Fall semester of 
                     2016, offered a hands-on approach to history meant to introduce students to the 
                     use of digital tools and sources for the purpose of conducting original historical
                     
                     research, analyzing and interpreting findings, and communicating results.</div>

                     Heritage.” The students from the Fall 2016 Digital history course were invited 
                     back to volunteer at the History Harvest by providing the skills and knowledge 
                     they learned about collection and digitization of historical items and documents.
                     
                     The second History Harvest in Spring 2019 was part of a larger project in collaboration
                     
                     with the city of Johnson City and East Tennessee State University to commemorate 
                     Johnson City’s Sesquicentennial celebration of the founding of the city (“Johnson

                     2017 Harvest was held in the document room of the Sherrod Library at East Tennessee
                     
                     State University, which offered wide tables where items could be adequately examined,
                     photographed, and cataloged (“Libraries Home-Sherrod Library” 2022). The room was
                     set 
                     up to handle approximately 3 to 4 contributors at one time, which helped with wait

                     photography, scanning, and oral history intake. The forms, including consent and 
                     deed of gift, were provided for the contributors as they moved through the stations.

                  <div class="ptext" id="p14">The 2017 History Harvest was supported by an instructional development grant through
                     
                     East Tennessee State University, which allowed for purchasing of equipment that was
                     
                     not readily available at the institution. Although the institution provided most of
                     
                     the needs for the Harvest other challenges arose during the process including issues
                     
                     dealing with the logistics, greater community, technical and operational issues. The
                     
                     largest issue for this Harvest was the timing of contributors arriving at the staging
                     
                     area. The contributors were scheduled for morning or afternoon appointments but on
                     the
                     day of the Harvest, most of the contributors arrived in the morning session, even
                     though 
                     they had confirmed an afternoon time slot with the director. The result of this issue
                     
                     was the contributors had to wait in line at the sign-in and intake stations and therefore
                     put more strain on the workflow at the other stations. This problem could have been
                     avoided 
                     if some face-to-face appointments, including confirmation of arrival time, were made
                     
                     with the contributors prior to the start of the Harvest.</div>
                  
                  
                  <div class="counter"><a href="#p15">15</a></div>
                  <div class="ptext" id="p15">The 2019 History Harvest did not have the scheduling issues of the previous Harvest,
                     
                     but did experience issues related to production and workflow stemming from lack of
                     
                     proper equipment. The public library was the venue for this Harvest as well as providing
                     most equipment needed to scan and digitize the items brought in by contributors. The
                     
                     library provided two flatbed scanners to use for the digitization of documents. Unfortunately
                     , the equipment was not up to date enough nor quick enough to offer efficient workflow.
                     This issue, as with the first Harvest, caused a backup of intake and processing stations,
                     which led to the contributors waiting to get their items scanned and examined. Most
                     of 
                     these issues could be resolved if the Harvests were done more traditionally. Most
                     History 
                     Harvests do not digitize the items contributors bring to the harvest at the time of
                     
                     collection. The items are dropped off/collected, or donated, (donation can sometimes
                     
                     be a requirement) then the digitization process takes place later in a more controlled
                     
                     environment. The advantage this Harvest had that the 2017 Harvest did not have was
                     
                     the availability of two professional archivists from the public library to help scan
                     
                     and evaluate the items brought in by the contributors. The addition of the archivist
                     
                     freed up the director to manage other issues if they arose during the Harvest.</div>

                     materials, uploading/saving files, preservation techniques, organizational and technical
                     
                     skills. The students that came back and volunteered to work at the first Harvest 
                     gained experience with community outreach and collaboration with local businesses
                     in the community. They also were able to apply the technical skills they learned 
                     in the digital history course while learning organizational skills pertaining to 
                     public history and archival studies. The Harvests themselves brought together people
                     
                     of the local community, which extended to neighboring states. The first Harvest 
                     contributors came from neighboring states of Tennessee to share their experiences
                     of growing and selling tobacco, like Western North Carolina and Southwest Virginia.
                     
                     This allowed the contributors to interact with new people and some they had not 
                     seen in years because they were brought together by their love of tobacco.</div>

                  <div class="ptext" id="p17">The goal of the second Harvest was to bring together the local community 
                     surrounding the university to collect items pertaining to the city’s 150th 
                     anniversary. Community outreach was the most important skill learned from 
                     this Harvest. The contributors were residents of the city, and some had a 
                     connection with the university. But the connection between the contributors 
                     was not seen in this Harvest like it was for the first Harvest. The contributors 
                     brought mostly family related items that in some way connected to the city. 
                     But other relationships were formed between the community and the university, 
                     as well as between university departments. Through the outreach process of the 
                     Harvest, businesses in the community contacted the director of the Harvest to 
                     see if the university would be interested in not only digitizing the material 
                     they had, but also wanted to form a collection in the university’s archive. 
                     The university archive, Archives of Appalachia, acquired a large collection 
                     of photos from the local electric company that had been taking pictures of 
                     sites they had worked on since the early 1900s. Internal university departments 
                     also forged new cooperative relationships. The history department reconnected 
                     with the archives and the museum on campus to work together on the second Harvest
                     
                     which resulted in more collaboration and new exciting ways the departments could 
                     create other collaborative events.</div>

                  <div class="ptext" id="p18">It is the hope of everyone involved in these projects that harvests and the 
                     engagement of students with the Digital History course can continue with help 
                     of the university and the local community. Future plans for the material 
                     collected in the 2017 and 2019 include displays in the Reece Museum, located 
                     on the East Tennessee State University campus, as well as a possible traveling 
                     exhibit. There are also plans to create an online exhibit so students can have 
                     access to the materials as examples for future collections plus allow the local 
                     community to enjoy the collections. Making the Harvest materials readily 
                     available to the public as an open-source platform is also a primary tenant 
                     of the conducting a History Harvest we wish to honor. The cases presented in 
                     this discussion were a unique experience in collecting and preserving local 
                     history. Although both cases had their own successes and complications, they 
                     both provided a connection between the university and the local community that 
                     will continue to grow into the future and hopefully be a shining example of 
                     community outreach and collaboration.

                  <div class="ptext" id="p19">Conducting a History Harvest combines elements of community archiving and the 
                     practice of digital history, creating a powerful dialog for future generations 
                     to build upon. As a component of pedagogy and best practices, the relationship
                     generated between university students and members of the greater community 
                     facilitate community engagement and community-based learning experiences. 
                     In addition, the type of community-based learning a History Harvest creates 
                     gives students the opportunity to practice history. Since students at the 
                     Harvest are responsible for gathering memorabilia and hearing stories from 
                     members of the community as they share their heirlooms, the sharing of 
                     authority, according to Fien Danniau (2013, 122), allows discourse between 
                     historians and “the experiences and interpretations of the public.” The 
                     practice of digital history, when intertwined with tenets of community 
                     archiving offers “ways for communities to make shared, autonomous decisions 
                     about what holds enduring values, shape collective memory of their own pasts 
                     and control the means through which stories about their past are constructed”
