                <p>As a case study for the practice and application of digital history in a mid-size 
                    university history department, this paper analyzes two history harvest events 
                    undertaken in a split-level digital history course. By examining the results of 
                    two local History Harvests, specifically through participation of the greater 
                    community, outside the university, and the preservation and digitization of the 
                    local historical items, we discuss the impact history harvests can have on a 
                    community, as well as history students. The primary goal of both History 
                    Harvests outlined in this paper was to work with the local community 
                    surrounding the university to preserve pieces of local history. This article 
                    provides guidelines for conducting a History Harvest including suggestions for 
                    community outreach, local university involvement with the greater community, and
                    digitizing issues that might occur while conducting the Harvest.</p>

                    <p>As a component of regional education, a central mission of regional universities
                        is to connect with the greater community surrounding the institution. As a potential 
                        member of the future workforce of a community, it is likewise important to provide 
                        opportunities for students to engage with people outside the university in meaningful 
                        and impactful ways to facilitate the creation of enduring relationships. Community 
                        engaged learning is a useful method for introducing and fostering these connections 
                        between students and the greater community. One way to accomplish this 
                        student-community engagement is to involve the community in the production of their 
                        own history through the organization of a History Harvest event. In a History 
                        Harvest, members of the local community are invited to bring their artifacts and 
                        family histories together in one place for the purpose of creating a historical 
                        collection. Usually organized around a particular theme, Harvest materials are 
                        typically arranged to create a digital repository documenting the community history 
                        based on the theme. 
                        This paper explores two History Harvest events hosted by the Department of History 
                        at East Tennessee State University (ETSU), a mid-size regional university located 
                        in northeast Tennessee that has been serving communities throughout Western North 
                        Carolina, Southwest Virginia, and East Tennessee for over a century (“Department 
                        of History” 2022). Approaching this topic through the lens of digital history and 
                        community archiving, this paper offers a case study for engaging undergraduate and 
                        graduate students in the practice of digital history and community outreach while
                        offering the local community the opportunity to participate in the creation of 
                        their history using History Harvest events. The final goals for the History Harvest 
                        projects are to share the results with the local community by creating a digital 
                        repository which will allow the community as well as scholars to make use of 
                        materials collected through the harvests. Some of the items mentioned in this 
                        study are also scheduled to be on display in the museum at East Tennessee State 
                        University. The long-term goal of this paper is that this case study will provide 
                        helpful guidelines to others wishing to involve their community and local 
                        universities in preserving their own history and reveal issues that might occur 
                        while conducting a Harvest. 
                        
                        Defining a History Harvest
                        The History Harvest movement began in 2010 to serve as an open-access, 
                        community-based project. The movement was created by William Thomas and Patrick 
                        Jones in the Department of History at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln. The 
                        goal of a History Harvest, according to its founders, is to “create a new model of undergraduate learning in the humanities that is team-oriented, student-led, community-based and integrated through digital technologies” and to “democratize history by creating public conversation about the materials of history and their meaning, as well as through the creation of an online public archive, which makes available new material-the artifacts of everyday life-for historical study” (Thomas and Jones 2013, 327). As such, a History Harvest can serve as a way for undergraduate and graduate history students to put the practice of history into action, as well as connect with the greater community. From a pedagogical standpoint, a History Harvest, according to their webpage, can serve as “an innovative new authentic learning initiative. The collaborative, team-oriented, student-centered and community-based project seeks to create a popular movement to democratize and open American history by utilizing digital technologies to share the experiences and artifacts of everyday people and local historical institutions” (“The History Harvest” 2022).
                        The “Harvest” means just that. The concept is that a team of public historians go 
                        out into the community and invite members of that community to bring artifacts they
                        wish to share with the greater community. Community members are also invited to share
                        their knowledge and experience with the artifacts that they wish to have shared onto
                        the open-source website where the digital archive of the community collection will 
                        in turn serve as an open source for the purpose of public education. Although the 
                        movement began in the Great Plains region, the goal of the creators of the History 
                        Harvest movement is that the movement would spread across the US, allowing for a 
                        national digital archive (“The History Harvest” 2022). The digital collections 
                        contained on the History Harvest Project website serve as a repository for educators 
                        to use in their classrooms as well as a community archive containing the collective 
                        memories of local people.  
                        
                        Community Archiving
                        Defining a community can be a daunting task. The variables are many and membership
                        often crosses the traditional markers such as ethnicity, race, gender, religion, a
                        nd geography, to include social justice issues. Community, for the purpose of this
                        case study, is defined by geographic location and includes life-long residents and
                        local business owners within Johnson City, as well as those living nearby in the 
                        Appalachian Highland region. Conducting a History Harvest allows for the introduction
                        of new members into an existent community, in this instance, university students 
                        who may be living in the area just for the duration of their studies, planning to 
                        remain within the area after graduation, or are already life-long members of the 
                        community. As Richard Cox (2009, 251) writes, “Community is seen by many to be an 
                        asset; to not belong to a community is a problem, a detriment to living out life 
                        to its fullest. The point here is that being part of some sort of community is 
                        deemed to be a normal part of humanity, and it is seen as an essential objective 
                        if one seems disconnected from a community.” Whether the members of the community 
                        are temporary or life-long, connection and investment in the community are the 
                        essential factors, no matter the duration of membership. 
                        The term community archive, likewise, is difficult to discern and is often used 
                        interchangeably with terms like “local history group, oral history project, 
                        community history project, and community memory project” (Flinn 2008, 152). Other 
                        scholars, when defining community archives emphasize, “the community or group’s 
                        own self-definition and self-identification by locality, ethnicity, faith, 
                        sexuality, occupation, ideology, shared interest or any combination of the above”
                        (Flinn and Stevens, 2009, 5). Community archives are deliberate and careful in 
                        their placement and role within an area or region and even their presence within a
                        community suggests their social importance. For archival activists like Michelle 
                        Caswell, Marika Cifor, and Mario H. Ramirez (2016, 61), community archives formed 
                        as “alternatives to mainstream repositories through which communities can make 
                        collective decisions about what is of enduring value to them, shape collective 
                        memory of their own pasts, and control the means through which stories of their 
                        past are constructed.” Jeanette Bastian (2003, 5) claims, the archives of a 
                        community are often a mirror of that society and are therefore “evidence of the 
                        actions and transactions of the individuals within the community but also define 
                        the public consciousness of the community itself.” 
                        As a primary component of the two History Harvests discussed in this paper, the 
                        goal was to connect history students to the greater Johnson City community 
                        through the process of digital history and community archiving to promote enduring
                        connections while documenting the history of the area. The Harvest purpose here 
                        is closely related to Rebecka Sheffield’s (2017, 351) point that, “Community 
                        archives grow out of the desire to collect documentary heritage that reflects our 
                        common identities, experiences, and interests.” As such, students gain a valuable 
                        learning experience which offers them knowledge about the practical aspects of 
                        conducting public history, history of the region, the value of history to the 
                        greater community, and the importance of members of the community giving voice to 
                        its own history.
                        
                        Purpose of History Harvest
                        The main purpose of a History Harvest is to preserve local historical items for future 
                        generations. The second purpose includes community outreach and community-based 
                        education. Thirdly, History Harvests can support and implement education initiatives 
                        for students and educators at all levels of learning. Finally, a History Harvest 
                        can help a local community connect to the larger American historical experience 
                        and explore those connections through the sharing of memory and preservation of 
                        history. Ultimately, a History Harvest allows individuals to create and preserve 
                        their community history. Faye Sayer (2019, 114), defines community history as “the
                        engagement of a community, usually geographically determined, with their local 
                        history.” History Harvests encourage communities to participate in the sharing of 
                        not only individual history but also the combination of the individual and the 
                        local community history to form a more complete historical record.
                        
                        The History Harvest Project Scope
                        The History Harvest projects discussed here centered on two different themes, but 
                        with the same goal in mind. The overall purpose and scope of the Harvests was to 
                        get students and the local community involved in collecting and preserving local 
                        history. The first History Harvest, held in Spring 2017, was a component of an 
                        Instructional Development Grant awarded to members of the History department at 
                        East Tennessee State University. This Instructional Development Grant is a grant 
                        is meant to promote and support innovative teaching projects. The History Harvest 
                        project in Spring 2017 consisted of two components, a Digital History Course, and 
                        a History Harvest. The Digital History course, which ran in the Fall semester of 
                        2016, offered a hands-on approach to history meant to introduce students to the 
                        use of digital tools and sources for the purpose of conducting original historical 
                        research, analyzing and interpreting findings, and communicating results. 
                        The theme of the Spring 2017 Harvest was “Preserving Southern Appalachia’s Tobacco
                        Heritage.” The students from the Fall 2016 Digital history course were invited 
                        back to volunteer at the History Harvest by providing the skills and knowledge 
                        they learned about collection and digitization of historical items and documents. 
                        The second History Harvest in Spring 2019 was part of a larger project in collaboration 
                        with the city of Johnson City and East Tennessee State University to commemorate 
                        Johnson City’s Sesquicentennial celebration of the founding of the city (“Johnson 
                        City Public Library-Home” 2022). The Spring 2019 Harvest’s theme was “Johnson 
                        City: Preserving Our Heritage.”
                        The items collected from the 2017 and 2019 History Harvests consisted of documents,
                        artifacts, pictures, and oral histories. After participants signed a consent form,
                        the items were scanned or photographed then returned to the contributors with a 
                        digital copy of each item. Some items were donated to the Reece Museum (“Reece 
                        Museum” 2022) and the Archives of Appalachia (“Archives of Appalachia” 2022), 
                        located on the campus of East Tennessee State University. The oral histories were 
                        recorded by a History Department faculty member, who followed up with the 
                        contributors to finalize the oral histories and submit them to the Archives of 
                        Appalachia for long-term preservation.  
                        
                        Harvesting and Preserving History in Practice
                        A portion of the grant for the 2017 Harvest provided necessary equipment for the digital preservation of items brought to the History Harvest including a Canon digital camera complete with extra lenses, tripod, and storage case. The other items include two external hard drives to store the digital material and a bundle of USB drives used to store contributors' contributions digitally. Each contributor received a USB drive containing a digital image of the items they brought to the Harvest. The 2017 Harvest was held in the document room of the Sherrod Library at East Tennessee State University, which offered wide tables where items could be adequately examined, photographed, and cataloged (“Libraries Home-Sherrod Library” 2022). The room was set up to handle approximately 3 to 4 contributors at one time, which helped with wait time as well as flow to the other stations. The stations consisted of sign in, intake, photography, scanning, and oral history intake. The forms, including consent and deed of gift, were provided for the contributors as they moved through the stations. The director of both History Harvests invited students, faculty and volunteers to a training session which included training on the scanners, cameras, and other equipment needed to provide the digital preservation of items brought to the harvests. The labor for the 2017 harvest was provided by the undergraduate and graduate students that had taken the Digital History course during the previous semester as well as volunteers and faculty from the history department.  
                        The 2019 Harvest workload was supported by graduate students, faculty, and library staff. The 2019 Harvest was held at the Johnson City Public library. The library provided a location for the Harvest as well as archivists to help evaluate and scan the items brought to the event. The library also provided two flatbed scanners and laptops for the harvest. The organization and set up of the 2019 Harvest were similar to the 2017 Harvest except for an extra station designated for the Reece Museum at East Tennessee State University. The museum director was present to evaluate the items that contributors requested to be donated.
