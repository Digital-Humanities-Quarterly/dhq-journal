            <!--Include a brief abstract of the article-->
            <p>This article explores the impact that a series of Archives Unleashed datathon events
               have had on community engagement both within the web archiving field, and more
               specifically, on the professional practices of attendees. We present results from
               surveyed datathon participants, in addition to related evidence from our events, to
               discuss how our participants saw the datathons as dramatically impacting both their
               professional practices as well as the broader web archiving community. Drawing on and
               adapting two leading community engagement models, we combine them to introduce a new
               understanding of how to build and engage users in an open-source digital humanities
               project. Our model illustrates both the activities undertaken by our project as well
               as the related impact they have on the field. The model can be broadly applied to
               other digital humanities projects seeking to engage their communities.</p>

         <p><quote rend="inline">If you build it, they will come.</quote> Unfortunately, this does
            not apply when developing digital humanities tools and infrastructure. Creating an
            open-source tool and fostering a user community around it requires concerted efforts in
            the realm of community engagement and outreach. It means building a community, which
            involves scoping, involvement, and ongoing engagement. To support our web archive
            analysis tools, our project team has run a series of <title rend="quotes">Archives
               Unleashed</title> datathons, to help engage users not only just with our tools, but
            with each other in an attempt to build a sustainable web archiving analysis community. </p>
         <p>This article explores the impact that our series of datathon events have had on
            community engagement both within the web archiving field, and more specifically, on the
            professional practices of attendees. To do so, we draw on and adapt two leading
            community engagement models, combining them to introduce our new understanding of how to
            build and engage users in an open-source digital humanities project. Our model
            illustrates both the activities undertaken by our project, as well as the related impact
            they have on the field and can be broadly applied to other digital humanities projects
            seeking to engage their communities. Ultimately, the six-stage community engagement
            model emphasizes scoping, informing, consulting, involving, collaborating, and
            empowering, in an iterative cycle where one can work to continually expand one’s
            community.</p>
         <p>We wanted to explore the following questions: how has our community been built? What
            activities and approaches at these events had the most impact, and which ones could be
            improved? What have been the lasting impacts of community engagement? And, finally, what
            are the broader and long-term impacts of creating a community within the web archiving
            community? These would be critical for both our project but also for others within the
            broader digital humanities and library communities interested in similar issues around
            community building and engagement.</p>
         <p>Our specific focus is on our datathons, which were modeled on the broader
               <q>hackathon</q> movement. Hackathons emerged in the early 2000s, primarily at first
            to rapidly develop new computer software <ptr target="#briscoe2014"/>. The term itself
            combines the terms <q>hacking</q> and <q>marathon,</q> implying an <quote rend="inline"
               >intense, uninterrupted period of programming</quote>
            <ptr target="#komssi2015"/>. Over two decades, hackathons have grown to encompass groups
            as varied as cultural organizations, government agencies, venture capitalists looking
            for new ideas, and other forms of innovation <ptr target="#concilio2017"/>
            <ptr target="#pethan2019"/>. A growing body of literature explores how hackathons have
            been adopted within fields as varied as academia, medicine, and civic <q>hacking.</q>
            Indeed, the model is well-positioned for <quote rend="inline">enriching social networks,
               facilitating collaborative learning, and workforce development</quote>
            <ptr target="#pethan2019" loc="15"/>. </p>
         <p>While our Archives Unleashed Project drew on the hackathon model, as it allowed for
            short focused, yet intensive work periods, we made an early shift to use the term
               <q>datathon</q> instead. Our first two events (in 2016 and 2017) used the term
               <q>hackathon,</q> but our project team worried the nature of the term itself would
            preclude bringing together a wide array of participants. Our project wanted to engage
            with individuals in diverse roles within the web archiving field: not just computer
            scientists and developers, but digital humanists, librarians, and curators. The unifying
            feature of the events would not be <q>hacking</q> on a particular technology, but rather
            exploring the implications of new data.</p>
         <p>Our article begins with a brief background into the broader Archives Unleashed Project
            and the ecosystem that our datathons exist in. We then define the communities we engage
            with, both specifically and more broadly. Following this, we introduce the field of
            community engagement and note the two main frameworks that we draw from, as well as how
            they are combined. Then, through a series of eight interviews with datathon
            participants, as well as related evidence from our events, we discuss how our
            participants saw the datathons as dramatically impacting both their professional
            practices as well as the broader web archiving community. We conclude this article with
            lessons learned and how these models can be adapted to work for the digital
            humanities.</p>

            <head>Background: Web Archives and the Archives Unleashed Project</head>
            <p>The world wide web, made public in 1991 by Tim Berners-Lee after being developed as
               an internal tool at the European Organization for Nuclear Research (CERN), has grown
               exponentially over the past three decades. Since its inception, the web has become a
               significant site of social, cultural, economic, and political activity. Our lives are
               increasingly mediated through technology, a current trend which has grown even
               clearer with widespread remote working and social distancing amidst the COVID-19
               pandemic. As one of the co-authors of this article has argued, <quote rend="inline"
                  >without using the web, histories of the 1990s will be incomplete for the most
                  part. Ignoring the web would be like ignoring print culture</quote>
               <ptr target="#milligan2019" loc="20"/>. Recognizing the significance of the web to
               the future historical record, beginning in 1996, the Internet Archive as well as
               national libraries in Sweden and Australia, began to carry out the widespread
               preservation of web content. This process, web archiving, can be understood as <quote
                  rend="inline">any form of deliberate and purposive preserving of web
                  material</quote>
               <ptr target="#brugger2010"/>. Web archiving has increasingly become part of research
               agendas for national libraries and archives, as well as memory institutions around
               the world.</p>
            <p>As of writing, the Internet Archive holds over 900 billion URLs and 60 petabytes of
               unique data (a petabyte being 1,000 terabytes). This figure is probably already
               dated, as the Internet Archive roughly doubles in size every two years. Despite this
               sheer amount of data, or perhaps because of it, <emph>access</emph> to this data has
               lagged. The sheer amount of data, coupled with the lack of research tools, means that
               scholars have, in many cases, not been able to carry out fruitful research with this
               material. Given the importance of web archives to carrying out histories of the 1990s
               and beyond, this is a serious problem. In other words, the data is there – and
               considerable expertise has been developed in the collection of web archival data
               – but the ability to work with it is not. In addition to the problems of scale, there
               are technical challenges of working with Web ARChive (WARC) files, in which much of
               this data is saved. We will return to WARC files shortly. Working with web archival
               data requires an understanding of both high-performance computing and the command
               line. This is, for the most part, out of reach for many scholars. They do not have
               the time, the resources, the support, or the training to work with data at scale,
               meaning that many research questions from the 1990s onwards cannot benefit from web
               data. In other words, this data is increasingly important for research, but it is too
               inaccessible for any research at scale.</p>
            <p>Our Archives Unleashed Project thus provides scholars and researchers with tools to
               explore historical internet content and reduce access barriers to large-scale web
               archival data. Established in 2017 with funding from The Andrew W. Mellon Foundation,
               the project grows out of a recognition that web archives are critical to
               understanding the world around us, and that the scholarly community accordingly needs
               approachable and user-friendly tools to access born-digital cultural heritage. The
               Archives Unleashed Project exists in several scholarly communities as it is located
               at the intersection of researchers, tools developers, and libraries. Our goal is to
               improve scholarly access to web archives through a <quote rend="inline">multi-pronged
                  strategy involving tool creation, process modeling, and community building - all
                  proceeding concurrently in mutually-reinforcing efforts</quote>
               <ptr target="#ruest2020"/>. This multi-pronged process manifests itself in three
               primary ways. First, the Archives Unleashed Toolkit, an Apache Spark libaray for
               working with web archives directly. Secondly, the Archives Unleashed Cloud, a
               cloud-hosted infrastructure and web-based front-end to run Toolkit jobs on WARC data
                  <ptr target="#ruest2021"/>. Finally, the project co-hosts Archives Unleashed
               datathons with local partners. These two-day events bring an interdisciplinary group
               of people together to collaborate and gain hands-on experience with web archive data. </p>
            <p>At the datathons, users are encouraged to use our project tools – they structure the
               sorts of projects that are undertaken. The Archives Unleashed Toolkit and Cloud were
               created to provide complementary approaches to working with web archives at scale.
               While digital content can exist in a variety of formats, both tools specifically work
               with WARC files, as well as their ARC format predecessor. WARC files, an ISO Standard
               (28500:2017), are essentially a container-file format that holds collected web
               resources together. As the web archiving community has standardized around WARCs,
               this has also made the development of a tool and analytics infrastructure possible. </p>
            <p>However, as WARC files are inaccessible to the majority of researchers, so much of
               the work of the Toolkit and the Cloud revolves around extracting <q>derivative</q>
               files from web archives: familiar formats such as extracted text files, network
               graphs, or statistical information. For example, when exploring the text of a WARC,
               several filters can be applied including date, language, keyword, domain, or URL
               patterns. This also means that projects can be carried out on a wide variety of
               languages; we have seen successful examples of users working with collections in
               French and German.</p>
            <p>The datathons are the centerpiece of the Archives Unleashed Project’s community
               engagement strategy. We want to make sure that the Toolkit and the Cloud both reach
               users and are responsive to their needs. As Niels Brügger has argued, there is great
               value in <quote rend="inline">cooperation between web-archiving institutions and
                  Internet research communities</quote>
               <ptr target="#brugger2010"/>. Our approach to community building has taken several
               shapes, from providing robust open-source code documentation, running a Slack group
               with open sign-up for sharing and discussion, regularly blogging, providing a
               quarterly e-mail newsletter, and – crucially, hosting the datathons discussed here.
               We also strive to develop educational resources for attendees, building relationships
               with like-minded projects and institutions (from the Internet Archive to university
               libraries to national libraries in North America and Europe), and also, participate
               in scholarly activities that support and foster information sharing.</p>
            <p>Our first datathons predated the Archives Unleashed Project. Between March 2016 and
               June 2017, an earlier project team (including two of this paper’s authors) carried
               out an initial sequence of four events. These were broader events, primarily focused
               on networking and building capacity in the web archiving community (described in <ref
                  target="#milliganetal2019">Milligan et al. [2019]</ref>), and included 148
               attendees from thirteen countries broadly drawing from web archive curators, digital
               humanists, and computer scientists. </p>
            <p>This paper focuses on the subsequent four datathons as part of our Mellon-funded
               project. These events were co-hosted with and held at the University of Toronto
               Library (April 2018), Simon Fraser University Library (November 2019), George
               Washington University Library (March 2019), and Columbia University Library (hosted
               online due to COVID-19, March 2020). Collectively, these four datathons have engaged
               with over 70 participants from seven countries and fifty unique institutions.
               Participants were predominantly from Canada and the United States, with participants
               from five additional countries including the United Kingdom, Germany, New Zealand,
               Egypt, and Hungary. While datathon events were open to a broad spectrum of
               information professionals, the majority of participants came from the higher
               education sector: university faculty and graduate students, librarians, and
               archivists. We had some smaller representation from national archives, non-profit
               organizations, museums, and independent researchers. In terms of diversity, we did
               not collect information on racial backgrounds, gender identities, or educational
               backgrounds; we are accordingly reluctant to make assumptions about our attendees or
               interviewees.</p>
            <p>These datathons had three primary goals. First, they were designed to introduce
               individuals to tools and methodologies of working with web archives at scale.
               Secondly, would allow attendees to engage in conversations to facilitate knowledge
               sharing and scholarly collaborations. Finally, the events aimed to foster community
               around open-source Archives Unleashed tools and web archive practices. While datathon
               participants bring a diversity of intellectual and personal perspectives to the
               events, in general, they can be categorized as access providers, tool builders, and
               data explorers. For the Archives Unleashed Project, focused on fostering an
               open-source community, these events would be pivotal for our community engagement
               strategy.</p>

         <div>
            <head>Community Engagement</head>
            <p>When thinking of community engagement, we were principally informed by the broad
               definition advanced by Liz Weaver and colleagues in a paper written for the Canadian
               Tamarack Institute, an organization dedicated to engaging with citizens to grapple
               pressing community issues. Weaver et al. define community engagement as <quote
                  rend="inline">people working collaboratively, through inspired action and
                  learning, to create and realize bold visions for their common future</quote>
               <ptr target="#whaley2010"/>. For organizations and institutions, community engagement
               is an opportunity to build active relationships with individuals and other entities
               for mutually beneficial exchanges. Community engagement is vital as it builds a
               relationship that actively seeks to understand the goals, needs, aspirations,
               concerns, and values held by a community <ptr target="#moore2016"/>. Without
               engagement and understanding of a community’s composition, there can be
               misunderstanding, misrepresentation, miscommunication, and missed opportunities.</p>
            <p>Before discussing community engagement models, we need to briefly define what we mean
               by community. Community is a surprisingly difficult term to define, as meta-reviews
               of scholarly definitions suggest (in addition to those below, see <ref
                  target="#macqueen2001">MacQueen et al. [2001]</ref>). We use the definition
               suggested by Cobigo et al.: <quote rend="inline">A community is a group of people
                  that interact and support each other, and are bounded by shared experiences or
                  characteristics, a sense of belonging, and often by their physical
                  proximity</quote>
               <ptr target="#cobigo2016" loc="195"/>. Indeed, while the web archiving community is
               largely virtual, our datathons (apart from our one held online due to COVID-19)
               assembled people together in a physical setting to foster community as well.
               Accordingly, when we speak of the larger web archiving community, we refer to
               individuals, organizations, groups, and institutions that have a shared focus on
               experience and engagement with web archiving activities and research. </p>
            <p>Within this broad community there is our Archives Unleashed community, composed of
               those who who engage with our platforms and support project work. While the web
               archiving community is multidisciplinary, it can be a resource-intensive process.
               Accordingly, national libraries and post-secondary educational institutions are
               overrepresent within the web archiving field (along with the non-profit Internet
               Archive), providing significant contributions in the form of education, professional
               development opportunities, services, and tools. The professional backgrounds of these
               sources are reflected in the demographics and backgrounds of most of our
               participants. </p>
            <p>Community engagement is critical for many other domains, including business and urban
               development <ptr target="#fredericks2016"/>
               <ptr target="#mitra2016"/>, medical <ptr target="#joosten2015"/>, environmental <ptr
                  target="#fernandez2016"/>, open-source and technology development <ptr
                  target="#decker2015"/>
               <ptr target="#link2017"/>, education <ptr target="#gribb2018"/>, libraries <ptr
                  target="#reid2016"/>
               <ptr target="#tharani2019"/>, and social sciences such as archaeology <ptr
                  target="#leiuen2016"/>. Across these studies, however, there are few canonical
               community engagement models or frameworks; rather, most of the studies reflect on
               specific case studies or activities, and broad understandings of how engaging
               communities can benefit a specific group or organization. We did, however, identify
               two models that could be adapted as a framework to better understand the goals and
               approaches of the Archives Unleashed Project when it came to community building and
               engagement. We primarily base our work on the first model, although we draw on
               elements of the second as well.</p>
            <p>The first model is the Open Community Engagement Process (OCEP) model, developed and
               operationalized by the Water Science Software Institute (WSSI). The OCEP model draws
               on development methods from Agile Software Development and the Open-Source software
               development community <ptr target="#ahalt2013" loc="42"/>. This model approaches
               community engagement both iteratively and incrementally. Their vision is illustrated
               as an infinity symbol, with communities continuing to gain knowledge through all
               steps. Crucially, for our own purposes, the WSSI model features <q>hackathons,</q>
               finding barriers, and disseminating ideas through publications; all of these are
               critical aspects of the Archives Unleashed Project, especially the first. The
               limitation of the model, however, is its complexity. OCEP includes fifteen stages, is
               three dimensional which makes for complicated diagramming, and is difficult to
               explain. OCEP is also arguably, for our purposes, too focused on software development
               and does not have the wide range of applications that we want to provide.</p>
            <p> The second model that we draw on is the International Association for Public
               Participation’s (IAP2) <title rend="quotes">Spectrum of Public Participation.</title>
               IAP2’s model describes five critical stages of community engagement (IAP2 2018). The
               first is to inform, or explain an opportunity available to the community. The second
               is to consult the community. The third is to involve the community in planning,
               implementing decisions, project design processes, and ensure widespread
               understanding. The fourth is to collaborate, or to work together to find solutions.
               And finally, the spectrum closes with empower, or providing the community with
               resources and skills to make their own decisions. While community engagement looks
               different in each sector, the processes are broadly applicable and work well for the
               Archives Unleashed Project. Understandably, there is no one-size-fits-all-model, as
               each sector and discipline have unique sets of needs. While we found the stage model
               of IAP2 attractive for being action-oriented, it lacked the stage and flow
               organization of OCEP. Accordingly, we combine them as seen in Figure 1.</p>
            <figure>
               <head>Archives Unleashed Community Engagement Model, adapted from IAP2</head>
               <graphic url="resources/images/figure01.png"/>
            </figure>
            <p> From the IAP2 model, we drew from the spirit of the five-stages of community
               engagement: informing, consulting, involving, collaborating, and empowering. In this,
               we are not alone. The IAP2 model has been applied to <quote rend="inline">project and
                  program development in fields ranging from health care to environmental planning,
                  particularly in Australia and Canada</quote>
               <ptr target="#powell2010"/>. As IAP2 focuses on an engagement dynamic originally
               rooted in government-civic relations, we have adjusted the categories to fit with
               Archives Unleashed Project priorities, our governance structure, and our activities.
               For example, our project goals were already defined, so while we do consult with our
               community for feedback and input on development processes, many overall decisions are
               made by the project team, not by community vote. This would be the case for many
               digital humanities projects. It is also important to note, that while we’ve adapted
               OCEP’s infinity shape for our community engagement framework, stages do not
               necessarily happen independently or one at a time.</p>
            <p> We present the six stages of our model below. Note that the datathon process only
               appears at stage three of this six-stage process – when we begin to “consult” with
               the community – but as the first two stages provide invaluable context, we felt it
               was valuable to provide an overview of all of them. </p>
            <p> The first stage is to scope. If we look to the aforementioned OCEP model, we can
               describe our first stage of community engagement where we scope or identify a problem
               or challenge, which becomes <quote rend="inline">the driving question [which] serves
                  as an incentive for a specific subset of the community to participate in the OCEP
                  Open Community Engagement Process] process</quote>
               <ptr target="#ahalt2013" loc="44"/>. This stage drives purpose and objectives. Once a
               problem or challenge has been defined, it is critical to identify the scope of
               stakeholders that will collectively make up the community we are engaging. In this
               stage, we ask: who is our target audience, what types of individuals, organizations,
               or groups are we trying to represent and reach? Who is affected by our <q>driving
                  question?</q> With our Archives Unleashed Project, we leveraged previous work on
               the <q>Warcbase</q> project (an Archives Unleashed Toolkit predecessor) to identify
               needs and barriers of scholars within the digital humanities and social sciences,
               when working with web archives <ptr target="#lin2017"/>. Through this experience and
               outreach at diverse conferences and workshops, we gained a sense of who was being
               affected by high barriers of access to web archives. Scoping and identifying allowed
               our project to focus on three user-types: academics and scholars (specifically within
               the humanities, social sciences, and the specific area of the digital humanities);
               digital access content providers (primarily librarians and archivists), and tool
               builders (with a focus on those in computer science). Note that this scoping provided
               the background for the basic structure of our datathons.</p>
            <p> The second stage is to inform. The inform stage, as defined by IAP2, is <quote
                  rend="inline">to provide the public with balanced and objective information to
                  assist them in understanding the problems, alternatives and/or solutions</quote>
               <ptr target="#iap2018"/>. Throughout this stage, it was important for the Archives
               Unleashed team to share information and summaries around the project goals,
               objectives, and road mapping, as well as bring awareness to web archiving access
               barriers, and raise an understanding of why our project was important for the
               community. One of our initial major activities was to develop a presence on several
               information-sharing platforms. This was to both deliver information and grow a
               supportive community. Specifically, we used Slack as a way of supportive two-way
               communication between the team and the community, as well as encouraging peer-to-peer
               discussions and information sharing practices. An accessible signup form allowed for
               quick access to our Slack space, and crucially, we could add additional targeted
               channels for specific aspects of our project, as well as spaces for general
               discussions. We also set up a quarterly newsletter and regularly-published blog
               posts. </p>
            <p> The third stage is to consult. In our project, this laid the groundwork for the
               datathons. As IAP2 identified, the purpose of consulting with a community is to open
               dialogue in which individuals can provide <quote rend="inline">feedback on analysis,
                  alternatives and/or decisions</quote>
               <ptr target="#iap2018"/>. This stage identifies the importance of both asking and
               listening to voices within the community, and to inform development cycles and
               approaches by the Archives Unleashed team. We achieved this in several key respects:
               an advisory board, discussions at datathons (as described in this paper), as well as
               formally through user surveys and interviews. Indeed, much of the research behind
               this paper exemplifies our consultation process.</p>
            <p> The fourth stage is to involve, which for us, centered around the datathons
               discussed in this paper. This stage speaks to an active mode of participation from
               the community. IAP2 defines this stage as a way <quote rend="inline">to work directly
                  with the public throughout the process to ensure that public concerns and
                  aspirations are consistently understood and considered.</quote><note>
                  <ref
                     target="https://cdn.ymaws.com/www.iap2.org/resource/resmgr/pillars/Spectrum_8.5x11_Print.pdf"

               </note> While our project, as an academic one funded by a granting agency, does not
               involve community participation at the ultimate decision-making level, involvement
               has taken the shape of working collaboratively with our community on tools
               development. </p>
            <p>Involving our community has been the primary goal of our datathon events, intending
               to build a community around the tools that would complement and contribute to the
               broader web archiving scholarly community. As attendees participate in our datathons,
               they create connections that can support future research collaborations and the
               sharing of skills and practices with their broader networks. As the OCEP model
               suggests, by participating in events like our datathons, attendees are exposed to
               ideas, methods, approaches, skills to address web archiving challenges that may not
               have <quote rend="inline">emerged using traditional disciplinary methods and that
                  require synthetic knowledge</quote>
               <ptr target="#ahalt2013" loc="45"/>. In other words, the datathon model we adopted as
               a key activity in our involvement stage draws perspectives and approaches from the
               community that we otherwise would not have encountered. Notably, involvement overlaps
               with the consultation stage. </p>
            <p> The fifth and penultimate stage is to collaborate and establish partnerships. Here,
               too, the datathons represented a building of both collaborations with our community
               and amongst them. The Archives Unleashed Project aims to foster interdisciplinary
               collaborations as we sit at the intersection of technology, cultural heritage, and
               researchers. Interdisciplinary and multi-institutional collaboration also provides
               opportunities for information and resources to be shared more widely. The datathon
               structure has provided a glimpse into the ways Archives Unleashed has stepped into a
               role of an intermediary for peer-to-peer collaborations and peer-to-institutional
               partnerships. As one participant (R4, introduced later in this article) suggested,
               Archives Unleashed became a <q>broker of data,</q> which for some participants
               created a necessary connection between awareness and knowledge by bridging a gap to
               accessing web archives data. This has been an active element of our project, and
               includes formal partnerships with academic institutions to explore their collections,
               co-host datathons together, and crucially build relationships with other projects and
               institutions within the field, such as the Internet Archive. Crucially, it has been
               critical to identify and develop relationships with projects and organizations that
               could help us foster interoperability between projects (such as data transfer APIs or
               adapting web-based notebooks).</p>
            <p> The final stage, then, is to empower. The IAP2 model defines the empower stage as,
                  <quote rend="inline">To place final decision-making in the hands of the
                  public</quote>
               <ptr target="#iap2018"/>. However, the Archives Unleashed model approaches
               empowerment in a way which encourages and supports the confidence and skills of an
               individual to work with web archives, and addresses the objective of lowering
               barriers to web archives. Beyond the active participation of empowering our users
               through the datathons, we also seek to give resources to the community through
               learning guides (text and image-based documents that provide a tutorial-based
               approach to working with data), videos, and publications which explain our workflows
               and approaches.</p>
            <p> Why the infinity symbol? Ultimately, it reflects our approach to long-term
               sustainability. After empowering users, we need to consider the scope and think about
               what the subsequent projects and iterations will look like, and the opportunities to
               further community engagement and enrichment; we then begin to move through the model
               again. Cognizant of long-term use of our tools and projects, we are reluctant to post
               a firm ending to the model.</p>
            <p> This was thus our project’s landscape. We wanted to explore the impact of the
               Archives Unleashed datathon events on community engagement through a robust
               understanding of these models and the broader scholarly landscape. We return to these
               two models later in the paper, as we explore how they meaningfully integrate to help
               make sense of the Archives Unleashed Project’s approach to community engagement.</p>

            <p>To understand the impact of our events and inform our proposed community engagement
               model, we turned to interviews with participants from our event. To do so, we
               compiled a list of all participants who attended our Mellon-funded datathons between
               2017 and 2019 (notably our events in Toronto, Vancouver, and Washington DC). Our
               primary goal was to craft interview questions and discussions to shed light on steps
               3 – 6 (consult, involve, collaborate, and empower). By applying the model to our
               datathon, we aimed to validate our proposed model.</p>
            <p> Our datathons sought to bring together individuals across three discrete categories,
               as identified by our scoping phase. First, attendees from libraries and archives, –
               predominantly from post-secondary institutions- or whose professional role was
               largely related to curating web archives. Secondly, attendees from the tool-building
               community, or those whose professional roles largely related to developing software
               for archiving or analysis. And, finally, researchers, or those whose professional
               role mostly revolved around using web archives for scholarly research. As our
               datathons are roughly structured to include a third of their attendees from each
               group, we wanted to interview across these three categories <ptr
                  target="#milliganetal2019"/>. Some basic information on the flow of the datathon
               can inform the discussion that follows. Our datathons involve teams working in small
               groups of between four and six individuals. These groups ideally spanned the three
               main participant groups (tools builders/library and archives/researchers) and indeed,
               represented diversity within those sub-categories, spanning the range from libraries,
               archives, sociology, social media and society scholars, humanists, software
               developers, government documents librarians, and so forth.</p>
            <p>Datathons provided an open and collegial environment that allowed for the organic
               formation of new collaborations and connections. For some attendees, it was a chance
               to finally meet people they knew about or follow in the web archiving community but
               had never had a chance to meet face-to-face with; while for others, it was an
               opportunity to forge an entirely new network. The datathon also afforded participants
               the opportunity to meet individuals they would not have met in any other context.</p>
            <p> These networking opportunities are especially challenging as there are significant
               barriers within the web archiving community, especially as it comprises of so many
               institutions, organizations, projects, and individuals from diverse backgrounds. As
               the community developed organically over two decades, there is no one overarching
               body or group to look to, but rather clusters of groups have formed around specific
               organizations (such as meetings at the Society of American Archivists, or digital
               humanities conferences, or regional professional groups, or national libraries). </p>
            <p>Within the structure of the datathon event, there are various elements and activities
               geared towards fostering an open and welcoming community, and helping individuals
               develop a sense of belonging. To encourage team formation, we run a sticky note
               exercise at the event’s beginning to bring people together into teams. Participants
               were encouraged to write down research questions on one coloured sticky note, web
               archive collections of interest on another, and finally, tools and infrastructure on
               another one. They place their sticky notes on surfaces as organizers physically
               cluster the notes to identify emerging themes, and encourage physical groups of
               people around those themed clusters. After three or four iterations, teams would be
               in place <ptr target="#milliganetal2019"/>. This method was adapted from the field of
               participatory design <ptr target="#walsh2013"/>.</p>
            <p>The sticky note exercise was critical as teams are, of course, the core of the event.
               Indeed, the teams that emerged out of this were fundamental in fostering group
               dynamics and belonging. As there were no prescribed research problems or questions,
               teams were free to decide on the datasets, methods, and research questions –
               identified during the sticky note exercise and refined while in their groups. Some
               groups did have a technical expert who they could rely on, but many others would need
               to work together to approach some of the daunting technical barriers presented by
               WARC files and difficult tools. Cognizant of limitations of individual’s personal
               laptops or bandwidth constraints at events, we provide cloud-hosted virtual machines
               which participants could access remotely. </p>
            <p>After working on their projects for two days, the event culminated with final
               presentations. Teams would have up to five minutes to present their findings, usually
               through a slide show or dynamic demonstration, and then answer one or two questions
               from the audience. Judges, selected by the host organization, would then pick one
                  <q>winner</q> who received a token prize of Starbucks gift cards (chosen mainly
               because of their cross-border accessibility).</p>
            <p> For this paper, a total of eight semi-structured interviews were conducted via
               Skype, and subsequently transcribed for reviewing and coding to identify emerging
               themes and relationships. All interviewees consented to have the interview recorded
               and agreed to be identified in any ensuing publications with a description of their
               professional role. While all interviewees had attended at least one of the three
               Mellon-funded datathons, four of them had also attended pre-Archives Unleashed
               Project datathon. We will introduce each interview subject again below in prose as
               they appear in results, but for convenience we use abbreviations for subsequent
               mentions. They are listed in Table 1.</p>

            <p>The interview questions revolved around three general areas. First, we were
               interested in interviewees’ professional background and experience, as well as their
               scholarly interests. We wanted to understand their knowledge and experience with web
               archiving prior to attending the datathon. Secondly, we explored their datathon
               experience, focusing on their overall experience and impressions from the event,
               their familiarity with similar events, and crucially whether their scholarly
               community or practice has changed as a result of the datathon. Finally, we concluded
               with general questions around their thoughts on the future of web archiving,
               including challenges, opportunities, and gaps that they deemed relevant to the future
               of the community. These questions were developed as a means to understand the degree
               to which Archives Unleashed had successfully created a scholarly community, how the
               datathons impacted community formation, and what, if any, were the impacts on the
               broader web archiving community.</p>

            <p>The following section is divided into our main themes: backgrounds and pre-existing
               knowledge of web archiving, the impact of the datathon experience (notably
               skill-building, exposure to diverse practices, community formation, and inculcation
               of a sense of belonging), the datathon within the web archiving community context,
               and finally, general reflections on the future of web archiving and barriers in the
               field. As noted, these all primarily shed light on steps 4 – 6 (involve, collaborate,
               and empower) of the community model. For convenience, an overview of findings is
               provided in Table 2.</p>

            <p>The first step in understanding a community has to be understanding its composition.
               Where do members come from? What technical or social knowledge of web archives did
               they have? Accordingly, we asked participants about their varied professional
               backgrounds and scholarly interests. As attendees at a datathon, the participants
               interviewed all in some way worked with web archives in their current or most recent
               position: whether they were conducting crawls for institutional collections,
               providing access to researchers, or creating tools to interact with web archival
               data. While working in the field, however, when asked about the ways in which they
               had become familiar with web archiving, many pointed to an accumulation of knowledge
               based on practice through work experience. Knowledge, in a sense, was a result of
               trial-and-error and through professional positions, rather than through formal higher
               education training. This was seen across the board from those with degrees in the
               LIS, humanities, engineering, and computer science disciplines. Indeed, experience
               was often obtained outside of the field but applied to it. For example, one librarian
               working at a large national library (R1) had previously worked with special media
               formats at scale, an experience which lent itself well to web archiving. Another
               librarian working at a large research library (R2) had been working with social media
               data. With both examples, we see a pattern where previous experience with diverse
               digital formats carried over to their work in web archiving. </p>
            <p> All eight participants agreed that the Archives Unleashed datathon had increased
               their knowledge of web archiving (generally related to higher-level thinking –
               theoretical aims, goals, processes) outside of any technical skills they learned. One
               respondent, a researcher at a large U.S. public university (R3), noted that the
               datathon provided foundational knowledge of some of the working parts and concepts
               within web archiving, for instance, WARC files, derivatives, as well as the
               possibilities of web archiving analysis. R2 emphasized that the datathon validated
               for them the connection between web archiving and scholarly research. For R2, as well
               as two additional interviewees – one a graduate student and digital humanities
               developer (R4) and another a digital scholarship librarian at a Canadian university
               (R5) – the event brought an understanding of how researchers may want to use and look
               at web archive data. This was important for both tool developers as well as
               librarians to help inform their ways to support users and colleagues. Finally,
               another participant – an archivist at a large U.S. private university (R6) – remarked
               that the event had helped them to think about “what we might change on our end as the
               staff members creating these collections, to allow for this other kind of research
               that we hadn't really supported before at our institution.”</p>
         </div>
         <div>
            <head>Impact of the Datathon on Professional Practice</head>
            <p>With backgrounds established, we wanted to explore the degree to which our events –
               as an exercise in community engagement – had meaningful impacts on professional
               practices. We can cluster their responses into four main themes. First, the datathons
               contribution to skill-building. Secondly, how the event exposed attendees to diverse,
               interdisciplinary perspectives. Thirdly, how the events fostered community formation;
               and fourthly – and finally – how our events fostered for some a sense of belonging.
               We explore each of these in turn.</p>
            <p> Despite the varying levels of experience that participants brought to the datathon,
               all agreed there were several important lessons and skills they took away from their
               datathon experience. This meant building or adding to their technical repertoires,
               even amongst those with technical expertise coming in. For those who work with web
               archive collections as part of their professional practice, such as R3 and R4, their
               primary focus during their everyday work is to collect information. This means that
               they rarely have opportunities to, really dig in and work with the data up close.
               Indeed, this ability to work with the data itself is where the datathon model shined
               for participants. By digging into the mechanics of data and the intricacies of tools
               in a small, supportive environment, group collaborations led to discussions around
               the challenges, limitations, and other structural practices of web archiving.
               Notably, the wrap-up activity – where the groups presented their final projects – was
               noted by participants as an opportunity to showcase final projects and to share
               information. </p>
            <p>A number of specific tools were learned, as well. All respondents mentioned the
               Archives Unleashed Toolkit. Social media analysis tools such as twarc (<ref
                  target="https://github.com/DocNow/twarc">https://github.com/DocNow/twarc</ref>),
               APIs, and approaches to visualization were also common answers. Notably, R4 noted the
               importance of learning Spark: <quote rend="inline">prior to the second workshop, I
                  really had never used Spark before. I kind of knew what it was but just had never
                  spent the time to learn how to use it,</quote> and argued that future work and
               collaborations would not have emerged if they had not attended the datathon and
               learned how to use Spark. The overall impact of the event on lowering barriers was
               also noted by R8, a graduate student at a large private U.S. university, who
               expressed ongoing efforts to <quote rend="inline">help archivists to feel more
                  confident or less afraid of the technology of command line and things like that so
                  that they could use Archives Unleashed and the tools that you're developing. Don't
                  be afraid of it. This is great. That's the great thing about the datathon,
                  right?</quote></p>
            <p> Another crucial dimension of the datathon was helping participants make a stronger
               case for why professions needed to adopt these methods and approaches to web
               archiving. In other words, it allowed them to better advocate for the value of web
               archiving within their institutions and communities. As R1, the librarian from a
               national library described, institutions and organizations are <quote rend="inline"
                  >not as likely to put money towards it or they’re not as likely to just believe in
                  it</quote> without tangible outputs or use cases like one might see coming out of
               a datathon. This was echoed by R6, an archivist at a large U.S. private university,
               who indicated that it is hard to advocate for web archiving <quote rend="inline">when
                  administrators often want statistics and usage numbers and quantitative reasons to
                  support the work, we can’t necessarily say that people are using web archive
                  yet.</quote> As R5, the librarian at a mid-sized Canadian university considered,
               institutions may not also <quote rend="inline">realize the commitment that’s needed
                  to do this well.</quote> Through tangible examples, R5 expressed that though their
               mandate as a digital scholarship librarian, <quote rend="inline">I find that
                  explaining to them why this is important, how they can use this technology, all of
                  a sudden it becomes less of an abstract fear and more of an oh, I see why this is
                  important and why I want to learn it.</quote> By being able to showcase actual
               projects from the datathons, participants were able in turn to bring lessons and
               approaches back to their institutions.</p>
         </div>
         <div>
            <head>Exposure to Diverse Perspectives</head>
            <p>Similarly, participants regularly commented on the benefit of working in small groups
               (discussed in the previous section) with a diverse range of perspectives unified only
               in some cases by a shared interest in web archiving. Given the event, this was
               sufficiently cohesive. Indeed, as R7 (a graduate student and developer at a mid-sized
               U.S. public university) noted, it represented an <quote rend="inline">opportunity to
                  network with like-minded people.</quote> The range of perspectives and background
               groups was in and of itself a real boon. R7 spoke at this at length, highlighting
               that: <quote rend="block">You don’t realize how much you don’t understand until you
                  try to explain something that you think is obvious. So that’s something I think
                  really came out when I was working with teams, was trying to convey things that
                  seemed obvious to me, or intuitive to me, but then other folks were rightly
                  questioning <q>why would you do it that way?</q> and I would say, <q>well how else
                     would you do that?</q> Basically, going back and forth was really
                  educational.</quote></p>
            <p>This back-and-forth would be represented in the final projects as well, as R7
               stressed how this creativity was borne out in the final presentations. For example, a
               researcher with a flair for visualization could make a concept come alive. R7
               reflects, in these final presentations, participants could <quote rend="inline"
                  >transform[ing] topics that you never really thought you could take a look at and
                  making them into visual representations.</quote> Similarly, connections between
               different disciplines could pay off in the long term. R8, a graduate student, was
               able to connect with an archivist as part of their datathon team, leading to critical
               insights around data brokering, collections strategies, and beyond; as she expressed,
                  <quote rend="inline">a lot of things sort of came together just through that one
                  interaction with her. And that led to a lot of insights for me,</quote> noting
               that they corresponded after the event as well. </p>
         </div>
         <div>
            <head>Community Formation</head>
            <p>While us organizers had the initial goal of building community around the specific
               Archives Unleashed Tools (i.e., community <hi rend="italic">with</hi> our project),
               coincidently, we were able to encourage connections <hi rend="italic">within</hi> the
               community that did not involve our tools. Indeed, part of this was simply breaking
               down disciplinary barriers. One of our attendees, R6, an archivist at a large private
               university, saw the event as helping to <quote rend="inline">break down the
                  librarian, archivist versus scholar researcher dichotomy ... all of [these] people
                  are in the same room equally as peers.</quote>
            </p>
            <p>Indeed, through the interviews, we saw community formation taking shape as
               participants emerged as ambassadors within the web archiving community, their home
               institutions, and professional communities. For example, R3 – a faculty researcher at
               a large U.S. university – drew a direct relationship between the datathon and their
               current scholarly practices. For them, the skills and connections learned at the
               event allowed them to expose colleagues to web archiving practices and demonstrate
               the possibilities that WARC files provided. Another, R2, the librarian developer at a
               private U.S. university, noted that it informed their own development work on a
               related project that used WARCs and some of the web archiving APIs. When it came time
               to work on this project, the datathon <quote rend="inline">gave us confidence that
                  when we were trying to do the same thing, that it was the right way to
               go.</quote></p>
            <p> Within the series of events that were run, participants who attended multiple events
               matured in their participation as they could mentor new attendees. R7 noted that the
               first time they attended the event, they were <quote rend="inline">still learning
                  what a WARC was,</quote> and R3 reflected that <quote rend="inline">the projects
                  that [they] worked on became increasingly more technical over multiple
                  datathons.</quote> Crucially, these repeat attendees shifted organically into a
               mentorship role, having the confidence to help other group members based on the
               technical skills and expertise developed iteratively over datathons.</p>
         </div>
         <div>
            <head>Sense of Belonging</head>
            <p>In general terms, the world of web archiving is unfamiliar and unintuitive to
               researchers, librarians, archivists, and even some tool builders. At the same time,
               those who work in the field are quickly confronted with an overwhelming and
               intimidating amount of data in a relatively idiosyncratic file format (in that WARCs
               are seldom encountered outside of the web archiving field). To lower these barriers,
               we want to inculcate a sense of belonging. </p>
            <p> A sense of belonging has been defined in a critical article by Hagerty et al. as
                  <quote rend="inline">the experiences of personal involvement in a system or
                  environment so that persons feel themselves to be an integral part of that system
                  or environment</quote>
               <ptr target="#haggerty1992"/>. Peer support and a sense of belonging have been
               identified as two critical factors for overall mental health as well amongst
               students, and are essential goals of our events as well (drawing on our experience as
               educators as well) <ptr target="#mcbeath2018"/>. A sense of belonging is critical to
               whether an individual participates in a broader community.</p>
            <p>The importance of the sticky note exercise in creating a sense of belonging came
               across in the interviews. As R7 explained, <quote rend="inline">we did the exercise
                  on the board with the Post-Its and things like that, and I think that really
                  helped me find a group and also find something of interest.</quote>
            </p>
            <p>This was also nurtured through sustained group work. As R3 noted, there was a
               recognition that the <quote rend="inline">majority of people were in the same boat
                  because working with web archives is difficult.</quote> By being able to work
               together, the events for many <quote rend="inline">normalize[d] the experience with
                  the tools and the technology and limitations</quote> as R3 explained. R4, a
               graduate student and developer at a large U.S. university, saw the event as akin to a
                  <quote rend="inline">travelling web archive or reading room,</quote> and by making
               data accessible to teams (many of whom who could now talk to the curating librarian
               responsible for the data) we were akin to a <q>broker of data.</q> Indeed, these
               partnerships were mutually beneficial as participants were able to access web archive
               data, at the same time, attention was brought to unique institutional datasets that
               exist, but may not be widely known about.</p>
         </div>
         <div>
            <head>Areas for Improvement</head>
            <p>While participants were positive around the overall impact – conveyed through
               post-event surveys and interviews– ideas did arise around how this event model could
               either be better refined or perhaps would not fit all of our community-building
               goals. Some of these, notably the diverse range of technical expertise or
               disciplines, as well as the slowed momentum of collaboration after the event <ptr
                  target="#komssi2015"/>, were expected. Other suggestions led us to engage more
               deeply with pedagogical literature. </p>
            <p>The focus on <q>data,</q> implicit in the name <q>datathon</q> itself, had some
               downsides. It led to an emphasis on technical issues and working with discrete
               datasets themselves, which had the effect of preventing discussion on broader issues
               to do with policy, ethics, or theory. R3 gave an important example of <quote
                  rend="inline">issues of representation and what this means and what these gaps
                  mean that aren't data specific</quote> as something that did not feel welcome at
               the event as a topic of discussion. One could look at a dataset, but this left out
               questions that might (as R3 again noted) allow us to <quote rend="inline">look at the
                  whole [web archiving] life cycle.</quote>
            </p>
            <p>With such technical questions and the overall ethos, issues were also raised around
               the diversity of technical expertise. As teams largely formed themselves through the
               collaborative team building exercise, some teams ended up without much in the way of
               technical strength. R6, an archivist at a large U.S. private university, found
               themselves in such a group and wished that there had been more of an expectation for
               peers (even if they were in another group) to help <quote rend="inline">peers who are
                  struggling to get them more towards a middle ground rather than identifying the
                  people who are doing a really stellar job and pushing them farther ahead from the
                  folks who are struggling.</quote> We were inspired by this, and in future
               grant-funded work, are pursuing a formal mentorship program to help pair expertise
               with researchers in a more targeted and inclusive way.</p>
            <p>Finally, the loss of momentum after the event was a shortcoming identified by
               interviewees and our project team alike. The short two-day nature of the event means
               that it largely relies heavily on exploratory projects that may not have a readily
               apparent route forward to a larger study or publication. It also reflects the
               difficult nature of the tools, and how outside of the resources provided by the
               datathon, they may continue to be too difficult. However, we need to consider that
               engagement is not just a short-term milestone, nor is it just using a particular
               toolkit or approach. Rather, it is again <hi rend="italic">community</hi>. Several
               participants noted that while they do not use the tools, they do have them tucked
               away as a resource to recommend when a patron or a colleague might want to work with
               web archival data. </p>
         </div>
         <div>
            <head>The Road Ahead</head>
            <p>Participants were all asked about their thoughts on the future of web archiving.
               While broad in nature, this question was met with optimism from respondents who were
               generally excited about the direction of web archiving and the opportunities for
               scholars, access providers, and tool builders (and everyone in between). On the
               collection side, R2 (librarian developer at a large national library) saw a shift
               from national to institutional collecting, which would notably involve <quote
                  rend="inline">large growth in subject-based collecting that is likely to be of
                  more value for both the historical record and for scholarly work.</quote> As well,
               there was a consensus that web archive collections hold immense value for current and
               future researchers, and web archives have – as R3 explained – <quote rend="inline">a
                  potential to add a lot more rigor and also allow us to share data and in lots of
                  other spaces.</quote> We also saw that most participants were happy about the
               Archives Unleashed Project; R7, for example, noted that they felt <quote
                  rend="inline">feel very good about the tools that you’ve been developing, like
                  those are exactly the right sorts of tools and tearing down the right sorts of
                  technical barriers that are going to make the adoption happen faster.</quote></p>
            <p>Yet there was also a sense that the process of web archiving analysis might be ahead
               of where researchers are right now; that we are, perhaps, along with the web
               archiving field more generally, laying the groundwork for future work. As R2 notes,
               while there is undoubtedly <quote rend="inline">long-term massive significance to
                  [this] scholarly activity ... [it will] happen in a timeframe that will be
                  frustrating long ... [but the pace of adoption] should not at all be taken as a
                  reflection on the significance of the work.</quote> R1, a librarian at a national
               library, remarked that Archives Unleashed <quote rend="inline">opens the door to
                  (those computational) conversations because it starts to break down [barriers to]
                  the technical part.</quote> Indeed, use of archival collections often lags behind
               their creation; as R6 argued, <quote rend="inline">in archives we take a pretty long
                  view of time and history, and just because (few) are using it now doesn’t mean
                  that people aren’t going to want it (web archive data).</quote>

            <p>Through this, an emerging community model takes shape for both the Archives Unleashed
               Project as well as our role within the broader ecosystem; this has implications for
               other digital humanities projects. It is summarized in Table 3. Archives Unleashed is
               located within the web archiving ecosystem, with important links to the digital
               humanities, historical, computational social sciences, and computer science fields.
               From these interviews and our own experiences, we understand that <quote
                  rend="inline">if you build it, they will come</quote> mentality does not work, and
               active engagement to build relationships and communities is essential. The goal
               through datathons was to build a community around our tools that would complement and
               contribute to the other connections taking shape. </p>
            <p>From our earlier discussion, we identified two community engagement frameworks – the
               Water Science Software Institute’s Open Community Engagement Process (OCEP) and the
               International Association for Public Participation’s (IAP2) <title rend="quotes"
                  >Spectrum of Public Participation,</title> and brought them together in our
               Archives Unleashed community model. We can see that our combination of the OCEP and
               IAP2 models works reasonably well, capturing the breadth of activities taking place
               through our datathons. IAP2 captures the main categories, more or less; and OCEP
               captures the need to see the cycle as an infinite loop, where we continually navigate
               and improve as we move through the community engagement model.</p>
            <p>Overall, the Archives Unleashed Project has successfully built a community around the
               scholarly practice of exploring web archives and created unique opportunities for
               individuals with a wide variance in backgrounds, skills, and experience to connect
               and collaborate. All participants identified at least one, and in many cases several,
               tangible skills that they learned. They also spoke to the important aspect of having
               the opportunity to forge new collaborations, which have positively impacted their
               professional practices and research collaborations. It also bears out the hackathon
               literature, which suggests the ability for these events to <quote rend="inline"
                  >enable building a community of users and strategic networks,</quote>
               <ptr target="#komssi2015" loc="64"/> seen in our discussions around community
               formation, a sense of belonging, and skills acquired by participants through the
               Archives Unleashed datathons.</p>
            <p>Without community engagement, projects would live and work in silos. The models we
               engage with here, as well as the modified version that we advance, are all part of
               the broader ways in which our projects and others in the digital humanities create a
               space for and recognize collaborative and interdisciplinary work. </p>
