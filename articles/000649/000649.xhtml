                  <p>This article focuses on the international news flow regarding the execution of
                     					Maximilian, the Emperor of Mexico. The execution occurred in June 1867, but it
                     					received global attention only at the beginning of July when the news started
                     to
                     					spread over the borders, via telegraph, and rapidly through the network of
                     					newspapers. The article concentrates on international news on Maximilian's
                     					execution between 5 and 20 July 1867. The aim of the study is both empirical
                     and
                     					methodological. It explores the sentiments underlying the news about the
                     					execution and the regional differences in these sentiments on an empirical
                     					level. On a methodological level, the article investigates the strategies to
                     					analyze sentiments via newspaper corpora in a multilingual research setting.
                     The
                     					study is based on optically recognized historical newspapers in three languages
                     					(German, Spanish and English), and four regions (Austria, Germany, Mexico, and
                     					the United States). Our analysis shows content variations in the corpora, mainly
                     					that news was framed differently in each studied region, indicating that the
                     					local perception of the event and political interests shaped the news. In our
                     					corpus, the Mexican press –published in the middle of a political crisis– tended
                     					towards a neutral stance, the Austrian and German papers mainly were negative,
                     					and the United States showed mixed sentiments on the incident.</p>

                  <div class="ptext" id="p1">The execution of Maximillian, Emperor of Mexico, by the army of Benito Juarez in
                     				1867 had international ramifications, and the world became polarized. The press
                     				around the globe reported it and rallied the population in favor or against the
                     				event. In this analysis, we explore the underlying sentiments and emotions
                     				embedded in the texts that circulated inthe press, as a case study of the
                     				project Oceanic Exchanges, whose aim was to uncover how the international was
                     				refracted through the local as news, applying text mining methods to a corpus
                     of
                     				national digitized nineteenth-century newspapers. </div>

                  <div class="ptext" id="p2"> Our hypothesis is that regional emotional content variations of news reveal the
                     				political undertones and biases of information flows. The latter aspect is
                     				fostered by the fact that the execution of Maximilian was, from the outset, an
                     				incident that divided opinions.</div>
                  			
                  <div class="counter"><a href="#p3">3</a></div>
                  <div class="ptext" id="p3">To that goal, we put together a corpus that includes digitized newspapers from
                     				different regions in North America and Europe, encompassing material from the
                     				actual arena of the execution, Mexico, from the country of Maximilian's
                     				ancestry, Austria as well as from the US and Germany<a class="noteRef" href="#d4e247">[1]</a> that covered the news abundantly [<a class="ref" href="#priani2019">Priani et al. 2019</a>].
                     				After dividing the corpus into geographical regions, we use quantitative methods
                     				–word frequency distributions and named entity recognition (NER)–to first look
                     				at the corpus. Then, using qualitative content analysis, we narrowed the
                     				information to compare the different regions. Finally, using automated sentiment
                     				analysis tools, we were able to compare the automatic analysis to the human one,
                     				showing a similar and clear sentimental trend in both methods depending on the
                     				geographical region: the Austrian/German press had a negative bias, while the
                     				Mexican newspapers showed a more positive picture, and the US showed mixed
                     				sentiments. </div>

                     				Oceanic Exchanges corpus OCR quality ranges between 60-85%, but it varies within
                     				each country's corpora. Nonetheless, as Ryan Cordell pointed out, “methods such
                     				as text mining rely not on the nineteenth-century newspapers themselves, but on
                     				those newspapers as a remediated by mass digitization, a phrase that shorthands
                     				elaborate systems of scholarship, preservation, bureaucracy, human labor,

                     				human. The practical challenge was that the US and Mexican subcorpora had poor
                     				OCR quality compared to the Austrian and German. The human challenge was that
                     as
                     				an international team, participants from different countries have different
                     				scholarship cultures. The Mexican team, for example, was not familiar with
                     				working with dirty OCR and, because the corpus was not large, decided to
                     				transcribe all of their news items.</div>

                  <div class="ptext" id="p17">We decided to work with the Mexican corpus as it was prepared by the Mexican team,
                     				respecting its work and effort. In the case of the US subcorpus, the automatic
                     				extraction included everything on the page, and there were no breaks between
                     				news stories and columns –like in the German and Austrian corpus. The raw data
                     				included the news item about Maximilian's death and any other news stories on
                     				the page, making it hard to work with. Since there were thousands of hits, we
                     				narrowed the information down through an automated process, i.e, filtering
                     				chunks of surrounding text (windows of words to the right and to the left) were
                     				“Maximilian” is mentioned. This eliminated most of the unwanted information,
                     				although it was a superficial strategy prone to some noise. As we assume
                     				newspapers are remediated by mass digitization, we also assume that our corpus
                     				expresses how digital humanities are produced in global teams that must manage
                     				cultural and technological differences. Finally, Table 1 shows the size of the

                     				stories that circulated in the press after the execution of Maximilian I, the
                     				Mexican emperor. First, we used existing digital tools that draw on NLP, a
                     				multidisciplinary field aiming to automatically process large amounts of natural
                     				language data, and we performed qualitative analysis of the automatically
                     				extracted named entities (discussed below). After this process, we analyzed the
                     				emotional contents of the corpora by drawing on such automatic NLP tools. In
                     				recent years, sentiment analysis has been applied to extensive collections of
                     				news, online product reviews, and other types of corpora. However, little
                     				attention has been paid to historical news documents [<a class="ref" href="#sprugnoli2016">Sprugnoli et al. 2016</a>].
                     				Few works have applied sentiment analysis to drama plays, literary texts, and

                     				methods trained in large amounts of data. Particularly, we used Google Cloud

                  <div class="ptext" id="p20">Our initial point of departure was to extract general statistics to explore the
                     				word frequency distributions in each subcorpus. This provided a general overview
                     				of the relevant terms in each region. It is essential to mention that the
                     				corpora were pre-processed, i.e., we tokenized it and filtered the stopwords
                     				that do not carry semantic content (prepositions, determiners, conjunctions,
                     				function words). We then used Named Entity Recognition (NER), Natural Language
                     				Processing (NLP) technology that automatically identifies words (or sequence of
                     				words) that belong to specific categories, i.e., abstract or physical entities
                     				denote proper names. Previously, these tools have been used to analyze
                     				nineteenth-century newspapers, but never in tandem to study news stories'
                     				underlying sentiments and emotions. For example, some international projects are
                     				using NLP to study big data corpora, as well as developing analytical and
                     				visualization tools, like the Media Monitoring of the Past (2020) and the

                     we
                     				extracted a list of words that appear in similar contexts to each entity of

                     				was used to automatically translate the extracted contexts into English. Since
                     				we were a multilingual team and we worked with a corpus in several languages,
                     we
                     				chose English as the lingua franca to communicate and work. Early on, we decided
                     				to translate all the news stories into English, adding certain complications to

                     				specific domains such as historical news documents. However, these statistical
                     				methods can cope, to some extent, with language variation and diachrony. This
                     				means that they do not rely on fixed lexicons and rules. Instead, they focus on
                     				different features of the text to predict how likely it is that a token is a

                     				the words, and training with millions of examples before. Due to this, our

                     				the regions of Austria and Germany. In other words, some articles reappeared in
                     				different newspapers, occurring both within and between regions. This points to
                     				the fact that there is a cultural resemblance among them, viewing Maximilian's
                     				shooting through a similar lens: a negative one in the European press. We found
                     				a similar situation in the United States newspaper. Table 4 shows an example of
                     				these repetitions. Meanwhile, in the Mexican press, this was not as common. This
                     				probably is the case because new information from far away was harder to get,
                     				and articles were reused.</div>

                     				factors. The newspaper's position is determined not just by an editorial
                     				decision but also by the need to fill space, lack of a correspondent, or the
                     				popularity of a particular text. This is also important to consider when
                     				analyzing the score from the automatic sentiment analysis because reprints will

                     				official governmental statements about the execution. Most of the published
                     				documents in Mexican newspapers are the telegrams sent between Mariano Escobedo,
                     				head of the military army in Queretaro, and Sebastian Lerdo de Tejada, Minister
                     				of State to President Juarez, in San Luis Potosi, discussing the procedure,
                     				trial, and shooting of Maximilian. We found few opinion pieces (op-ed) in the
                     				corpus, which leads us to think that there was governmental control of the
                     				press, not an unprecedented situation in Mexico. The situation is kept under
                     				control by publishing short, non-emotional telegrams, probably avoiding a more
                     				prominent international situation. After the breakthrough of telegram
                     				connections, international news events were often quickly reported through this
                     				technology that favored short notices: longer texts, with more emotional
                     				undertones and editorial considerations, came with a delay [<a class="ref" href="#oiva2019">Oiva et al. 2019</a>]. </div>

                     				is expressed through the use of adjectives such as “disgust,” “horror,”
                     				“revulsion,” “regrettable,” “tremendous sensation,” “without mercy,” “shameful,”
                     				“pain,” “sadness,” “vigorously protested”. For example, Regensburger Anzeiger in

                     				the death sentence in the published official telegrams. Sometimes, though, it
                     				exposed fake news from the time because they reported about Charlotte's death
                     in
                     				Europe and Miramón succumbing to his war injuries. Both did not happen at the
                     				time, but they seem to help the official narrative emotionally.</div>

                  <div class="ptext" id="p54">The German and Austrian press used “death” in different ways. Some reports exalt
                     				Maximilian's positive characteristics: “honorable,” “good,” “noble,” “brave,”
                     				“amiable,” “chivalrous,” “prince”. Others concentrate on blaming and finding out
                     				who was ultimately responsible for his death: Napoleon for abandoning him in
                     				Mexico or the United States for not stopping Juarez. The third type of news
                     				story was about European royals and dignitaries mourning. The US press paints
                     				his death as unfavorable by condemning it. The use of “expedition” and
                     				“catastrophe” (disaster) also alludes to sentiments. Expedition refers to
                     				England, Spain, and France's 1862 invasion of Mexico, which led to Maximilian's
                     				proclamation as emperor. German and Austrian newspapers, on the one hand,
                     				present some criticism towards the expedition, particularly towards France and
                     				Napoleon III. On the other, they call for an immediate new expedition to avenge
                     				the destiny of the Austrian Prince. The newspapers from the United States also
                     				use the term “expedition” to refer to the attack the European countries charged
                     				against Mexico but do not publish anything about a new expedition. </div>

                  <div class="ptext" id="p55">In a similar matter, “catastrophe” – meaning an emotional disaster, not a natural
                     				one– is a window into the sentimental biases of the press. While the “Mexican
                     				Expedition” was good, Maximilian's death is a “Mexican Disaster” in the Austrian
                     				and German corpora. In other words, for some of the European press, an
                     				expedition that cost thousands of lives the death of one person is a disaster,
                     				but the killing of thousands of Mexicans during the war is an expedition. As
                     				seen in the previous analysis of entities, language indicates the newspapers'
                     				point of view (see Appendix 1c and 1d).</div>

                     				once but were depicted differently: the expedition is unfortunate, and the
                     				results of the expedition were catastrophic. In other words, Maximilian's death
                     				is not perceived as a disaster. The English, Spanish and French invasion was a
                     				military intervention to the Mexican press, which became historically known as
                     				the “French Intervention” (see appendix 1e).</div>

                     				is used in all regions, there are essential differences that contrast with the
                     				use of president. Primarily, “emperor” refers to Maximilian and Franz Joseph of
                     				Austria and Napoleon III of France. Nonetheless, in the Mexican press, it is
                     				used to refer mostily to Maximilian and is followed by negative descriptors,
                     				such as “usurper”: the use of appellatives reveals the emotional underlying of
                     				news stories (see appendix 1g). </div>

                     				papers. In the Mexican publications, he is alluded to as “prince of Europe” or,
                     				in some cases, as “prisoner prince.” For the rest of the newspapers, the word is

                  <div class="ptext" id="p62">Magnus was a central person to Maximilian's shooting because he was his lawyer
                     				during the trial. Many Mexican papers mentioned him because he was constantly
                     				talked about in governmental correspondence. He is also mentioned in other
                     				international newspapers because we detected a reprint of a letter he sent.
                     				Nonetheless, he does not appear among the first 100 frequently used person

                     				to his death. It is also used similarly in the USA. In Mexico, this term does
                     				not appear. Both the mentioning or lack of it helped understand the underlying
                     				sentiment in news publications in this entity. For example, “Juarez!” does not
                     				appear among the most frequent terms in European newspapers. The algorithm
                     				probably causes this due to an OCR problem: parts of his name can be read often,
                     				but often cut. If the materials were cleaned, Juarez would probably become more
                     				prominent. </div>

                     				score by region. We have averaged the score of all news stories published by
                     				each newspaper in the different regions in these plots. Also, it can be observed
                     				how the number of sources varies in each region. The Austrians and Germans wrote
                     				many news stories showing a general tendency to one side of the sentiment
                     				continuum. For example, the Austrian bar chart has mostly negative stories,
                     				while the Mexican bar chart has mainly positive stories. We have excluded the
                     				USA from these visualizations since, for this particular case, we did not
                     				preserve the newspaper source information for each news story. This is due to
                     				the OCR cleaning and pre-processing steps involved in this specific database,
                     				where we had to filter just the text portions with relevant information about
                     				the Maximilian case. Still, the graph shows the sentiment distribution of the

                  <div class="ptext" id="p72">Table 5 shows this general tendency clearly. Mexican newspapers are inclined
                     				towards a positive direction, while European newspapers and those from the
                     				United States are prone to consider Maximilian's shooting as negative..
                     				Meanwhile, the Mexican press shows an alliance with the government in power,
                     				meaning Juarez's republic. They only printed official statements and
                     				communications from the events, meaning telegraphic messages between Mariano
                     				Escobedo in Queretaro's battlefront and Sebastian Lerdo de Tejada –Minister of
                     				Foreign Affairs under Juarez– in San Luis Potosi. Since they are mostly short
                     				and to the point messages, the sentiment analysis results closer to neutrality.
                     				The United States, while it might not agree with the imperial governmental
                     				system, opposes the actions taken by Juarez. Therefore, news stories tend to
                     				focus on the negative aspects of the shooting. The German newspapers are less
                     				extreme than the Austrian ones, maybe because Maximilian was an Austrian
                     				prince.</div>

                  <div class="ptext" id="p73">Nonetheless, the averages are very low since both sides are very close to
                     				neutrality. It should be considered that newspapers, as an institutional ethos,
                     				tend to strive for certain neutrality. Although not always achieved –like songs,
                     				poems and op-ed can be found– it does tend towards the middle and away from
                     				extreme views. </div>

                     				about Maximilian shooting provided similar results to the analysis previously
                     				done using other techniques –such as content analysis, obtaining the frequency
                     				of common words and named entities–, which shows that these digital techniques
                     				can identify the underlying ideological positions from each region. It is
                     				important to mention that the differences are small but significant enough to
                     				evidence the variations. </div>

                     				It has covered newspapers from two continents and four geographical regions. The
                     				case itself is illuminating from the perspective that it happened very near to
                     				the inauguration of the transatlantic telegraph cable and indicates how quickly
                     				news circulated. The execution was a politically loaded media event that aroused
                     				mixed feelings and ambiguous emotions. The execution was not only a domestic

                     				that the local perception of the event and polítical interests shaped the news.

                     				tended towards a neutral stance, the Austrian and German papers mainly were

                     				varied because of cultural, political, and economic reasons. On the other hand,
                     				digitized newspapers have been optically recognized with an OCR software based
                     				on particular scanning practices, which produced differences in quality.
                     				However, we argue that it is possible to transgress the OCR problem and the
                     				multilingual nature of the data, as we have done, and conduct transnational
                     				research. We drew on quantitative solutions such as named-entity recognition,
                     				frequency distributions, and textual context analysis in conjunction with
                     				qualitative analysis. This permitted us to study the underlying sentiments in
                     				the newspapers from the nineteenth century. We have a significant outcome

                     					that in the 1860s, there was no Germany in the present understanding but
                     					independent states that formed the German Confederation. In 1867, the New
                     					German Confederation was born under the Prussian leadership, excluding
                     					Bavaria, Württemberg, Baden, and Hesse-Darmstadt (that joined the
                     					Confederation again in 1870). Austria, in turn, was a multilingual,
                     					multiethnic empire that reached many present-day areas, for example,
                     					Northern Italy, Slovenia, and Romania. We have used the expressions
                     					'German' and 'Austrian region' to cover German-language papers from these
                     					areas. </span></div>
