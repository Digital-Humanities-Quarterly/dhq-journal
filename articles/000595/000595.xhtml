                  <p>In this paper, we explore the material conditions of scholarship and digital editorial
                     work that make uncovering nineteenth-century women’s lives possible in the twenty-first
                     century. Taking our project, <cite class="title italic">Digital Dinah Craik</cite>, a TEI-edition of the letters of the bestselling Victorian author, as a case study,
                     we discuss research methods that combine digital scholarly editing with genealogy
                     and prosopography. We argue that by combining research tools aimed at scholars, such
                     as the Text Encoding Initiative (TEI), and the <cite class="title italic">Oxford Dictionary of National Biography</cite>, with research tools aimed at a more general audience, such as <cite class="title italic">Ancestry.com</cite> and the <cite class="title italic">British Newspaper Archive</cite>, we can develop more creative and inclusive research methods and in turn, gain a
                     fuller picture of women’s and working-class lives.</p>

                  <div class="ptext" id="p1">Prosopography, a form of collective life writing that documents the characteristics
                     of a
                     group, has a long and gendered history. Developed as a historical research method
                     in the
                     second half of the nineteenth century and early twentieth century, by scholars studying
                     populations including Ancient Rome and seventeenth-century English Puritans [<a class="ref" href="#verboven2007">Verboven et al 2007</a>, 42], much early prosopographical research focused on the lives of men. In the
                     twenty-first century, we have inherited the legacy of this research; 85% of the entries
                     in the <cite class="title italic">Oxford Dictionary of National Biography </cite>(<cite class="title italic">ODNB</cite>), a Victorian project begun by Sir Leslie Stephen, are of notable
                     men.<a class="noteRef" href="#d4e256">[1]</a> Yet, in
                     the same historical period, prosopography has been a congenial form for documenting
                     women’s lives. As Alison Booth reminds us, in volume form, the collected lives of
                     women
                     have thrived since at least the second half of the nineteenth century, when the
                     publication of volumes aimed at a general audience of (female) readers tripled and
                     then
                     quadrupled every decade, remaining a popular form to the present day [<a class="ref" href="#booth2004">Booth 2004</a>, 29]. Booth
                     identifies collective biographies of women from as far back as the Middle Ages and
                     notes
                     that “Catalogs of notable women have flourished in plain view for centuries, while
                     generation after generation laments the absence of women from the past” [<a class="ref" href="#booth2004">Booth 2004</a>, 2–3]. On
                     the one hand, then, women have been given short shrift in scholarly prosopographies
                     such
                     as the ODNB. On the other hand, prosopography is one genre in which the lives of women
                     and other marginalized groups have often flourished, in part because the collective
                     form
                     does not require believing that any individual woman is important enough to merit
                     full-length biographical treatment, but rather that women’s history in general is
                     important. </div>
                  
                  <div class="counter"><a href="#p2">2</a></div>
                  <div class="ptext" id="p2">In the late twentieth and early twenty-first centuries, the gendered history of
                     prosopography has become intertwined with that of the digital humanities. Some of
                     the
                     most important early feminist digital humanities projects, including The Orlando Project
                     [<a class="ref" href="#brown2006a">Brown et al 2006-2019a</a>], The Women Writers’ Project [<a class="ref" href="#flanders1988">Flanders et al 1988-2019</a>], and the
                     Collective Biographies of Women [<a class="ref" href="#booth2013">Booth 2013-2017</a>], analyze and generate prosopographies
                     centered around women, in part because digitization offers the promise of more space
                     to
                     represent women’s writing and women’s lives freed from the constraints of the codex
                     form. Of course, all projects remain bound by other constraints including time and
                     funding, and as Julia Flanders et al remind us in their work on encoding proper names,
                     we must ask ourselves honestly about the feasibility and utility of this markup [<a class="ref" href="#flanders1998">Flanders et al 1998</a>, 287]. There is a tension, then, in prosopography, between a necessary selectivity about
                     which figures to include given the restraints imposed by the prosopographical format,
                     whether it is a short chapter in a collective biography or a predetermined set of
                     fields
                     in a database, and a desire for greater inclusivity, especially in terms of representing
                     marginalized lives. Yet, as we argue here, it is also possible for the restraints
                     of the
                     prosopographical format to be generative.</div>
                  
                  <div class="counter"><a href="#p3">3</a></div>
                  <div class="ptext" id="p3">In this paper, through a case study of a TEI edition of the letters of the popular
                     Victorian novelist, Dinah Craik, we argue that the restraint imposed by the TEI template
                     can lead us to a more inclusive prosopography, both in terms of the people included,
                     and
                     in the information-seeking methods we use to collect data on historical figures. Our
                     project encodes and gives biographical detail not only for every person named in the
                     letters, but also every person referenced but not necessarily named, many of whom
                     are
                     women referenced only as sisters, wives, and servants. TEI templates such as the one
                     we
                     use in Digital Dinah Craik may seem constraining; however, as Jacqueline Wernimont
                     argues, technologies such as The Orlando Projects’s XML Document Type Definition (DTD)
                     can be read as “generative” and “productive of a model of the text, but not the sole or
                     authoritative model” <span class="error"><a class="ref" href="#orlando2013">#orlando2013</a></span>. We follow Wernimont in arguing for the generative
                     possibilities of mark up; in our case the establishment of a TEI prosopographical
                     template creates an imperative to fill every element and attribute, a departure from
                     more selective standard editorial practice for nineteenth-century letters. We extend
                     recent work in digital prosopography that explores the complex process of modelling
                     people as data [<a class="ref" href="#crompton2016">Crompton et al 2016</a>] [<a class="ref" href="#hedley2018">Hedley and Kooistra 2018</a>] by demonstrating
                     how we have combined scholarly tools such as the TEI with para-scholarly genealogical
                     databases and recently digitized nineteenth-century newspapers and books to give the
                     fullest account of each <span class="monospace">&lt;person&gt;</span> entry possible. This approach is labor-intensive,
                     and our project has relied heavily on the expertise and labor of student research
                     assistants and librarians, as well as on external funding from the Social Sciences
                     and
                     Humanities Research Council of Canada (SSHRC). </div>
                  
                  <div class="counter"><a href="#p4">4</a></div>
                  <div class="ptext" id="p4">Given the work-intensive nature of our approach, a second goal of this paper is to
                     highlight the affective labor of data collection, and the ingenuity involved in toggling
                     back and forth between multiple sources to uncover data about nineteenth-century women
                     who have left little trace. This type of research does not often receive the credit
                     that
                     other forms of scholarship do. Susan Brown argues that “activities of practical benefit
                     to others” in the digital humanities, including “structuring, manipulating,
                     transforming, or remediating data” can be defined as service labor in the digital
                     humanities; this type of service labor, which often takes place in the library or
                     is
                     closely associated with librarianship, is feminized and less prestigious than other
                     forms of scholarship [<a class="ref" href="#brown2018">Brown 2018</a>, para 9]. In writing about our method of data collection in
                     detail, we respond to recent calls in feminist digital humanities to recognize the
                     labor
                     and material conditions involved in data collection. Elizabeth Losh and Wernimont
                     use
                     the acronym MEALS to signal their feminist emphasis on how the “material, embodied,
                     affective, labor-intensive, and situated character of engagements with computation
                     can
                     operate experientially for users in shared spaces.” [<a class="ref" href="#losh2018">Losh et al 2018</a>, 17]. Catherine D'Ignazio and
                     Lauren F. Klein point out that when data products are released to the public, the
                     workers who collected the data and processed them for use are rarely credited. D’Ignazio
                     and Klein make a feminist argument for showing the work involved in the entire life
                     cycle of the project <span class="error"><a class="ref" href="#df">#df</a></span>.<a class="noteRef" href="#d4e330">[2]</a> Midway through our project, we aim to document our data
                     collection as a feminist practice. </div>

                  <div class="ptext" id="p5">The Digital Dinah Craik project has been ongoing at the University of Calgary in
                     Alberta, Canada, since January 2015 and now includes more than 400 letters published
                     with Northeastern University’s TEI Archive Publishing and Access Service (TAPAS),
                     and an
                     accompanying prosopography that offers an inclusive and standardized set of information
                     on every person mentioned by name or by reference in Craik’s letters. These encoded
                     letters constitute the first phase of our project, in which we have focused on letters
                     written by Craik and addressed to her publishers and other acquaintances in artistic
                     and
                     literary fields.<a class="noteRef" href="#d4e340">[3]</a> Craik’s letters are important not only because they shed light
                     on the career of an important and well-connected author, but because of what they
                     can
                     tell us about the venues and types of publications and networks of connection that
                     could
                     sustain a nineteenth-century woman writer’s career for upwards of forty years. Craik’s
                     career is remarkable not only for its success and length but for the literary
                     sociability that sustained it, as she maintained relationships with writers, publishers
                     and artists from her adolescent years to her death. Writing about digital editions
                     of
                     early modern correspondence, Camille Desenclos argues that one of the main aims of
                     editing correspondence is “the (re)-constitution of networks”; through “links created
                     first between the sender and the addressee and then between the different people
                     mentioned within the letters, a social, commercial and even cultural network can be
                     reconstructed” [<a class="ref" href="#desenclos2016">Desenclos 2016</a>, 188]. Craik’s letters are a testament to the power of social
                     networks in a woman writer’s career, especially those centered around the home like
                     that
                     of Anna Maria and Samuel Carter Hall’s literary salons. Ultimately, we plan to use
                     our
                     encoded letters and prosopography to analyze Craik’s networks, but in this paper we
                     focus on the methods we have developed to build an inclusive prosopography that helps
                     our users glean meaning from component parts of the digital edition. </div>

                     on the complex processes of modeling people as data, rather than on a final statistical

                     means to build a prosopography, a form that tends to “flatten out differences and
                     anomalies to create a typical subject,” based on an understanding that identity is
                     intersectional, “fluid and contingent” <span class="error"><a class="ref" href="#hedley2019">#hedley2019</a></span>. As Hedley and Kooistra note, the

                     a TEI
                     prosopography, much of the research on prosopography has focused on how scholars might
                     make the best use of a completed prosopographical dataset, whether it is to support
                     research questions about a historical group of people or to integrate a prosopography
                     created using one technology with another one (for example, transforming a TEI
                     prosopography to Linked Open Data). In collecting standardized biographical data on
                     a
                     large number of people, prosopography enables researchers to aggregate individual
                     lives
                     and make data-driven claims, for example, about the average life of a Roman slave
                     or the
                     relationship between Puritanism and a positive attitude toward science [<a class="ref" href="#verboven2007">Verboven et al 2007</a>, 41–42]. Prosopography also has a long relationship with genealogy, which has been
                     used to uncover individual’s ancestors and lineage, allowing scholars to make claims,
                     for example, about the number of Roman officials from the same small network of families
                     [<a class="ref" href="#verboven2007">Verboven et al 2007</a>, 38–40]. The standardized, statistical nature of prosopography
                     makes it a natural fit for computational research. Addressing concerns that
                     prosopographical templates can decontextualize information about a person, presenting
                     it
                     as a straightforward fact, beginning in the 1990s scholars including John Bradley
                     and
                     Harold Short developed a factoid-based approach to prosopography, which uses relational
                     technology to link person records to information about people in primary sources
                     <span class="error"><a class="ref" href="#bradley2005a">#bradley2005a</a></span> <span class="error"><a class="ref" href="#bradley2005b">#bradley2005b</a></span>. This approach positions prosopography
                     as a collection of situated “factoids” with potential tensions or contradictions, rather
                     than as a standalone “‘scholarly overview’ of a person” <span class="error"><a class="ref" href="#bradley2005">#bradley2005</a></span>.
                     Recent work has focused on how to make prosopographical data more widely discoverable
                     online. The question of how to integrate prosopography with the semantic web has spurred
                     scholars to explore ontologies such as CIDOC-CRM, FOAF, and SKOS <span class="error"><a class="ref" href="#bradley2015">#bradley2015</a></span> <span class="error"><a class="ref" href="#brown2013">#brown2013</a></span>

                     process, with developing an inclusive research method for collecting prosopographical
                     data that leverages a combination of scholarly tools and databases aimed at family
                     historians. This method grows out of our project’s user orientation, which has led
                     us to
                     prioritize actions that increase the availability of users’ information interactions
                     within our digital edition. Our use of genealogical databases does not focus on
                     uncovering family networks, which are not currently part of our TEI tagset, but rather
                     on researching obscure people, particularly women and the working classes, who would
                     otherwise be lost to history. Prosopography is notoriously labor-intensive; a problem
                     with prosopographical research has been that the sources needed to complete research
                     on
                     a group of people, for example, the social background of a group of
                     geographically-diverse Oxford students in the 1950s, has been scattered across the

                     aimed at family historians, such as Ancestry or FindMyPast, offer a solution to this
                     problem by aggregating not only previously scattered parish baptismal, birth, death
                     and
                     census records, but also, more recently, data including asylum records, military

                     resources aimed at family historians.<a class="noteRef" href="#d4e440">[7]</a> Tanya Evans writes
                     that genealogists “have been dismissed by professional and academic historians... as

                     wider
                     historical community” [<a class="ref" href="#evans2011">Evans 2011</a>, 49–51]. This suspicion operates at an institutional level;
                     public libraries are much more likely to offer subscriptions to genealogical databases
                     than university libraries. Marianne Van Remoortel notes that because these databases
                     “primarily target amateur genealogists and do not count many universities among their
                     subscribers, their potential remains largely untapped” [<a class="ref" href="#vanremoortel2016">Van Remoortel 2016</a>, 134]. This concern is part
                     of a long tradition of suspicion in the academy toward those who do research without
                     the
                     training and credentials valued in the university. N. Katherine Hayles writes that
                     “most
                     professional fields in the humanities have their shadow fields,” and that scholars
                     “often regard such activity as a nuisance because it is not concerned with the questions
                     the scholar regards as important or significant” [<a class="ref" href="#hayles2012">Hayles 2012</a>, 36]. Following Hayles, we
                     demonstrate that scholars would do well to incorporate the expertise and digital tools
                     developed by and for those outside the academy.</div>

                     their perceived historical significance. Digital Dinah Craik offers a case study that
                     shows what a TEI prosopography might look like when a project’s research practices
                     disallow such selective value judgments. Three digital editions of nineteenth-century

                     which they encode the correspondents and people mentioned in the letters. The Vincent
                     Van Gogh Letters give full name dates of birth and death and occupation for all persons
                     mentioned and typically no more (though there are separate written essays detailing
                     Van

                     description including either occupation or relationship to Yonge, and a short
                     biographical sentence for those named in the letters. The Olive Schreiner Letters
                     write
                     their prosopographical data in paragraphs, with differing levels of detail. For example,
                     a Miss Battie is described as “a typist who Schreiner approached to type some of her

                     we offer three case studies of the research methods used to uncover information about

                     since the networks of writers, artists, editors and publishers that supported a
                     career like Craik’s did not have the same public visibility as those of her male
                     contemporaries. While many early digital humanities projects cast a wide net,
                     considering the texts and lives of hundreds of women writers, focusing on one
                     individual woman writers’ connections has the potential to reveal a detailed,
                     historically situated network of literary sociability. As Elisa Beshero-Bondar and
                     Elizabeth Raisanen argue, while many digital humanities projects tend to consider
                     women writers collectively, doing so may elide the historical specificity and
                     idiosyncrasies of particular women writers; we can seek to redress this problem in
                     part by launching projects devoted to single women writers, like Mary Russell
                     Mitford, the subject of Beshero-Bondar and Raisanen’s work [<a class="ref" href="#besherobondar2017">Beshero-Bondar and Raisanen 2017</a>, 741]. As we will
                     show, these egocentric networks have the potential to uncover detailed, situated,
                     and
                     inclusive historical networks in addition to building a prosopographical database

                     reference, we try to complete each element in our template. In order to research
                     people like Craik’s fellow lodger, whose forename may have been either May or Marian
                     and whose surname may have been either James or Anderson, we turn to genealogical
                     sources such as FamilySearch.com and Ancestry.com, which digitize census data, birth
                     and death certificates, marriage certificates, and probates, among other records.
                     These primary sources can help us to provide the full names, life ranges,
                     nationalities, occupations, and often the residences for many of the unknown people
                     from Craik’s letters. Usually, knowing the few facts provided in a census report such
                     as full name, occupation, and nationality, helps us to reformulate our previous
                     searches. Having more robust search terms helps us to find more information about
                     otherwise unknown lives in newspaper databases such as the British Newspaper Archive
                     and in OCR generated transcripts of nineteenth-century Google Books.</div>

                     instinctive value judgments about who counts in a collective biography. For example,
                     Craik’s two servants, whom she calls “Mary” and “Little Mary” exemplify the
                     working-class women’s lives that, as Virginia Woolf notes, were excluded from the
                     original DNB, yet both merit <span class="monospace">&lt;person&gt;</span> entries in our project’s prosopography.
                     Because we knew relatively little about the two Marys, and because Craik omits both
                     women’s surnames in her letters, we used the names that Craik used to refer to them
                     as their @xml:id values. Then, we turned to genealogical databases seeking
                     information that would help us to populate the elements in our TEI tagset. Internal
                     evidence from Craik’s letters assured us that we could disambiguate between the two
                     Marys by tracing the residents of Craik’s household through mid-century census
                     records. Craik writes about both servants in a letter to her brother in 1860, in
                     which she details a “domestic revolution” in her home:</div>

                     affordances of para-scholarly information retrieval services. To begin filling out
                     the <span class="monospace">&lt;person&gt;</span> entry for his sister, we located Henry Blackett’s early census
                     records on Ancestry.com. In this case, we used information from the Craik Site Index,
                     but we find that low-barrier digital sources such as Wikipedia often provide enough
                     information to begin an effective search on genealogical platforms. Using Henry
                     Blackett’s birth and death dates and his place of birth, we searched British census
                     records, focussing on the first two decades of his life, when he might have lived
                     with his parents and siblings. The census for 1851 shows a 25-year-old Henry Blackett
                     living at 16 Bedford Row, Islington, Middlesex with his widowed mother Martha, his
                     three younger sisters, two visitors (his future wife and mother-in-law), and two
                     servants. This step narrowed our search to one among three Blackett sisters: Martha
                     (b. 23 August 1822), Harriet (b. 2 March 1829), or Catherine (b. 30 June 1831)
                     (Census 1851). It also helped build a basic TEI template and stub entries for the
                     Blacketts, which could help us to verify that all of our future searches pertained
                     to
                     the same Blackett family. Next, we searched for Henry Blackett’s household data
                     around the time that Craik was writing about his sister’s declining mental health.
                     In
                     April 1861, less than six months after Craik composed her letter, Henry Blackett
                     lived at Westside, Ealing, Middlesex with his wife Ellen, his five children, and his
                     sister, Harriet [<a class="ref" href="#census1861a">Census 1861a</a>]. In this census report, Harriet was not listed as a

                     unable to provide a precise date of death of Harriet Blackett. In March 1864, she
                     married a man named Joseph James and adopted the much more common name “Harriet
                     James.” Without a middle name on record, we have been unable to discern between the

                     her lifetime. In four letters that Craik wrote to the publisher Alexander Macmillan
                     in 1860, she makes passing reference to a young writer named Miss Blyth, who was
                     attempting to publish one of her novels with Macmillan and Company. These four

                     publishability of the work under review. Craik’s opinion of the young writer was
                     generally favourable. She writes:</div>

                  <div class="ptext" id="p28">Creating a prosopographical entry for Miss Blyth proved challenging: with nothing
                     but
                     a common British surname to begin our research, we had to amalgamate data from a mix
                     of scholarly and para-scholarly information resources before we could initiate a
                     query in genealogical databases. Because Craik mentions Miss Blyth with proper names
                     throughout the Berg letters, we encoded all instances with the <span class="monospace">&lt;persName&gt;</span> tag
                     and created an <span class="monospace">@xml:id</span> for “MissBlyth” in our Craik Site Index. We added a <span class="monospace">@ref</span>
                     attribute to the original <span class="monospace">&lt;persName&gt;</span> tags and pointed them to the <span class="monospace">@xml:id</span>.
                     Open-source digitization projects such as Google Books and the Internet Archive were
                     essential for initiating a prosopographical record for Miss Blyth. Instead of working
                     with the sparse biographical information and common surname that we had on hand, we
                     started a search profile by uncovering the manuscript she was working on with
                     Macmillan and Company in 1860. Craik’s letters reveal that Miss Blyth’s manuscript
                     was entitled Aunt Jessie [<a class="ref" href="#craik1860c">Craik 1860c</a>] and included characters named Herbert, Mabel,
                     Millicent, and Jackson [<a class="ref" href="#craik1860b">Craik 1860b</a>]. Two characters named “M &amp; J” were engaged
                     in courtship [<a class="ref" href="#craik1860b">Craik 1860b</a>]. Craik’s reflections on Miss Blyth and her manuscript gave
                     us further insight into the subject matter. On Aunt Jessie, Craik writes that “the
                     Crimea life is as fresh &amp; natural-like as if she had seen it – she must have got
                     it from nature, secondhand: as I got from Ben – ” [<a class="ref" href="#craik1860c">Craik 1860c</a>]. Furthermore, Craik’s
                     first response to Aunt Jessie was “it garred me greet” [<a class="ref" href="#craik1860c">Craik 1860c</a>] — a Scottish
                     colloquialism which roughly means “compelled me greatly” [<a class="ref" href="#gar">Gar</a>, vol 2]. The latter of
                     these two details puzzled us: Macmillan was Scottish, and Craik might have been
                     dipping into colloquialisms as a form of amicability, but, it was also possible that
                     either the writer or the content of Aunt Jessie was Scottish. With these details in
                     mind, we began our search for titles similar to Aunt Jessie that were published in
                     the latter portion of 1860 — hoping, of course, that Macmillan heeded Craik’s advice
                     to publish the tale.</div>

                  <div class="ptext" id="p29"> To create a prosopographical entry for an unknown writer like Miss Blyth, we had
                     to
                     adopt an inclusive and iterative research process, combining fragments from public
                     and academic information resources including Google Books, the Internet Archive,
                     newspaper, scholarly, and eventually, genealogical databases. Just as we expected,
                     searches in the Orlando Project and elsewhere retrieved many writers named Blyth,
                     including Estelle Blyth, Myrna Blyth, E. H. Blyth, and Sophie Veitch, “a Scotswoman”
                     and sensation novelist “who lived the early part of her life abroad,” wrote travel
                     books in the 1860s, and sometimes used the pseudonym “J. A. St John Blythe” <span class="error"><a class="ref" href="#brown2006">#brown2006</a></span>.
                     Eventually, we found a novel on Google Books called The Moor Cottage,
                     published by Macmillan and Company in 1861 [<a class="ref" href="#beverley1861">Beverley 1861</a>]. By conducting free text
                     searches in this novel, we found a main character named Aunt Jessie with secondary
                     characters named Herbert, Mabel, Millicent, and Jackson. We verified that this novel
                     featured the Crimean War, and found that the plot included a romance that confirmed
                     Craik’s comments praising the “lovemaking between Millicent &amp; Jackson” [<a class="ref" href="#craik1860c">Craik 1860c</a>].
                     The Moor Cottage was authored by a writer named May Beverley; yet, our
                     prosopography entry in progress indicated that this person might have shared an
                     identity with Miss Blyth. While researching May Beverley, we found that she published
                     books for young readers between 1859 and 1871, including Little Estella and Other
                     Fairy Tales with Macmillan in 1859. We had trouble connecting this author with the
                     name Blyth until we found an 1874 advertisement for May Beverley’s The City of the
                     Plain, and other Tales edited by Reverend E. H. Blyth, Hammersmith [<a class="ref" href="#hayes1874">Hayes 1874</a>].</div>

                  <div class="ptext" id="p30">As our example of Miss Blyth demonstrates, an openness toward combining diverse
                     scholarly and para-scholarly information resources can afford more inclusive
                     representations of marginalized figures in prosopographical research. After learning
                     the name of May Beverley’s one-time editor Reverend E. H. Blyth, we learned that
                     Blyth had a sister who shared his literary inclinations. Mary Popham Blyth is listed
                     in the personography of Troy J. Bassett’s At the Circulating Library: A Database of
                     Victorian Fiction 1837–1901 [<a class="ref" href="#basset2018a">Basset 2018a</a>]. She was born in Beverley, Yorkshire
                     [<a class="ref" href="#basset2018b">Basset 2018b</a>]. May Beverley, then, was a pseudonym that combined a diminutive of
                     Mary Blyth’s forename with her place of birth. As we researched her career, we
                     learned that Mary Popham Blyth wrote under both her given name, her initials M. P.
                     B., and her pseudonym from the years 1859 to 1871. She was also an amateur artist
                     whose works appeared in the India Office Library [<a class="ref" href="#archer1969">Archer 1969</a>, 133]. After connecting
                     the pseudonym to the author mentioned in the letter, we were able to fill in the tags
                     required by our TEI prosopography. The profile on Troy J. Bassett’s At the
                     Circulating Library catalyzed our <span class="monospace">&lt;person&gt;</span> entry for the <span class="monospace">xml:id</span> Miss Blyth, but
                     we verified the information with sources such as Ancestry.com, Familysearch.com,
                     Google Books, and the Internet Archive. Census records helped us correct her birth
                     year from 1831 to 1841, while also adding key information such as <span class="monospace">&lt;occupation&gt;</span>
                     and <span class="monospace">&lt;nationality&gt;</span>. Our <span class="monospace">&lt;note&gt;</span> was populated with information from Craik’s

                  <div class="ptext" id="p31">Our research does not always yield such certainty over the identity of a person, and
                     we find that it is important to be able to encode for levels of certainty in
                     identifying prosopographical subjects. Publishing was
                     often a family business in the nineteenth century, and in the case of Craik’s first
                     publishers, Chapman and Hall, we are not always certain whether letters addressed
                     to
                     “Mr. Chapman” were meant to reach Edward Chapman, founder of the firm, or his cousin,
                     Frederic Chapman, who took on major responsibilities at the firm following Hall’s
                     death in 1847 [<a class="ref" href="#patten2004">Patten 2004</a>]. In these cases, we make use of the TEI’s certainty
                     attribute (<span class="monospace">@cert</span>) with a “low,” “medium” or “high” attribute value to qualify the
                     degrees of certainty in interpretative encoding. For example, in a letter that Craik
                     wrote between the 6th and 7th of December 1855, she recounts the contents of her
                     recent mail to her brother, Ben. Craik writes that she received “a box of good things
                     from an Aunt of the Pmalderites a nice old lady who promised me shortbread &amp; I
                     don’t know what &amp; sent a box-full” [<a class="ref" href="#craik1855">Craik 1855</a>]. Based on what we already know
                     about Craik’s social networks, we inferred that “the Pmalderites” was a reference to
                     the family of Craik’s friend Alleyn Lyell Reade — a Scottish writer and editor whom
                     Craik often visited at his dwelling, Pmalder Cottage, in Greenock. However, the
                     letter did not produce adequate leads to follow up on our suspicions. Like most
                     genealogical research, our prosopographical research can be an endless back-and-forth
                     process of consulting multiple digital platforms and analogue materials, and
                     unfortunately, it does not always yield successful results. </div>

                  <div class="ptext" id="p32">Our difficulties in identifying historic people are further compounded by working
                     with unclear handwritten manuscript materials. Proper names can be challenging to
                     work with; place and person names are among the most difficult words for a
                     twenty-first century researcher to read accurately. Whereas the original recipient
                     of
                     the letter was embedded in the same social network as the letter writer, the
                     twenty-first century reader must rely on a knowledge of the sender’s handwriting and
                     its peculiarities as well as a general sense of common surnames in nineteenth-century
                     England to make an educated guess as to what the proper name might be. There has been
                     research into proper names using prosopography; omnastics has, for example identified
                     common slave names in ancient Rome [<a class="ref" href="#verboven2007">Verboven et al 2007</a>, 37–38]. Our research problem
                     again begins with developing the prosopography in the first place rather than
                     analyzing a completed dataset, and with paleography rather than omnastics. Put
                     simply, how should a researcher develop a <span class="monospace">&lt;person&gt;</span> entry for a name they cannot
                     read? Again, a wide search encompassing a range of sources can help. While it was
                     not
                     at first apparent to us whether a person who appeared to be Craik’s neighbor was
                     named “Miss Wilkinson” or “Miss Wilkensen” or something else altogether; genealogical
                     records reveal that a Sarah Wilkinson was a neighbor of Craik’s, and newspaper
                     articles surrounding Craik’s adoption of a daughter and neighbor Miss Wilkinson’s
                     involvement confirm the reading. As the example of Miss Wilkinson shows, addresses,
                     a
                     key component of correspondence, can clarify a person’s identity when all else fails.

                  <div class="ptext" id="p33">Recognizing the importance of mobility and propinquity in Craik’s career led us to
                     change our initial template and adopt a <span class="monospace">&lt;residence&gt;</span> tag in our TEI
                     prosopography. The <span class="monospace">&lt;residence&gt;</span> tag is useful both in terms of clarifying both
                     identity and temporal location: it can clarify both the identity of those referred
                     to
                     in a letter and the date of the letter. Because nineteenth-century census information
                     was collected door-to-door, address information for historical subjects is also
                     available in genealogical databases. In combination with datable w3c attributes @from
                     and <span class="monospace">@to</span> or <span class="monospace">@notBefore</span> and <span class="monospace">@notAfter</span>, we have begun to use the <span class="monospace">&lt;residence&gt;</span> tag
                     to track the addresses of Craik’s closest friends, colleagues, and collaborators.
                     Developing a list of Craik’s residences and the timeframe that she lived there as
                     part of her prosopographical entry helps us to narrow down dates for letters with
                     no
                     dateline; frequently, her letters will include an address so that the recipient would
                     know where to write back, but a partial dateline that is missing the year or is
                     absent altogether, since the recipient would have presumably known what year it was.
                     We have also included residences for Craik’s close friends and associates, since it
                     is not uncommon for her to write a letter from a friend’s residence, or to refer
                     within a letter to a friend by residence or street name. When a letter is addressed
                     from 1 Doune Terrace, we can infer that Craik was visiting the publisher Robert
                     Chambers in Edinburgh when it was written. Sometimes, as in the case of the reference
                     to the Pmalderites, Craik will refer to a family by their residence. For example,
                     on
                     Christmas Eve in 1886, Craik records in her diary “Went to Eden Cottage to see the
                     family collection of babies — a very sweet sight — to the delight of grandparents
                     —
                     parents — uncles &amp; aunts.” The residence tag in our prosopography allows us to
                     quickly determine that the Miers family, close friends and neighbors of Craik’s with
                     connections to Brazil, lived at Eden Cottage. The addition of the <span class="monospace">&lt;residence&gt;</span>
                     tag, which disambiguates dates and people, is thus especially useful for new members
                     of the project as it creates an accessible internal reference. It has also provided
                     the basis for further research into geolocating Victorian residences in order to
                     explore the role of propinquity — frequent, unplanned interaction due to physical
                     proximity — in women writers’s careers. </div>

                     be practical to research an obscure person at a later date and instead focus on
                     completing a transcription of a long letter. A lack of information may also prevent
                     completion. Sometimes, searching a genealogical database with nothing but the fact
                     that someone with the surname “Linos” helped Craik to organize a small glee club
                     around the year 1862 is not enough to work with. In such cases, use of stub entries,
                     which may be as simple as whichever part of a name is mentioned in a letter (first
                     names in case of servants or intimate friends, last names in case of middle-class
                     friends, acquaintances and professional connections), plus an <span class="monospace">@xml:id</span> and gender
                     attribute. If more information arises, these stub entries can be fleshed out at a
                     later date. Nevertheless, the number of lives we have been able to uncover by using
                     all sources available to us, regardless of their perceived scholarly value, has been
                     illuminating. </div>

                  <div class="ptext" id="p35">Current digital research methods are shifting the boundaries around whose labor,
                     methods, expertise, and tools can be included in definitions of scholarship. In our
                     work on Digital Dinah Craik, we embrace this shift as we develop an inclusive and
                     situated practice of digital prosopography designed to aid the users of our digital
                     edition in their engagements with Craik’s encoded correspondence. Combining the
                     scholarly editorial practices set out by the TEI with genealogical databases and
                     other para-scholarly resources has led us to a research methodology that takes full
                     advantage of the digital resources that are available to us at this historical
                     moment. Inclusivity is at the helm of our research practice; it drives our methods
                     for populating the TEI prosopography with marginalized lives from Craik’s
                     correspondence, and it propels us toward diverse research methods for completing our
                     TEI tagsets. Our research team uses and acknowledges our debt to a range of scholarly
                     and para-scholarly information resources for prosopography, many of which have been
                     designed for researchers who work outside of the institutional structures of the
                     university, and in the “shadow fields” of the academy [<a class="ref" href="#hayles2012">Hayles 2012</a>, 36]. Genealogical
                     databases such as Ancestry and FamilySearch and mass digitization projects like
                     Google Books, the Internet Archive, and the British Newspaper Archive have long
                     served the information needs of public researchers, both hobbyists and professionals.
                     Originally, these para-scholarly resources fulfilled our project’s needs where
                     traditional scholarly databases have fallen short, and they have gradually become
                     paramount to the success of our prosopographical method. In short, where in the past
                     many of these lives would have been glossed over in edited letters, the combination
                     of the TEI and genealogical resources allows us to pause and expand our understanding
                     of Craik’s networks to include women like, Harriet Blackett, Mary Popham Blyth, Mary
                     Bonnar, and Mary Chandler. It is our hope that our prosopography, which traces the
                     lives of everyone mentioned in one author’s correspondence, serves to shed some light
                     on lives that often go unremarked.</div>

                  <div class="ptext" id="p36"> To conclude, we would also like to suggest that a more inclusive research process
                     has the potential to build a wider community of practice. Our work on the Digital
                     Dinah Craik prosopography has led our project team to open our research communities
                     as well as our research practices. Our approach, method, and practice of digital
                     prosopography developed from sustained interactions among project members with a
                     variety of community research experiences. Our project is situated in a traditional
                     academic setting, with work taking place in the university library before the
                     COVID-19 pandemic. It began as a collaboration among academic researchers (one
                     professor with a small team of graduate and undergraduate students), and it has been
                     shaped by lessons learned among genealogy collectives at the local public library.
                     Over time, academic librarians, including Christie Hurrell and Ingrid Reiche, public
                     library staff, especially Janice Parker, and local genealogists, including Alyson
                     Bennett, have contributed to Digital Dinah Craik, often importing techniques and
                     sources from their own communities of practice. Our use of genealogical databases
                     in
                     particular draws on the expertise of those with a background working in the public
                     library system. We would suggest that one larger outcome of utilizing a diverse range
                     of scholarly and para-scholarly sources is the ability to build a more diverse
                     community of practice that incorporates knowledge and expertise from outside of the
                     academy.</div>

                     our search to the long nineteenth century (1789 to 1914), women fare marginally
                     better, making up 14% (rather than 13%) of notable people (4,698 women and 30,135
                     men). Other scholars have noticed this issue and the <cite class="title italic">ODNB</cite> is

                     mark up and race further underscores the point that data is never neutral. For
                     example, Jessica Marie Johnson offers black digital practice as a positive
                     alternative to the digitization of eighteenth and nineteenth century records of
                     slavery which threaten to replicate the violence of the slave ship register [<a class="ref" href="#johnson2018">Johnson 2018</a>, 57].
                     Working at the intersection of Black studies and the digital humanities, Kim
