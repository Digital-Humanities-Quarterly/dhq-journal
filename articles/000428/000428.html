                  <p>This article articulates a digital adaptation of enumerative bibliography and
                     argues for its recuperative potential in feminist literary history. Digital
                     enumerative bibliography uses bibliographical structures within a relational
                     database that allows researchers to track more relevant metadata such as
                     geographical location of subject matter, language, and time period. Whereas
                     traditional enumerative bibliographies use a hierarchy of textual data, a
                     relational database creates a nexus that facilitates new kinds of research
                     queries. As an example, we offer our digital project the <cite class="title italic">Women in Book History Bibliography</cite> and use its 1,550 citations as a
                     dataset to trace what is women’s book history. We then advocate for digital
                     enumerative bibliography as a form of feminist recovery efforts that recovers
                     not only primary texts but scholarship about them.

                  <div class="ptext" id="p1">In 2014, Michelle Levy asked, “Do Women
                     Have a Book History?” She continues that Robert Darnton’s [<a class="ref" href="#darnton1982">Darnton 1982</a>] influential communication circuit is “silent on the question of gender”
                     and “too rigid to capture the full range
                     of women’s involvement in the production and dissemination of literary
                     writing even during the print era”
                      [<a class="ref" href="#levy2014">Levy 2014</a>, 297; 300]. This question is one that resonates more widely, especially for feminist
                     book historians who encounter a wide range of literature that is rich in its
                     history of production processes, readings of bibliographic objects, and
                     histories of circulation and reception, but largely “silent”
                     about gender. Levy’s question is indicative of the key issue with women’s book
                     history: despite significant work in the field, there is no narrative, no
                     central theses or arguments that join together the diverse body of work on
                     women’s work and labor. The phrase “women’s book history” is itself rare,
                     as it appears less than ten times in the scholarship that we have located. This
                     had led many to believe that the answer to Levy’s question might be “no,”
                     or perhaps “not yet.”

                  <div class="ptext" id="p2">In response, we began to gather data in the form of secondary source citations in
                     an enumerative bibliography on the intersection of women’s lives and book
                     history. In 2016, this became the <cite class="title italic">Women in Book History
                        Bibliography</cite> (<cite class="title italic">WBHB</cite>). The <cite class="title italic">WBHB</cite> is an open-access bibliography that, in its
                     earliest iteration, used lists generated in Zotero to create listings of sources
                     which intersected with our definitions of women and book history, which were
                     clustered in established subfields like authorship, manuscript studies, reading,
                     and the book trades. We began this project because, similarly to the question
                     that motivated Levy’s article, we had an issue with a lack of a clear
                     disciplinary history to pull from in our dissertation research on early modern
                     English print culture. We hoped that by sharing secondary sources we could help
                     others as we helped each other. Thanks to a generous grant from what is now the
                     Center of Digital Humanities Research (CoDHR) at Texas A&amp;M University, in
                     2017 we transitioned the bibliography to a MySQL database with a front end
                     written in Django. We capitalized on the capabilities of a relational database
                     to include filters that allow users to isolate sources by tags including
                     geographic location, language, year, author, and a more robust list of subfields
                     that includes archival studies, digital media, LGBTQ+, critical race theory, and
                     indigeneity.

                     work “count” by writing it into the historical record, is a
                     feminist act that preserves the past while shaping the future. When we first
                     launched the site, we were not prepared for the enthusiastic response, nor that
                     this project was a visible indicator of a growing pushback against what one
                     might think of as “traditional” bibliography, the field that
                     grew from the work of W.W. Greg, Fredson Bowers, and G. Thomas Tanselle.
                     Bibliography as a discipline has its origins in studies on the Bible and
                     Shakespeare, and has, historically, not focused on women’s experiences nor those
                     of other under-represented subject positions and genres. Considering the
                     development of women’s book history alongside black bibliography, queer
                     bibliography, the postcolonial and indigenous book, and the global book suggests
                     that one future of digital and material studies is as an activist discourse with
                     deep ties to critical theory.

                  <div class="ptext" id="p4">To explore the latter possibility, this essay uses the example of our digital
                     enumerative bibliography to demonstrate that feminist approaches to digital
                     humanities and book history have much to offer the recovery of women’s literary
                     history and promote its ongoing construction. They work together to create new
                     methodologies and revise existing structures to correctly position women’s
                     contributions to textual production in a historically and materially accurate
                     context. While our larger concerns are on the history of the book, this
                     article’s primary focus is on bibliographic methods for feminist intervention.
                     We use bibliography’s epistemological work as a revisionist methodology that
                     counteracts patriarchal structures as it reorganizes itself around feminist
                     ones. Secondly, we look at the larger implications of data gathering on the
                     epistemology of book history and draw conclusions about what a feminist
                     historiography reveals about women’s history and studies on the book. Lastly, we
                     touch on the structural implications of working on marginal subjects while being
                     precariously employed. This dual precarity adds an urgency to the responsible
                     preservation of digital literary recovery efforts, and we provide a roadmap for
                     thinking through these issues.

                     bibliography. It is an important ancestor to book history, as one aspect of the
                     field grew from debates in textual and historical bibliography in the 1970s and
                     1980s [<a class="ref" href="#howsam2006">Howsam 2006</a>]. Similarly, Amy E. Earhart [<a class="ref" href="#earhart2015">Earhart 2015</a>] argues that digital humanities pulls from
                     bibliography in its methods and some of its more conservative ideologies that
                     have prioritized work on white male literary subjects.<a class="noteRef" href="#d4e301">[2]</a> Intervening
                     within these narratives allows us to repurpose bibliography in both material and

                  <div class="ptext" id="p6">The <cite class="title italic">WBHB</cite> began as a simple enumerative bibliography,
                     as this was the most familiar tool to solve a common problem — finding and
                     organizing sources around a central topic. Enumerative bibliographies are
                     accessible for both creators and users. Every scholar has experience with them
                     as references at the end of articles and books. They not only let a researcher
                     collect data, but present it in a hierarchy that suggests importance and the
                     relationships of textual data [<a class="ref" href="#harmon1989">Harmon 1989</a>, 47]. Enumerative
                     bibliography is a deceptively simple form that can seemingly be done with little
                     critical thought: adopting a common citation style and plugging information into
                     a reference manager can generate a bibliography in seconds. These lists are
                     simple, but they are powerful. They are the tools “for which the non-bibliographer
                     breathes a silent prayer of thanks whenever beginning a new research
                     project”
                      [<a class="ref" href="#pionke2013">Pionke 2013</a>, 6]. Its influence on field-building and encouraging future scholarship is
                     substantial. For example, in the early twentieth century African-American
                     literary scholars like Dorothy B. Porter used enumerative bibliography to
                     establish the field as a legitimate discourse [<a class="ref" href="#porter1945">Porter 1945</a>]. In
                     short, bibliographic lists become the first step towards canon development, and
                     from there to actual disciplinary creation.

                     reimagined around one of bibliography’s key concepts: purpose. Gregson Bowers
                     argues that bibliography is intimately connected to data’s imagined purpose. He
                     believes that to collect information for the sake of itself would only make
                     bibliography “a limited science”
                      [<a class="ref" href="#bowers1949">Bowers 1949</a>, 8]. To meet users’ needs of referencing material that is otherwise
                     uncollected, we still use the visuals of a printed bibliography on the front end
                     to help users encounter data in familiar ways. We have also retained the
                     taxonomies of a print-based bibliography as an organizational structure by using
                     the same fields that a citation generator like Zotero would use: author, title,
                     publisher, and year.

                     bibliographic hierarchy to a nexus of interconnected data that surrounds a core
                     organizing function — the title of a secondary source. As Stephen Ramsay writes,

                     existing epistemological work of disciplinary lists. Databases can supplement
                     standard bibliographic data by tracking information that is normally latent
                     rather than explicit in common citation styles, such as format of publication; a
                     citation format will change based on if it is a journal article or book, but
                     most humanities citation styles do not explicitly include format. Our database’s
                     taxonomy does. There is consequently a shift in thinking about bibliographic
                     data’s use beyond pointing to sources for further reading. It allows us to ask
                     questions about our field by what language we use to title our sources and
                     where, when, and in what format we publish. Further, databases allow for
                     extraction of these individual pieces of data as they meet changing criteria
                     based on users’ interests, which a static list does not. This means that digital
                     enumerative bibliography facilitates new kinds of research than print-focused

                     in and by what criteria. As Daniel V. Pitti observes, it is difficult to reduce
                     the complexities of historical and material documents to the constraints of
                     database design [<a class="ref" href="#pitti2004">Pitti 2004</a>, 476]. However, queries plugged
                     into a well-designed database can “reveal intellectual relations
                     between unique entities, but also between categories or classes of
                     entities based on shared characteristics”
                      [<a class="ref" href="#pitti2004">Pitti 2004</a>, 477]. We designed the <cite class="title italic">WBHB</cite> to uncover
                     “intellectual relations” in the shared characteristics of
                     language, geography, subject, and time period for our sources. For example,
                     analyzing sources in the database that focus on manuscript or print shows that
                     there is a distinct shift in scholarly emphasis from manuscript to print in the
                     English Renaissance. This is an important tool for the feminist book historian
                     studying English literature, as a point of interest is that the rise of print
                     was a shift toward a form of textual production that favored male writers for
                     many years [<a class="ref" href="#ezell2003">Ezell 2003</a>]. As another example, sorting the database
                     by the LGBT+ tag shows that most of the sources we have located in this area
                     focus on late-twentieth century periodicals in the United States, and there is a
                     dearth of pre-modernist scholarship in English on queer identities and the
                     material book or a queered production of the book. While one must be careful
                     about making broad arguments based on an artificial construction of sources,
                     these searches nevertheless indicate that expanding enumerative bibliography to
                     the full relational potential of a database allows scholars to ask dramatically

                     a feminist desire to conceptualize this experience. As an example, Leslie Howsam
                     wrote in her groundbreaking 1998 article: 
                     <blockquote>
                        <p>

                           concealed by thematic theoretical models: most of the women whose work
                           in the book cycle has been so painstakingly discovered by researchers
                           have been atypical individuals, outstanding anomalies in a cultural
                           field dominated by men. Most publishers and editors have been men; the

                           works were men; printing trade workers at all levels were almost always
                           men … For the most part, what [Lucien] Febvre and [Henri-Jean] Martin
                           called “the little world of the book” has
                           been a male domain.

                     women have always been physically present if not always leaving material traces
                     that are as easily identifiable. What the sources in the <cite class="title italic">WBHB</cite> emphasize is that women’s experiences are much harder to grasp
                     and more likely to slip by as invisible labor.

                     bibliographies to fill in gaps and silences in parallel ways to those who
                     reconstruct lost voices in the archives. As Lauren F. Klein demonstrates with
                     James Hemmings [<a class="ref" href="#klein2013">Klein 2013</a>], data visualization and mapping can
                     capture lost histories and combat the forces of erasure that leave important
                     histories behind. What the <cite class="title italic">WBHB</cite> suggests is that
                     the visualization and analysis of secondary sources can also uncover important
                     trends about how scholarship on marginal figures slips in and out of our value
                     systems. Often “recovery efforts” begin with the assumption
                     that something is lost only to discover it was just overlooked, hiding in plain
                     sight. Collecting and analyzing secondary sources on women and the book has
                     shown us this is the case with book history.

                     sources on a marginal topic yields is that we can identify <em class="emph">how</em>
                     these subjects became marginal in contemporary discourses. To challenge our own
                     conceptions of the field, we approach sources through a generous taxonomy and
                     metadata structure. If the scholarly source is about women or women-identifying
                     subjects in a substantial way, and intersects with areas of interest to book
                     historians (categorized through the “Fields” section
                     of the database), it is included. While there are still value judgments in this
                     process, they are more transparent when one strips away obscuring language and
                     the heavy weight of what is “really” book history. Often work
                     that is within book history in its methods or approach does not use the phrase
                     “book history,” just as work that is interested in racial power
                     structures does not always signal itself as “critical race theory.” By
                     looking at what a source <em class="emph">does</em> instead of how it positions itself,
                     we have found many more items than anticipated and consequently have had to
                     rethink our definitions of such seemingly concrete ideas as <span class="hi italic">women, the book, textual production, and authorship.</span> Because of its
                     generous approach to source indexing, the <cite class="title italic">WBHB</cite>
                     connects sources on women printers in Renaissance Italy to the feminist zines of
                     the late twentieth century in the U.S. to contemporary fantasy print culture in
                     Korea, because all of it is produced by women. The sheer variety and depth of
                     scholarship in this area sits in sharp contrast to how little the field
                     considers the diversity of sources in its major narratives.

                     assumptions from a field-specific approach to a labor-specific approach. As a
                     result, the data this approach yields suggests one reason that women are
                     difficult to identify in general book history scholarship is a byproduct of the
                     field’s methodological and discursive practices. Anglo-American men are the
                     numerical majority of subjects and are more likely to have their experiences
                     recorded in accessible ways: papers in archives, surviving letters, published
                     memoirs. Since book history itself privileges these documents, men’s experiences
                     dominate how the field is understood. Furthermore, the language of book history,
                     by design, obscures the subject in favor of the object of study and the process
                     by which the object came into being [<a class="ref" href="#williams2009">Williams and Abbott 2009</a>, 2]. The
                     unintentional result of this practice is that it is easy to overlook what kinds
                     of subjects are privileged and how the objects of study may be more queered,
                     gendered, and raced than is generally acknowledged.

                        International Bibliography</cite>, one can get a sense of some of these
                     issues. We selected two popular subjects as test cases: the book trades and
                     authorship. To keep the numbers at a manageable rate, we also added
                     “England” as a search term for both. On the <cite class="title italic">MLA</cite>, searching for the “book trade” and “England” yields
                     314 results.<a class="noteRef" href="#d4e612">[3]</a> Adding in
                     the search term “women” narrows the number down to 16, not all of which are
                     about women subjects. If one replaces “women” with “men,” there are
                     nine sources, even fewer than that of women. This leaves 290 sources that are
                     unmarked by gender. One finds something similar with authorship.
                     “Authorship” and “England” yields 323 results, which is narrowed
                     to 49 by including the search term “women.” An additional 19 are indexed
                     with “men.” Alternative search terms such as “gender” do not add to
                     these numbers in significant ways. In both cases, a small proportion of sources
                     are indexed by gender of any presentation.

                     histories, as the Oxford editions emphasize, and while men’s experiences can be
                     very enlightening for studies on women, they are only occasionally written in a
                     way that acknowledges the limitations of their conclusions. That is, without the
                     presence of non-male subjects, it is uncommon to find an interrogation of the
                     various levels of privilege and authority historical subjects experience that
                     could indicate how women and other minorities fit into these narratives.

                     characterization of how book history discusses its subjects. The sources we have
                     found on women and the book indicate that when faced with this reality, work on
                     women tends to flag itself as participating in an alternative discourse — it
                     includes the words “women,”
                     “women’s,” or “gender” in the title or as a keyword. More than 60% of
                     the sources in the <cite class="title italic">WBHB</cite> are marked by this
                     language. In book history scholarship, to tell the story by women is to
                     <em class="emph">position</em> it as the story of women. The same cannot be said of
                     scholarship on male subjects, which, as the <cite class="title italic">MLA</cite>
                     examples demonstrate, rarely identifies itself as only about men. It seems that
                     women are either gendered or ignored. As more information is uncovered about
                     women’s roles in the history of the book, this positioning may be less useful
                     than it has been. Future studies of women’s book history may be able to locate
                     with more authority and nuance where the gender of their subjects is and is not
                     a factor in the production of text, as well as when it is a hindrance versus
                     when it is a boon. And as our current society interrogates the usefulness of
                     gender and sex as categories, it is likely that these characterizations will
                     increasingly be assigned to performative categories rather than human features,

                     experience for many researchers, but they also point to a different issue of
                     access: access to the secondary sources. There is a large set of issues
                     surrounding access to secondary work that mimic the challenges of primary
                     sources: paywalls and database subscriptions, the high cost of limited run
                     academic books, and the complicated ethics of services like <cite class="title italic">Academia.edu</cite> that tentatively facilitate sharing of information.
                     Another is just finding the sources one is looking for to begin with. This is
                     especially true when comparing what is on the <cite class="title italic">MLA</cite>
                     with what actually exists in the field, especially when that field’s definition
                     and values are still unformed. As an example, we compared the sources in the <span class="hi italic">MLA</span> to what we have been able to collect in the <cite class="title italic">WBHB</cite>, and the difference is marked. Since all our
                     sources include women, we filtered by “England” and the subject. For the
                     book trades, our filters yield 178 sources. Compared to the 16 sources that
                     researchers are assured of having from the <cite class="title italic">MLA</cite>,
                     this is a significant improvement. Filtering by authorship yields a similar
                     result: while the <cite class="title italic">MLA</cite> offered 49 sources for
                     women’s authorship in England, the <cite class="title italic">WBHB</cite> has
                     356.

                     perfect in its comprehensive surveillance of its intended topic, despite its
                     best efforts. It is also true that the ways in which the <cite class="title italic">MLA</cite> indexes sources inhibits visibility when it comes to English
                     women and the book trades and authorship. The disparity between the <cite class="title italic">WBHB</cite> and the <cite class="title italic">MLA</cite> suggests
                     a key difference in indexing practices. According to its online guidelines, the
                     <cite class="title italic">MLA</cite> employs a very broad vocabulary of 68,000
                     words used by a team of professional indexers and selected field bibliographers
                     [<a class="ref" href="#FAQ">FAQ n.d.</a>]. The <cite class="title italic">MLA</cite> also appears to
                     not retroactively allow keywords to change (nor can we imagine many authors
                     would find value in re-indexing dated scholarship). These are practical
                     decisions, but they mean that listed sources do not always reflect how current
                     scholarship is categorized and understood. Book history is an interdisciplinary
                     field, so it is logical that authors and indexers may not always select the same
                     terms that would link together studies that are truly on the same topics.
                     Scholars may be participating in studies of book history implicitly rather than
                     explicitly (as noted above), or pieces may have been published in an emerging
                     discourse that now goes by another name. Since book history is a relatively new
                     term for a broad and complicated field, it is not wholeheartedly embraced by its
                     practitioners who may see the term as a needless derivative of historical
                     bibliography, limited in its emphasis on the “book” as a printed codex,
                     oddly fetishizing the material in an increasingly digital world, or less precise
                     for a dozen other reasons. In short, what the field lacks is a set of values
                     that is reflected in a lack of a centralized taxonomy.

                     such as the digital humanities and critical theory. Scholars posing new or
                     differently organized inquiries must do the work of field-building, they must
                     make their own roadmaps, and their own “citational chains”

                     are historical, but they are also formative and impact the perception of the

                     digital enumerative bibliography can incorporate the kind of flexible and
                     adaptable indexing practices to address access issues, as well as those that
                     hide women’s work in generalized language. The centralized taxonomy of the
                     “Fields” list requires subjective editorial
                     intervention, which opens the project up to the murkier areas of bibliographic
                     science. However, users’ ability to filter by empirical data as well as complete
                     full-text searches should ameliorate issues introduced by organizational
                     choices.

                     are central to this work, specifically access to secondary sources. While
                     Mandell, Earhart, and others correctly argue that digital recovery efforts are
                     essential to the establishment of minority authors in the literary canon, our
                     project suggests that another step in the digital recovery process, beyond
                     access to primary sources, is greater access to secondary sources. Scholarship
                     becomes discourses, discourses become emergent narratives in monographs and
                     anthologies. Without including secondary sources in recovery efforts, what work
                     there is remains a silent niche rather than a sub-field or even a discipline in
                     its own right. Dominant dialogues remain in place and are functionally
                     re-canonized [<a class="ref" href="#earhart2015">Earhart 2015</a>]. This is particularly relevant given
                     the culture wars in academe that have likewise been ongoing since the 1980s and
                     revolve around what constitutes the canon inside the classroom. Canon upholds
                     values of scholarship, and the traditional — until recently, at least —
                     exclusion of writers that are not dead white men has been a crux for both
                     professors and students. While our focus in this essay and elsewhere has been on
                     women writ large (where applicable, we adhere to a constructionist view of
                     female identities), it must not be overlooked that much of the work that has
                     been done so far has been limited to America and Europe. While book history is
                     beginning to look beyond Anglo-European print culture, we particularly want to
                     look forward to studies that genuinely encompass a global perspective rather
                     than giving lip-service to a particular set of strictures and structures.

                     creates a substantial set of hurdles, even if these are experiences we share

                     needs. Due to timing, neither of us was able to incorporate the project

                     account digital work in a monograph-driven tenure system [<a class="ref" href="#boyles2018">Boyles et al. 2018</a>, 693]. The <cite class="title italic">WBHB</cite> is
                     no different. The initial project cost a few hundred dollars to buy the domain
                     and the associated costs to run the website for one year. We sorted and produced
                     citation lists through Zotero, which is open-access software. One editor
                     received unexpected supplemental income through the Beth Qualls Endowed
                     Fellowship, which she was able to divert toward the creation of the site.
                     Without the generosity of this donor and the luck of winning this fellowship,
                     the website probably would not exist. Even a couple hundred dollars a year is
                     significant for a graduate student stipend where one is balancing reimbursement,
                     tuition fees and other university costs, and irregular summer funding. Paying
                     out of pocket was not a system we would be able to maintain, especially when one
                     considers the cost of the coding classes and software subscriptions that are
                     necessary to advance beyond Zotero.

                     crowdfunding are ones that tend to be shared amongst those who begin digital
                     humanities projects without access to institutional support. Beyond the
                     challenges of acquiring skills and finding the time to build a project that may
                     not be assessed on the same level as a journal article, there are legitimate
                     reservations about making visible funding sources that are less than
                     prestigious. Projects that do this reveal their own precarity, and there is
                     value that we culturally and professionally place on sources for funding that
                     can affect tenure and promotion, reputation, and respect. Further, crowdfunding
                     and other non-traditional funding sources can exacerbate the lack of stability
                     that Boyles et al. identify. This position has real consequences. As Laura C.
                     Mandell demonstrates, the “do-it-yourself” model of digital
                     humanities work has yielded a list of dead links and half-finished projects from
                     the 1990s on women writers [<a class="ref" href="#mandell2016">Mandell 2016</a>, 590]. These sites
                     are cautionary tales of project planning and maintenance management.

                     institutionally funded projects because of the associated stability that tends
                     to come with supported scholarship. Instead, it argues that institutions and
                     scholars with secure employment must extend those protections to new digital
                     humanities projects if they encourage their students to pursue such work. What

                     influence to secure us practical training, server space, and mentoring. Through
                     a technical assistance grant in 2017, Mandell and the Center of Digital
                     Humanities Research (CoDHR) provided a programmer to convert the database from a
                     MySQL shell into the front end we now use. CoDHR also pledged server space,
                     which alleviated one of the biggest issues projects face and more than anything
                     else ensured the database would continue to survive.

                     providing long-term support, more projects will not make the transition from
                     graduate student work to sustainability. A sea of new dead links may appear in
                     articles from 2019. When these links are, as Mandell points to, connected to
                     activist scholarship that recuperates marginalized histories and made by
                     precariously employed scholars, the likelihood of this possibility exponentially
                     increases. These dead links will match the sea of dissertations from scholars
                     who were unable to find secure employment and thus never built on such work, a
                     generation of brain power lost to the adjunct crisis. As the academic job market
                     in library sciences and literary studies continues to decline and the future of
                     the National Endowment for the Humanities remains uncertain, the burden is on
                     individual institutions to invest long-term support in projects to keep this
                     data and labor from being lost as much as we have called on them to ethically

                     lost to the sea of dead links. The historiography we are uncovering in these
                     sources has distinct activist roots; it largely comes from the work of
                     second-wave and third-wave feminism and feminist literary recovery efforts. Of
                     the 1,550 sources currently in the database, around 95% are from 1970 forward,
                     when these movements began to gain traction and produce substantial amounts of

                     in the twentieth century, it will involve reimagining, somewhat, our mission of
                     collecting primarily scholarly criticism. Women subjects were less common in the
                     “canon” of literary criticism, which was challenged
                     through the feminist movement. And prior to the later twentieth century, the
                     number of women scholars in universities was drastically lower. Since the vast
                     majority of the authors in our database are women-identified, it is
                     statistically unlikely we will find the kind of sources we look for before 1930.
                     We may have to adjust our methods of accounting.

                  <div class="ptext" id="p38">Feminist literary recovery sought to “bring long-lost women writers and
                     their works to light, to bring them into scholarly discourse, and to
                     make their works available to students and scholars”
                      [<a class="ref" href="#marsden2002">Marsden 2002</a>, 657]. The work in the <cite class="title italic">WBHB</cite> is from all three of
                     these foci, especially the last which spawned sustained discussions of feminist
                     textual editing and canon formation. Collecting sources from feminist literary
                     recovery has allowed us to get a picture of the methods and values of this
                     movement as it intersects with material culture. Just as Ezell’s <cite class="title italic">Writing Women’s Literary History</cite> [1993] took seriously
                     the impact of feminist literary criticism, this project demonstrates that
                     preserving and analyzing this data can point to the contributions and absences
                     of the movements. The data proves some of the assumed biases of studies in
                     material culture, including the privileging of print over manuscript, public
                     writing over domestic, and what is defined as literary over technical or
                     vocational.

                  <div class="ptext" id="p39">Quantitative confirmation of gaps and silences reiterates that even recovery
                     efforts can be limited in scope by ideological barriers. Lillian S. Robinson
                     describes one such obstacle as the desire to recover women’s writing only of a
                     certain sort — what could be described as proto-feminist or maps onto
                     contemporary feminist values. Robinson wonders “<em class="emph">Is</em> there a place
                     for research — criticism and scholarship — on women’s literature that,
                     while not being explicitly anti-feminist, nonetheless is not explicitly
                     feminist either?”
                      (<a href="#robinson1987">emphasis original</a>). Robinson argues that given the widespread prejudices against women
                     writers in both curriculum and in the scholarship, the answer had to be
                     “yes” on the grounds that just working on a woman writer was a feminist
                     act in and of itself. We can extend this philosophy to advocate for more work on
                     women’s writing in manuscript, in private, and in non-literary genres. But it
                     also reaches women on the margins of textual production, those who perform
                     occasionally unremarkable but nevertheless universal labor. For instance,
                     “mercuries” was the gendered term for women distributing pamphlets in
                     the eighteenth century, and while such a trade role may not be labor that
                     necessarily resonates with contemporary feminism, it is still labor whose
                     recovery is a feminist act. Similarly, we cannot safely characterize women in
                     the print house as feminist exceptions, but if we want to recover a historically
                     accurate account of women’s writing and labor, it is to these sites and
                     practices to which we must return.

                  <div class="ptext" id="p40">The <span class="hi italic">WBHB</span> is an example of digital enumerative bibliography
                     as recuperation — to put the pieces together of a story that has far-reaching
                     implications and powerful resonances. But it is also an attempt to collect
                     sources beyond simple posterity. Feminist recovery requires a shift in the
                     underpinnings of the academic industrial complex, and the data we have collected
                     reveals a pattern of one step forward with two steps back, progress met with
                     backlash. In what Mandell characterizes as “Cycles of Forgetting”
                      [<a class="ref" href="#mandell2016">Mandell 2016</a>, 589], digital feminist recovery projects pop up and then quickly lay dormant;
                     an array of teaching anthologies of women poets go out of print with no readily
                     available alternatives; editorial apparatus to texts conspicuously focus on
                     scandalous lives rather than on successful professional careers; close studies
                     of women’s writing bypass bibliographic accuracy. Until this mindset shifts,
                     women are in danger of being “forgotten” again, and Mandell
                     argues that digital recovery is the best method of disrupting this process [<a class="ref" href="#mandell2016">Mandell 2016</a>, 590]. Within this philosophy, the <cite class="title italic">WBHB</cite> makes it harder to forget all the groundbreaking
                     work that has been done on women who now fill anthologies, not just the
                     historical subjects themselves. Even when this scholarship falls out of print,
                     through responsible indexing it is not forgotten.
