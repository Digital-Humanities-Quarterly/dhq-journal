            <p>Black DH has at its core principles and practices that call for equity and inclusion. This article speaks to how 
               the dialogue between Black DH and the fields of learning sciences, instructional design, and exhibition design can 
               create new frameworks for inclusion, design, and learning for all.

          <head>Introduction</head>
            <p>Black digital humanities (Black DH) is an emerging field that centers Black people in digital humanities. This field 
               does not yet have established traditions regarding methods or research practices. This youthfulness allows Black DH to 
               be interdisciplinary and inclusive in relation to its methods, theoretical frameworks, and research settings 
               <ptr target="#prince_etal2022"/>. As a field that draws on Black studies and Black scholarship, Black DH has the 
               potential to forge new paths <quote rend="inline">as [it] examines, constructs, and reimagines innovative communities 
               and people [across space and time]</quote> <ptr target="#prince_etal2022"/>. Drawing on the limitless and 
               interdisciplinary nature of Black DH, I discuss connections between Black DH and the fields of exhibition design, 
               instructional design, and the learning sciences, reflecting on what Black DH can offer practitioners of various 
               backgrounds and how this emerging field can further its reach. I speak from my own background working at the 
               intersection of these fields, as a scholar with a degree in the learning sciences who has designed analog and digital 
               exhibitions drawing on instructional design to create learning experiences. While I lead with caution that some of what 
               I have to say here is derived from my experiences and is thus inherently incomplete, I believe that Black DH will prove 
               to be an important tool through which to address urgent issues of power and identity in these academic communities.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <head>Defining Black DH</head>
            <p>It is important at this junction to define Black DH. Black DH is an emerging field conceived as the process or practice 
               of engaging with the experiences and history of Black people through digital humanities methodologies. Black DH 
               addresses the intersection of Black lives, Black cultural and social experiences, and Black humanity with digital 
               technologies. As a field negotiating both Blackness and the digital, Black DH is an endeavor to help restore the 
               humanity of Black people through the use of digital platforms and tools <ptr target="#gallon2016"/>. As <name>Kim 
               Gallon</name> writes, in advocating for a group whose identity has historically been questioned and denied, Black DH 
               <quote rend="inline">troubles the very core of what we have come to know as the <emph>humanities</emph> by recovering 
               alternate constructions of humanity that have been historically excluded from that concept</quote> 
               <ptr target="#gallon2016" loc="45"/>. Scholars of Black DH think critically about the issue of power; consider seriously 
               the digital processes and tools used to study humanity; and combine historical and contemporary perspectives of 
               Black experiences to inform research and shape practices in the field.
            </p>
            <p>Black DH is also the process or practice of recognizing that Black history and experience is defined by the intersection 
               of policy, economics, race, technology, and gender. By using technologies and other emerging tools to empower and 
               enact respect for Black lives, practitioners simultaneously transform Black experiences in society. In transforming 
               the experiences of Black people, Black DH can in turn inform other fields instructional design and exhibition design, 
               in their shared pursuit of creating inclusive learning environments for all students, as well as the learning sciences, 
               which is about understanding the complexities of learning across contexts to devise new approaches 
               <ptr target="#lee2018"/>. Black DH lends itself well to this work by providing historical context for the complexities 
               of learning for Black learners. In the text that follows, I discuss the fundamentals of each field and illustrate how 
               these fields can learn from each other. Interdisciplinary collaboration will advance Black DH, facilitating the 
               transportation of ideas into new fields and contexts for greater impact on the real world.

          <head>Contextualizing Exhibition Design</head>
            <p>Exhibition design is the art or process of putting together artifacts using available technologies and tools to share 
               a narrative around a topic. Exhibition design has consistently shifted over the years from a curator-centered to an 
               audience-centered approach <ptr target="#lake-hammond_etal2010"/>. Though gallery space, collection content, and 
               audience are fundamental elements of exhibition design, audience considerations are increasingly becoming influential 
               in the design of exhibitions <ptr target="#lake-hammond_etal2010"/>. This shift to a user- or audience-centered design 
               is related to the integration of concepts such as user- or human-centered design in the broader discipline 
               <ptr target="#lee2015"/> <ptr target="#lake-hammond_etal2010"/>. The field of exhibition design is interdisciplinary 
               as it draws on an iterative relationship between narrative, storytelling, architectural space, communication media, 
               and an understanding of the audience <ptr target="#locker2011"/>. It includes the fields of graphic, industrial, 
               architectural, interaction, and organization design <ptr target="#lake-hammond_etal2010"/>. A combination of experience 
               design through multimedia technology, lighting, audio, and creative performance helps create a comprehensive narrative 
               around a topic. Indeed, <name>Locker</name> argues that there is no magic recipe for exhibition design because there 
               are a variety of different approaches that have evolved with each generation of designers. However, Derda provides a 
               contemporary definition of exhibition design: <quote rend="block">Exhibition design is a process that uses visual 
               storytelling and environment to convey information. It focuses on the content of the artworks or artefacts to be 
               presented and is concerned with their arrangement so that they may be understood in connection to one another and in 
               conversation with the viewing environment's conditions. <ptr target="#derda2023" loc="2"/></quote>
            </p>
            <p>Exhibition design requires a variety of design skills applied differently based on the context 
               <ptr target="#lee2015"/>. It's a method of information presentation that aims at engaging the audience through the 
               exhibition organization and the delivery of the information. As <name>Urry</name> and <name>Larsen</name> explain, the 
               main goals of exhibition design are a) to connect the educational and culturally important aspects of the content; and 
               b) to attract a wider audience to create an environment that will both foster learning and act as entertainment. 
               Embedded in the exhibition design process is the desire to create and be learning environments, thus the relevance of 
               and connection with instructional design processes, further discussed below.
            </p>
            <div>
              <head>Racial Issues in Exhibition Design</head>
                <p>As learning spaces, exhibitions have historically been designed to perpetuate colonial and racist views of 
                   marginalized groups. For instance, when objects looted from former colonies or objects that were created during 
                   the eras of chattel slavery or Jim Crow are exhibited without proper contextualization in the design of the 
                   exhibition, they tend to reinforce racist and imperialist tropes. For the past four years, conversations about race 
                   have increasingly been supported in the design world by the white designers, curators, and editors who have 
                   dominated the field. However, the end goal of this dialogue has yet to be clarified, as racist tropes and practices 
                   are still perpetuated by exhibition design <ptr target="#okhio2023"/>. At a 2023 exhibition created by prominent 
                   designers and curators during Italian Design Week, figurines of the 1920s portraying racist caricatures of Black, 
                   Asian, Middle Eastern, and Indigenous people as subhuman were displayed without any context 
                   <ptr target="#okhio2023"/>. Yet, only a few designers, such as the Asian-Australian multi-disciplinary designer 
                   <name>Jenny Nguyen</name> and the Black American designer and professor of architecture <name>Stephen Burks</name> 
                   openly criticized the exhibition as offensive <ptr target="#okhio2023"/>. Designers involved in the exhibition 
                   denied racist intent, apologizing for hurting certain communities and calling for dialogue. Writing about this event, 
                   <name>Camille Okhio</name> wonders when the field will move past the endless and fruitless cycle of <q>dialogue</q> 
                   to concrete change <ptr target="#okhio2023"/>.
                </p>
                <p>Exhibition designers are still influenced by the colonial imagination, and their design choices reflect these 
                   imperialist ambitions, which subvert efforts to design a sense of inclusion for visitors and staff 
                   <ptr target="#hills_etal2023"/>. Hence, to design exhibition spaces that reject colonial framing of others, to 
                   decolonize exhibition design, <name>Adrienne Lalli Hills</name> and <name>Margaret Middleton</name> propose creating 
                   exhibition environments anchored in Indigenous <quote rend="inline">creativity, values, and aesthetics systems — a 
                   stark departure from design conventions that often feel colonial</quote> <ptr target="#hills_etal2023" loc="10"/>.
                </p>
                <p>The field of exhibition design has the power to <quote rend="inline">help disadvantaged groups, to raise self-esteem 
                   and even to challenge racism by progressing learning</quote> <ptr target="#golding2016" loc="4"/>. Decolonial, 
                   postcolonial, and Black feminist theory have been proposed as lenses through which to counter the tendency to 
                   portray Black people and other marginalized groups as less than humans. For instance, <name>Hill</name> and 
                   <name>Middleton</name> recommend that designers avoid the decontextualized display of objects behind glass panes 
                   because such displays reflect colonial aesthetics in design. In fact, the encapsulation of objects in oak cases, 
                   organized according to neat taxonomies, reduces the cultural materials to mere curiosities, thereby exoticizing 
                   non-Western, non-white cultures <ptr target="#hills_etal2023"/>. Likewise, the design of visitor experiences is often 
                   shaped by the colonial imagination in that visitors are expected to only explore and interact with exhibitions in 
                   certain ways. Those who do not conform to these unspoken expectations are not considered <q>good</q> (code for 
                   white, middle-class) visitors <ptr target="#hills_etal2023"/>. This colonial perspective on visitors' experience 
                   explains recent incidents at the <name>Metropolitan Museum</name>, where a Cambodian artist was kicked out for 
                   performing a dance prayer to her ancestral gods in an exhibition of looted religious statues and a Black artist 
                   was expelled from an exhibition about Black Rest for asking white visitors to honor the space 
                   <ptr target="#cheam-shapiro2023"/> <ptr target="#michael2023"/>. There is no question that even now, in the 21st 
                   century, the field of exhibition design is still struggling with racial issues.

          <head>Creating Meaningful Learning Experiences</head>
            <p>As an interdisciplinary field, instructional design places a great emphasis on the design of meaningful learning 
               experiences <ptr target="#lin_etal2017"/>. More specifically, instructional design focuses on the creation of 
               instructional materials that meet the needs of all students. The instructional designer's goal is to 
               <quote rend="inline">create something that enables a person or group of people to learn about a particular topic or 
               develop or improve a set of skills or encourage the learner to conduct further study</quote> 
               <ptr target="#brown_etal2016" loc="7"/>. Instructional design is connected to exhibition design in that both disciplines 
               strive to create meaningful learning experiences, facilitating the public's understanding of various topics through 
               the organization and presentation of information. Interestingly, both fields also aim to prompt the learner or visitor 
               to search for further information <ptr target="#popoli_etal2021"/>.
            </p>
            <p>The field of instructional design is concerned with the process of systematically designing instructional events and 
               situations. This encompasses iterative processes centering on human learning such as: a) planning the learning 
               outcomes; b) identifying strategies for learning and teaching; c) choosing appropriate technologies; d) selecting 
               educational media; and e) assessing the learner's performance <ptr target="#branch_etal2014"/>. <name>John Sweller</name> 
               notes that instructional design processes include the following major activities: 
               <list type="unordered">
                 <item>Analysis of the setting and learner needs</item>
                 <item>Design of a set of specifications for an effective, efficient, and relevant learner environment</item>
                 <item>Development of all learner and management materials</item>
                 <item>Implementation of instructional strategies</item>
                 <item>Evaluation of the results of the development</item>
               </list>
               These activities have resulted in different instructional models, which are applied according according to a particular 
               context to help the designer visualize, direct, and manage teaching and learning situations or materials.
            </p>
            <div>
              <head>Race and Identity in Instructional Design</head>
                <p>It is worth noting that instructional design scholarship is increasingly concerned with issues of race and equity 
                   in the field. <name>Ryan Ikeda</name> et al. recognize that the educational system has been designed to create 
                   inequity and to contribute to the design of instructional materials that serve as tools for the white supremacist and 
                   settler colonial project in the <name>United States</name>. In other words, instructional design models are shaped 
                   by racist and colonialist perspectives that need to be dismantled to create <quote rend="inline">a learning model 
                   that quickly responds to the slippery machinations of racism</quote> <ptr target="#ikeda_etal2021" loc="28"/>. 
                   Applying anti-racist pedagogy to design implies approaching instructional design as a collective activity by 
                   integrating different stakeholders from various fields, including the humanities and STEM, and being accountable to

                   designing with awareness of situational factors that can impact student learning; being cognizant of one's 
                   positionality through one's various identities, biases, and commitments; and representing that awareness in the 
                   design process by examining the role of power in design <ptr target="#ikeda_etal2021"/>.

                <p>Instructional design makes essential an in-depth understanding of learners, which includes an analysis of the 
                   learners' skills, prior knowledge, attitudes toward content, cultural background, and more 
                   <ptr target="#dick_etal2015"/> <ptr target="#kartal_etal2018"/>. However, as <name>Liangyue Lu</name> and 
                   <name>Jianping Xu</name> discuss, little attention has been afforded to learners' racial identities and power 
                   dynamics among learners, particularly minoritized learners. Yet, by integrating critical race theory (CRT) into an 
                   instructional design model, <name>Lu</name> and <name>Xu</name> propose the Motivational Framework for Culturally 
                   Responsive Teaching (MFCRT) as a means of attending to learners' racial identities. Indeed, this model centers on 
                   developing race awareness, unpacking white privilege, and paying attention to silenced students 
                   <ptr target="#lu_etal2020"/>. Similarly, <name>Michael K. Thomas</name> and <name>Marco A. Columbus</name> suggest 
                   integrating culture and identity, particularly African American identity, in instructional design work. Their theory 
                   of primary cultural instructional design states that instructional designers must interact with culture and 
                   identity by designing relevant and meaningful learning environments that take into consideration communities such 
                   as African American learners <ptr target="#thomas_etal2009"/>. Addressing the question of culture in instructional 
                   design, <name>Patricia A. Young</name> developed the culture-based model (CBM), an intercultural instructional 
                   design framework to guide designers through the design, management, development, and evaluation process 
                   <ptr target="#young2008"/>. Culture is an integral part of one's identity, with this model, <name>Young</name> points 
                   to the fact that minoritized or otherwise unrepresented cultural groups have not been taken into consideration in 
                   previous instructional design models. There is no doubt that the growing interest in issues of equity and race 
                   within the field of instructional design demonstrates a need to reckon with previous practices that have ignored 
                   or neglected certain communities.

          <head>Designing Learning Situations through Exhibitions</head>
            <p>As previously stated, exhibition design is an interdisciplinary field that draws from a variety of design fields. 
               Exhibition design plays a critical role in teaching about the past, present, and the future. Yet, its interactions 
               with the field of instructional design are still limited, or rather not explicit. Libraries, museums, and cultural 
               heritage institutions often use exhibitions to democratize access to their collections and educate the public about and 
               around a topic or theme. The act of choosing the exhibition theme and designing its contents cannot be completed without 
               the input of curators, who are often subject matter experts with sufficient knowledge to help the exhibition designer 
               create meaningful exhibition experiences for the visitors.
            </p>
            <p>Like instructional design, exhibition design is a creative process that involves a variety of design approaches or 
               processes that change with each new generation of designers <ptr target="#locker2011"/> <ptr target="#barnes_etal2019"/>. 
               <name>Zoi Popoli</name> and <name>Izabela Derda</name> explain that <quote rend="inline">exhibition design now requires 
               the combined efforts of multiple specialists throughout most of the creative process</quote> 
               <ptr target="#popoli_etal2021"/>. Given that exhibition design draws on a variety of skills to inform and teach a 
               diverse audience <ptr target="#lee2015"/>, exhibition design should also utilize instructional design processes to create 
               a better visitor experience. For instance, understanding how people learn and how this affects the design of learning 
               environments or events can inform the design of an exhibition.

          <head>Getting Into the Learning Sciences</head>
            <p>The field of learning sciences is difficult to define <ptr target="#lee2022"/>, but scholars agree that it is 
               interdisciplinary. <name>Victor R. Lee</name> explains that the learning sciences aim <quote rend="inline">to understand 
               the surprising complexity of real-world learning within and across sociotechnical contexts; to actively use new 
               understandings to design learning environments; and to establish novel approaches for using technology (when it is 
               appropriate) to support learning</quote> <ptr target="#lee2022"/>. <name>Indigo Esmonde</name> and <name>Angela N. 
               Booker</name> add that the field is focused on investigating learning and teaching in a variety of contexts. Using 
               approaches from psychology, cognitive science, neuroscience, education, anthropology, and sociology, the learning 
               sciences provide different perspectives on how to define learning and how learning occurs. This includes examining 
               what people should learn, <quote rend="inline">how we know when they have learned it</quote>, and 
               <quote rend="inline">which teaching methods, in which contexts</quote>, are most likely to make learning happen 
               <ptr target="#esmonde_etal2017"/>. Constructivism, cognitive science, educational technology, and sociocultural studies have been the early influence of learning sciences (Sawyer, 2006). Hence, the field also places a great emphasis on the design of learning spaces in different contexts, and to the use of technology to support learning (Esmonde &amp; Booker, 2017).  </p>
            <p>The field includes psychology, sociology, computer science, education and cognitive science, and contributes various approaches to theory and method to examine how to better understand teaching and learning process (Luckin &amp; Cukurova, 2019). Sommerhoff et al. (2018) define learning sciences as “the analysis and facilitation of real-world learning in formal and informal contexts;” with technology being key in helping and scaffolding learners to participate in constructive learning activities.  In effect, “cognition, metacognition and dialog are the primary foci for analysis with respect to learning activities and processes, and the learning environment is considered to be fundamental to the facilitation of learning.” (Luckin &amp; Cukorova, 2019, p. 2825). Hence, the field seeks to provide learning opportunities for any learner in any setting (McKenney, 2018). It is therefore not surprising that Douroudi (2023) argues that learning sciences is an interdisciplinary field that came out of a desire to understand learning in humans and machines, which includes artificial intelligence and machine learning. Interestingly, there is an increased interest in understanding how power participates in the design of learning settings, and experiences, and how any hurt can be limited (Esmonde &amp; Booker, 2016). For instance, DiSalvo et al. (2014) explore how designed learning environments can facilitate learners' construction of racial, ethnic, and gendered identities. Designing learning environments that enable groups that have historically been marginalized in the context of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) can help these learners develop identities with disciplinary agency, and support learners navigate the complexities of learning (Tabak &amp; Radinsky, 2014; Thompson, 2014). Yet, as Esmonde and Booker (2017) note, the learning sciences are yet to address racial issues.  In effect,    </p>
            <p>When we look more closely, we discover that wherever we find social relations, variability of experience and practice, or evaluation of knowledge and learning, we also find dynamics of power. The learning sciences, therefore, must necessarily centre conceptions of equity, diverse experience, and the dynamics of power and privilege expressed in and through learning environments (p.1).</p>
            <div>
              <head>Questions of Power in the Learning Sciences</head>
                <p>The learning sciences is increasingly showing interest in the issues of power, identity, and culture. Scholars are exploring the power dynamic in learning environments (Lee, 2023), as more researchers are recognizing that the learning sciences should focus on issues of justice, and entitlement in and through learning environments (Esmonde &amp; Booker, 2017). The field of learning sciences needs to pay more attention to the issues of power and oppression (Esmonde &amp; Booker, 2017).  Leibovitz et al. (2024) also call for more commitment to racial justice and urgent and vigorous participation in the racial justice initiative. For the authors, learning about social justice in various contexts through the framework of pedagogies of witnessing (Leibovitz et al., 2024).   However, “the learning sciences possesses limited theoretical underpinnings that make the relationship between power and learning visible, even as the field strives to speak across both a situated, sociocultural tradition and a more individualistic psychological tradition.” (Esmonde &amp; Booker, 2017, p. 1). Consequently, the limited theoretical grounding may explore the limited research on racial issues. For this reason, I contend that Black DH can provide the learning sciences with the theoretical underpinning needed to struggle with issues of race. </p>
                <p>Research in the field of the learning sciences that explores ways to support learning and learning activities in settings such as exhibitions is limited (Hammady &amp; Ma, 2019).  Yet, this research on exhibitions shows strategies and technologies such as artificial intelligence and games used to ensure that learning happens during exhibition visits (Author, 2022; Gutwill, &amp; Allen, 2012; Yannier et al., 2022). The learning sciences and instructional design are interdisciplinary fields focusing on learning and they both can inform exhibition design. Expectations, final products, and theoretical commitments in the learning sciences, instructional design, and exhibition design are different still all three fields are interested in learning, and in how we can build knowledge to improve and support practices and environments that enhance the learning experiences of underrepresented communities and all individuals in these settings.       </p>

          <head>Bringing Black DH into the Conversation</head>
            <p>Black DH brings to the fore questions of race and racialized systems that have affected and still affect Black people. It tells the story of a people and restore its humanity by using digital tools. Given their interest in organizing information to reach a diverse audience, the fields of exhibition design, instructional design, and learning sciences can be informed by the Black DH.  As previously stated, instrumental for the field of Black DH. In <hi rend="italic">Making a Case for Black Digital Humanities,</hi> Gallon (2016), draws from Kirschenbaum (2014), and states the following:  </p>
            <p>Black digital humanities reflects less an actual “thing” and more of a constructed space to consider the intersections between the digital and blackness …  Like race, gender, class, and sexuality — all social constructs, if you will — the digital humanities increasingly hold real meaning and significance in the academic universe (p. 43). </p>
            <p>I draw on Gallon's (2016) argument to contend that race, gender, class, and sexuality and all social constructs increasingly hold real meaning in the learning sciences, exhibition design, and instructional design. </p>
            <p>As such, these fields can benefit from Black DH critical insights into the intersection of technology and blackness. Yet, these fields can also bring to the emerging field of Black DH their perspectives on learning and design. The lens of Black DH is critical in examining, analyzing, and providing perspective on technology and blackness.  I contend that being able to communicate, inform, and even learn about these complex interactions and intersections requires the scholars in the field to think about a) learning; b) exhibition; and c) instructional design implications or applications. In other words, when creating an exhibition, designers should put on the habits of instructional designers; that is think of exhibitions as the process of designing learning spaces, courses/lessons with instructional goals and objectives.  As Bedford (<ref target="https://www-tandfonline-com.dist.lib.usu.edu/doi/full/10.1080/02660830.2016.1219492">2014</ref>) states, regardless of how broad, problematic, select, or beneficial,  exhibitions “were designed to educate.” (p.22). However, “their pedagogies …  are neither straightforward nor always comfortable, but rather, multifarious – as troubling and conflicting as they are exciting and inspiring.” (Clover et al., 2016, p. 123). Exhibitions are learning spaces (Merriam et al., 2014). Thus, exhibition design can also be perceived as the process of developing spaces that can facilitate learning. Thinking about exhibitions as learning spaces will help exhibition designers integrate visitors (i.e., audience, or learners) in the entire design process; and support exhibition design with learning theories that can help exhibitions achieve the goal of educating.  The learning sciences also allows for exhibition designers to find ways to support exhibition visitors ‘learning. Support may include the integration of relevant technology to facilitate learning. </p>
            <p>It is s true that Black DH has been essential in the development of the digital humanities; and it still needs to recover the joy and pleasure of blackness through digital technologies (Gallon, 2022). Yet, I add that Black DH is also a means of creating spaces to learn, talk, and tell stories about Black experiences in a digital world with digital tools. The strategies, technologies, spaces, and ways employed to tell or teach these Black experiences vary in this emerging field. The expansion of Black DH also resides in its conversation and interactions with other disciplines such as those discussed in this paper. The “more critical [Black DH] practices segue into these spaces [i.e., instructional design, exhibition design, and learning sciences] the greater the ability to shape [Black DH and these fields] into places of encounter for [learning], critique, intellectual growth, creative inspiration, and even activism.” (Clover et al., 2016, p.124).  </p>
            <p>According to Weheliye (2014), Black DH interrogates the sociopolitical relations that have racialized and informed the literature, philosophy, and texts we used. Gallon (2016) goes further to say that</p>
            <p>The Black digital humanities reveal how methodological approaches for studying and thinking about the category of blackness may come to bear on and transform the digital processes and tools used to study humanity… [the field] helps to unmask the racialized systems of power at work in how we understand the digital humanities as a field and utilize its associated techniques (pp. 43-46).</p>
            <p>Following Gallon (2016), I argue that Black DH can inform exhibition design, instructional design, and the learning sciences. It can help these fields examine the methodological approaches used to design, investigate, and understand learning as it relates to and situates blackness. It may also transform the processes and tools used to design and analyze learning in these fields. Embedded in Black DH approaches or practices is the critical lens applied to examine and think about Black experiences and blackness in relation to any other concept, technology, or practice. For instance, the critical lens of Black DH can help the fields of instructional design, exhibition design, and learning sciences critically engage with technology employed to design; critically interrogate the means utilized to support learning; and critically examine the concept of power when it comes to design and learning. Questions about learning, technology use, the learning process, who defines or has the power to define learning, and design learning spaces in relation to Black experiences can add to these other disciplines. The intersection of Black DH with other fields will create new avenues for research and expand research methods and practices for these fields. Black DH lends itself well with instructional design. Black DH provides resources, information about the Black experience, which instructional design can rely on to develop strategies that can positively shape the design of instructional materials that meets the needs of Black students. I contend that Black DH can serve as a critical lens that helps challenge racism embedded in exhibition design and achieve concrete change. Black DH will add to the other critical approaches such decolonization, postcolonial and Black feminist theories. Black DH can also act as a source that will ground exhibition design in new practices, design principles, and counter “the ‘cannibalistic' tendency to trap the ‘other' behind ‘our' glass case displays and frame their knowledge according to western criteria” (Golding, 2023, p.7). Hence, Black DH can be a source of information for exhibition designers to narrate Black experiences.      </p>
            <p>Black DH can lead these fields to critically examine power historically to make sense of it contemporary. Such analysis can highlight voices that have often been left out or ignore; voices that have often been acknowledged, amplified, and validated; what knowledge, ways of learning, or doing that may have, historically, been deemed and may still be considered irrelevant; may be silenced, or opposed.  Bridging with these fields creates an opportunity for further questions and findings. Similarly, the emerging field of Black DH is about improving the Black experiences in different contexts; this includes learning spaces, and empowering Black people using various tools including technology to tell their stories. In this regard, Black DH can engage in a conversation with these fields, breaking the apparent barriers to shape these fields to transform the Black experience in any setting.  As interdisciplinary fields interested in inclusion, design, and learning, they can build upon Black DH knowledge to make greater collective progress to understand, support, and design learning for all.  Building on Markauskaite et al's. (2024) perspective on the learning sciences, it is my understanding that the Black DH community has both a body of empirical research and prior knowledge to contribute, as well as expertise to advance research on learning in exhibition design, instructional design, and the learning sciences. Simultaneously, Black DH will benefit from these interactions and make progress in its endeavor to positively affect the experiences of Black people in any context or situation.          </p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <head>Conclusion</head>
            <p>The Black DH connects and informs Black studies with its practices and the critical lenses it applies to examine methods, digital platforms, and tools application to blackness and Black experiences. Through emerging and expanding the digital humanities, informing other disciplines, such as the learning sciences, exhibition design, and instructional design, will further advance Black DH. Black DH interrogate the relationship between the digital as power and blackness. Scholars in the fields of learning sciences, exhibition design, and instructional design, can build on this work to question how Blackness is shaped, portrayed, submerged, or even erased through the tools or methodological approaches employed in the study of learning study, in the design of instruction or exhibitions. Drawing from Lee (2018) argument on how fields considered different can speak to each other, I contend that scholars from each field need to connect and initiate collaborations. In other words, Black DH should start conversation with learning sciences, instructional design, and exhibition design, and vice-versa. This will allow parties “to get excited about ideas that other parties are also currently thinking about, and … have dialogue” (Lee, 2018). My argument is that such exchange of ideas could generate new methods and frameworks to address issues of inclusion, design, and learning for all.     </p>
