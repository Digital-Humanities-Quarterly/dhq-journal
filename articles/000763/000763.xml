           <p>This article examines the connection between Black digital humanities and fields such as the learning sciences, 
              instructional design, and exhibition design. Focusing on key elements of these fields, this paper shows their 
              relevance to Black digital humanities, arguing that the future of this emerging field lies in its intersections with

            <p>Black DH has at its core principles and practices that call for equity and inclusion. This article speaks to how 
               the dialogue between Black DH and the fields of learning sciences, instructional design, and exhibition design can 
               create new frameworks for inclusion, design, and learning for all.

          <head>Introduction</head>
            <p>Black digital humanities is an emerging field that centers Black people in digital humanities. This field does not have established traditions yet, as it relates to methods or research practices. This youthfulness allows Black digital humanities (Black DH) to be interdisciplinary and inclusive in relation to its methods, theoretical frameworks, and research settings (Prince &amp; Messina, 2022). As a field that draws on Black studies, and Black scholarship, Black DH has the potential to forge new “paths using their innovative [methods] as [it] examines, constructs, and reimagines innovative communities and people [across space and time] (Prince &amp; Messina, 2022). Drawing on the limitless and interdisciplinary nature of Black DH that I discuss connections that exist in some fields; and reflect on how the emerging field of Black DH can influence fields such as instructional design, exhibition design and the learning sciences, while benefiting from this interaction to further its reach.  </p>
            <p>This article exists as an effort to present the Black DH to instructional design, exhibition design, and learning sciences communities. It also shows the connection between Black DH and these fields to the digital humanities (DH) community from one perspective. The current point of view is surely appropriate because the author has a degree in learning design; and works at the intersection of learning sciences, instructional design, exhibition design, and Black DH. Professionally, the author serves learning sciences, and instructional design conferences and academic societies. I also designed analog and digital exhibitions drawing on instructional design and the learning sciences to create learning experiences for exhibition visitors. However, I do lead with the caution that some of what I have to say here is derived from my experience and inherently incomplete. Still, I present the following with confidence that it adds to the understanding of Black DH in the digital humanities. I examine Black DH intersection with learning sciences, instructional design, and exhibition design, while encouraging dialogue with these fields to advance academic knowledge.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <head>Defining Black DH</head>
            <p>It is important at this junction to define Black DH. Black DH is an emerging field conceived as the process or practice of engaging with the experiences and history of Black people.  Black DH refers to the intersection of Black lives, Black cultural and social experiences, and Black humanity with technologies. It’s the intersection of the digital and blackness, that is, an endeavor to provide the humanity of Black people through the help of digital platforms and tools, and/or restore Black people's humanity (Gallon, 2016). However, for a group whose identity has historically been denied and even questioned, Black DH “troubles the very core of what we have come to know as the <hi rend="italic">humanities </hi>by recovering alternate constructions of humanity that have been historically excluded from that concept” (p.45). Scholars in this emerging field critically think about the issue of power; seriously consider the digital processes and tools used to study humanity (Brown et al., 2016; Gallon, 2016); and combine historical and contemporary perspectives of the Black experiences to inform practices, and shape research and practices in the field.  </p>
            <p>Black DH is also the process or practice of recognizing that this history and experience is shaped at the intersection of policy, economics, race, technology, and gender; while using technologies and other emerging tools to empower and enact respect for Black lives, and simultaneously transforming Black experiences in the society. In empowering and transforming the experiences of Black people, Black DH, can inform other fields such as a) instructional design in its pursuits of creating inclusive learning environments for all students; b) exhibition design, and c) the learning sciences which is about understanding the complexities of learning across contexts to devise new approaches to support learning (Lee, 2018). Black DH lends itself well with providing historical context to the complexities of learning for Black learners.  In the text that follows, I discuss the fundamentals of each field and illustrate that these fields can learn from each other.  Collaboration will advance Black DH, facilitate the transportation of ideas into new fields and contexts for greater impact on the real world.  </p>

          <head>Contextualizing Exhibition Design</head>
            <p>Exhibition design can be said to be the art or process of putting together artifacts to share a narrative around a topic using available technologies and tools. Exhibition design has consistently shifted over the years from a curator-centered to an audience-centered approach to exhibition (Lake-Hammond &amp; Waite, 2010). Though gallery space, collection content, and audience are fundamental elements to exhibition design, audience considerations are increasingly becoming influential in the design of exhibitions (Lake-Hammond &amp; Waite, 2010). This shift to a user or audience-centered design is related to the integration of concepts such as user or human-centered design in the discipline of design (Lee, 2015; Lake-Hammond &amp; Waite, 2010). The field of exhibition design is interdisciplinary as it draws on an iterative relationship between narrative, storytelling, architectural space, communication media, and an understanding of the audience (Locker, 2011). It includes the fields of graphic, industrial, architectural, interaction, and organization design (Lake-Hammond &amp; Waite, 2010). A combination of experience design, multimedia and technology, lighting, audio and creative performance help create a comprehensive narrative around a topic. Indeed, Locker (2011) argues that there is no magic recipe for exhibition design because there are a variety of different approaches that have evolved with each generation of designers.  However, Derda (2023) provides a contemporary definition of exhibition design.  </p>
            <p>Exhibition design is a process that uses visual storytelling and environment to convey information. It focuses on the content of the artworks or artefacts to be presented and is concerned with their arrangement so that they may be understood in connection to one another and in conversation with the viewing environment’s conditions (Derdra, 2023, p. 2).</p>
            <p>Exhibition design requires a variety of design skills applied differently based on the context (Lee, 2015). It’s a method of information presentation that aims at engaging the audience through the exhibition organization, and the delivery of the information. As Urry and Larsen (2011) explain, the main role of exhibition design is to a) connect the educational and culturally important aspects of the content; and b) the need to attract a wider audience, to create an environment that will both foster learning and act as entertainment. Embedded in the exhibition design process is the desire to create and be learning environments, thus the relevance of and connection with instructional design processes, further discussed below. </p>
            <div>
              <head>Racial Issues in Exhibition Design</head>
                <p>As learning spaces, exhibitions have been historically designed to perpetuate colonial and racist views of disadvantage groups. For instance, when looted objects from former colonies are exhibited, reminding a colonial past and the subjugation of communities and ethnic groups; or when artifacts from slavery or Jim Crow era are exhibited without proper contextualization in the design of the exhibition, they tend to reinforce racist and imperialist tropes.  For the past four years, conversation about race have been supported in the design world by the white designers, curators, and editors who have dominated the field; however, the end goal of this dialogue is yet to be clarified as racist tropes and practices are still experienced in exhibition design (Okhio, 2023). At a 2023 exhibition, created by prominent designers and curators during the Italian Design Week, figurines of the 1920s, portraying racist caricatures of Black, Asian, Middle Eastern, and Indigenous people as subhuman were displayed without any context (Okhio, 2023). Yet, only a few designers such as the Asian-Australian Jenny Nguyen and the Black American Stephen Burks criticized the exhibition, finding it offensive (Okhio, 2023). Designers involved in the exhibition denied being racists, apologizing for hurting some communities, and calling for dialogue; this makes Okhio (2023) wonder when the field will move past the endless and fruitless cycle of dialogue, to concrete change. Exhibition designers are still influenced by colonial imagination, and their design choices reflect these imperial ambitions, which subvert efforts to design a sense of inclusion for visitors and staff (Hills &amp; Middleton, 2023). Hence, to design exhibition spaces that reject colonial framing of others, to decolonize exhibition design, Hills and Middleton (2023) propose creating exhibition environments anchored in Indigenous “creativity, values, and aesthetics systems - a stark departure from design conventions that often feel colonial” (p. 10).   </p>
                <p>The field of exhibition design has the power to “help disadvantaged groups, to raise self-esteem and even to challenge racism by progressing learning.” (Golding, 2016, p.4). Decolonial perspectives (Mkwesha &amp; Huber, 2021), postcolonial, and Black feminist theory (Golding, 2016) have been proposed to counter the tendency to portray Blacks and other groups as less than humans. For instance, to decolonize exhibition design, Hill and Middleton (2023), recommend designers to avoid the decontextualized display of objects behind glass panes because such display reflect colonial aesthetics in design. In fact, the encapsulation of objects in oak cases organized in neat taxonomies reduces the cultural materials to interesting curiosity that exoticizes non-Western cultures (Hill &amp; Middleton, 2023). Likewise, the design of the visitor experience is shaped by colonial imagination when the visitor is invited to explore the exhibition, and expected interact with the exhibition a certain, that is, act as the good visitor, which is code for white, wealthy visitor (Hill &amp; Middleton, 2023). This colonial perspective on visitors’ experience explains incidents at the Metropolitan Museum, where a Cambodian artist was kicked out for performing a dance prayer to her ancestral gods in an exhibition of looted religious statues (Cheam-Shapiro, 2023); and the expulsion of a Black artist from an exhibition about Black Rest asking white visitors to honor the space (Michael, 2023). Thus, there is no question that in the 21 st century, the field of exhibition design is still struggling with racial issues. </p>

        <div>
          <head>Creating Meaningful Learning Experiences</head>
            <p>As an interdisciplinary field, instructional design places a great emphasis on the design of meaningful learning experiences (Lin &amp; Spector, 2017).  Instructional design, as a field focuses on the creation of instructional materials that meet the needs of all students. The instructional designer goal is to “create something that enables a person or group of people to learn about a particular topic or develop or improve a set of skills or encourage the learner to conduct further study” (Brown &amp; Greene, 2020, p. 7). For creating meaningful learning experiences things that enable people to learn more or seek more information on a topic, instructional design is connected to exhibition design. Both fields present and organize information to facilitate the public or learner's understanding. Interestingly, both fields in their designs also aim to prompt the learner or visitor to search for further information ( Popoli &amp; Derda, 2021). </p>
            <p>The field of instructional design is concerned with the process of systematically designing instructional events and situations (citation needed) and encompasses iterative processes centering on human learning, such as: a) planning the learning outcomes; b) selecting strategies for learning and teaching; c) choosing appropriate technologies; d) selecting educational media; and e) assessing the performance (Branch &amp; Kopcha, 2014). Sweller (2021) noted that instructional design processes encompass major activities: 
              <list type="unordered">
                <item>Analysis of the setting and learner needs</item>
                <item>Design of a set of specifications for an effective, efficient, and relevant learner environment</item>
                <item>Development of all learner and management materials</item>
                <item>Implementation of instructional strategies</item>
                <item>Evaluation of the results of the development</item>
              </list>
            </p>
            <p>These activities have resulted in different instructional models, which are applied according to a context, and help the designer visualize, direct, and manage the acts of creating teaching and learning situations or materials (Branch &amp; Kopcha, 2014). </p>
            <div>
              <head>Race and Identity in Instructional Design</head>
                <p>It is worth noting that instructional design is increasingly concern with issues of race and equity in the field.  Ikeda et al. 2021) recognize that the educational system has been designed to create inequity; to contribute to the design of instructional materials that served as a tool for white supremacist and settler colonial project in the United States. In other words, instructional design models are shaped by supremacists and colonial perspectives and need to be dismantled to create “a learning model that quickly responds to the slippery machinations of racism (Ikeda et al., 2021, p. 28). Applying anti-racist pedagogy to design implies approaching instructional design as a collective activity; integrating different stakeholders from various fields including the humanities and STEM; and being accountable to BIPOC (Black, Indigenous, and People of Color) by designing with specific stakeholders (Ikeda et al., 2021). Anti-racism design also includes designing with situational factors that can impact student learning; being aware of one’s positionality by identifying one’s biases, racial identity, ideology, or political commitment; representing that awareness in the design process by examining the role of power in design (Ikeda et al., 2021). </p>
                <p>Instructional design makes essential an in-depth understanding of learners, which includes an analysis of the learners’ skills, prior knowledge, attitudes toward content, cultural background, and more (Dick et al., 2015; Kartal et al., 2018). However, as Lu and Xu (2020) learners’ racial identification and power dynamic among learners, particularly minoritized learners is given little attention. Yet, by integrating critical race theory (CRT) into one instructional design model, Lu and Xu (2020) propose the Motivational Framework for Culturally Responsive Teaching (MFCRT) to attend to learners’ racial identity. Indeed, this model centers on developing race awareness, unpacking white privilege, and paying attention to silenced students (Lu &amp; Xu, 2020). Thomas and Columbus (2009) suggest integrating culture and identity, particularly African American identity in instructional design work. The theory for primary cultural instructional design sustains that instructional designers must interact with culture and identity; this to design relevant and successful learning environments that take into consideration communities such as the African American learners (Thomas &amp; Columbus, 2009). To address culture, Young (2008) developed the culture-based model (CBM) an intercultural instructional design framework to guide designers through the design, management, development, and evaluation process. Culture is an integral part of one’s identity, and the likelihood of different racial groups to have similar culture is limited. Hence, with this model, Young (2008) points to the fact that cultures from minoritized/underrepresented groups have not been taken into consideration in previous instructional design models. Given the concern for learning, there is no doubt that the growing interest in issues of equity and race is a demonstration by scholars in the field to reckon with previous practices that have ignored or neglected some communities.    </p>

          <head>Designing Learning Situations through Exhibitions</head>
            <p>As previously stated, exhibition design is an interdisciplinary field that draws from a variety of design fields. Exhibition design plays a critical role in learning and teaching the audience about the past, present, and the future. Yet, its interactions with the field of instructional design are still limited, or rather not explicit. Libraries, museums, and cultural heritage institutions often use exhibitions to democratize access to their collections and educate the public about and around a topic or theme. The role of choosing the theme and designing the exhibition cannot be completed without the input of curators who are often experts in the subject. They have sufficient knowledge to help the exhibition designer create meaningful exhibition experiences for the visitors.</p>
            <p>As instructional design, exhibition design is a creative process that involves a variety of approaches or processes to design that change with each generation of designers (Locker, 2011; Barnes &amp; McPherson, 2019). Popoli and Derda (2021) explain that “exhibition design now requires the combined efforts of multiple specialists throughout most of the creative process” (p.398). Attesting that exhibition design draws on a variety of skills to inform and teach a diverse audience (Lee, 2015), exhibition design can draw from instructional design processes for a better visitor experience (Author, 2023). For instance, understanding how people learn, and how it affects the design of learning environments or events can inform the design of an exhibition. </p>
            <p>In the previous section, I discussed the relevance of instructional design for exhibition design. Exhibition design staff in libraries and museums can benefit by collaborating with instructional designers, because in their work they desire to design, educate, and assist visitors in their learning experiences (Wang &amp; Lei, 2016).</p>
            <p>The field of learning sciences struggles with its definition (Lee, 2023), however, scholars agree that its interdisciplinary.  Nevertheless, Lee (2023) explains that learning sciences aims “ to understand the surprising complexity of real-world learning within and across sociotechnical contexts; to actively use new understandings to design learning environments; and to establish novel approaches for using technology (when it is appropriate) to support learning” (p. 11). Esmonde and Booker (2017) add that the field is focused on investigating learning and teaching in a variety of contexts. Using approaches from psychology, cognitive science, neuroscience, education, anthropology, and sociology, the learning sciences provides different perspectives to the field’s main goals to define learning, and how it occurs; to examine what people should learn, and “how we know when they have learned it”; and to identify “which teaching methods, in which contexts,” are most likely to make learning happen (Esmonde &amp; Booker,  2017, p.1).  Constructivism, cognitive science, educational technology, and sociocultural studies have been the early influence of learning sciences (Sawyer, 2006). Hence, the field also places a great emphasis on the design of learning spaces in different contexts, and to the use of technology to support learning (Esmonde &amp; Booker, 2017).  </p>
            <p>The field includes psychology, sociology, computer science, education and cognitive science, and contributes various approaches to theory and method to examine how to better understand teaching and learning process (Luckin &amp; Cukurova, 2019). Sommerhoff et al. (2018) define learning sciences as “the analysis and facilitation of real-world learning in formal and informal contexts;” with technology being key in helping and scaffolding learners to participate in constructive learning activities.  In effect, “cognition, metacognition and dialog are the primary foci for analysis with respect to learning activities and processes, and the learning environment is considered to be fundamental to the facilitation of learning.” (Luckin &amp; Cukorova, 2019, p. 2825). Hence, the field seeks to provide learning opportunities for any learner in any setting (McKenney, 2018). It is therefore not surprising that Douroudi (2023) argues that learning sciences is an interdisciplinary field that came out of a desire to understand learning in humans and machines, which includes artificial intelligence and machine learning. Interestingly, there is an increased interest in understanding how power participates in the design of learning settings, and experiences, and how any hurt can be limited (Esmonde &amp; Booker, 2016). For instance, DiSalvo et al. (2014) explore how designed learning environments can facilitate learners’ construction of racial, ethnic, and gendered identities. Designing learning environments that enable groups that have historically been marginalized in the context of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) can help these learners develop identities with disciplinary agency, and support learners navigate the complexities of learning (Tabak &amp; Radinsky, 2014; Thompson, 2014). Yet, as Esmonde and Booker (2017) note, the learning sciences are yet to address racial issues.  In effect,    </p>
            <p>When we look more closely, we discover that wherever we find social relations, variability of experience and practice, or evaluation of knowledge and learning, we also find dynamics of power. The learning sciences, therefore, must necessarily centre conceptions of equity, diverse experience, and the dynamics of power and privilege expressed in and through learning environments (p.1).</p>
            <div>
              <head>Questions of Power in the Learning Sciences</head>
                <p>The learning sciences is increasingly showing interest in the issues of power, identity, and culture. Scholars are exploring the power dynamic in learning environments (Lee, 2023), as more researchers are recognizing that the learning sciences should focus on issues of justice, and entitlement in and through learning environments (Esmonde &amp; Booker, 2017). The field of learning sciences needs to pay more attention to the issues of power and oppression (Esmonde &amp; Booker, 2017).  Leibovitz et al. (2024) also call for more commitment to racial justice and urgent and vigorous participation in the racial justice initiative. For the authors, learning about social justice in various contexts through the framework of pedagogies of witnessing (Leibovitz et al., 2024).   However, “the learning sciences possesses limited theoretical underpinnings that make the relationship between power and learning visible, even as the field strives to speak across both a situated, sociocultural tradition and a more individualistic psychological tradition.” (Esmonde &amp; Booker, 2017, p. 1). Consequently, the limited theoretical grounding may explore the limited research on racial issues. For this reason, I contend that Black DH can provide the learning sciences with the theoretical underpinning needed to struggle with issues of race. </p>
                <p>Research in the field of the learning sciences that explores ways to support learning and learning activities in settings such as exhibitions is limited (Hammady &amp; Ma, 2019).  Yet, this research on exhibitions shows strategies and technologies such as artificial intelligence and games used to ensure that learning happens during exhibition visits (Author, 2022; Gutwill, &amp; Allen, 2012; Yannier et al., 2022). The learning sciences and instructional design are interdisciplinary fields focusing on learning and they both can inform exhibition design. Expectations, final products, and theoretical commitments in the learning sciences, instructional design, and exhibition design are different still all three fields are interested in learning, and in how we can build knowledge to improve and support practices and environments that enhance the learning experiences of underrepresented communities and all individuals in these settings.       </p>

          <head>Bringing Black DH into the Conversation</head>
            <p>Black DH brings to the fore questions of race and racialized systems that have affected and still affect Black people. It tells the story of a people and restore its humanity by using digital tools. Given their interest in organizing information to reach a diverse audience, the fields of exhibition design, instructional design, and learning sciences can be informed by the Black DH.  As previously stated, instrumental for the field of Black DH. In <hi rend="italic">Making a Case for Black Digital Humanities,</hi> Gallon (2016), draws from Kirschenbaum (2014), and states the following:  </p>
            <p>Black digital humanities reflects less an actual “thing” and more of a constructed space to consider the intersections between the digital and blackness …  Like race, gender, class, and sexuality — all social constructs, if you will — the digital humanities increasingly hold real meaning and significance in the academic universe (p. 43). </p>
            <p>I draw on Gallon's (2016) argument to contend that race, gender, class, and sexuality and all social constructs increasingly hold real meaning in the learning sciences, exhibition design, and instructional design. </p>
            <p>As such, these fields can benefit from Black DH critical insights into the intersection of technology and blackness. Yet, these fields can also bring to the emerging field of Black DH their perspectives on learning and design. The lens of Black DH is critical in examining, analyzing, and providing perspective on technology and blackness.  I contend that being able to communicate, inform, and even learn about these complex interactions and intersections requires the scholars in the field to think about a) learning; b) exhibition; and c) instructional design implications or applications. In other words, when creating an exhibition, designers should put on the habits of instructional designers; that is think of exhibitions as the process of designing learning spaces, courses/lessons with instructional goals and objectives.  As Bedford (<ref target="https://www-tandfonline-com.dist.lib.usu.edu/doi/full/10.1080/02660830.2016.1219492">2014</ref>) states, regardless of how broad, problematic, select, or beneficial,  exhibitions “were designed to educate.” (p.22). However, “their pedagogies …  are neither straightforward nor always comfortable, but rather, multifarious – as troubling and conflicting as they are exciting and inspiring.” (Clover et al., 2016, p. 123). Exhibitions are learning spaces (Merriam et al., 2014). Thus, exhibition design can also be perceived as the process of developing spaces that can facilitate learning. Thinking about exhibitions as learning spaces will help exhibition designers integrate visitors (i.e., audience, or learners) in the entire design process; and support exhibition design with learning theories that can help exhibitions achieve the goal of educating.  The learning sciences also allows for exhibition designers to find ways to support exhibition visitors ‘learning. Support may include the integration of relevant technology to facilitate learning. </p>
            <p>It is s true that Black DH has been essential in the development of the digital humanities; and it still needs to recover the joy and pleasure of blackness through digital technologies (Gallon, 2022). Yet, I add that Black DH is also a means of creating spaces to learn, talk, and tell stories about Black experiences in a digital world with digital tools. The strategies, technologies, spaces, and ways employed to tell or teach these Black experiences vary in this emerging field. The expansion of Black DH also resides in its conversation and interactions with other disciplines such as those discussed in this paper. The “more critical [Black DH] practices segue into these spaces [i.e., instructional design, exhibition design, and learning sciences] the greater the ability to shape [Black DH and these fields] into places of encounter for [learning], critique, intellectual growth, creative inspiration, and even activism.” (Clover et al., 2016, p.124).  </p>
            <p>According to Weheliye (2014), Black DH interrogates the sociopolitical relations that have racialized and informed the literature, philosophy, and texts we used. Gallon (2016) goes further to say that</p>
            <p>The Black digital humanities reveal how methodological approaches for studying and thinking about the category of blackness may come to bear on and transform the digital processes and tools used to study humanity… [the field] helps to unmask the racialized systems of power at work in how we understand the digital humanities as a field and utilize its associated techniques (pp. 43-46).</p>
            <p>Following Gallon (2016), I argue that Black DH can inform exhibition design, instructional design, and the learning sciences. It can help these fields examine the methodological approaches used to design, investigate, and understand learning as it relates to and situates blackness. It may also transform the processes and tools used to design and analyze learning in these fields. Embedded in Black DH approaches or practices is the critical lens applied to examine and think about Black experiences and blackness in relation to any other concept, technology, or practice. For instance, the critical lens of Black DH can help the fields of instructional design, exhibition design, and learning sciences critically engage with technology employed to design; critically interrogate the means utilized to support learning; and critically examine the concept of power when it comes to design and learning. Questions about learning, technology use, the learning process, who defines or has the power to define learning, and design learning spaces in relation to Black experiences can add to these other disciplines. The intersection of Black DH with other fields will create new avenues for research and expand research methods and practices for these fields. Black DH lends itself well with instructional design. Black DH provides resources, information about the Black experience, which instructional design can rely on to develop strategies that can positively shape the design of instructional materials that meets the needs of Black students. I contend that Black DH can serve as a critical lens that helps challenge racism embedded in exhibition design and achieve concrete change. Black DH will add to the other critical approaches such decolonization, postcolonial and Black feminist theories. Black DH can also act as a source that will ground exhibition design in new practices, design principles, and counter “the ‘cannibalistic’ tendency to trap the ‘other’ behind ‘our’ glass case displays and frame their knowledge according to western criteria” (Golding, 2023, p.7). Hence, Black DH can be a source of information for exhibition designers to narrate Black experiences.      </p>
            <p>Black DH can lead these fields to critically examine power historically to make sense of it contemporary. Such analysis can highlight voices that have often been left out or ignore; voices that have often been acknowledged, amplified, and validated; what knowledge, ways of learning, or doing that may have, historically, been deemed and may still be considered irrelevant; may be silenced, or opposed.  Bridging with these fields creates an opportunity for further questions and findings. Similarly, the emerging field of Black DH is about improving the Black experiences in different contexts; this includes learning spaces, and empowering Black people using various tools including technology to tell their stories. In this regard, Black DH can engage in a conversation with these fields, breaking the apparent barriers to shape these fields to transform the Black experience in any setting.  As interdisciplinary fields interested in inclusion, design, and learning, they can build upon Black DH knowledge to make greater collective progress to understand, support, and design learning for all.  Building on Markauskaite et al’s. (2024) perspective on the learning sciences, it is my understanding that the Black DH community has both a body of empirical research and prior knowledge to contribute, as well as expertise to advance research on learning in exhibition design, instructional design, and the learning sciences. Simultaneously, Black DH will benefit from these interactions and make progress in its endeavor to positively affect the experiences of Black people in any context or situation.          </p>

          <head>Conclusion</head>
            <p>The Black DH connects and informs Black studies with its practices and the critical lenses it applies to examine methods, digital platforms, and tools application to blackness and Black experiences. Through emerging and expanding the digital humanities, informing other disciplines, such as the learning sciences, exhibition design, and instructional design, will further advance Black DH. Black DH interrogate the relationship between the digital as power and blackness. Scholars in the fields of learning sciences, exhibition design, and instructional design, can build on this work to question how Blackness is shaped, portrayed, submerged, or even erased through the tools or methodological approaches employed in the study of learning study, in the design of instruction or exhibitions. Drawing from Lee (2018) argument on how fields considered different can speak to each other, I contend that scholars from each field need to connect and initiate collaborations. In other words, Black DH should start conversation with learning sciences, instructional design, and exhibition design, and vice-versa. This will allow parties “to get excited about ideas that other parties are also currently thinking about, and … have dialogue” (Lee, 2018). My argument is that such exchange of ideas could generate new methods and frameworks to address issues of inclusion, design, and learning for all.     </p>
