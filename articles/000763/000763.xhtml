                  <p>This article examines the connection between Black digital humanities and fields such
                     as the learning sciences, 
                     instructional design, and exhibition design. Focusing on key elements of these fields,
                     this paper shows their 
                     relevance to Black digital humanities, arguing that the future of this emerging field
                     lies in its intersections with 
                     other disciplines.

                  <div class="ptext" id="p1">Black digital humanities (Black DH) is an emerging field that centers Black people
                     in digital humanities. This field 
                     does not yet have established traditions regarding methods or research practices.
                     This youthfulness allows Black DH to 
                     be interdisciplinary and inclusive in relation to its methods, theoretical frameworks,
                     and research settings 
                     [<a class="ref" href="#prince_etal2022">Prince and Messina 2022</a>]. As a field that draws on Black studies and Black scholarship, Black DH has the 
                     potential to forge new paths “as [it] examines, constructs, and reimagines innovative communities 
                     and people [across space and time]” [<a class="ref" href="#prince_etal2022">Prince and Messina 2022</a>]. Drawing on the limitless and 
                     interdisciplinary nature of Black DH, I discuss connections between Black DH and the
                     fields of exhibition design, 
                     instructional design, and the learning sciences, reflecting on what Black DH can offer
                     practitioners of various 
                     backgrounds and how this emerging field can further its reach. I speak from my own
                     background working at the 
                     intersection of these fields, as a scholar with a degree in the learning sciences
                     who has designed analog and digital 
                     exhibitions drawing on instructional design to create learning experiences. While
                     I lead with caution that some of what 
                     I have to say here is derived from my experiences and is thus inherently incomplete,
                     I believe that Black DH will prove 
                     to be an important tool through which to address urgent issues of power and identity
                     in these academic communities.

                  <div class="ptext" id="p2">It is important at this junction to define Black DH. Black DH is an emerging field
                     conceived as the process or practice 
                     of engaging with the experiences and history of Black people through digital humanities
                     methodologies. Black DH 
                     addresses the intersection of Black lives, Black cultural and social experiences,
                     and Black humanity with digital 
                     technologies. As a field negotiating both Blackness and the digital, Black DH is an
                     endeavor to help restore the 
                     humanity of Black people through the use of digital platforms and tools [<a class="ref" href="#gallon2016">Gallon 2016</a>]. As Kim 
                     Gallon writes, in advocating for a group whose identity has historically been questioned
                     and denied, Black DH 
                     “troubles the very core of what we have come to know as the <em class="emph">humanities</em> by recovering 
                     alternate constructions of humanity that have been historically excluded from that
                     concept” 
                     [<a class="ref" href="#gallon2016">Gallon 2016</a>, 45]. Scholars of Black DH think critically about the issue of power; consider seriously
                     
                     the digital processes and tools used to study humanity; and combine historical and
                     contemporary perspectives of 
                     Black experiences to inform research and shape practices in the field.

                  <div class="counter"><a href="#p3">3</a></div>
                  <div class="ptext" id="p3">Black DH is also the process or practice of recognizing that Black history and experience
                     is defined by the intersection 
                     of policy, economics, race, technology, and gender. By using technologies and other
                     emerging tools to empower and 
                     enact respect for Black lives, practitioners simultaneously transform Black experiences
                     in society. In transforming 
                     the experiences of Black people, Black DH can in turn inform other fields instructional
                     design and exhibition design, 
                     in their shared pursuit of creating inclusive learning environments for all students,
                     as well as the learning sciences, 
                     which is about understanding the complexities of learning across contexts to devise
                     new approaches 
                     [<a class="ref" href="#lee2018">Lee 2018</a>]. Black DH lends itself well to this work by providing historical context for the
                     complexities 
                     of learning for Black learners. In the text that follows, I discuss the fundamentals
                     of each field and illustrate how 
                     these fields can learn from each other. Interdisciplinary collaboration will advance
                     Black DH, facilitating the 
                     transportation of ideas into new fields and contexts for greater impact on the real
                     world.

                  <div class="ptext" id="p4">Exhibition design is the art or process of putting together artifacts using available
                     technologies and tools to share 
                     a narrative around a topic. Exhibition design has consistently shifted over the years
                     from a curator-centered to an 
                     audience-centered approach [<a class="ref" href="#lake-hammond_etal2010">Lake-Hammond and Waite 2010</a>]. Though gallery space, collection content, and 
                     audience are fundamental elements of exhibition design, audience considerations are
                     increasingly becoming influential 
                     in the design of exhibitions [<a class="ref" href="#lake-hammond_etal2010">Lake-Hammond and Waite 2010</a>]. This shift to a user- or audience-centered design 
                     is related to the integration of concepts such as user- or human-centered design in
                     the broader discipline 
                     [<a class="ref" href="#lee2015">Lee 2015</a>] [<a class="ref" href="#lake-hammond_etal2010">Lake-Hammond and Waite 2010</a>]. The field of exhibition design is interdisciplinary 
                     as it draws on an iterative relationship between narrative, storytelling, architectural
                     space, communication media, 
                     and an understanding of the audience [<a class="ref" href="#locker2011">Locker 2011</a>]. It includes the fields of graphic, industrial, 
                     architectural, interaction, and organization design [<a class="ref" href="#lake-hammond_etal2010">Lake-Hammond and Waite 2010</a>]. A combination of experience 
                     design through multimedia technology, lighting, audio, and creative performance helps
                     create a comprehensive narrative 
                     around a topic. Indeed, Locker argues that there is no magic recipe for exhibition design because there 
                     are a variety of different approaches that have evolved with each generation of designers.
                     However, Derda provides a 
                     contemporary definition of exhibition design: 
                     <blockquote>
                        <p>Exhibition design is a process that uses visual 
                           storytelling and environment to convey information. It focuses on the content of the
                           artworks or artefacts to be 
                           presented and is concerned with their arrangement so that they may be understood in
                           connection to one another and in 
                           conversation with the viewing environment's conditions. [<a class="ref" href="#derda2023">Derda 2023</a>, 2]</p>

                  <div class="counter"><a href="#p5">5</a></div>
                  <div class="ptext" id="p5">Exhibition design requires a variety of design skills applied differently based on
                     the context 
                     [<a class="ref" href="#lee2015">Lee 2015</a>]. It's a method of information presentation that aims at engaging the audience through
                     the 
                     exhibition organization and the delivery of the information. As Urry and Larsen explain, the 
                     main goals of exhibition design are a) to connect the educational and culturally important
                     aspects of the content; and 
                     b) to attract a wider audience to create an environment that will both foster learning
                     and act as entertainment. 
                     Embedded in the exhibition design process is the desire to create and be learning
                     environments, thus the relevance of 
                     and connection with instructional design processes, further discussed below.

                     <div class="ptext" id="p6">As learning spaces, exhibitions have historically been designed to perpetuate colonial
                        and racist views of 
                        marginalized groups. For instance, when objects looted from former colonies or objects
                        that were created during 
                        the eras of chattel slavery or Jim Crow are exhibited without proper contextualization
                        in the design of the 
                        exhibition, they tend to reinforce racist and imperialist tropes. For the past four
                        years, conversations about race 
                        have increasingly been supported in the design world by the white designers, curators,
                        and editors who have 
                        dominated the field. However, the end goal of this dialogue has yet to be clarified,
                        as racist tropes and practices 
                        are still perpetuated by exhibition design [<a class="ref" href="#okhio2023">Okhio 2023</a>]. At a 2023 exhibition created by prominent 
                        designers and curators during Italian Design Week, figurines of the 1920s portraying
                        racist caricatures of Black, 
                        Asian, Middle Eastern, and Indigenous people as subhuman were displayed without any

                        [<a class="ref" href="#okhio2023">Okhio 2023</a>]. Yet, only a few designers, such as the Asian-Australian multi-disciplinary designer
                        
                        Jenny Nguyen and the Black American designer and professor of architecture Stephen Burks 
                        openly criticized the exhibition as offensive [<a class="ref" href="#okhio2023">Okhio 2023</a>]. Designers involved in the exhibition 
                        denied racist intent, apologizing for hurting certain communities and calling for
                        dialogue. Writing about this event, 
                        Camille Okhio wonders when the field will move past the endless and fruitless cycle of “dialogue” 
                        to concrete change [<a class="ref" href="#okhio2023">Okhio 2023</a>].

                        to counter the tendency to 
                        portray Black people and other marginalized groups as less than humans. For instance,
                        Hill and 
                        Middleton recommend that designers avoid the decontextualized display of objects behind glass
                        panes 
                        because such displays reflect colonial aesthetics in design. In fact, the encapsulation
                        of objects in oak cases, 
                        organized according to neat taxonomies, reduces the cultural materials to mere curiosities,
                        thereby exoticizing 
                        non-Western, non-white cultures [<a class="ref" href="#hills_etal2023">Hills and Middleton 2023</a>]. Likewise, the design of visitor experiences is often 
                        shaped by the colonial imagination in that visitors are expected to only explore and
                        interact with exhibitions in 
                        certain ways. Those who do not conform to these unspoken expectations are not considered
                        “good” (code for 
                        white, middle-class) visitors [<a class="ref" href="#hills_etal2023">Hills and Middleton 2023</a>]. This colonial perspective on visitors' experience 
                        explains recent incidents at the Metropolitan Museum, where a Cambodian artist was kicked out for 
                        performing a dance prayer to her ancestral gods in an exhibition of looted religious
                        statues and a Black artist 
                        was expelled from an exhibition about Black Rest for asking white visitors to honor
                        the space

                        with issues of race and equity 
                        in the field. Ryan Ikeda et al. recognize that the educational system has been designed to create 
                        inequity and to contribute to the design of instructional materials that serve as
                        tools for the white supremacist and 
                        settler colonial project in the United States. In other words, instructional design models are shaped 
                        by racist and colonialist perspectives that need to be dismantled to create “a learning model 
                        that quickly responds to the slippery machinations of racism” [<a class="ref" href="#ikeda_etal2021">Ikeda et al. 2021</a>, 28]. 
                        Applying anti-racist pedagogy to design implies approaching instructional design as
                        a collective activity by 
                        integrating different stakeholders from various fields, including the humanities and

                        designing with awareness of situational factors that can impact student learning;
                        being cognizant of one's 
                        positionality through one's various identities, biases, and commitments; and representing

                        dynamics among learners, particularly minoritized learners. Yet, by integrating critical
                        race theory (CRT) into an 
                        instructional design model, Lu and Xu propose the Motivational Framework for Culturally 
                        Responsive Teaching (MFCRT) as a means of attending to learners' racial identities.
                        Indeed, this model centers on 
                        developing race awareness, unpacking white privilege, and paying attention to silenced
                        students 
                        [<a class="ref" href="#lu_etal2020">Lu and Xu 2020</a>]. Similarly, Michael K. Thomas and Marco A. Columbus suggest 
                        integrating culture and identity, particularly African American identity, in instructional
                        design work. Their theory 
                        of primary cultural instructional design states that instructional designers must
                        interact with culture and 
                        identity by designing relevant and meaningful learning environments that take into
                        consideration communities such 
                        as African American learners [<a class="ref" href="#thomas_etal2009">Thomas and Columbus 2009</a>]. Addressing the question of culture in instructional 
                        design, Patricia A. Young developed the culture-based model (CBM), an intercultural instructional 
                        design framework to guide designers through the design, management, development, and
                        evaluation process 
                        [<a class="ref" href="#young2008">Young 2008</a>]. Culture is an integral part of one's identity, with this model, Young points 
                        to the fact that minoritized or otherwise unrepresented cultural groups have not been
                        taken into consideration in 
                        previous instructional design models. There is no doubt that the growing interest
                        in issues of equity and race 
                        within the field of instructional design demonstrates a need to reckon with previous
                        practices that have ignored

                     and educate the public about and 
                     around a topic or theme. The act of choosing the exhibition theme and designing its
                     contents cannot be completed without 
                     the input of curators, who are often subject matter experts with sufficient knowledge
                     to help the exhibition designer

                        and culture. Scholars are 
                        exploring the power dynamics in learning environments [<a class="ref" href="#lee2022">Lee 2022</a>], and more researchers are recognizing 
                        that the learning sciences should focus on issues of justice and entitlement in and
                        through learning environments 
                        [<a class="ref" href="#esmonde_etal2017">Esmonde and Booker 2017</a>]. Talia Leibovitz et al. also call for further commitment to racial 
                        justice and urgent and vigorous participation in the racial justice initiative. For
                        the authors, this includes 
                        learning about social justice through the framework of pedagogies of witnessing [<a class="ref" href="#leibovitz_etal2024">Leibovitz et al. 2024</a>]. 
                        However, “the learning sciences possesses limited theoretical underpinnings that make the 
                        relationship between power and learning visible, even as the field strives to speak
                        across both a situated, 
                        sociocultural tradition and a more individualistic psychological tradition” [<a class="ref" href="#esmonde_etal2017">Esmonde and Booker 2017</a>]. 
                        Consequently, the limited theoretical grounding may explore the limited research on
                        racial issues. For this reason, 
                        I assert that Black DH can provide the learning sciences with the theoretical underpinning
                        needed to contend with 
                        issues of race.

                     and still affect Black people. 
                     The field tells the story of a people, working to restore their humanity by using
                     digital tools. Given their interest 
                     in organizing information to reach a diverse audience, the fields of exhibition design,
                     instructional design, and 
                     learning sciences can be informed by the Black DH. In <cite class="title italic">Making a Case for Black Digital 
                        Humanities,</cite> Kim Gallon, drawing from Kirschenbaum, states the following:
                     “Black digital humanities reflects less an actual ‘thing’ and more of a 
                     constructed space to consider the intersections between the digital and blackness…
                     Like race, gender, class, and 
                     sexuality — all social constructs, if you will — the digital humanities increasingly
                     hold real meaning and significance 
                     in the academic universe. [<a class="ref" href="#gallon2016">Gallon 2016</a>]” I draw on Gallon's argument to contend that 
                     race, gender, class, sexuality, and all social constructs increasingly hold real meaning
                     in the learning sciences, 
                     exhibition design, and instructional design.

                  <div class="ptext" id="p20">As such, these fields can benefit from the insights of Black DH practitioners into
                     the intersection of technology and 
                     Blackness. Yet, these fields can also bring to Black DH their perspectives on learning
                     and design. The lens of Black DH 
                     is critical in examining, analyzing, and providing perspectives on technology and
                     Blackness. I contend that being able 
                     to communicate, inform, and even learn about these complex interactions and intersections
                     requires the scholars in the 
                     field to think about a) learning; b) exhibition; and c) instructional design implications
                     and applications. In other 
                     words, when creating an exhibition, designers should assume the habits of instructional
                     designers by thinking of 
                     exhibitions as the process of designing learning spaces with instructional goals and
                     objectives. As Bedford 
                     states, regardless of how broad, problematic, select, or beneficial, exhibitions “were designed to 
                     educate” [<a class="ref" href="#bedford2014">Bedford 2014</a>, 22]. However, “their pedagogies… are neither 
                     straightforward nor always comfortable, but rather, multifarious — as troubling and
                     conflicting as they are exciting 
                     and inspiring” [<a class="ref" href="#clover_etal2016">Clover et al. 2016</a>, 123]. To summarize, exhibitions are learning spaces 
                     [<a class="ref" href="#merriam_etal2014">Merriam and Bierema 2014</a>]. Thus, exhibition design can also be perceived as the process of developing spaces
                     
                     that can facilitate learning. Thinking about exhibitions as learning spaces will help
                     exhibition designers integrate 
                     visitors (i.e., learners) into the entire design process and support exhibition design
                     with learning theories that can 
                     help exhibitions achieve the goal of education. The learning sciences also allows
                     for exhibition designers to find ways 
                     to support exhibition visitors' learning, such as by integrating relevant technologies.

                  <div class="ptext" id="p23">Following Gallon, I argue that Black DH can inform exhibition design, instructional design, and the
                     learning 
                     sciences. It can help these fields examine the methodological approaches used to design,
                     investigate, and understand 
                     learning as it relates to and situates Blackness. It may also transform the processes
                     and tools used to design and 
                     analyze learning in these fields. Embedded in Black DH approaches and practices is
                     the critical lens applied to examine 
                     and think about Black experiences and Blackness in relation to other concepts, technologies,
                     and practices. For instance, 
                     the critical lens of Black DH can help the fields of instructional design, exhibition
                     design, and learning sciences 
                     critically engage with technologies employed to design; critically interrogate the
                     means utilized to support learning; 
                     and critically examine the concept of power when it comes to design and learning.
                     Through Black DH, we can better 
                     explore questions about learning processes and technology use, as well as who has
                     the power to define learning and 
                     learning spaces in relation to Black experiences.

                     and expand research methods and 
                     practices for these fields. Black DH lends itself well to instructional design by
                     providing resources and information 
                     about the Black experience that instructional design can rely on to create instructional
                     materials that meet the needs 
                     of Black students. I contend that Black DH can serve as a critical lens that helps
                     challenge racism embedded in 
                     exhibition design and achieve concrete change. Black DH can also act as a source that
                     will ground exhibition design in 
                     new practices, design principles, and counter “the ‘cannibalistic’ 
                     tendency to trap the ‘other’ behind ‘our’ glass case displays and 
                     frame their knowledge according to western criteria” [<a class="ref" href="#golding2016">Golding 2016</a>, 7]. Hence, Black DH can 
                     be a source of information for exhibition designers to narrate Black experiences.

                     context to make sense of it 
                     contemporarily. Such analysis can highlight voices that have often been left out or
                     ignored, as well as the different 
                     forms of knowledge and ways of learning and doing that have historically and may still
                     today be considered irrelevant 
                     or unimportant. Bridging with these fields creates an opportunity for further questions
                     and findings. Since the 
                     emerging field of Black DH is about improving the Black experiences in different contexts,
                     our work should include 
                     learning spaces and what it means to empower Black people using various tools, including
                     technology, to tell their 
                     stories. In this regard, Black DH can engage in a conversation with these fields,
                     breaking the apparent barriers to 
                     transform the Black experience in any setting. As interdisciplinary fields interested
                     in inclusion, design, and 
                     learning, they can build upon Black DH knowledge to make greater collective progress
                     to understand, support, and design 
                     learning for all. Building on Lina Markauskaite et al.'s perspective on the learning sciences, it is my 
                     understanding that the Black DH community has a body of empirical research and prior
                     knowledge to contribute, as well 
                     as expertise to advance research on learning in exhibition design, instructional design,
                     and the learning sciences. 
                     Simultaneously, Black DH will benefit from these interactions and make progress in
                     its endeavor to positively affect the 
                     xperiences of Black people in any context or situation.

                     digital platforms, and tool applications to Blackness and Black experiences. Through
                     emerging and expanding the digital 
                     humanities through other disciplines, such as the learning sciences, exhibition design,
                     and instructional design, will 
                     further advance Black DH. Black DH interrogates the relationship between Blackness
                     and the digital as power. Scholars 
                     in the fields of learning sciences, exhibition design, and instructional design, can
                     build on this work to question how 
                     Blackness is shaped, portrayed, submerged, or even erased through the tools or methodological
                     approaches employed in the 
                     study of learning and in the design of instructional materials and exhibitions. Drawing
                     from Lee's writing 
                     about how different fields can speak to each other, I argue that scholars from these
                     fields need to connect and initiate 
                     collaborations. In other words, Black DH practitioners should start conversations
                     with scholars of the learning sciences, 
                     instructional design, and exhibition design, and vice-versa. This will allow parties
                     “to get excited 
                     about ideas that other parties are also currently thinking about, and … have dialogue” 
                     [<a class="ref" href="#lee2018">Lee 2018</a>]. My argument is that such exchange of ideas could generate new methods and frameworks
                     to address 
                     issues of inclusion, design, and learning for all.
