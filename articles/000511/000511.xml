      <dhq:abstract>
        <p>In this paper, we argue for the value of motion capture-driven research that moves
          audiovisual analysis in a performative direction to integrate the dancer/researcher into
          the cinematic space. Like the work of videographic practitioners who communicate their
          findings through the audiovisual medium, rather than the written medium, this work seeks
          to engage with what Catherine Grant and Brad Haseman have called performative research by
          applying a practice-led approach to moving image analysis. Through a physical and virtual
          embodiment of film and dance form, we seek to better understand the formal implications of
          dance’s integration into cinematic space and the material conditions that affected
          filmmakers’ narrative and stylistic choices. The Movement Visualization Tool (mv tool) is
          a virtual research environment that generates live feedback of multiple agents’ movement.
          Accessible motion capture technology renders an abstracted skeleton of the moving agents,
          providing information about movement pathways through space using color-based and
          historical traceform filters. The tool can also replicate a mobile frame aesthetic,
          allowing for a constructed mover and a virtually constructed camera to engage in
          performative dialogue. We use the mv tool and videographic methods to recreate and
          disseminate two cases: movement scales from Laban/Bartenieff Movement Studies and dance
          sequences from narrative cinema. Rather than working from existing audiovisual content, we
          posit that the act of recreating the movement phrases leads to a deeper understanding of
          the choreography and, in the case of the filmic examples, of the formal practices that led
          to their creation.</p>

      <div>
        <head>Introduction</head>
        <p>The human body is a staggeringly intricate instrument. Filmmakers have developed
          meaningful, complex ways of staging figure movement on screen for storytelling purposes,
          both aided and impeded by the industrial, technological, and cultural changes that affect
          the conventions of film form. Despite significant developments in the digital humanities,
          the infinite variability and historical specificity of the body and cinematic space defy
          any single tool or method’s attempts to offer an automated, comprehensive categorization
          of figure movement in film. Much of the work in the field prioritizes quantitative and
          qualitative methods for observing and communicating research findings. What knowledge
          could we gain by integrating the researcher into a cinematic space, using digital tools to
          recreate the craft of dance and film form?</p>
        <p>We argue for the value of motion capture-driven research that affords us such integration
          and moves audiovisual analysis in a performative direction. The <emph>Movement
            Visualization Tool</emph> (mv tool), a virtual research environment that generates live
          feedback of multiple agents’ movement, makes these lines of inquiry possible. Inexpensive,
          lightweight motion capture technology renders an abstracted skeleton of the moving agent,
          providing information about movement patterns and pathways through space using color-based
          and historical traceform filters. The tool also allows a virtually constructed mover and
          camera to interact through manual or algorithmic manipulation, replicating a mobile frame
          effect to study patterns of camera and figure movement. Researching in such a space is
          therefore inherently hands-on, interactive, and driven by the creation of new audiovisual
          content. Like the work of videographic practitioners who study and communicate their
          findings through the audiovisual medium, rather than in written form, this work applies
          performative research methods <ptr target="#haseman2006"/>
          <ptr target="#grant2016"/> to a study of movement on screen. We posit that through a
          practice-led embodiment of film and dance form we can better understand the formal
          implications of dance’s integration into cinematic space and the material conditions that
          affected filmmakers’ narrative and stylistic choices. By visualizing movement patterns
          with the mv tool and disseminating that video data as an essential part of our research
          output, we hope to offer alternative modes of scholarly dissemination that enriches
          humanistic observation of cinematic movement.</p>
        <p>Two audiovisual case studies allow us to test the methodological value of this approach
          and deepen our understanding of moving image form. The first explores patterns from
          Laban/Bartenieff Movement Studies (subsequently LBMS) to observe the compatibility of this
          system’s expansive taxonomy of human movement with computerized analytical methods. By
          recording and manipulating LBMS’ Axis and Girdle movement scales, we can better perceive
          how those forms are rendered in a cinematic, rather than live, space. The second builds on
          this foundation and involves the recreation of dance sequences from two films, <emph>Top
            Hat</emph> (1935, Marc Sandrich) and <emph>Beau travail</emph> (1999, Claire Denis). By
          isolating the body and camera from their cinematic surroundings, we can recreate core
          staging and figure movement elements and can generate alternative camera and figure
          relationships. The result is a better understanding of these film sequences’ functions and
          the motivations that drove the filmmakers’ choices. A performative method combined with
          digital capture tools sharpens formal analysis, when studying figure movement on screen in
          particular. This approach enhances our ability to rigorously articulate the complexities
          of the human body in motion and deepens our understanding of cinematic production
          histories.</p>

        <head>Mapping Performative Research in the Digital Humanities</head>
        <p>Approaching our subject from a performative research paradigm helps us to further
          understand the stylistic and material components of dance in narrative filmmaking.
          Catherine Grant draws upon Brad Haseman in describing performative research as an approach
          in which symbolic data and material forms of practice "work as utterances that accomplish,
          by their very enunciation, an action that generates effects" <ptr target="#haseman2006"
            loc="102"/>
          <ptr target="#grant2016" loc="14"/>. Practice is thus a critical aspect of performative
          research with the performative act serving as the data.</p>
        <p>Scholars in a number of disciplines have engaged with methodologies of performative or
          practice-led research in order to approach their subject from a more dynamic perspective
            <ptr target="#haseman2006"/>, formulate new research questions in audio-visual analysis
            <ptr target="#grant2016"/>
          <ptr target="#mittell2019"/>
          <ptr target="#keathley2016"/>
          <ptr target="#hagedoorn"/>, illuminate hidden or implicit characteristics of audiovisual
          texts <ptr target="#cox2019"/>
          <ptr target="#arnold2019b"/>, and develop new pedagogical tools <ptr target="#proctor2019"
          />. We mobilize the methodological advantages of a practice-led approach through embodied,
          analytical recreations of figure movement in cinematic space and through an engagement
          with the material constraints of cinematic form.</p>

          <head>Studying movement in motion</head>
          <p>Film and digital humanities scholars have created theoretical and historical models
            that expand our understanding of how bodies can manifest on screen <ptr

            <ptr target="#keating2019"/>

            <ptr target="#aceland2016"/>
            <ptr target="#flueckiger2018"/>. Substantial research outside of a cinematic context has
            explored the value of quantifying aspects of LBMS’s movement frameworks <ptr

            <ptr target="#cuan2019"/>
            <ptr target="#slaney2018"/>. However, this work rarely includes its movement data as
            part of the published output, reducing the reader’s ability to directly engage with the
            object of study’s dynamic nature or to evaluate the data generated by a performative
            research paradigm.</p>
          <p>Our research method perceives the object of study as one in motion as well as in
            stasis, engaging with what Henri Bergson has called an "intuitive" knowledge of movement
              <ptr target="#bergson2007"/> to better understand choreographic patterns and the
            myriad choices filmmakers make in staging the body for the camera. Carol-Lynne Moore
            sees close ties between Bergson’s categorizations of intellectual and intuitive
            perception and Rudolf Laban’s theories of Space from LBMS, which describes where the
            body moves in its environment. Whereas intellectual knowledge perceives movement as
            snapshots in time, an intuitive understanding perceives movement as a "flowing
            continuity fluctuating endlessly" <ptr target="#moore2009" loc="84"/>. This approach to
            perception has phenomenological implications as well. Our ability to study past
            traceforms of movement through the mv tool’s historical traceform filter evokes the sort
            of "thickness" that Maurice Merleau-Ponty theorizes in his evocation of the accumulation
            of perceptual content <ptr target="#merleau2002" loc="321"/>. Embodying the movement is
            a key part of our analytical process; the videographic content presented in this article
            serves both as a record of the movement recreations and as a component of the research
            output.</p>
          <p>It can further be argued that intuitive understanding is also an implicit aspect of
            videographic criticism, which allows practitioners to "enter into" their object of study
              <ptr target="#bergson2007" loc="130"/>, in this case an audiovisual or filmic form. As
            Grant elaborates, in videographic criticism the researcher engages with the logic of the
            medium on its own terms in a way that encourages experimentation and play <ptr
              target="#grant2016"/>. Jason Mittell similarly points to the transformative value of
            entering moving images through nonlinear editing, arguing, "Even if you don’t make
            something new with the sounds and images imported into the editing platform, you can
            still discover something new by exploring a film via this new interface" <ptr
              target="#mittell2019" loc="226"/>. Rather than working from existing audiovisual
            content, we posit that the act of recreating the movement phrases leads to a deeper
            understanding of movement patterns and, in the case of the filmic examples, of the
            formal practices that led to their creation.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <head>Performing constraints</head>
          <p>Haseman positions this kind of practice-led approach as central to a performative
            paradigm, but he does not discuss the potential of considering choices and constraints
            as a part of such an approach. All creative practices are affected by constraints or
            obstacles of various kinds at both the macro and micro level of production: a director
            makes storytelling and aesthetic choices based on the budget available to them; a
            cinematographer chooses how to place and move the camera based on available technology;
            a choreographer can only work in a particular dance style (jazz, for example) if the
            surrounding cultural conditions have encouraged professional dancers to also train in
            that form. Filmmakers are constantly using craft practices, existing models and
            experience, and trial and error to guide their decision-making. As a result, stylistic
            history can benefit from what David Bordwell calls a problem-solution model of
            understanding the choices filmmakers make by envisioning stylistic history as a "network
            of problems and solutions" <ptr target="#bordwell1997" loc="149"/>.</p>
          <p>A practice-led approach, through the physical and intellectual act of recreation,
            encourages the analyst to engage with a similar level of material specificity. Indeed,
            as Bordwell argues, adopting a problem-solution model to understanding film history has
            recreation of practical details as an inherent aspect of its approach; the task "is one
            of reconstruction. On the basis of surviving films and other documents, the historian
            reconstructs a choice situation" <ptr target="#bordwell1997" loc="156"/>. Through a
            performative approach, the act is one of recreation rather than reconstruction. By
            directly engaging with the process, we end up with a tangible creation, informed by
            careful study of the original, that was subject to its own series of problems and
            solutions. The video and motion-capture recreations of LBMS scales and dance numbers
            published here, in turn, communicate research findings that complement our written
            analysis of those same movement examples. For example, in "No Strings (Reprise)" from
              <emph>Top Hat</emph> there is a movement where Fred Astaire shifts his weight into a
            chair and ostensibly falls asleep. In practicing the sequence for recreation with our
            dancers, we discovered that using a chair for the ending led to a more constrained and
            cautious movement quality, due to the light chair creating an unstable situation as the
            movers shifted weight onto it. Choreographing a graceful final posture for Astaire’s
            number resulted in a series of choices, perhaps an adjustment to the choreography, a
            change of furniture so that a lower armchair would permit Astaire to better
            counterbalance into it, or the addition of the carpet which mitigates most of the
            instability. We similarly needed to find solutions to the problem, but in our case,
            different furniture or securing the chair to the floor was not an option (i.e. the
            obvious solution of nailing the chair in place would certainly have infuriated the
            building owner and prevented our ability to continue working in the studio). Since our
            greatest priority was maintaining the spinning choreography, the feeling of lightness,
            and the increasing drowsiness of Astaire’s character, we chose to have the dancers shift
            into a final resting pose on the floor instead, which allowed us to more effectively
            maintain the movement qualities and the long line of the body seen in the final
            pose.</p>
          <p>Methodologically, by conducting research in an audiovisual medium, our work will lead
            us to make choices and confront obstacles in parallel to the films we were
              recreating.<note>While techniques for teaching figure movement or film form is not the
              focus of this article, this approach also has obvious pedagogical value in its ability
              to instill a greater awareness of and respect for the complexities of any audiovisual
              production.</note> Catherine Grant touches on this issue in referencing concerns from
            the art-scholar Barbara Bolt, articulating that "following Haseman, the problem for the
            'performative’ (or creative) academic researcher can lie in recognising and mapping the
            effects or 'transformations’ that have occurred in their practice-research" <ptr
              target="#grant2016" loc="14"/>. In our work, we choose to approach this problem as an
            opportunity. Incorporating an acknowledgment and understanding of constraints and
            choices into the performative research method leads to a more rigorous process and, as
            we found with our case studies, to new and valuable insights. It also helped us refine
            our understanding of the Kinect’s technological advantages and limitations in motion
            capture.</p>
          <p>Our results were affected by the resources and technology available to us, and we made
            deliberate, informed decisions based on those practical constraints. In choosing to work
            primarily with motion-capture data over video, however, we are able to move beyond the
            gravitational and physical constraints of reality, and our research tool is specifically
            designed to modify the rendering of the captured data, allowing for experimentation with
            the relationship between figure and frame.</p>

        <head>Technical Description of the Movement Visualization Tool</head>
        <p>The <emph>Movement Visualization Tool</emph> (mv tool) is a modular system for figure
          movement data capture that facilitates a variety of processes<emph>.</emph> The modular
          nature of the system’s components allows for a dynamic architecture. We can extract or add
          modules as needed to achieve tasks concurrently or independently. Users can visualize the
          abstracted skeleton generated by the mv tool with the addition of various forms of visual
          and sonic feedback to better perceive the body’s movement through space. The users’
          interaction with the skeleton and the visual/sonic filters can occur in a real-time (live)
          environment or can be recorded and manipulated for post-collection analysis. For the
          purposes of this research, the system can be broken down into three modules: data
          collection, data analysis and preprocessing, and visualization.</p>
        <div>
          <head>Data Collection</head>
          <p>The <emph>data collection</emph> module is a motion capture application that utilizes
            remote sensors to extract abstract movement data from users. Movement data is captured
            using the Microsoft Kinect V2, which we chose for its relative robustness-to-cost ratio,
            its portability, and its lightweight network protocol coupling capability, principally
            with Open Sound Control (OSC). The Kinect uses infrared cameras to generate depth maps,
            which are then internally transformed into a variety of different generalized
            representations, including a 25-joint skeleton frame. Using custom developed software
            applications <ptr target="#junokas2018"/>, users can access the Kinect’s application
            programming interface and construct a 3-by-25 <emph>skeleton sensor array</emph> for
            each body captured by the Kinect (i.e. the three spatial dimensions along horizontal/x,
            vertical/y, and sagittal/z planes for each of the 25 joints).</p>
          <p>To increase resolution and/or range, multiple Kinect data collection stations can be
            added to the system, generating independent skeleton sensor arrays using the same module
            articulated above but in multiple instances. These arrays are then sent to the next
            module for data analysis and preprocessing (<ref target="#figure01">Figure 1</ref>).</p>
          <figure xml:id="figure01">
            <head>Movement visualization tool infrastructure.</head>

          </figure>
        </div>
        <div>
          <head>Data Analysis and Preprocessing</head>
          <p>The skeleton sensor arrays are sent from the data collection module into the <emph>data
              analysis and preprocessing</emph> module<emph>,</emph> where they are prepared for the
            next series of modules within the system. The analysis and preprocessing is done with
            Max/MSP/Jitter <ptr target="#puckette2018"/>, which we chose due to its
            signal-processing based computational design, native support for real-time interaction,
            compatibility with the chosen protocol (i.e. OSC), and the ability to easily create
            object oriented visualization filters.</p>
          <p>The multiple skeleton sensor arrays from the Kinects can be synced at a constant frame
            rate, combining the multiple data streams into one representative <emph>skeleton
              frame,</emph> transforming them to generate the highest resolution and largest sensor
            capture range possible from the input skeleton sensor arrays. For this research, while
            three Kinects were used, comparable resolutions were achieved using the data from one
            Kinect. This was largely due to the asynchronous frame rate of data capture across the
            three Kinects, leading to a non-unified temporal dataset that could not simply be made
            into a higher resolution (e.g. a frame missing from one Kinect would not necessarily be
            at the same frame as the other Kinects, making corrective interpolation or substitution
            substantially more difficult). Due to this, the ultimate skeleton frame was composed
            from a singular sensor’s data capture.</p>
          <p>The skeleton frame is then parsed into respective body arrays for individual,
            positional mover analysis, taking the first and second derivative of the skeleton joint
            positions, generating an approximate measure of <emph>velocity</emph> and
              <emph>acceleration</emph>. The magnitude of these derivatives is calculated,
            generating an approximate measure of <emph>speed</emph> and the <emph>magnitude of
              acceleration.</emph> Using these physical representations, kinematic limitations can
            be placed on the skeleton frame, setting programmatic bounds modeled on physically
            possible human movement. This reduces jitter and discontinuity errors between frames,
            making a more realistic physical representation for the digital data stream.</p>
          <p>From these bounded positions, kinematic measures and relative positions are measured
            and collected, providing an extension to the sensor’s positioning. These relative
            positions measure the dimensional difference of each joint from every other joint. On
            top of these physically limited relative positions, infinite impulse response filters
            (with dynamic coefficients that can be user defined) can be applied, weighting the
            current frame’s position by the previous frame’s position, creating a type of smoothing
            on the positions, which dampens jerky frame-to-frame movements, resulting in the
              <emph>preprocessed skeleton array,</emph> the main source of data for the rest of the
            system (<ref target="#figure02">Figure 2</ref>). In this research, the mv tool uses the
            preprocessed skeleton array to drive the visualization of mover and the relative camera
            position.</p>

          <head>Visualization</head>
          <p>The mv tool visualization principally serves as an abstract joint skeleton
            representation that shows the subject’s movement in relationship to a virtual camera
            position. Purposefully eliminating other environmental contexts, this abstracted view
            focuses on what is being captured by the system, ultimately informing the direction of
            our research. Additionally, the mv tool allows for visual filters to be placed on the
            abstract skeleton, highlighting several opportunities for further analysis and
            understanding. For the purposes of this work, we apply three filters to provoke deeper
            research: dynamic camera positioning based on joint movement, historical joint
            traceforms, and spatial color maps.</p>
          <p>The mv tool has the capability to dynamically change the position of the virtual camera
            in the digital space, operating independently or coupled with the subject it is
            "filming." While users can manually control the three-dimensional digital camera
            position in the digital space, the camera movement can be tied to track a specific joint
            of the subject, moving in relation to the subject figure’s movement. For example, the
            camera can track the pelvic joints of the subject, moving in <emph>parallel</emph> or in
              <emph>counterpoint</emph> to the joint, allowing the subject’s pelvis to control the
            position of the camera as it moves (<ref target="#figure03">Figure 3</ref>).</p>
          <figure xml:id="figure03">
            <head>LBMS dimensional scale demonstrating parallel pelvic movement.</head>
            <media mimeType="video/mp4" url="https://player.vimeo.com/video/409178465"/>
          </figure>
          <p>A historical joint trail filter can also be applied to the skeleton figure, leaving a
            dynamic history of the subject’s movement in the scene. The persistence of the
            traceforms in the scene can be manipulated by the user, ranging from no historical
            traceforms to the entire temporal record of the captured movement. This provides the
            user with a visual "history," giving better insight into the paths and patterns of their
            movement (<ref target="#figure04">Figure 4</ref>).</p>

            <graphic url="resources/images/figure04.png"/>
          </figure>
          <p>Spatial color maps can also be added to the skeleton joints, providing insight into the
            trajectory of a given joint’s movement from an anchored point (<ref target="#figure05"
              >Figure 5</ref>). For example, the trajectory of the right wrist from the spine mid
            can be colored in relation to its proximity to a three dimensional unit projection from
            the spine mid, providing the mover with a color map relating which of twenty-seven unit
            projections their movement aligns closest with (i.e. the complete set of permutation
            that can be made using only 1 and 0 in 3D).</p>

          </figure>
          <p>The ability to manipulate recorded movement data in these ways allows the analyst to
            draw attention to different aspects of the body’s movement in space. These adjustments
            create a "poeticized quantification" of data that resembles videographic deformation
            methods articulated by Jason Mittell, which he argues can help scholars formulate new
            observations about an art object’s form <ptr target="#mittell2019"/>. By algorithmically
            changing our visualizations of human movement, we can amplify certain observable
            patterns, posit hypothetical alternatives (in the relationship between camera and
            figure, especially), or simply marvel at the expansive complexities of the human
            body.</p>

        <head>Case study: Laban/Bartenieff Movement Studies (Axis and Girdle Scales)</head>
        <p>Laban/Bartenieff Movement Studies offers a detailed taxonomy to describe, analyze, and
          categorize forms of human movement and encourages the analyst to take a performative
          approach to their workflow by both observing and embodying movement patterns. Our first
          case study comes from the Space category of LBMS, which seeks to understand where the body
          moves to in its environment. This exploration considers in a more quantitative manner the
          changing shape of the Kinesphere, or "the space within the reach of the body" <ptr
            target="#laban2011a" loc="10"/>.<note>Capitalized terms indicate vocabulary from the
            LBMS framework. For more on the LBMS work, see <ptr target="#laban2011a"/>
            <ptr target="#laban2011b"/>
            <ptr target="#moore2009"/>. For an approach to the work using less technical language,
            see <ptr target="#studd2013"/>.</note> Rudolf Laban theorized a series of movement
          scales designed to increase the body’s range of motion and encourage the exploration of
          movement through particular pathways. Like musical scales, they are designed with a
          theoretical rigor, follow a series of guidelines based on the necessary space between each
          directional pull (frequently referred to in LMBS as Spatial Pulls), and are
          repeatable.</p>
        <p>The Space category taxonomizes multiple geometric elements to describe the body’s
          orientation in space <ptr target="#laban2011a" loc="10–17"/>:</p>
        <list type="unordered">
          <item>Directionality, or Spatial Pulls, of movement as articulated along the three
            dimensions (Vertical, Horizontal, Sagittal)</item>
          <item>The shape of the pathways with which the body moves from point to point (Central,
            Peripheral, or Transverse)</item>
          <item>The position of movement relative to the body center (Near Reach Space to Far Reach
            Space)</item>
          <item>The height (Low, Mid-height, High) of the leading movement</item>
        </list>
        <p>Space draws on Laban’s research into theories of platonic solids, leading him to argue
          for twenty-seven dominant Spatial Pulls or directional rays <ptr target="#laban2011a"
            loc="10–17"/>. Six pulls form the basis for axial movement (up, down, forward, back,
          right, left), rays that when plotted on a graph represent the end points of an octahedron.
          When sequenced together, these six pulls form the dimensional scale, which isolates each
          of the three axes (Vertical, Horizontal, Sagittal) and demonstrates the relative stability
          of this range of motion (<ref target="#figure06">Figure 6</ref>).</p>

        </figure>
        <p>Laban theorized that all remaining Spatial Pulls are the result of these six fundamental
          pulls combining in both unequal and equal combinations. Twelve rays form the basis for
          planar movement; the three planes — horizontal, vertical, and sagittal — each contains
          four Spatial Pulls. Laban theorized movement between those twelve rays as existing in an
          icosahedral space. Combining all three Dimensional Pulls equally leads to highly mobile
          movement, which Laban saw as moving between the endpoints and diagonals of a cube:
          Right-Forward-High, Left-Back-Low, Left-Forward-High, Right-Back-Low, Left-Back-High,
          Right-Forward-Low, Right-Back-High, Left-Forward-Low. To these twenty-six rays or Spatial
          Pulls we add Place, Laban’s articulation of a relatively neutral starting and ending
          position for scales, in which the figure is standing with the arms relaxed by their side
          and the feet planted in parallel.</p>
        <p>The two scales we chose to visualize come from movement in an icosahedral space, the Axis
          scale and the Girdle scale. These forms are paired and complementary; each scale includes
          six points, none of which are repeated in the other scale’s movement. As a result, the two
          scales together move the body through all twelve theorized planar directions. Both scales
          also interact with the Right-Forward-High to Left-Back-Low diagonal of the cube. The Axis
          scale moves through Transverse pathways that deflect off of the diagonal without ever
          crossing it. Its Spatial Pulls are as follows (<ref target="#figure07">Figure
          7</ref>):</p>
        <p>Right-High (vertical), Back-Low (sagittal), Right-Forward (horizontal), Left-Low
          (vertical), Forward-High (sagittal), Left-Back (horizontal)</p>

        </figure>
        <p>In contrast, the Girdle scale, which Laban calls "a chain of six surface-lines" <ptr
            target="#laban2011a" loc="68"/> moves in a Peripheral pathway that orbits the diagonal,
          as follows (<ref target="#figure08">Figure 8</ref>):</p>
        <p>Left-High (vertical), Back-High (sagittal), Right-Back (horizontal), Right-Low
          (vertical), Forward-Low (sagittal), Left-Forward (horizontal)</p>

        </figure>
        <p>Each scale results in a different gestalt movement quality and progression through
          pathways. As the Axis scale deflects off of the diagonal, its movement has more of a
          swinging feel as the body moves back and forth between High and Low, Forward and Back, and
          Right (open) and Left (closed). The Girdle scale, through its peripheral movement, creates
          a pathway that maintains a consistent distance from the body center and moves through
          adjacent icosahedral Spatial Pulls, creating a smoother, circular quality in the body <ptr
            target="#laban2011a"/>
          <ptr target="#moore2009"/>.</p>
        <p>Defining twenty-seven possible directions for the body to move is inherently limiting.
          Laban writes that "innumerable directions radiate from the centre of our body and its
          kinesphere into infinite space" <ptr target="#laban2011a" loc="17"/>. However, these
          limitations and geometric parallels are beneficial to a computerized visualization of
          movement, in which we must define each possible zone of movement. This subdivision
          provided the spatial segmentation for the mv tool’s color filter, in particular, which
          aligns closely with the maximum number of distinctions our color filter could render (<ref
            target="#figure09">Figure 9</ref>).</p>
        <figure xml:id="figure09">
          <head>Our chart reference for the mv tool's color filter, annotating Laban's drawing which
            also posits twenty-seven directional rays <ptr target="#laban2011a" loc="16"/>.</head>
          <graphic url="resources/images/figure09.png"/>
        </figure>
        <p>When moving through a LBMS scale, one body part initiates and leads the movement through
          the various directional Pulls. Our recordings demonstrate these movement pathways as led
          by the right hand in a Far-Reach movement pattern for greatest visibility, but one can
          explore these sequences led from any body part (the right hip, the left big toe, the
          tongue) and at a bigger or more restrained scale. In all recordings presented in this
          article (LBMS scales and dance recreations), the color changes are dictated by the spatial
          position of the right wrist, with the color changes affecting the entire skeleton. Like
          all the filters built for the mv tool, the body part dictating the color change can be
          moved to any of the skeleton’s twenty-five recorded points.</p>
        <p>The color filters provide data on the spatial zones that are most activated by a recorded
          movement phrase, as is visible in the motion-capture data for the Axis and Girdle scales
          with added color changes (<ref target="#figure10">Figure 10</ref> and <ref
            target="#figure11">Figure 11</ref>):</p>

        </figure>
        <p>What becomes immediately apparent are the limitations of translating Laban’s theorization
          of twenty-seven Spatial Pulls into a computerized environment, as the color changes are
          not restricted simply to the six colors corresponding with the scale Spatial Pulls.
          Instead, the software recognizes any of the twenty-seven zones activated by the movement
          of the right wrist. Similarly, the starting position of Place, with the arms relaxed at
          one’s sides, renders as the color for Right-Low (a dark orange) rather than Place (grey),
          given that the wrist is below the body center. In other work, where establishing a place
          of neutrality is necessary, we adjust the starting point to have the right wrist resting
          on the sternum. This additional data, however, is valuable. In the color visualization of
          the Axis scale, we can observe the skeleton activating approximately fourteen color
          points, whereas the Girdle scale activates approximately eight. This aligns with the
          complementary pathways of the two scales; while the Girdle scale moves between spatially
          adjacent points (Peripheral pathways), the Axis scale uses Transverse pathways to slice
          obliquely through the Kinesphere to get to each subsequent Spatial Pull, activating
          additional space in the process. This contrast is visible through the addition of
          historical traceforms filter, in which the greater smoothness of the Girdle pathways is
          apparent (<ref target="#figure12">Figure 12</ref> and <ref target="#figure13">Figure
            13</ref>):</p>

        </figure>
        <p>What also becomes apparent from these visualizations is that the recommended technique
          for performing LBMS scales is ideal for a Kinect-driven motion-capture environment. While
          the torso, arms, and legs frequently need to twist and reach away from a forward facing
          position to move through the Spatial Pulls or counterbalance the movement, the pelvis
          should remain frontal and forward-facing, encouraging mobility of the spine and limbs. As
          a result, the body center is always facing forward. Some scales, like the Girdle scale,
          are more easily performed by taking a few steps, but the scales are always fairly
          spatially contained, and often result in a relatively stationary practice in which weight
          is shifted between the two feet. Finally, performing LBMS scales rarely requires the mover
          to lie prone on the ground. All three of these conditions — a consistently forward facing,
          a limited range of locomotion, and standing movement patterns — are ideal for this
          technological infrastructure. They facilitate the Kinects’ ability to maintain a
          consistent skeleton rendering, minimizing the quantity of glitching and increasing the
          accuracy of movement pathways. Determining these conditions helped in the selection
          process of our cinematic movement examples.</p>

        <head>Case study: Dance in narrative cinema</head>
        <p>This case study seeks to better understand how filmmakers use figure and camera movement
          to guide viewer attention and communicate narrative and aesthetic meaning. In selecting
          examples to analyze, our decision-making process was heavily influenced by technology and
          infrastructure. We needed to work with solo dancers, as recording multiple performers
          simultaneously is more difficult with the Kinects, especially if those performers cross
          paths or touch during the number. In order to more closely recreate the relationship
          between camera and figure, we chose to work with sequences that maintained a relatively
          consistent camera position and that included minimal editing. We also did not have a
          studio space large enough to capture more expansive dancing, or movement that travelled
          through a wider space accompanied by a follow shot.</p>
        <p>Our data capture approach differed for the LBMS material and the film material. As
          Oyallon-Koloski is certified in Laban Movement Analysis and familiar with the LBMS
          movement scales, she performed those phrases herself. The scales are theoretical movement
          exercises without an existing audiovisual referent, so no filmic comparison was necessary.
          In contrast, a recreated, close approximation of the choreographed movement from our
          filmic examples was a central component of our analytical process for studying these dance
          phrases, for which more specialized dance training and rehearsal time was necessary. As a
          result, the dance recreations were learned and performed by two Dance MFA students at the
          University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign, Catherine MacMaster and Sarah Mininsohn.
          MacMaster has technical training in ballet, contemporary, and modern dance forms, with a
          secondary focus in tap dancing, musical theater jazz, West African dance, Afro-Cuban
          Folkloric Dance, and Tango. Mininsohn has technical training in modern dance,
          improvisation, and ballet, with a choreographic focus on contemporary and improvisational
          styles.</p>
        <p>Because Oyallon-Koloski’s broader research interests focus on musical cinema, we chose to
          include one number that allowed us to study how these stylistic patterns affected the
          musical number’s relationship to the larger narrative. MacMaster and Mininsohn
          collaborated with Oyallon-Koloski in the selection of appropriate dance phrases given
          their movement backgrounds. In selecting a number from a Hollywood musical, the most
          compatible numbers all came from the 1930s, with solo tap dancing numbers emerging as the
          most logical choice. We chose to work with Fred Astaire’s soft-shoe reprise of <title
            rend="quotes">No Strings (I’m Fancy Free)</title> from <emph>Top Hat</emph> (1935), an
          iconic number that our dancers felt was compatible with their movement training. For our
          second example, we chose the final dance sequence from Claire Denis’ <emph>Beau
            travail</emph> (1999). Its construction similarly met our criteria — a single dancer
          (Denis Lavant), a restricted setting, a single camera set-up, and limited editing — but
          provided us with an example that contrasted <emph>Top Hat</emph>’s technological,
          industrial, and cultural context. Despite sharing numerous stylistic characteristics — an
          emphasis on a single performer who in both cases is white and male, a relatively static
          camera, a longer average shot rate, few overall edits, and long shot framings on the
          dancers — the choreography and overall function of each number diverge, as do their
          production histories and choreographic processes.</p>
        <p>For both sequences, the dancers’ focus was on understanding the holistic staging patterns
          of the choreography, the essential movement qualities (with the language of Effort
          qualities from LBMS guiding much of our analysis), and the narrative motivation of the
          dance. One significant revelation from this work was the unusual nature of the form of
          movement learning; despite their extensive movement training, neither had ever learned
          choreography before purely from an audiovisual artifact. Choreographic recreations
          frequently benefit from video recordings of previous performances but are led by movement
          professionals who have often performed the movement themselves and who re-learn and teach
          the choreography to the performers. Because such prior knowledge was not available to us,
          MacMaster and Mininsohn learned the choreography together, in consultation with
          Oyallon-Koloski, working from a recording of the dance sequence flipped on the horizontal
          to facilitate the process of learning the steps and pathways on the correct side. Both
          MacMaster and Mininsohn recorded multiple takes of each movement phrase, improvising or
          resetting their staging position during the moments when the performer in question (i.e.
          Fred Astaire and Denis Lavant) was not on screen. In order to allow the dancers to focus
          on different aspects of narrative, staging, and choreographic detail in each take, during
          several they performed alongside a playback of the filmic dance, while in others they
          performed alongside the audio track from the film only. The video recordings, shot on a
          Canon EOS R, approximate the camera placement but do not fully replicate the camera
          movement of the originals, as the dance recreations vary somewhat as well, and serve
          primarily as documentation of the stylistic analysis performed by our dancers.</p>

          <head><title rend="quotes">No Strings (Reprise)</title> | <emph>Top Hat</emph>
            (1935)</head>
          <p><emph>Top Hat</emph> is directed by Marc Sandrich, photographed by David Abel, and
            choreographed collaboratively by Fred Astaire and Hermes Pan. It was the first film for
            which Pan served as dance director <ptr target="#franceschina2012" loc="60"/>. Pan, not
            Sandrich, likely worked with Abel on the camerawork for the dance numbers and had
            decision-making power over the integration of the figure movement into the cinematic
            space. Constantine, a writer for <emph>Dance Magazine</emph> who interviewed Pan in
            1945, suggests that the dance director’s job is to <title rend="quotes">focus the camera
              on the most important part of the choreography and swing the camera in rhythm with the
              dancers</title>
            <ptr target="#franceschina2012" loc="60"/>. Patrick Keating discusses this relationship
            with more detail in his discussion of the <title rend="quotes">No Strings (I’m Fancy
              Free)</title> number, in which <quote rend="inline">the camerawork remains completely
              subordinate to Jerry’s [Astaire’s] movements. When Jerry dances behind some chairs,
              the camera dollies in to follow; when Jerry spins to the right, a pan keeps him in
              frame</quote>
            <ptr target="#keating2019" loc="85"/>. Astaire had a reputation for remaining closely
            involved in all the stylistic elements of his dances and for wanting the camera to be an
            "involved but unobtrusive spectator" <ptr target="#mueller1985" loc="26"/>, a
            "subservient" form of camerawork that was nonetheless the result of a complex
            choreographic process <ptr target="#keating2019" loc="85"/>.</p>
          <p>This reprise occurs very soon in the plot after Jerry Mulligan’s (Astaire) "No Strings
            (I’m Fancy Free)," in which his enthusiastic tap dancing awakens and irritates Gale
            Tremont (Ginger Rogers). Immediately smitten with Gale, he performs a soft-shoe
            "sand-man" version of the number to help lull her back to sleep, as Edward Everett
            Horton’s character (Horace Hardwick) observes him. Jerry’s motivation, therefore, is to
            perform a soothing number that stylistically contrasts its bombastic predecessor, but
            his movement quality is also the result of his newly discovered feelings for Gale. In
            preparing the recreation, we focused on the sense of lift in Astaire’s physicality
            (Light Weight), particularly in the upper body, paired with a core stability evoking his
            ballroom training that results in him skimming the surface of the floor. MacMaster and
            Mininsohn also embody the deliberate weight shifting steps coming from a tap dance
            vocabulary that move him through both swooping lateral staging changes and circular
            pathways. In our recreations, MacMaster performed in tap shoes and emphasized the formal
            steps in her learning process given that she has tap dance training; Mininsohn, drawing
            on her improvisation training, performed barefoot and prioritized the movement qualities
            and their relationship to narrative motivations (<ref target="#figure14">Figure

          </figure>
          <p>The choreography for this number involves numerous turns and pivots that move the
            figure away from a frontal facing and an ending weight shift into a chair which, as
            discussed above, our dancers performed into the ground. Both proved difficult for the
            Kinect to render properly; the latter results in some glitching rather than a clean line
            of the body, and the rotations are more difficult to perceive in the abstracted space.
            This points to the Kinect’s design for home gaming use, which is adapted for standing
            (or sitting), front-facing postures without much simultaneous movement of the limbs
            across the midline. However, adding the historical traceforms to Mininsohn’s recorded
            skeleton allows us to perceive the graceful pathways of Astaire’s movement, the Free
            Flowing movement that skims the surface, and the choreographic emphasis on repeated
            pathways and continuous motion (<ref target="#figure18">Figure 18</ref>).</p>
          <figure xml:id="figure18">

          </figure>
          <p>We also learn from a closer analysis of the "No Strings (Reprise)" number that one of
            the camera movements during the dancing is the result of Horton’s, as well as Astaire’s,
            movement. Jerry’s dancing in the beginning of the number moves him repeatedly through
            the horizontal space of the frame, but it isn’t until Horace walks rightward towards the
            couch as Jerry also slides right in front of him that the camera pans slightly right to
            follow, ensuring that Horace remains fully visible as he sits on the couch. The camera
            remains static until the end of the dance, even though Astaire’s leftward pivot turns in
            the middle of the dance briefly cause his arms to go out of frame. By adding our mobile
            frame filter to keep the skeleton centered in the frame, we can visualize what Astaire’s
            phrase would have looked like had the camera followed all of his lateral shifts; here
            the body element maintained in the center of the frame is the skeleton’s pelvis (<ref
              target="#figure19">Figure 19</ref>).</p>
          <figure xml:id="figure19">
            <head>Visualization of "No Strings (Reprise)" with mobile framing, performed by Sarah

            <media mimeType="video/mp4" url="https://player.vimeo.com/video/375299168/"/>
          </figure>
          <p>This goes against the logical assumption that the dancers on-screen would dictate
            figure-motivated camera movement, as both Constantine and Keating articulate. Yet such a
            choice on Pan and Abel’s part does not necessarily contradict this rationale. The lack
            of reframing to the left ensures that Horace remains visible on the right and reinforces
            that the number is serving a crucial narrative purpose, one that is guiding the
            filmmakers’ stylistic decisions as much as the impulse to clearly capture Astaire’s
            artistry on-screen. Having Jerry perform the number is not only for the sake of
            aesthetic excess (as a demonstration of Astaire’s physical prowess) but also to make
            amends for disturbing Gale. In the process of the number, Horace also watches the
            soothing dancing and is lulled to sleep before Jerry succumbs to sleep himself. Keeping
            Horace in frame during the dancing allows us to see that he is watching Jerry dance, and
            a later cut to a closer framing of him looking tired cues us to watch the background as
            Jerry continues to dance, where we can observe Horace put his head down on the couch.
            Even in the earlier "No Strings" number, the choreographic and cinematographic decisions
            are made to either keep Astaire dancing close enough to Horton so that the latter
            remains in frame or have Astaire’s dancing carry him far enough through lateral space
            that Horton does not awkwardly reappear at unexpected moments in the background.
            Ultimately, the camera helps to emphasize the most important function of the
            choreography: narrative comprehension. Recreating and manipulating the movement for the
            purposes of formal analysis enhances our, and hopefully the reader’s, ability to observe
            these choreographic and cinematic patterns.</p>

        <div>
          <head>Galoup’s final dance sequence | <emph>Beau travail</emph> (1999)</head>
          <p><emph>Beau travail</emph>, loosely adapted from Herman Melville’s <emph>Billy
              Budd</emph>, is directed by Claire Denis and photographed by Denis’ long-time
            collaborator Agnès Godard. The film’s narrative portrays much choreographed movement in
            its focus on French Foreign Legion soldiers stationed in Djibouti, and choreographer
            Bernardo Montet’s creative contributions were essential to the film’s preproduction
            design <ptr target="#mayne2005" loc="93"/>. <emph>Beau travail</emph> includes several
            dance scenes between local Djibouti women and the Legionnaires but also emphasizes
            performances of military and domestic exercises, blurring the line between dance,
            military calisthenics, and pedestrian movement. The film relies little on dialogue or
            explicit narration, forcing the viewer to read the implicit meaning of the figure
            movement; Judith Mayne describes the film as a "kind of choreographed ritual" <ptr
              target="#mayne2005" loc="93"/>. The protagonist Galoup’s final solo dance occurs after
            the character’s presumed suicide, which allows the viewer to read the motivation of that
            final dance in numerous ways: as a frenetic but ultimately futile attempt at escape <ptr
              target="#mayne2005" loc="101"/>, as an example of the post-colonial body <ptr
              target="#hayward2002"/>, as a marker of queer displacement <ptr target="#sosa2011"/>.
            Denis viewed the scene as an attempt at freedom; while initially planning to include the
            number before the suicide, she changed the plot order to "give the sense that Galoup
            could escape himself" but also because after filming the number she realized it was the
            stronger ending <ptr target="#darke2000" loc="18"/>. Our close analysis through
            recreation of the film’s final dance scene is equally revelatory in its emphasis on the
            explicit diegetic details present and the craft mechanics of the scene.</p>
          <p>Montet was closely involved with <emph>Beau travail</emph>’s narrative development in
            preproduction, but his influence on Galoup’s final dance sequence, performed by Denis
            Lavant, is unclear. Denis recalls the number’s process in an interview with <emph>Senses
              of Cinema</emph>:</p>
          <p>But we never rehearsed the dance scene at the end of <emph>Beau Travail</emph>. I told
            him [Denis Lavant] it’s the dance between life and death. It was written like that in
            the script, and he said, 'What do you mean by "the dance between life and death"?’ So, I
            let him hear that great disco music [<emph>laughs</emph>], and he said, 'This is it.’
            So, we didn’t need to rehearse. . . . He said, 'You don’t want us to fix some of it?’ I
            thought it was better to keep the energy inside, because if we started fixing some stuff
            then we would have made many takes. And we made one take. But he was exhausted at the
            end" <ptr target="#hughes2009"/>.</p>
          <p>Lavant already had extensive movement training at the time of filming, with a
            background in circus and pantomime, so it is plausible that he created the number
            without Montet’s assistance. Denis’ comment about a lack of rehearsal and a single take
            seems suspect but indicates that an improvised approach to avoid an over-rehearsed look
            was key to the process. Most accounts of this number describe the dancing as frenetic,
            but upon closer analysis we can observe that Lavant’s movement is in fact quite
            graceful, with increasingly controlled and complex movements originating from the body
            center (the result of core stability and alternating Bound and Free Flow) and
            reverberating into the limbs. Like Astaire’s movement, much of Lavant’s movement
            patterns are driven by an upward impulse and a feeling of lift, but with a greater
            sensation of strength (Strong Weight) in contrast to Astaire’s lightness. Unlike the
            fluidity and ongoing nature of the "No Strings" number, Lavant frequently starts and
            stops. The spatial relationship of camera and figure also creates an off-kilter feeling.
            Rather than film Lavant straight-on, the camera remains to his left (likely to avoid
            revealing the camera in the mirrored wall). His gaze and facing frequently focuses
            leftward as well, as if he is intrigued by something off-screen left that the viewer
            cannot see. In recreating this number, MacMaster and Mininsohn focused on this sense of
            increasing and halting range of motion, as if in the afterlife Galoup is discovering an
            ability to fully express himself for the first time. They embodied the specific pathways
            and gestures Galoup employs in the first half of the number (including his smoking) but
            chose to improvise the more expansive movement of the second half (<ref

          </figure>
          <p>Denis’ film does not fall within the confines of the musical genre. But the space of
            Galoup’s final dance feels more liminal or beyond the limits of the established diegesis
            the way many musical sequences would, an impression that comes from the disparate
            stylistic choices of staging, choreography, cinematography, and sound. Unlike the
            earlier club scenes, where we hear French Creole and Turkish popular music, Galoup here
            performs to Corona’s Eurodance hit, "Rhythm of the Night." Previously we see
            Legionnaires and local Djibouti women dancing, but now Galoup is alone (with his mirror
            self). As the narrative progresses, the camera allows us to see more of the movement by
            adopting more distant framings. The early disco scene is shot at close proximity,
            allowing us to see the men and women dancing together in medium close-ups. The second
            disco scene in which the women dance as Galoup watches shows them in a medium long shot.
            It is only during Galoup’s final number where we see him dance in a full long shot, and
            even then we frequently lose his extremities as they extend beyond the edges of the
            frame. Adding historical traceforms allows us to perceive the increasing expansiveness
            of Galoup’s movement and release, especially after his leap to the ground (2:08 in <ref
              target="#figure24">Figure 24</ref>'s video).</p>

          <p>Godard’s camera in <emph>Beau travail</emph>’s final number never dollies through the
            space, but she frequently pans and tilts to holistically follow Lavant’s movement
            through the small space of the disco. A visualization of the movement with the addition
            of a parallel mobile camera (that reframes along the horizontal, sagittal, and vertical
            planes) takes this follow aesthetic to the extreme (<ref target="#figure25">Figure
              25</ref>).</p>

          </figure>
          <p>A perfectly aligned, parallel camera removes the feeling of spontaneity from the
            number. While Godard’s cinematography calmly and subtly reframes as Lavant moves through
            the space, parts of Lavant’s body occasionally move out of frame, specifically his head
            during sudden leaps, imbuing him with a sense of freedom and release. If Lavant were
            always centered, the expansiveness of his movements would potentially be diminished by
            the parallel movements of the camera, especially as the number progresses. In seeing a
            perfectly centered version of the dance, we also are reminded that Lavant is not truly
            alone in the number, as Godard keeps his mirrored image in frame throughout, balancing
            the space between Lavant and his reflection. Like "No Strings (Reprise)," Galoup’s final
            solo number results in a composition that reminds the viewer of the importance of both
            figures through deliberate choreography and mobile framing.</p>

      <div>
        <head>In conclusion: What movement should the camera follow?</head>
        <p>The mobile framing in these dance sequences from <emph>Top Hat</emph> and <emph>Beau
            travail</emph> are motivated by figure movement. For Keating, mastery of the follow shot
          requires <quote rend="inline">timing the camera’s movement to coincide with a
            character’s,</quote> and he summarizes the spectrum of follow shot aesthetics as
          residing between <soCalled>invisible</soCalled> and flamboyant impulses [<ref
            target="#keating2019">2019, 75</ref>]. Our ability with the mv tool to manipulate the
          figure’s relationship to the mobile frame raises the question, which part of a character’s
          movement should the camera follow? In many instances of cinematic staging, in which the
          camera follows a character who is walking with an erect posture, this question may serve
          little purpose. However, both Astaire and Lavant expand and contract their Kinespheres by
          moving their limbs towards and away from their body center, and their choreography pulls
          them off-vertical into diagonal pathways. The visualizations of mobile framing above, in
          which the pelvis’ position guides the parallel mobile frame, gives an approximation of
          what a holistic follow shot would look like, if the cameraperson was obsessively
          accounting for every tiny shift of the body. An examination of the end of Astaire’s solo
          emphasizes the importance of the cinematography in creating an unobtrusive sightline for
          the viewer through the cinematic space. The camera dollies to follow Astaire as he
          drowsily dances towards the armchair, yet it does not also retreat in parallel as
          Astaire’s spins briefly move him back towards the right. Instead, the follow shot creates
          a smooth pathway to end the number with Astaire centered, his straight body line on the
          diagonal of the frame.</p>
        <p>With the mv tool’s mobile camera filter and the practice-based impulses of performative
          research, we can hypothesize what a more flamboyant approach to the follow shot would look
          like in these films. If the camera focuses on following the right wrist instead of the
          body center, for example, the mobile framing becomes significantly more obtrusive. Readers
          who are easily nauseated may choose to skip these visualizations, a warning that on its
          own can explain why filmmakers have not traditionally chosen this cinematographic approach
            (<ref target="#figure26">Figure 26</ref> and <ref target="#figure27">Figure
          27</ref>).</p>

        <p>Using digital resources like the mv tool and a performative methodology for stylistic
          analysis allows us to explore innovative and experimental research questions. The
          discovery that <title rend="quotes">No Strings (Reprise)</title> includes a follow shot
          motivated by a secondary character points to new lines of inquiry. How common is this
          occurrence, in Astaire numbers and musical cinema more broadly? With more data, could we
          articulate a correlation between a norm of camera movement motivated by secondary
          (non-dancing) characters and an emphasis on drawing viewer attention to narrative details?
          The flamboyant and extreme camera movements that we can record with the mv tool may not be
          accessible to filmmakers working in live-action environments due to the limits of camera
          technology. Yet the ability to change the relationship of the figure to frame initiates
          questions about how subtle changes to cinematic staging affects a viewer’s perception of
          the figure movement and can lead us to better understand why filmmakers make the choices
          they do. For aspiring filmmakers and cinematic choreographers, being able to play in such
          an environment can empower them to find creative and experimental solutions to the
          problems inherent in translating an idea to the screen. Performatively engaging with these
          digital tools provides material insight into audiovisual objects and fosters creative
          discovery.</p>
