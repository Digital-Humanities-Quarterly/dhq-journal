                  <p>In this paper, we argue for the value of motion capture-driven research that moves
                     audiovisual analysis in a performative direction to integrate the dancer/researcher
                     into
                     the cinematic space. Like the work of videographic practitioners who communicate their
                     findings through the audiovisual medium, rather than the written medium, this work
                     seeks
                     to engage with what Catherine Grant and Brad Haseman have called performative research
                     by
                     applying a practice-led approach to moving image analysis. Through a physical and
                     virtual
                     embodiment of film and dance form, we seek to better understand the formal implications
                     of
                     dance’s integration into cinematic space and the material conditions that affected
                     filmmakers’ narrative and stylistic choices. The Movement Visualization Tool (mv tool)
                     is
                     a virtual research environment that generates live feedback of multiple agents’ movement.
                     Accessible motion capture technology renders an abstracted skeleton of the moving
                     agents,
                     providing information about movement pathways through space using color-based and
                     historical traceform filters. The tool can also replicate a mobile frame aesthetic,
                     allowing for a constructed mover and a virtually constructed camera to engage in
                     performative dialogue. We use the mv tool and videographic methods to recreate and
                     disseminate two cases: movement scales from Laban/Bartenieff Movement Studies and
                     dance
                     sequences from narrative cinema. Rather than working from existing audiovisual content,
                     we
                     posit that the act of recreating the movement phrases leads to a deeper understanding
                     of
                     the choreography and, in the case of the filmic examples, of the formal practices
                     that led
                     to their creation.

                  <div class="ptext" id="p1">The human body is a staggeringly intricate instrument. Filmmakers have developed
                     meaningful, complex ways of staging figure movement on screen for storytelling purposes,
                     both aided and impeded by the industrial, technological, and cultural changes that
                     affect
                     the conventions of film form. Despite significant developments in the digital humanities,
                     the infinite variability and historical specificity of the body and cinematic space
                     defy
                     any single tool or method’s attempts to offer an automated, comprehensive categorization
                     of figure movement in film. Much of the work in the field prioritizes quantitative
                     and
                     qualitative methods for observing and communicating research findings. What knowledge
                     could we gain by integrating the researcher into a cinematic space, using digital
                     tools to
                     recreate the craft of dance and film form?

                     feedback of multiple agents’ movement, makes these lines of inquiry possible. Inexpensive,
                     lightweight motion capture technology renders an abstracted skeleton of the moving
                     agent,
                     providing information about movement patterns and pathways through space using color-based
                     and historical traceform filters. The tool also allows a virtually constructed mover
                     and
                     camera to interact through manual or algorithmic manipulation, replicating a mobile
                     frame
                     effect to study patterns of camera and figure movement. Researching in such a space
                     is
                     therefore inherently hands-on, interactive, and driven by the creation of new audiovisual
                     content. Like the work of videographic practitioners who study and communicate their
                     findings through the audiovisual medium, rather than in written form, this work applies
                     performative research methods [<a class="ref" href="#haseman2006">Haseman, 2006</a>]
                     [<a class="ref" href="#grant2016">Grant, 2016</a>] to a study of movement on screen. We posit that through a
                     practice-led embodiment of film and dance form we can better understand the formal
                     implications of dance’s integration into cinematic space and the material conditions
                     that
                     affected filmmakers’ narrative and stylistic choices. By visualizing movement patterns
                     with the mv tool and disseminating that video data as an essential part of our research
                     output, we hope to offer alternative modes of scholarly dissemination that enriches
                     humanistic observation of cinematic movement.

                  <div class="ptext" id="p3">Two audiovisual case studies allow us to test the methodological value of this approach
                     and deepen our understanding of moving image form. The first explores patterns from
                     Laban/Bartenieff Movement Studies (subsequently LBMS) to observe the compatibility
                     of this
                     system’s expansive taxonomy of human movement with computerized analytical methods.
                     By
                     recording and manipulating LBMS’ Axis and Girdle movement scales, we can better perceive
                     how those forms are rendered in a cinematic, rather than live, space. The second builds
                     on
                     this foundation and involves the recreation of dance sequences from two films, <em class="emph">Top
                        Hat</em> (1935, Marc Sandrich) and <em class="emph">Beau travail</em> (1999, Claire Denis). By
                     isolating the body and camera from their cinematic surroundings, we can recreate core
                     staging and figure movement elements and can generate alternative camera and figure
                     relationships. The result is a better understanding of these film sequences’ functions
                     and
                     the motivations that drove the filmmakers’ choices. A performative method combined
                     with
                     digital capture tools sharpens formal analysis, when studying figure movement on screen
                     in
                     particular. This approach enhances our ability to rigorously articulate the complexities
                     of the human body in motion and deepens our understanding of cinematic production
                     histories.

                     Catherine Grant draws upon Brad Haseman in describing performative research as an
                     approach
                     in which symbolic data and material forms of practice "work as utterances that accomplish,
                     by their very enunciation, an action that generates effects" [<a class="ref" href="#haseman2006">Haseman, 2006</a>, 102]
                     [<a class="ref" href="#grant2016">Grant, 2016</a>, 14]. Practice is thus a critical aspect of performative
                     research with the performative act serving as the data.

                     <div class="ptext" id="p7">Our research method perceives the object of study as one in motion as well as in
                        stasis, engaging with what Henri Bergson has called an "intuitive" knowledge of movement
                        [<a class="ref" href="#bergson2007">Bergson, 2007</a>] to better understand choreographic patterns and the
                        myriad choices filmmakers make in staging the body for the camera. Carol-Lynne Moore
                        sees close ties between Bergson’s categorizations of intellectual and intuitive
                        perception and Rudolf Laban’s theories of Space from LBMS, which describes where the
                        body moves in its environment. Whereas intellectual knowledge perceives movement as
                        snapshots in time, an intuitive understanding perceives movement as a "flowing
                        continuity fluctuating endlessly" [<a class="ref" href="#moore2009">Moore, 2009</a>, 84]. This approach to
                        perception has phenomenological implications as well. Our ability to study past
                        traceforms of movement through the mv tool’s historical traceform filter evokes the
                        sort
                        of "thickness" that Maurice Merleau-Ponty theorizes in his evocation of the accumulation
                        of perceptual content [<a class="ref" href="#merleau2002">Merleau-Ponty, 2002</a>, 321]. Embodying the movement is
                        a key part of our analytical process; the videographic content presented in this article
                        serves both as a record of the movement recreations and as a component of the research
                        output.

                        videographic criticism, which allows practitioners to "enter into" their object of

                        [<a class="ref" href="#bergson2007">Bergson, 2007</a>, 130], in this case an audiovisual or filmic form. As
                        Grant elaborates, in videographic criticism the researcher engages with the logic
                        of the
                        medium on its own terms in a way that encourages experimentation and play [<a class="ref" href="#grant2016">Grant, 2016</a>]. Jason Mittell similarly points to the transformative value of
                        entering moving images through nonlinear editing, arguing, "Even if you don’t make
                        something new with the sounds and images imported into the editing platform, you can
                        still discover something new by exploring a film via this new interface" [<a class="ref" href="#mittell2019">Mittell, 2019</a>, 226]. Rather than working from existing audiovisual
                        content, we posit that the act of recreating the movement phrases leads to a deeper
                        understanding of movement patterns and, in the case of the filmic examples, of the
                        formal practices that led to their creation.

                        as a part of such an approach. All creative practices are affected by constraints
                        or
                        obstacles of various kinds at both the macro and micro level of production: a director
                        makes storytelling and aesthetic choices based on the budget available to them; a
                        cinematographer chooses how to place and move the camera based on available technology;
                        a choreographer can only work in a particular dance style (jazz, for example) if the
                        surrounding cultural conditions have encouraged professional dancers to also train
                        in
                        that form. Filmmakers are constantly using craft practices, existing models and
                        experience, and trial and error to guide their decision-making. As a result, stylistic
                        history can benefit from what David Bordwell calls a problem-solution model of
                        understanding the choices filmmakers make by envisioning stylistic history as a "network
                        of problems and solutions" [<a class="ref" href="#bordwell1997">Bordwell, 1997</a>, 149].

                        encourages the analyst to engage with a similar level of material specificity. Indeed,
                        as Bordwell argues, adopting a problem-solution model to understanding film history
                        has
                        recreation of practical details as an inherent aspect of its approach; the task "is
                        one
                        of reconstruction. On the basis of surviving films and other documents, the historian
                        reconstructs a choice situation" [<a class="ref" href="#bordwell1997">Bordwell, 1997</a>, 156]. Through a
                        performative approach, the act is one of recreation rather than reconstruction. By
                        directly engaging with the process, we end up with a tangible creation, informed by
                        careful study of the original, that was subject to its own series of problems and
                        solutions. The video and motion-capture recreations of LBMS scales and dance numbers
                        published here, in turn, communicate research findings that complement our written
                        analysis of those same movement examples. For example, in "No Strings (Reprise)" from
                        <em class="emph">Top Hat</em> there is a movement where Fred Astaire shifts his weight into a
                        chair and ostensibly falls asleep. In practicing the sequence for recreation with
                        our
                        dancers, we discovered that using a chair for the ending led to a more constrained
                        and
                        cautious movement quality, due to the light chair creating an unstable situation as
                        the
                        movers shifted weight onto it. Choreographing a graceful final posture for Astaire’s
                        number resulted in a series of choices, perhaps an adjustment to the choreography,
                        a
                        change of furniture so that a lower armchair would permit Astaire to better
                        counterbalance into it, or the addition of the carpet which mitigates most of the
                        instability. We similarly needed to find solutions to the problem, but in our case,
                        different furniture or securing the chair to the floor was not an option (i.e. the
                        obvious solution of nailing the chair in place would certainly have infuriated the
                        building owner and prevented our ability to continue working in the studio). Since
                        our
                        greatest priority was maintaining the spinning choreography, the feeling of lightness,
                        and the increasing drowsiness of Astaire’s character, we chose to have the dancers
                        shift
                        into a final resting pose on the floor instead, which allowed us to more effectively
                        maintain the movement qualities and the long line of the body seen in the final
                        pose.

                     pulls combining in both unequal and equal combinations. Twelve rays form the basis
                     for
                     planar movement; the three planes — horizontal, vertical, and sagittal — each contains
                     four Spatial Pulls. Laban theorized movement between those twelve rays as existing
                     in an
                     icosahedral space. Combining all three Dimensional Pulls equally leads to highly mobile
                     movement, which Laban saw as moving between the endpoints and diagonals of a cube:
                     Right-Forward-High, Left-Back-Low, Left-Forward-High, Right-Back-Low, Left-Back-High,
                     Right-Forward-Low, Right-Back-High, Left-Forward-Low. To these twenty-six rays or
                     Spatial
                     Pulls we add Place, Laban’s articulation of a relatively neutral starting and ending

                     side

                     six points, none of which are repeated in the other scale’s movement. As a result,
                     the two

                  <div class="ptext" id="p38">What becomes immediately apparent are the limitations of translating Laban’s theorization
                     of twenty-seven Spatial Pulls into a computerized environment, as the color changes
                     are
                     not restricted simply to the six colors corresponding with the scale Spatial Pulls.
                     Instead, the software recognizes any of the twenty-seven zones activated by the movement
                     of the right wrist. Similarly, the starting position of Place, with the arms relaxed
                     at
                     one’s sides, renders as the color for Right-Low (a dark orange) rather than Place
                     (grey),
                     given that the wrist is below the body center. In other work, where establishing a
                     place
                     of neutrality is necessary, we adjust the starting point to have the right wrist resting
                     on the sternum. This additional data, however, is valuable. In the color visualization
                     of
                     the Axis scale, we can observe the skeleton activating approximately fourteen color
                     points, whereas the Girdle scale activates approximately eight. This aligns with the
                     complementary pathways of the two scales; while the Girdle scale moves between spatially
                     adjacent points (Peripheral pathways), the Axis scale uses Transverse pathways to
                     slice
                     obliquely through the Kinesphere to get to each subsequent Spatial Pull, activating
                     additional space in the process. This contrast is visible through the addition of
                     historical traceforms filter, in which the greater smoothness of the Girdle pathways
                     is

                     for performing LBMS scales is ideal for a Kinect-driven motion-capture environment.
                     While
                     the torso, arms, and legs frequently need to twist and reach away from a forward facing
                     position to move through the Spatial Pulls or counterbalance the movement, the pelvis
                     should remain frontal and forward-facing, encouraging mobility of the spine and limbs.
                     As
                     a result, the body center is always facing forward. Some scales, like the Girdle scale,
                     are more easily performed by taking a few steps, but the scales are always fairly
                     spatially contained, and often result in a relatively stationary practice in which
                     weight
                     is shifted between the two feet. Finally, performing LBMS scales rarely requires the
                     mover
                     to lie prone on the ground. All three of these conditions — a consistently forward
                     facing,
                     a limited range of locomotion, and standing movement patterns — are ideal for this
                     technological infrastructure. They facilitate the Kinects’ ability to maintain a
                     consistent skeleton rendering, minimizing the quantity of glitching and increasing
                     the
                     accuracy of movement pathways. Determining these conditions helped in the selection
                     process of our cinematic movement examples.

                     to guide viewer attention and communicate narrative and aesthetic meaning. In selecting
                     examples to analyze, our decision-making process was heavily influenced by technology
                     and
                     infrastructure. We needed to work with solo dancers, as recording multiple performers
                     simultaneously is more difficult with the Kinects, especially if those performers
                     cross
                     paths or touch during the number. In order to more closely recreate the relationship
                     between camera and figure, we chose to work with sequences that maintained a relatively
                     consistent camera position and that included minimal editing. We also did not have
                     a
                     studio space large enough to capture more expansive dancing, or movement that travelled
                     through a wider space accompanied by a follow shot.

                  <div class="ptext" id="p41">Our data capture approach differed for the LBMS material and the film material. As
                     Oyallon-Koloski is certified in Laban Movement Analysis and familiar with the LBMS
                     movement scales, she performed those phrases herself. The scales are theoretical movement
                     exercises without an existing audiovisual referent, so no filmic comparison was necessary.
                     In contrast, a recreated, close approximation of the choreographed movement from our
                     filmic examples was a central component of our analytical process for studying these
                     dance
                     phrases, for which more specialized dance training and rehearsal time was necessary.
                     As a
                     result, the dance recreations were learned and performed by two Dance MFA students
                     at the
                     University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign, Catherine MacMaster and Sarah
                     Mininsohn.<a class="noteRef" href="#d4e783">[3]</a> MacMaster has technical training in ballet,
                     contemporary, and modern dance forms, with a secondary focus in tap dancing, musical
                     theater jazz, West African dance, Afro-Cuban Folkloric Dance, and Tango. Mininsohn
                     has
                     technical training in modern dance, improvisation, and ballet, with a choreographic

                  <div class="ptext" id="p42">Because Oyallon-Koloski’s broader research interests focus on musical cinema, we chose
                     to
                     include one number that allowed us to study how these stylistic patterns affected
                     the
                     musical number’s relationship to the larger narrative. MacMaster and Mininsohn
                     collaborated with Oyallon-Koloski in the selection of appropriate dance phrases given
                     their movement backgrounds. In selecting a number from a Hollywood musical, the most
                     compatible numbers all came from the 1930s, with solo tap dancing numbers emerging
                     as the
                     most logical choice. We chose to work with Fred Astaire’s soft-shoe reprise of “No Strings (I’m Fancy Free)” from <em class="emph">Top Hat</em> (1935), an
                     iconic number that our dancers felt was compatible with their movement training. For
                     our
                     second example, we chose the final dance sequence from Claire Denis’ <em class="emph">Beau
                        travail</em> (1999). Its construction similarly met our criteria — a single dancer
                     (Denis Lavant), a restricted setting, a single camera set-up, and limited editing
                     — but
                     provided us with an example that contrasted <em class="emph">Top Hat</em>’s technological,
                     industrial, and cultural context. Despite sharing numerous stylistic characteristics
                     — an
                     emphasis on a single performer who in both cases is white and male, a relatively static
                     camera, a longer average shot rate, few overall edits, and long shot framings on the
                     dancers — the choreography and overall function of each number diverge, as do their
                     production histories and choreographic processes.

                  <div class="ptext" id="p43">For both sequences, the dancers’ focus was on understanding the holistic staging patterns
                     of the choreography, the essential movement qualities (with the language of Effort
                     qualities from LBMS guiding much of our analysis), and the narrative motivation of
                     the
                     dance. One significant revelation from this work was the unusual nature of the form
                     of
                     movement learning; despite their extensive movement training, neither had ever learned
                     choreography before purely from an audiovisual artifact. Choreographic recreations
                     frequently benefit from video recordings of previous performances but are led by movement
                     professionals who have often performed the movement themselves and who re-learn and
                     teach
                     the choreography to the performers. Because such prior knowledge was not available
                     to us,
                     MacMaster and Mininsohn learned the choreography together, in consultation with
                     Oyallon-Koloski, working from a recording of the dance sequence flipped on the horizontal
                     to facilitate the process of learning the steps and pathways on the correct side.
                     Both
                     MacMaster and Mininsohn recorded multiple takes of each movement phrase, improvising
                     or
                     resetting their staging position during the moments when the performer in question
                     (i.e.
                     Fred Astaire and Denis Lavant) was not on screen. In order to allow the dancers to
                     focus
                     on different aspects of narrative, staging, and choreographic detail in each take,
                     during
                     several they performed alongside a playback of the filmic dance, while in others they
                     performed alongside the audio track from the film only. The video recordings, shot
                     on a
                     Canon EOS R, approximate the camera placement but do not fully replicate the camera
                     movement of the originals, as the dance recreations vary somewhat as well, and serve
                     primarily as documentation of the stylistic analysis performed by our dancers.

                        choreographed collaboratively by Fred Astaire and Hermes Pan. It was the first film
                        for
                        which Pan served as dance director [<a class="ref" href="#franceschina2012">Franceschina, 2012</a>, 60]. Pan, not
                        Sandrich, likely worked with Abel on the camerawork for the dance numbers and had
                        decision-making power over the integration of the figure movement into the cinematic
                        space. Constantine, a writer for <em class="emph">Dance Magazine</em> who interviewed Pan in
                        1945, suggests that the dance director’s job is to "focus the camera on the most
                        important part of the choreography and swing the camera in rhythm with the dancers"
                        [<a class="ref" href="#franceschina2012">Franceschina, 2012</a>, 60]. Patrick Keating discusses this relationship
                        with more detail in his discussion of the "No Strings (I’m Fancy Free)" number, in
                        which
                        "the camerawork remains completely subordinate to Jerry’s [Astaire’s] movements. When
                        Jerry dances behind some chairs, the camera dollies in to follow; when Jerry spins
                        to
                        the right, a pan keeps him in frame" [<a class="ref" href="#keating2019">Keating, 2019</a>, 85]. Astaire had
                        a reputation for remaining closely involved in all the stylistic elements of his dances
                        and for wanting the camera to be an "involved but unobtrusive spectator" [<a class="ref" href="#mueller1985">Mueller, 1985</a>, 26], a "subservient" form of camerawork that was
                        nonetheless the result of a complex choreographic process [<a class="ref" href="#keating2019">Keating, 2019</a>, 85].

                     <div class="ptext" id="p45">This reprise occurs very soon in the plot after Jerry Mulligan’s (Astaire) "No Strings
                        (I’m Fancy Free)," in which his enthusiastic tap dancing awakens and irritates Gale
                        Tremont (Ginger Rogers). Immediately smitten with Gale, he performs a soft-shoe
                        "sand-man" version of the number to help lull her back to sleep, as Edward Everett
                        Horton’s character (Horace Hardwick) observes him. Jerry’s motivation, therefore,
                        is to
                        perform a soothing number that stylistically contrasts its bombastic predecessor,
                        but
                        his movement quality is also the result of his newly discovered feelings for Gale.
                        In
                        preparing the recreation, we focused on the sense of lift in Astaire’s physicality
                        (Light Weight), particularly in the upper body, paired with a core stability evoking
                        his
                        ballroom training that results in him skimming the surface of the floor. MacMaster
                        and
                        Mininsohn also embody the deliberate weight shifting steps coming from a tap dance
                        vocabulary that move him through both swooping lateral staging changes and circular
                        pathways. In our recreations, MacMaster performed in tap shoes and emphasized the
                        formal
                        steps in her learning process given that she has tap dance training; Mininsohn, drawing
                        on her improvisation training, performed barefoot and prioritized the movement qualities
                        and their relationship to narrative motivations (<a href="#figure14">Figure

                        figure away from a frontal facing and an ending weight shift into a chair which, as
                        discussed above, our dancers performed into the ground. Both proved difficult for
                        the
                        Kinect to render properly; the latter results in some glitching rather than a clean
                        line
                        of the body, and the rotations are more difficult to perceive in the abstracted space.
                        This points to the Kinect’s design for home gaming use, which is adapted for standing
                        (or sitting), front-facing postures without much simultaneous movement of the limbs
                        across the midline. However, adding the historical traceforms to Mininsohn’s recorded
                        skeleton allows us to perceive the graceful pathways of Astaire’s movement, the Free
                        Flowing movement that skims the surface, and the choreographic emphasis on repeated
                        pathways and continuous motion (<a href="#figure18">Figure 18</a>).

                        of
                        the camera movements during the dancing is the result of Horton’s, as well as Astaire’s,
                        movement. Jerry’s dancing in the beginning of the number moves him repeatedly through
                        the horizontal space of the frame, but it isn’t until Horace walks rightward towards
                        the
                        couch as Jerry also slides right in front of him that the camera pans slightly right
                        to
                        follow, ensuring that Horace remains fully visible as he sits on the couch. The camera
                        remains static until the end of the dance, even though Astaire’s leftward pivot turns
                        in
                        the middle of the dance briefly cause his arms to go out of frame. By adding our mobile
                        frame filter to keep the skeleton centered in the frame, we can visualize what Astaire’s
                        phrase would have looked like had the camera followed all of his lateral shifts; here
                        the body element maintained in the center of the frame is the skeleton’s pelvis (<a href="#figure19">Figure 19</a>).

                     <div class="ptext" id="p48">This goes against the logical assumption that the dancers on-screen would dictate
                        figure-motivated camera movement, as both Constantine and Keating articulate. Yet
                        such a
                        choice on Pan and Abel’s part does not necessarily contradict this rationale. The
                        lack
                        of reframing to the left ensures that Horace remains visible on the right and reinforces
                        that the number is serving a crucial narrative purpose, one that is guiding the
                        filmmakers’ stylistic decisions as much as the impulse to clearly capture Astaire’s
                        artistry on-screen. Having Jerry perform the number is not only for the sake of
                        aesthetic excess (as a demonstration of Astaire’s physical prowess) but also to make
                        amends for disturbing Gale. In the process of the number, Horace also watches the
                        soothing dancing and is lulled to sleep before Jerry succumbs to sleep himself. Keeping
                        Horace in frame during the dancing allows us to see that he is watching Jerry dance,
                        and
                        a later cut to a closer framing of him looking tired cues us to watch the background
                        as
                        Jerry continues to dance, where we can observe Horace put his head down on the couch.
                        Even in the earlier "No Strings" number, the choreographic and cinematographic decisions
                        are made to either keep Astaire dancing close enough to Horton so that the latter
                        remains in frame or have Astaire’s dancing carry him far enough through lateral space
                        that Horton does not awkwardly reappear at unexpected moments in the background.
                        Ultimately, the camera helps to emphasize the most important function of the
                        choreography: narrative comprehension. Recreating and manipulating the movement for
                        the
                        purposes of formal analysis enhances our, and hopefully the reader’s, ability to observe
                        these choreographic and cinematic patterns.

                     <div class="ptext" id="p49"><em class="emph">Beau travail</em>, loosely adapted from Herman Melville’s <em class="emph">Billy
                           Budd</em>, is directed by Claire Denis and photographed by Denis’ long-time
                        collaborator Agnès Godard. The film’s narrative portrays much choreographed movement
                        in
                        its focus on French Foreign Legion soldiers stationed in Djibouti, and choreographer
                        Bernardo Montet’s creative contributions were essential to the film’s preproduction
                        design [<a class="ref" href="#mayne2005">Mayne, 2005</a>, 93]. <em class="emph">Beau travail</em> includes several
                        dance scenes between local Djibouti women and the Legionnaires but also emphasizes
                        performances of military and domestic exercises, blurring the line between dance,
                        military calisthenics, and pedestrian movement. The film relies little on dialogue
                        or
                        explicit narration, forcing the viewer to read the implicit meaning of the figure
                        movement; Judith Mayne describes the film as a "kind of choreographed ritual" [<a class="ref" href="#mayne2005">Mayne, 2005</a>, 93]. The protagonist Galoup’s final solo dance occurs after
                        the character’s presumed suicide, which allows the viewer to read the motivation of
                        that
                        final dance in numerous ways: as a frenetic but ultimately futile attempt at escape
                        [<a class="ref" href="#mayne2005">Mayne, 2005</a>, 101], as an example of the post-colonial body [<a class="ref" href="#hayward2002">Hayward, 2002</a>], as a marker of queer displacement [<a class="ref" href="#sosa2011">Sosa, 2011</a>].
                        Denis viewed the scene as an attempt at freedom; while initially planning to include
                        the
                        number before the suicide, she changed the plot order to "give the sense that Galoup
                        could escape himself" but also because after filming the number she realized it was
                        the
                        stronger ending [<a class="ref" href="#darke2000">Darke, 2000</a>, 18]. Our close analysis through
                        recreation of the film’s final dance scene is equally revelatory in its emphasis on
                        the
                        explicit diegetic details present and the craft mechanics of the scene.

                        Lavant, is unclear. Denis recalls the number’s process in an interview with <em class="emph">Senses

                        the script, and he said, 'What do you mean by "the dance between life and death"?’

                     <div class="ptext" id="p52">Lavant already had extensive movement training at the time of filming, with a
                        background in circus and pantomime, so it is plausible that he created the number
                        without Montet’s assistance. Denis’ comment about a lack of rehearsal and a single
                        take
                        seems suspect but indicates that an improvised approach to avoid an over-rehearsed
                        look
                        was key to the process. Most accounts of this number describe the dancing as frenetic,
                        but upon closer analysis we can observe that Lavant’s movement is in fact quite
                        graceful, with increasingly controlled and complex movements originating from the
                        body
                        center (the result of core stability and alternating Bound and Free Flow) and
                        reverberating into the limbs. Like Astaire’s movement, much of Lavant’s movement
                        patterns are driven by an upward impulse and a feeling of lift, but with a greater
                        sensation of strength (Strong Weight) in contrast to Astaire’s lightness. Unlike the
                        fluidity and ongoing nature of the "No Strings" number, Lavant frequently starts and
                        stops. The spatial relationship of camera and figure also creates an off-kilter feeling.
                        Rather than film Lavant straight-on, the camera remains to his left (likely to avoid
                        revealing the camera in the mirrored wall). His gaze and facing frequently focuses
                        leftward as well, as if he is intrigued by something off-screen left that the viewer
                        cannot see. In recreating this number, MacMaster and Mininsohn focused on this sense
                        of
                        increasing and halting range of motion, as if in the afterlife Galoup is discovering
                        an
                        ability to fully express himself for the first time. They embodied the specific pathways
                        and gestures Galoup employs in the first half of the number (including his smoking)
                        but
                        chose to improvise the more expansive movement of the second half (<a href="#figure20">Figure 20</a>, <a href="#figure21">Figure 21</a>, <a href="#figure22">Figure 22</a>, and <a href="#figure23">Figure 23</a>).

                        stylistic choices of staging, choreography, cinematography, and sound. Unlike the
                        earlier club scenes, where we hear French Creole and Turkish popular music, Galoup
                        here
                        performs to Corona’s Eurodance hit, "Rhythm of the Night." Previously we see
                        Legionnaires and local Djibouti women dancing, but now Galoup is alone (with his mirror
                        self). As the narrative progresses, the camera allows us to see more of the movement
                        by
                        adopting more distant framings. The early disco scene is shot at close proximity,
                        allowing us to see the men and women dancing together in medium close-ups. The second
                        disco scene in which the women dance as Galoup watches shows them in a medium long
                        shot.
                        It is only during Galoup’s final number where we see him dance in a full long shot,
                        and
                        even then we frequently lose his extremities as they extend beyond the edges of the
                        frame. Adding historical traceforms allows us to perceive the increasing expansiveness
                        of Galoup’s movement and release, especially after his leap to the ground (2:08 in
                        <a href="#figure24">Figure 24</a>'s video).

                     <div class="ptext" id="p56">A perfectly aligned, parallel camera removes the feeling of spontaneity from the
                        number. While Godard’s cinematography calmly and subtly reframes as Lavant moves through
                        the space, parts of Lavant’s body occasionally move out of frame, specifically his
                        head
                        during sudden leaps, imbuing him with a sense of freedom and release. If Lavant were
                        always centered, the expansiveness of his movements would potentially be diminished
                        by
                        the parallel movements of the camera, especially as the number progresses. In seeing
                        a
                        perfectly centered version of the dance, we also are reminded that Lavant is not truly
                        alone in the number, as Godard keeps his mirrored image in frame throughout, balancing
                        the space between Lavant and his reflection. Like "No Strings (Reprise)," Galoup’s
                        final
                        solo number results in a composition that reminds the viewer of the importance of
                        both
                        figures through deliberate choreography and mobile framing.

                  <div class="ptext" id="p57">The mobile framing in these dance sequences from <em class="emph">Top Hat</em> and <em class="emph">Beau
                        travail</em> are motivated by figure movement. For Keating, mastery of the follow shot
                     requires "timing the camera’s movement to coincide with a character’s," and he summarizes
                     the spectrum of follow shot aesthetics as residing between "invisible" and flamboyant
                     impulses [<a class="ref" href="#beau1999">Beau travail, 1999</a>, 75]. Our ability with the mv tool to manipulate
                     the figure’s relationship to the mobile frame raises the question, which part of a
                     character’s movement should the camera follow? In many instances of cinematic staging,
                     in
                     which the camera follows a character who is walking with an erect posture, this question
                     may serve little purpose. However, both Astaire and Lavant expand and contract their
                     Kinespheres by moving their limbs towards and away from their body center, and their
                     choreography pulls them off-vertical into diagonal pathways. The visualizations of
                     mobile
                     framing above, in which the pelvis’ position guides the parallel mobile frame, gives
                     an
                     approximation of what a holistic follow shot would look like, if the cameraperson
                     was
                     obsessively accounting for every tiny shift of the body. An examination of the end
                     of
                     Astaire’s solo emphasizes the importance of the cinematography in creating an unobtrusive
                     sightline for the viewer through the cinematic space. The camera dollies to follow
                     Astaire
                     as he drowsily dances towards the armchair, yet it does not also retreat in parallel
                     as
                     Astaire’s spins briefly move him back towards the right. Instead, the follow shot
                     creates
                     a smooth pathway to end the number with Astaire centered, his straight body line on
                     the
                     diagonal of the frame.

                     research, we can hypothesize what a more flamboyant approach to the follow shot would
                     look
                     like in these films. If the camera focuses on following the right wrist instead of
                     the
                     body center, for example, the mobile framing becomes significantly more obtrusive.

                     analysis allows us to explore innovative and experimental research questions. The
                     discovery that "No Strings (Reprise)" includes a follow shot motivated by a secondary
                     character points to new lines of inquiry. How common is this occurrence, in Astaire
                     numbers and musical cinema more broadly? With more data, could we articulate a correlation
                     between a norm of camera movement motivated by secondary (non-dancing) characters
                     and an
                     emphasis on drawing viewer attention to narrative details? The flamboyant and extreme
                     camera movements that we can record with the mv tool may not be accessible to filmmakers
                     working in live-action environments due to the limits of camera technology. Yet the
                     ability to change the relationship of the figure to frame initiates questions about
                     how
                     subtle changes to cinematic staging affects a viewer’s perception of the figure movement
                     and can lead us to better understand why filmmakers make the choices they do. For
                     aspiring
                     filmmakers and cinematic choreographers, being able to play in such an environment
                     can

                     translating an idea to the screen. Performatively engaging with these digital tools
