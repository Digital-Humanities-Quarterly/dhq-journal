                  <p>FLAME is an online digital humanities project providing economic data for
                     investigations of the transition from Late Antiquity to the Early Middle Ages (CE
                     325-750) in Western Eurasia and North Africa. While accumulating, entering, and
                     displaying the data, the project’s leadership has become increasingly aware of the
                     inherent distortions in these data. These deviations operate on various levels, from
                     the disparate events that provide the coin finds that serve as the basis of its data
                     to previously unexamined scholarly biases that underpin such a quantitative approach
                     to historical analysis. By systematically examining these phenomena, we hope to frame
                     a discussion of such inherent biases in other digital humanities undertakings.</p>

                     the Late Antique and Medieval Economy), a collaborative digital humanities project
                     based at Princeton University, aims to provide answers to this question through the
                     examination of coin data from the period of this transition — roughly 325–750 CE.
                     FLAME gathers as much coin-find evidence as possible, digitizes it, and visualizes
                     the results. In a series of conferences, we have examined this period and reflected
                     upon the possibilities that FLAME raises for framing (or re-framing) the discussion
                     of the ancient economy.</div>

                     motivations and describing its methodology and presentation. We highlight several
                     issues that demonstrate more general challenges to digital humanities projects,
                     particularly those that synthesize large and disparate bodies of evidence. We explore
                     the issue of systematic bias across our project layers. Beginning with the ancient
                     evidence itself, we suggest a typology of the bias that we have dealt with in the
                     course of the project, including biases that result from the project design itself.
                     We conclude that this bias creates insuperable obstacles for certain kinds of goals,
                     such as comprehensiveness, or even acceptable levels of representation for certain
                     regions, in pursuing big-data analysis in ancient history. The data is significant,
                     but there are also important lessons to be learned from its defects: among them how
                     to present systematic bias to users, as well as how to use data in ways that account
                     for identified biases. </div>

                           of scholarship, the types of the evidence used to attempt to answer this
                           question have continuously expanded. The classic studies on this subject, from
                           [<a class="ref" href="#gibbon_1776">Gibbon 1776</a>] to [<a class="ref" href="#dopsch_1923">Dopsch 1923</a>] and [<a class="ref" href="#pirenne_1922">Pirenne 1922</a>], based their arguments to a great extent on the

                           distinctive European economy, but otherwise ignored earlier monetary
                           developments and was more anecdotal than systematic in his use of the evidence

                           the Mediterranean. He was explicit in his intention to eschew numismatic
                           analysis, explaining his decision in a footnote that expressed hope that future
                           studies would examine coinage more carefully.<a class="noteRef" href="#d4e345">[2]</a>

                        <div class="ptext" id="p4">The outlines of the changes in minting from antiquity to the Middle Ages have
                           long been clear. In the fourth century CE, the Roman Empire, which controlled
                           the Mediterranean and beyond in antiquity, had been using a trimetallic system
                           of gold, silver, and bronze in the Mediterranean world, while its Sasanian
                           (Persian) rival to the East used a currency that consisted almost entirely of
                           silver. By the eighth century, monetary economies in the region morphed into
                           new forms and standards. A silver-based monetary economy developed in Europe, a
                           bimetallic one of gold and bronze in Byzantium in the northeast Mediterranean,
                           and a trimetallic system in the extensive lands of the Umayyads in the greater
                           MENA (Middle East and North Africa) region. The extent and volume of the
                           circulation of the coins that these economies used can be determined only from
                           a careful compilation and study of modern coin finds. Although digital tools
                           facilitate the analysis and visualization of the resulting patterns in the
                           literature, an understanding of the underlying forces shaping this data is
                           necessary. Only a critical reflection on the processes that led to the
                           deposition, excavation, study, and compilation of late antique coins can help
                           overcome the biases inherent in these processes and contribute to the
                           historical narrative of the period.</div>

                        <div class="ptext" id="p5">FLAME was formed in 2013, in the context of the annual Stone Lectures at
                           Princeton which Chris Wickham delivered. It began as an explicit attempt to
                           take Wickham’s aforementioned footnote to illuminate the economic history of
                           western Eurasia from the fourth to eighth century by assembling and presenting
                           numismatic data. From the beginning, its creators conceived it as a resource
                           database, that is, making the data available to others online but also meeting
                           and managing the expectation of a broader audience than its creators.<a class="noteRef" href="#d4e359">[3]</a> In retrospect, the project’s inception influenced several
                           subsequent biases.<a class="noteRef" href="#d4e366">[4]</a> Although FLAME began with the
                           necessary academic expertise in numismatics, represented by Princeton’s
                           numismatist, Alan Stahl, who came up with the idea for the project, the early
                           stages of the project did not include any digital technical expertise and
                           included rudimentary and unstandardized Excel files. Then-graduate student Lee
                           Mordechai “grew” into the role of technical director over time. As a
                           result, FLAME developed organically and benefitted from formal expertise in the
                           digital humanities only after a couple of years. Most initial members were
                           postdocs and graduate students affiliated with Princeton at the time. Project
                           development was inconsistent until the hiring of Mark Pyzyk as full-time
                           project manager in 2020. The subsequent regular discussions in the project’s
                           weekly meetings were crucial in thinking about and fleshing out the biases
                           underlying FLAME, as well as attempts to resolve them and how to communicate
                           them to FLAME’s audience. FLAME’s leadership defined the temporal delimitation
                           of the project to c. 325-750 CE and divided the project into two consecutive
                           stages that would examine the simpler question of coin minting and the far more
                           complex problem of coin circulation. </div>
                        
                        
                        <div class="counter"><a href="#p6">6</a></div>
                        <div class="ptext" id="p6">As FLAME operated for several years without funding, its leadership prioritized
                           rapid data collection which would both serve as a proof-of-concept for
                           subsequent funding, as well as producing results that its many non-tenured
                           members could use in their research. In retrospect, this decision introduced
                           and amplified existing (but then unrecognized) biases. For example, each member
                           of FLAME was given responsibility for a defined region of western Eurasia. They
                           worked independently of each other, coordinating with the leadership. This
                           accelerated data gathering but probably also sharpened differences between
                           regions, compounding the problems in regional biases (see below). Although many
                           additional contributors have joined FLAME over the years, the rationale
                           underlying the project’s spatial division remains an organizing principle and
                           the project’s temporal limits have not moved. From an early stage, the project
                           decided to focus on a few key variables relevant to its driving questions and
                           ignore others. For example, FLAME records a coin’s metal but ignores its
                           weight, as well as descriptions of text or images it might bear. This was
                           another decision that expedited data gathering, but it also resulted in fewer
                           variables for cross-checking and made it more difficult to address some of the
                           project’s subsequent biases. A key subsequent decision, taken a few years

                           its current format. FLAME’s core is a relational database (SQL Server). Project
                           members add to and edit the database through an Admin Panel website, developed
                           in JavaScript. The public version of this website includes a list of possible
                           values for FLAME’s key variables such as metal, denomination and mint.<a class="noteRef" href="#d4e392">[5]</a> Automatic tests within
                           the Admin Panel highlight potential issues with existing entries — for example,
                           coins with dates outside the project’s range — which require additional

                        <div class="ptext" id="p9">FLAME’s users interact with a graphic user interface (GUI). The GUI is based on
                           a map, developed in ArcGIS and JavaScript, on which the project’s data is
                           displayed. A side panel allows users to run advanced searches and place filters
                           on the data, with most results displayed on the map. Additional results may
                           appear in tabular or graph formats. FLAME’s design encourages exploration of
                           the results through customization. For example, when visualizing the coinage
                           output of a mint over time in a histogram, users can color-code different
                           elements based on the metallic content of coins minted in that location; the
                           data behind the histogram can then be exported in several formats (e.g. CSV,
                           XLS).</div>

                        <div class="ptext" id="p10">FLAME has imported data from other projects and datasets. Some of these
                           projects are openly accessible online. Others consist of data collected by
                           individuals, who then decided to donate it to FLAME. The decision to import
                           data resulted in an increase in the size of FLAME’s database by an order of
                           magnitude but also led to multiple challenges in using and maintaining these
                           data (see below for biases). Each of these datasets is idiosyncratic in its
                           coverage and data structure, so FLAME converts the data to its own format using
                           custom-built scripts. Since these other projects and datasets are continuously
                           updated but have no API (Application Programming Interface), the process is
                           undertaken on an ad hoc basis, using custom-written scrapers and data
                           transformations, leaving the resultant data unlinked except for a reference URL
                           on FLAME’s side for users wishing to follow entries back to their source. For
                           this reason, FLAME keeps a record of the dataset, from which the information is
                           derived. Since the data is not linked according to a wider linked open data
                           standard, the same data points could appear in two different datasets with
                           different names. As digital numismatic projects operate autonomously, two or
                           more databases could and often do end up containing the same coin finds but
                           digitized and classified them according to different criteria, depending on the
                           idiosyncratic goals or structure of these projects. To evaluate potential
                           duplicate data, FLAME developed an additional program that suggests possible
                           duplicates, which are then checked by project staff.<a class="noteRef" href="#d4e404">[6]</a>

                           to place more emphasis on User Experience (UX) to make the site and web
                           applications more user-friendly. FLAME’s leadership has periodically observed
                           and interviewed potential users — specialist and non-specialist academics, as
                           well as some students. These interviews have resulted in changes to the
                           public-facing user interface (UI), as well as the development of new features.
                           The emphasis on UX developed further through collaboration with the University
                           of Houston’s SYRIOS project, a National Endowment for the Humanities-funded
                           project that illustrates the history of ancient Syria through coinage.<a class="noteRef" href="#d4e409">[7]</a>

                           characteristics with other projects that work with material culture, and more
                           specifically projects that focus on numismatics.<a class="noteRef" href="#d4e419">[8]</a> As such,
                           FLAME’s development coincides with that of several other digital projects
                           concerned with ancient numismatics. These projects were generally developed
                           organically as digital versions of traditional reference publications that
                           include as much data as possible that conform to certain criteria. Thus, for
                           example, the Online Coins of the Roman Empire (OCRE) represents a catalog of
                           all coin types minted in the Roman Empire until 491 CE and was based on the
                           Roman Imperial Coinage (RIC) series of reference works. Other projects include
                           the Coin Hoards of the Roman Empire (CHRE) project, which aims to collect all
                           the information about coin hoards in the Roman Empire and beyond between c. 30
                           BCE and 400 CE, and the Portable Antiquities Scheme (PAS), which includes
                           archaeological objects found in England and Wales — mostly finds made and
                           reported by the public, including coins. Both these projects collected new
                           material and had no published precedent, but were nonetheless perceived as
                           digital versions of printed catalogs. </div>

                        <div class="ptext" id="p13">FLAME shares some of its core features with these projects. For example, like
                           FLAME, both the CHRE and PAS projects include a GUI, but unlike FLAME, both
                           CHRE and PAS place more emphasis on their data than their visual
                           representation. Both are also similar to FLAME in their data structure,
                           separating data at the level of individual coins and finds of coins found
                           within a common archaeological context. These approaches emerged organically in
                           different projects, resulting in different architectures. A subsequent
                           collaborative ontology, nomisma.org, was later established in an attempt to
                           provide stable digital representations of numismatic concepts between these and
                           other numismatic projects. Projects such as OCRE and PAS have organized at
                           least some of their data in a Nomisma-compliant manner, although the many
                           technical challenges have slowed collaboration, including with FLAME.<a class="noteRef" href="#d4e424">[9]</a>

                           entity (e.g., the Roman Empire) and/or a limited region (e.g., France). FLAME,
                           however, attempts to push the discussion forward by aggregating and harmonizing
                           data from different sources during a time of major change in its database.
                           Other numismatic projects facilitate answering numismatic research questions,
                           such as classifying coins into types, attempting to provide digital catalogs of
                           coins that share some variable, or finding patterns across coin finds.<a class="noteRef" href="#d4e433">[10]</a> FLAME, on
                           the other hand, has as its core a historical question — the nature of the Late
                           Roman to Medieval transition — that is primarily concerned with change over
                           time whether through coin production (i.e. how many coins were produced) or
                           coin circulation (i.e. which coins circulated where). This has heightened our
                           sensitivity to data biases — regional, temporal, and compositional with respect
                           to coin find contents — at the level of project design. While our digital
                           numismatic colleagues are all well aware of these topics (we are under no
                           illusions here), FLAME has been incentivized by the nature of its starting
                           questions to dig deeper into these factors: how, otherwise, could we claim to
                           accurately pursue our main question?</div>

                        and receiving feedback from colleagues, we have concluded that FLAME’s data
                        contains serious gaps, reflecting biases that affect all stages in the process of
                        discovering, preserving and publishing coins. In theory, numismatics seems like an
                        ideal candidate for digitization because some of its variables–such as the number
                        of coins found or the year in which a coin was minted–are easily quantifiable and
                        thus facilitate further analyses. Although some earlier publications treated
                        biases in digital numismatics anecdotally, providing little empirical data or
                        theoretical reflection on them, there has been little systematic analysis on
                        issues addressing entire assemblages of numismatic materials.<a class="noteRef" href="#d4e447">[11]</a> However, a
                        closer look at the numismatic evidence collected in the field — FLAME’s basic data
                        — reveals several types of biases, which we originally assumed could be minimized
                        through the accumulation of data. Once we had about a million coins in our
                        database, we believed, our database would be a more or less acceptable proxy for
                        the coins that were produced and circulated in Late Antiquity. In retrospect, this
                        view was naive. At present we believe that many of the biases we describe are
                        intractable in the near future and that tackling them would require significant
                        targeted research. As a result, despite the amount of data it contains, FLAME is
                        not a representative sample of the ancient monetary circulation. </div>

                     <div class="ptext" id="p16">We treat bias below on a spectrum of proximity to the ancient past. That is, the
                        closer the bias is to the historical material we propose to examine–e.g.,
                        individual transactions of coins, the burial of hoards, and so on–the more primary
                        we consider it. Critically, we insist on counting FLAME itself as a source of bias
                        that stands between researchers and the ancient past, sitting at the furthest
                        remove from the historical processes we provide insight into.<a class="noteRef" href="#d4e463">[12]</a> Figure 1 below summarizes some of the biases that shaped
                        the patterns of the survival of coins of which scholarship is aware. It utilizes
                        “corpora” of coins - with a corpus consisting of a group of coins that
                        share some key characteristic (e.g. all coins found in southern France or all
                        coins produced in Constantinople). The figure demonstrates that only a tiny
                        fraction of coins survives and enters scholarly awareness. </div>

                        comparative evidence suggests that only an extremely small fraction of coins (i.e.
                        far less than 1%) produced would be reported in scholarship.</div>

                        tertiary, and FLAME project bias. We begin, however, with Regional Bias (see next
                        section), as we believe that this methodological “layer” best illustrates the
                        complexities of the problem. While it is useful to think about proximity to the
                        past as a factor in data bias, Regional Bias shows that we must not fool ourselves

                        <div class="ptext" id="p19">Much of the bias in FLAME’s data emerges from regional differences rooted in
                           modern national or institutional factors, such as law, cultural organization,
                           national historical memory, or political circumstance — to say nothing of
                           economic reality. These national differences strongly influence the discovery,
                           preservation, and publication of archaeological objects. The absence of a
                           substantive rule of law can be ruinous to the cultural heritage of a region.
                           The most common form that this takes is the looting and selling of artifacts.
                           Such trade in looted goods has been regulated internationally since 1970 but
                           with unequal implementation.<a class="noteRef" href="#d4e505">[13]</a> Those artifacts that are
                           not effectively controlled make their way through various channels to an
                           enormous market of collectors. In a global context, the vast majority of
                           countries are significantly affected by artifact looting. Even countries like
                           France, the United Kingdom, or the United States, which more effectively
                           regulate objects found within their borders, serve as an endpoint for artifacts
                           illicitly exported from other nations.<a class="noteRef" href="#d4e514">[14]</a>
                           Ongoing warfare can also degrade or destroy a country’s cultural heritage.
                           Thus, regions such as Syria, Libya, and more recently Ukraine have suffered
                           serious loss of heritage objects and structures.<a class="noteRef" href="#d4e521">[15]</a>

                           map of coin finds. Thus, FLAME’s users might be surprised to see that Italy and
                           Turkey at present contain considerably fewer coin finds in FLAME than England
                           and France. Italy and Turkey were far more central components in the late
                           antique monetized macro-economy and therefore we would expect them to be better
                           represented. That this is not the case is probably the result of modern
                           regional biases, rather than any ancient pattern of circulation and deposition.
                           FLAME has attempted to lessen such disparities, for example, through the
                           establishment of coordinated teams in such under-reported areas. </div>

                           favorable in some places than in others. The question is why. Though a tempting
                           guess, it is not always a matter of wealth. Italy, for example, is a wealthy
                           country with a dynamic academic culture and a strong interest in excavating and
                           publishing archaeological materials on its territory. And yet we find
                           comparatively little published material there compared to some other countries.
                           On the other hand, Romania–significantly poorer today than Italy, but even more
                           so under communism–is among the best-excavated and published numismatic
                           contexts in Europe for late Roman coins. This was because its communist
                           government was strongly invested in establishing Romania’s “Roman” roots
                           and devoted enormous resources to supporting archaeological work, including
                           coin evidence, that furthered this ideological objective.</div>

                           a government program operating since 1997 within the parameters of several
                           national heritage laws but in particular the Treasure Act — which deals with
                           archaeological finds of precious metal objects.<a class="noteRef" href="#d4e575">[16]</a> The
                           PAS regulates and (sometimes controversially) incentivizes the discovery and
                           reporting of archaeological objects found by private individuals. While
                           individuals are required by law to report significant discoveries of more than
                           a single coin if gold or silver, or more than ten base metal (i.e. bronze)
                           coins, the PAS framework facilitates the process, preventing some of the more
                           important archaeological objects from being funneled into gray and black
                           markets. The objects are first inspected by local authorities — Field Liaison
                           Officers (FLOs) — who analyze, categorize, photograph, and record the objects
                           in an online database .<a class="noteRef" href="#d4e577">[17]</a> Under most circumstances,
                           the reporters will receive the objects back, at which point they are free to do
                           with them what they want - and many do sell their finds to museums or on the
                           market. This process is arguably a great incentive for them to report their
                           finds or at least removes significant disincentives to doing so. The PAS is
                           therefore a point of contrast to the many countries where found artifacts are
                           considered the property of the state, with no (or limited) compensation offered
                           to finders. The data gleaned from the process is published by PAS online,
                           freely and openly. This has meant huge gains in coin find data for England and

                           Mediterranean countries. Thus, England and Wales’s 1355 coin finds far
                           outnumber those of core economic regions in antiquity like Italy (467), Turkey
                           (265), and Egypt (74). This has much to do with the structure of reporting in
                           the UK, as well as the resources — and the legal enforcement efforts — devoted
                           to making the system work. As we mentioned earlier, because Scotland and
                           Northern Ireland do not participate in the PAS, the publication of coin finds
                           discovered on their territory lags significantly behind England and Wales. This
                           leads to a significant distortion in the British data encoded in FLAME; at the

                           lie much closer to the materials themselves and to the ancient economic
                           activity of which they were a part. What we define as primary biases derive
                           from lived experience in Late Antiquity and the early medieval period. Since we
                           cannot fully reconstruct lived experience in the past, many of these biases are
                           theoretical. Therefore, we must use proxies to answer questions about, e.g.,
                           the differential loss of coins. The few scholarly attempts made to understand
                           the effects of primary biases on the modern numismatic landscape (i.e., the
                           coins that scholars are left to work with in the present) have generally based
                           their studies on theoretical models derived from modern economic
                           phenomena.<a class="noteRef" href="#d4e598">[18]</a> The vast differences between societies over time,
                           however, obstruct such an analogy. For example, there are obvious issues
                           inherent in comparing a monetary economy, where transactions and taxes were
                           paid in precious metal coins, to one where payments are primarily in credit and

                        <div class="ptext" id="p27">In the pre-modern world, coins served as means of exchange and holders of
                           wealth; they were issued in three metals (alloys based on gold, silver, and
                           copper, respectively) and in various denominations (standards of fineness and
                           weight holding a fixed value in the monetary system, e.g., in the contemporary
                           United States, coins of 1, 5, 10, 25, or 50 cents). At various times and places
                           in antiquity, certain metals and denominations were available, corresponding to
                           different sectors and levels of economic activity. In general, gold-based
                           coinages were used for extraordinary, costly transactions (e.g., purchases of
                           land) and constituted the principal medium for storing wealth. Copper-based
                           coins were used for everyday transactions. Silver-based coinages, between gold

                           have spent most of the time since their minting underground. They may have been
                           buried intentionally or accidentally. The chief reason for intentionally
                           burying coins in antiquity was that there were few alternatives to save wealth
                           securely. Pre-modern societies rarely had any form of deposit banking, and so
                           individuals or institutions usually put saved coins along with other precious
                           objects into a vessel, burying them somewhere they could be dug up when needed.
                           Such “hoards” frequently comprised the highest-value coins available to
                           whoever hid them. Hoarding was relatively common in the pre-modern world,
                           though perhaps more so in times of perceived insecurity (e.g., war). If the
                           burier failed to retrieve the coins, they might come down to us as a hoard.
                           Other intentional contexts for coin deposits would be the burial of individuals
                           or other ritual offerings. Such cultural practices lead to biases in the coins
                           that survive up to our times — for example, the clear bias towards high-value
                           gold and silver coins in most hoard finds. </div>

                        <div class="ptext" id="p29">Other coins ended up in the ground through a different mode — accidental loss.
                           The vast majority of coins found in excavations and single finds — which
                           represent random accidental losses — are copper. The simple act of accidentally
                           dropping a coin during a transaction or travel would have been the first step
                           in this process, but the likelihood that the person would have recognized the
                           loss and retrieved the coin is far more likely in the case of high-value coins,
                           especially in antiquity where a single gold coin could be worth hundreds of
                           bronze coins. Also important is the fact that copper is often less bright in
                           color than gold or silver. As artificial lighting was rare, many transactions
                           took place outdoors in dusty or muddy locations that were close to the color of
                           copper. Such coins were less likely than gold or silver to attract the
                           attention of passersby. Another factor in the predominance of copper coins in
                           archaeological contexts is their generally fiduciary nature; that is, their
                           value was dependent on the state’s commitment to convertibility into precious
                           metal coinage. In cases of demonetization, for example as part of a coinage
                           reform, such coins would be worthless and might be casually discarded. Within
                           this context, silver coins issued within a tri-metallic system might be
                           significantly under-represented in modern samples since they were noticeable
                           enough to be observed and retrieved when lost (as opposed to copper), but not
                           valuable enough to be well-represented in hoards (as opposed to gold).</div>

                        <div class="ptext" id="p30">The second class of bias focuses on the archaeological context in which coins
                           are found, as well as the various natural and technical processes at play in a
                           coin’s survival over time and its subsequent discovery. Excavations are the
                           most common legal context from which buried coins are intentionally retrieved.
                           Within excavations, coins are valued as chronological indicators for a
                           particular archaeological layer. Most excavation coins are presumed to be the
                           result of unintentional loss and so, as sketched out above, are usually
                           copper-based and small. They are often in bad physical shape owing to wear
                           (since they were used daily), direct contact with corrosive environments (e.g.,
                           soil), and the greater susceptibility of copper to corrosion compared to silver
                           or gold. These factors tend to coincide with each other, often corroding coins
                           to the point that they are unreadable. A case in point is the <span class="hi italic">minimi</span> of the fifth and sixth centuries CE, a designation for coins of
                           about 10 mm in diameter, often poorly struck in the first place. The
                           categorization of such coins as <span class="hi quotes">unattributed</span> or <span class="hi quotes">unidentified</span>, — if they are recognized at all in the
                           course of excavation — is a source of bias on sites, especially when dealing
                           with strata associated with Late Antiquity. On the other hand, prominent
                           features on certain denominations might allow for partial identification. For
                           example, the sixth- and seventh-century Byzantine 40-nummi bronze piece is
                           quite large and heavy and carries a large M which is easily identifiable even
                           if other features are illegible.</div>

                        <div class="ptext" id="p31">A further source of bias among coins from excavations is the process of site
                           selection by archaeologists. Some of these are limited by definition - for
                           example, built-over areas in modern cities generally allow for only limited
                           archaeological excavations. Moreover, Late Antiquity, the period FLAME
                           investigates, has traditionally attracted less scholarly and public interest
                           than e.g. Greco-Roman antiquity, a period that remains the focus of many
                           excavated sites, or sectors within larger excavations. In FLAME’s case, this
                           probably contributes to the sharp reduction in coin finds between the beginning
                           and end of the period, with which the project is concerned. This imbalance in
                           the results of excavations often stems from ideological interests (for example,
                           demonstrating the level of civilization or identity of certain site
                           inhabitants). This might operate at the level of the archaeologists, those
                           granting funding or permits for excavations, or both. For instance, it is
                           common for excavations in Greece or Turkey for much of the 20th century to
                           bulldoze (often literally) through levels associated with medieval or late
                           antique remains, usually to reach Hellenistic and Classical layers, which
                           scholars, funders, and governments considered more prestigious. This affected
                           not only what came out of the ground, but where it went (into a bucket or a
                           museum showcase), as well as how it was preserved, cataloged, studied, and
                           published.</div>

                        <div class="ptext" id="p32">Besides excavation contexts, coins are often discovered in hoard contexts.
                           Hoards are typically defined as two or more coins thought to have been buried
                           together, often in a vessel or other container, which exhibit a radically
                           different pattern of coin preservation. As hoards were usually buried in
                           secret, they are often found outside of habitation areas excavated by
                           archaeologists. In the nineteenth century, hoards were frequently discovered by
                           farmers as the result of adopting deeper plows or through exploitation of areas
                           that had been abandoned since the Middle Ages. The expansion of urban areas –
                           with their deeper digging for infrastructure (e.g. building foundations,
                           sewers, utilities, etc.) – as well as transportation routes (e.g. roads and
                           railways) resulted in more hoard finds as well. In more recent times, the use
                           of metal detectors has greatly increased the rate at which such finds are made
                           (hence the phenomenon of “detectorists” in the United Kingdom, who are a major
                           constituent of the aforementioned Treasure Act and PAS policies). Whether such
                           coins are brought to the attention of government authorities or local
                           numismatists varies greatly depending on legislation and policy, and is a major
                           source of bias affecting FLAME’s database and circulation map, as discussed

                           coin finds. These biases are also largely intractable as they stem from broader
                           trends in scholarship and publication practices (e.g., who studies what? Who
                           publishes, where and for what reasons?). </div>

                           not the same as, the archaeological biases discussed above. Scholarly bias may
                           take the form of prioritizing certain academic activities over others.
                           Archaeologists, for example, often prioritize excavating sites over publishing
                           the results. Because of this, many sites that are excavated are not — and
                           likely will not be — published. A 2001 survey of archaeological excavations in
                           Israel revealed that fewer than 20 percent of excavations carried out in the
                           seasons between 1970–1989 had published their results.<a class="noteRef" href="#d4e693">[19]</a> Similarly, the major salvage
                           excavations in Beirut’s city center over the 1990s and 2000s had at least 15
                           different teams excavating over 200 sites. Only a handful of these have been
                           published to date.<a class="noteRef" href="#d4e698">[20]</a>

                        <div class="ptext" id="p35">Similar decisions are made within excavations themselves. For example, as
                           discussed above, researchers decide to excavate certain strata and features and
                           not others based on <span class="hi italic">ad hoc </span>criteria. In the case of
                           Beirut, the published excavation sites bulldozed the layers above the

                           Beirut. Even after the excavation of a site, the numismatic material is often
                           challenging for the average archaeologist to deal with. Although the ideal
                           solution is to bring in a numismatic specialist, in reality many coins remain

                           record made of their contents. </div>

                        <div class="ptext" id="p37">A further bias derives from the notorious decentralization of numismatic
                           publications, an existing problem exacerbated by FLAME’s scope. Reports of
                           finds can appear in local and relatively inaccessible journals, excavation
                           reports, edited volumes, festschrifts, and journal articles, among others. Many
                           of these are not systematically used for disseminating numismatic research.
                           This phenomenon already makes it difficult to locate all these reports, so that
                           FLAME’s information is more representative of the most accessible publications
                           rather than the whole of numismatic scholarship. It also favors English or
                           other standard research languages (e.g., German over Armenian), often published
                           by Western-oriented presses.</div>

                           past with various levels of success — for example Kropotkin’s survey of Roman
                           and Byzantine coin finds in the Soviet Union or Militky’s equivalent inventory
                           in the Czech Republic.<a class="noteRef" href="#d4e721">[21]</a> The latter example indicates that
                           additional biases intrude at the sub-national level, with certain counties or
                           regions being better covered than others (Prague, for instance, is hugely

                           contribute to biases in reference works – the catalogs and other methodological
                           apparatus most scholars use to identify a coin or better understand a
                           numismatic process. As a general rule of thumb, the more coins are available
                           for study (through publication, ideally), the better the resulting product.
                           There are other factors as well — for example, the popularity of certain topics
                           over others. While good catalogs for Roman imperial coins (e.g. aforementioned
                           Roman Imperial Coinage series) have appeared from the 1920s, their Byzantine
                           equivalents date only to the 1970s. Comprehensive catalogs of Sasanid Persian
                           coins date to the 2000s and are still incomplete today.<a class="noteRef" href="#d4e754">[24]</a> Other types of coinage — for example that of central Asia — are barely

                           are, however, biases inherent to FLAME itself that involve how the project is

                        <div class="ptext" id="p42">Most FLAME researchers are volunteers who provide the numismatic data for
                           regions about which they have some expertise. In general, they work alone,
                           coordinating their activity through project representatives. The participation
                           of such individuals does not, generally, arise in a vacuum, and is structured
                           by pre-existing individual and disciplinary contexts. Many early participants,
                           for example, were Princeton University graduate alumni. Subsequently,
                           volunteers might have seen a conference presentation on the project given by a
                           FLAME representative, or they might have been put in touch by someone with
                           knowledge of the project. Such weak ties follow familiar paths, generally
                           through North American and Western European universities.<a class="noteRef" href="#d4e779">[25]</a> Many contributors were first visiting scholars at Princeton or
                           had passed through programs such as Dumbarton Oaks' numismatic summer seminar
                           (co-taught by Stahl) or that of the American Numismatic Society. Disciplinary
                           and institutional networks play a critical role in the shaping of such work,
                           which favors some regions over others. For example, the authors of this
                           article, who have constituted the leadership of FLAME, all specialize in
                           aspects of northern Mediterranean and European scholarship. When FLAME has
                           attempted research on coin finds in regions where its leadership has fewer ties
                           such as North Africa, the Indian subcontinent, or East Asia, it has run into
                           problems recruiting individuals who might help. These are limitations we have
                           sought to address, with varying degrees of success.</div>

                           to this point, five regional clusters have come together to work on FLAME. This
                           has included groups focused on the Anatolian peninsula, the Iberian peninsula,
                           Southern Italy, Ukraine, as well as a group working at the University of
                           Hamburg focusing on early Islamic coinage. That the last group departs from the
                           typical regional focus is a result of scholarly specialization — most FLAME
                           scholars focus their research on pre-Islamic (e.g., Roman, Byzantine, etc.) or
                           Islamic coins but not both categories.</div>

                           countries are better able to support individuals and groups of scholars or have
                           particular national priorities that favor the publication and reporting of

                     archaeological and historical topics, they cannot overcome problems in source
                     materials. Biases that have plagued different research questions generally persist
                     and we are unable to even gauge their severity, except in outline, because we cannot
                     say how many materials have <span class="hi italic">not</span> been discovered, reported, or
                     published in various regions. This makes the exercise of gauging robustness in late
                     antique and medieval coin data more epistemological than technical. In our opinion,
                     there is no technical solution to this problem. FLAME itself has introduced its own
                     biases to its digital representation of the research question — biases that derive
                     from its implementation, visual design, and varied experience of its contributors.
                     All in all, many of these issues are intractable and will not be resolved in the
                     foreseeable future — a feature we feel FLAME shares with other digital humanities
                     projects, which have acknowledged similar biases to varying degrees. The ORBIS
                     Project, for instance — a digital itinerary planner and travel-time calculator for
                     the Roman world — was significantly affected by project-level biases that led to the
                     inclusion of the Black Sea in the project’s data but not the Red Sea.<a class="noteRef" href="#d4e815">[27]</a> The Mapping the Republic of Letters project — a mapping

                     establishing the limits at which projects in the digital humanities can operate

                     that FLAME’s efforts, or those of any other digital humanities project, are useless.
                     On the contrary, FLAME has forced us, its creators, to reflect more systematically
                     on
                     biases underlying scholarship on the late antique economy, many of which have not
                     been formally discussed in scholarship. The result is a more critical approach to
                     the
                     broader research question, and one that translates across the digital humanities.</div>

                     it
                     makes explicit the totality of information available to scholars of this period (it
                     is a reflection of scholarship, after all, and not the ancient world itself), but
                     because it makes imaginable the information that is missing. Thus, while numismatists
                     will not, presumably, cease their research because of the sudden revelation of how
                     much they do not know (something they already suspect), they can and should be more
                     self-conscious about it, and about where and how this is so. Moreover, scholars whose
                     interests are methodological or historiographical now have a tool to examine not only
                     the late antique and medieval economy, but also the basis on which knowledge of it
                     is
                     built. In this context, much of FLAME’s work over the past few years has moved
                     towards making its biases and other issues more transparent to project users. These
                     were not questions we considered during the first years of the project, when we were
                     more concerned about providing data to historians studying the ancient economy. </div>

                     The first marks certain kinds of bias directly in FLAME’s user interface, associating
                     coin finds directly with particular biases that afflict them. These are communicated
                     through pop-up tabs that appear when users click on coin finds. These bias labels,
                     each of which expands to provide a detailed definition of the bias, as well as a link
                     to the entry on our website, are dynamically generated, based on an automated set
                     of
                     criteria that assign bias on a case-by-case basis. These biases are most often at
                     the
                     primary level, where certain coin features help to identify them. For example, in
                     Figure 8, the status of High Use Bias is based almost entirely upon the metal of the
                     coin — bronze coins tend to be used more than gold or silver coins, and so finds that
                     are characterized primarily by bronze or other base metallic coinages are assigned

                     biases have required considerable case-specific descriptions, and we have therefore
                     adopted a unique format to communicate these. This is the second of our two-pronged
                     approach to addressing bias. For regions like Britain, we have asked area experts
                     to
                     write short essays explaining the particulars of the region in somewhat more detail
                     than what we saw above. These essays are posted as PDFs on a resources page on the
                     FLAME website, but they are also integrated directly into our UI and can be accessed
                     through the same bias tab described above (see Fig. 8, where the bullet “Regional
                     Bias: Britain” provides direct access to a PDF of the bias essay). Such links to
                     discussions of possible regional biases are assigned automatically to any find on
                     the
                     territory of the region in question. A list of biases we have identified appears on
                     a
                     dedicated page on our website, a link to which appears in all bias tabs.<a class="noteRef" href="#d4e853">[29]</a> This list
                     is not comprehensive for FLAME or any other historical numismatic project. In both
                     the application and this paper, we have attempted to compromise responsibly, settling
                     for a level of explicitness and systematicity.</div>

                  <div class="ptext" id="p51">In this context, we believe that the best strategy for addressing these issues is
                     to
                     use the powerful digital platforms we have built to highlight them. We encourage
                     users to engage with substantial critical approaches to the underlying data through
                     a
                     few mouse clicks, for example through the regional bias essays, and by constantly
                     reminding users that these biases exist. This coupling of data and bias warning would
                     have been extremely difficult, if not impossible, to do using traditional publication
                     practices. Transparently highlighting biases in our data and presentation and making
                     that information available to project users are key steps towards the production of
                     more robust research.</div>

                  <div class="ptext" id="p52">All scholars who work in historical and archaeological disciplines are aware that
                     the
                     evidence upon which they draw is incomplete and not fully representative of past
                     conditions. Source analysis is a basic component of the training of historians and
                     modern archaeological inquiry is accompanied by an understanding of the selective
                     nature of the evidence that comes from excavations. Within this scholarly context,
                     FLAME introduces an unprecedented concentration of relevant data - and tools to
                     analyze and visualize it - for questions regarding the late antique and medieval
                     economy. Yet this presentation also introduces profound challenges. Historians
                     trained in the traditional humanities are rarely prepared to contend with problems
                     inherent in large-scale quantitative datasets such as those underlying FLAME. On the
                     other hand, although digital humanities scholarship has produced impressive tools
                     for
                     viewing, accessing and using data, it often does so without integrating traditional
                     humanistic insights that might realistically temper expectations for such data, at
                     least not to a level that satisfies more traditional colleagues. A large database
                     with sophisticated graphical representations, based on finds of over a million coins,
                     might appear to some scholars as a robust proxy for past conditions, but, as we have
                     seen, such an assumption is naive, since the data carries multiple layers of biases.
                     In this regard, FLAME’s emphasis on revealing the biases and their impact on the
                     shape of our data is a major contribution. Once scholars are thoroughly acquainted
                     with the biases inherent in its data and their presentation, the FLAME database can
                     serve as the basis for discussions of one of the key transitions in global history,
                     using more data — and more precise data — than has ever been possible before.</div>

                     biases they replicate, introduce, or inherit from other projects as early as
                     possible. These reflections should be made public and be considered part of a more
                     robust presentation of the project, whether in formal settings such as conferences
                     or
                     in project materials such as publications. The online presence of the project and
                     its
                     documentation should include discussions of these biases that are accessible to
                     users, including the project’s attempts to acknowledge and ideally resolve them. If
                     possible, the project should also incorporate this more critical discourse into its
                     user interface. A shared discussion following such norms would benefit a broad range
                     of digital humanities projects and make their results more robust. </div>
