         <head>Introduction</head>
         <p>The project Digital Samos is devoted to study the monastic site of San Julián de Samos,
            which is one of the most ancient and largest monasteries in Spain. We examine the
            evolving nature of the monastic architecture along with its surrounding environment, the
            sacred precinct, and the nearby village. This monastic compound has been written and
            re-written through continuous spatial changes over the course of centuries. As a
            consequence, Samos is currently a palimpsest, that is, a complex built environment
            defined by multiple historical layers. </p>
         <p>Despite the monastery as a single entity has been largely examined by scholars since the
            late 19th century onwards,<note> For the history of the monastery of San Julián de Samos
               see: [Arias Arias 1950] [Arias Cuenllas 1992] [Castro 1912] [Durán 1947] [Folgar de
               la Calle 2006] [Folgar de la Calle, Goy Diz 2008] [López Peláez 1894] [Portilla Costa
               1978] [Portilla Costa 2003].</note> the monastic site as a totality of the religious
            buildings and their agricultural plots, the nearby urban tissue, the geographical
            setting, and the surrounding landscape, was not previously addressed when the present
            project began. This is probably due to the difficulties that spatiotemporal analysis
            involves in the case of built environments defined by layers that cross millennium. </p>
         <p>To uncover and reconstruct those historical layers in spatial and temporal terms, we
            utilize a multidisciplinary approach that combines historical sources, evidence-based
            investigation, and digital technologies. Historical sources related to monastic
            architecture and landscape at Samos are diverse and, sometimes, scarce, incomplete, or
            uncertain. The extant fragments of past monastic compounds may appear currently
            decontextualized, dispersed, hidden, or even lost. As a consequence, to investigate and
            reconstruct those multiple layers poses a set of challenges that concerns both urban
            history and architectural history. Digital tools can help us to overcome those
            challenges.</p>
         <p>Through computer-aided design (CAD) tools we created a series of phased 2D maps and 3D
            models that visualize the main stages of the monastic site evolution from the High
            Middle Ages to the early 21st century. These digital visualizations help us, as
            scholars, to gain a better understanding of the processes by which the monastic site of
            San Julián de Samos was designed, understood, changed, and experienced over time as a
            totality of topography, architecture, and human history.<note> The research project was
               started in: [López-Salas 2015].</note> A number of initiatives has also demonstrated
            in recent decades that the communication of knowledge with digital methods in academia
            can promote the understanding of cultural heritage and spread awareness of the
            importance of preserving and protecting historical architecture along with its context
            outside academia.<note> See, for example: [Borin 2016] [Calabi 2009] [Harris 2015] [King
               et al. 2016] [Monteleone et al. 2016] [Svalduz 2013].</note>
         </p>
         <p>In June 2018, we began a new in-process work for the project with the creation of an
            interactive web-map, hosted by Universidade da Coruña at <ref
               target="https://digitalsamos.udc.es/interactive_map.html"
               >https://digitalsamos.udc.es/interactive_map.html</ref>.<note> The Digital Samos
               project is accessible at: <ref target="https://digitalsamos.udc.es/index.html"
                  >https://digitalsamos.udc.es/index.html</ref>. In August 2018, it was selected by
               the Getty Foundation to feature its Digital Art History Initiative page, <ref
                  target="https://www.getty.edu/foundation/initiatives/current/dah/index.html"
                  >https://www.getty.edu/foundation/initiatives/current/dah/index.html</ref>. In
               February 2020, it was awarded with a special mention in the second edition of the
               Hispanic Digital Humanities Prizes, HDH 2020.</note> This new stage emerged from our
            participation in the Getty Summer Institute “Advanced Topics in Digital Art History: 3D
            (Geo)Spatial Networks” [Duke University 2018], where instructors and participants
            illustrated how web-based platforms have become essential vehicles for presentation and
            dissemination of research about architectural heritage. They can be also thought and
            designed as tools to ensure the intellectual integrity of computer-based visualization
            outcomes in research and communication of urban and architectural history [Jaskot et al.
            2018].</p>
         <p>In addition, an issue of major concern in the architectural community and virtual
            heritage domain at large is how we can publish graphic materials such as vector plans,
            3D models, or geospatial historical maps in such a way that their rigor is clear to
            their full consideration as research arguments. Print and online publications not only
            put a limit on the number of figures or illustrations to be published per article, but
            they also establish specific types of image file formats, which are generally raster
            graphics. The first issue — number — gives priority to prose in scientific publications.
            This fact usually leads to the consideration of graphic materials or multimedia outputs
            as an accompaniment to the text, but not the research arguments themselves
            [Chattopadhyay 2012] [Staley, 2015, 123-127] [Sullivan et al. 2017]. </p>
         <p>As Freddolini recently pointed out, “… the activity of writing involves diverse aspects
            that include the possible ways to visualize and disseminate my research… Tools for data
            visualization, to cite only one example, are not only a corollary –or a demonstration–
            of what I ‘write’, but essential components of the arguments I aim to create…”
            [Helmreich 2021, 176]. However, the use of common image file formats force researchers
            in those fields to convert their original vector CAD architectural plans, graphic 3D
            models reconstructions, or geospatial GIS historical maps into fixed images when they
            aim to publish their work. As a consequence, historical data and the different types of
            thinking and interpretation that were made and integrated in the computer-aided design
            visual materials, through layers, categories, or attributes, are generally lost. </p>
         <p>This is a common challenge we faced when we tried to communicate the results of our
            research about the monastic site of San Julián de Samos. The interactive web-map of
            Digital Samos is created to overcome that challenge through the use of web-mapping
            tools, while it also promotes the understanding of the historical site among scholars
            and public. It displays the extensive knowledge we acquired about this complex built
            environment through on-site and archival research into a digital publication, in which
            the “reader” is granted access to the evolution of the historical site. In addition to
            cartographic display showing detailed information about the setting topography and the
            compound of the monastic site (buildings, precinct, and village), the web-map aims to
            become a more scientific successor to the phased CAD maps we previously created. By
            taking advantage of the potentials of the digital domain, we try to overcome the
            limitations of the traditional series of fixed images in which we converted the CAD maps
            for prior dissemination of our research. Instead of static phased maps that revealed the
            complexity of spatiotemporal changes by means of time fragmentation or color coding
            design, the prototype web-map we present in this paper walks toward a more integral and
            effective online interface, where the final user is able to interact with space, time,
            scale, layers, and sources. All spatial entities are displayed in the form of web
            graphic features with attributes with historical data and interpretation within one
            single digital output. </p>
         <p>The paper is organized into three main parts. First, we present the project focus on the
            spatiotemporal analysis of a centuries-old Spanish monastic site and its main outcomes
            so far. Second part is devoted to the specific domain of web-mapping tools. Based on
            related works and projects in the field, we show how web-mapping can help us to better
            make sense of complex built environments that humans have formed and re-formed over
            time. As this point we also connect our project to existing literature in Spatial
            Humanities on deep mapping, thereby contextualizing the present case study. Then, we
            explain how we faced the process of creating an integral scientific web-map for Digital
            Samos that goes beyond static 2D representations of a multi-layered past physical realm
            in a definitive publication. We present the workflow, its potential, and pitfalls.
            Finally, we discussed the challenges, the present limitations, and the future
            developments of what we consider a functional prototype web-map for spatiotemporal
            analysis, presentation, and dissemination in the field of digital art and architectural
            history, while we also summarize why this project is valuable as a case study. The
            web-map is here conceived as a means for public outreach, a self-explanatory visual
            product, in which accessibility, transparency, legibility, and integrity of visual and
            textual spatial data in a digital environment aims to promote a fuller understanding of
            the process that defined the past monastic site(s).<note> By following the principles of
               the: [London Chapter 2009] [Seville Principles 2011].</note>
         </p>
         <p>San Julián de Samos beyond historical practice </p>
         <p>The main art historical question in the project San Julián de Samos is spatial change
            over time of a historical monastic site that includes the monastic buildings, the sacred
            precinct, the nearby village, and the surrounding rural area (Figure 1). The monastery
            was founded before the 7th century and, like most religious houses, it changed across
            its long life through constant constructions and re-constructions. Studying the question
            of spatial change over time is crucial to analyze how the site was conceived, understood
            and experienced, as a sum of different pieces (monastic buildings, topography, urban
            tissue, geographical features) instead of as a single artifact (Figure 2).</p>
         <p>The first part of our research process comprised the collection of historical and
            contemporary sources. Historical ones are very disparate from each other, such as
            building contracts, rental agreements, books of demarcations, cadasters, historical
            photographs, old maps, expropriation records, and civil engineering projects.
            Contemporary sources collected are images, plans, on-site investigation, measure
            surveys, remains, testimonies, scientific papers, book chapters, etc.</p>
         <p>The second part of the research process was focused on generating 2D maps and 3D models
            with Computer-Aided Design programs, that is digital tools, to recreate the multiples
            phases of spatial change of this monastic site over time. The monastic site was
            re-created and then visualized through static images of plans/maps and renderings, one
            per each main phase of transformation (Figures 3 and 4). We used a code for 2D map
            drawing that is comprised of different colored lines. Each colored line has a different
            meaning about the knowledge it represents. For example, dark and grey lines visualize
            buildings that are extant nowadays, that is evidence. On the contrary, brown and orange
            lines are used to draw hypothetical parts of the monastic site. We also used a different
            color to represent those monastic proposals that were planned but not built (Figure 5). </p>
         <p>Through this methodology we were able to recover the lost monastic compound of the Late
            Middle Ages from which only some remains are extant currently [López Salas 2013]. We
            could analyze the reasons behind the architectural reform that took place in the late
            15th century and its consequences on the definition of a new monastic site [López Salas
            2017a]. We discovered the role of monks in the creation and evolution of the sacred
            precinct and the immediate village of Samos, as urban planners [López Salas 2017b]
            [López Salas 2017c]. We came to understand the multiple processes that surrounded the
            replacement of the Romanesque church and cloister by bigger buildings, and the role that
            context, topography, and geographical features played in the monastic design of the 18th
            century. We also analyzed through digital representation how a proposed but unbuilt
            fourth cloister would have changed completely the historical monastic realm, as well as
            the losses that secularization brought to architecture and monastic landscape in the
            19th century [López Salas 2017d] [López Salas 2017e] [López Salas 2017f]. </p>
         <p>The new knowledge was acquired in the process of making the maps and models due to the
            reasoning that was applied to create them from sources and interpretations while also
            filling the gaps caused by ambiguity, uncertainty, or absence of data. This is what
            Elena Svalduz called “a new form of intellectual reasoning through modeling” or
            representation of past spaces by means of digital visualization tools [Svalduz 2018,
            36]. We also consider that most of this new knowledge in the form of visual products
            must be communicated from scholars to the scientific community and general public
            without losing the potential of the visual sense. However, scientific publications
            prioritize textual analysis as it also happens in the evaluation of knowledge production
            within academia, where images, videos, maps, or models that results from serious
            research are rarely considered as rigorous as texts. The inclusion of visual data in
            publications is usually restricted to a specific number of figures and its presentation
            is also limited by widely used raster image formats instead of vector graphics.</p>
         <p>In our case, the project outcomes reveal the potential of digital visualization for
            art-historical academic research as we have largely published in paper conferences,
            journal articles, and book chapters.<note> A comprehensive list of publications and
               communications related to the research carried out in Digital Samos is available at
               the project website: “Articles and Book Chapters”, <ref
                  target="https://digitalsamos.udc.es/research_publications.html"
                  >https://digitalsamos.udc.es/research_publications.html</ref>, “Congresses,
               Workshops, Seminars and Conferences”, <ref
                  target="https://digitalsamos.udc.es/research_congresses.html"
                  >https://digitalsamos.udc.es/research_congresses.html</ref>.</note> However, the
            lack of funds and the high cost of print publication prevented us from presenting the
            project along with its sources and results in any complete fashion so far. The creation
            of a web presence could provide, we think, an ideal solution to not only make the
            research outcomes about Samos accessible and better known in and outside academia, but
            also to test a new form of publication beyond the limits of scientific journals in what
            refers to the dissemination of visual-centered projects, where drawings, maps, images,
            and digital graphic outputs are not a complement of the text, but a new form of
            scholarly production to be recognized as rigorous as textual research [Chattopadhyay
            2012] [Staley, 2015, 123-127] [Sullivan et al. 2017]. In addition, we should not forget
            that each form of communication can do something that the other cannot and, for that
            reason, both should be considered complementary, and neither superior, as Ethington and
            Toyosawa point out in their comparison of cartography, which operates by simultaneity
            and juxtaposition, and semantic text, which is syntactically linear and narratological
            [Ethington, Toyosawa 2015, 75]. In this way the idea of creating an interactive web-map
            of the spatiotemporal changes at the monastery of San Julián de Samos was born.</p>
         <p>References and goals for Digital Samos web-map</p>
         <p>Working with 2D maps and 3D models poses a set of challenges in publication. The main
            one is the file format. While maps and models that reconstruct past spaces are usually
            created with computer-aided design or 3D computer graphics software toolsets, print and
            online scientific journals mainly display these types of digital products in the form of
            images, that is, fixed visual representations of real or imagined past spaces. None of
            the data on which the generation of the digital product was based on, or the
            interpretations the scholars made through various types of thinking, are usually
            published along with the images. They may be explained in the prose narrative that the
            images accompany, but as two entities separately [McClure, Worthey 2019]. </p>
         <p>This fact leads to a main difference between the map or model made by the scholar with
            the final map or model to be published in what refers to information and interpretation.
            It also shows another difference, which is not always visible, between the way we
            display and read text and images in scientific publications. While we are able to quote
            any excerpt of the text to cite the source or sources in which our argument is based,
            such quotation is not possible in the case of spatial features that define the image of
            a 2D map or a 3D model. As a consequence, the connection between our visual arguments
            and their evidence is lost [McClure, Worthey 2019], although it is fundamental to
            guarantee the rigor and transparency of scholarly publication. </p>
         <p>This is an issue of major concern in the computer-based visualization of cultural
            heritage research community that both the London Chapter (2009) and the Principles of
            Seville (2011) highlight [London Chapter 2009] [Seville Principles 2011] [Lanjouw,
            Waagen 2021]. Sufficient information to document and disseminate computer-aided
            visualization outcomes is needed to enable the understanding of the relationship between
            research sources, implicit knowledge, explicit reasoning, and visualization-based
            outcomes, but also to facilitate the recognition of accuracy in the field. </p>
         <p>The London Chapter (2009) points out that a first way to accomplish this challenge is
            through the publication of a two-dimensional record of the computer-based visualization
            outputs along with the methods used, and the interpretations made [London Chapter 2009].
            However, in this paper we propose to create a web-map were data and interpretations
            embedded during the generation of phased CAD maps for spatiotemporal analysis at Samos
            are also displayed when the online publication is faced. </p>
         <p>This challenge has already been accomplished by a number of research teams in historical
            studies about complex built environments with different purposes and results. Such is
            the case of the “Digitally Encoded Census Information and Mapping Archive” (DECIMA),
            which was designed as a research tool for historians interested in early modern
               Florence.<note> University of Toronto, DECIMA, <ref target="https://decima-map.net/"
                  >https://decima-map.net/</ref>.</note> DECIMA website is an open-access platform.
            In the so-called mapping tool, users can interact with mapped data from three censuses
            of 1551, 1561, and 1563. These are displayed on a historical map of the city from 1584
            georeferenced onto a contemporary one [Pecile 2018]. The design of DECIMA database and
            web platform enables users to display one census data layer or a group of them. As we
            zoom in the map, it is also possible to click on projected points with a cursor and a
            data table with associated census information about residents and properties will be
            displayed. In addition to that, DECIMA offers a data query tool for interactive analysis
            about ownership, shops, occupation, property values, or gender. It has already proved to
            be a powerful analytical tool that, even from simple questions, leads to new
            interpretations and knowledge about the modern Florence, its social conditions and
            relations [Terpstra, Rose 2018]. However, spatial features are simplified in the form of
            dots which is enough for the analysis of human movement or economic activity in the past
            city, but not for the study of the built environment in spatial terms.</p>
         <p>In this sense, another relevant example is the project “Visualizing the Mountain Estate:
            Landscape, Architecture and Experience in Chengde”. Their authors are developing an
            interactive web platform thought and designed as a tool for evolving research and
            discovery in a historical environment.<note> Office of Information, Knowledge and
               Library Services (OIKLS), NTU Singapore. Visualizing the Mountain Estate. Landscape,
               Architecture, and Experience in Chengde, <ref target="https://blogs.ntu.edu.sg/bssz/"
                  >https://blogs.ntu.edu.sg/bssz/</ref>.</note> The project is devoted to study an
            important Qing Dynasty Imperial Park in Chengde (China) that was built in multiple
            phases over the most part the eighteenth century and then deconstructed and
            reconstructed in the following two centuries. To approach how this imperial park was
            conceived, understood and experienced, the web-map of this project visualizes the whole
            built park environment along with its topography and hydrology over a current
            orthophotograph. The platform provides users with a layer control to select the type of
            landscape feature to visualize (buildings, walls, rivers, islands, lakes...). Moreover,
            data can be filtered by structure type, construction data and reign for selected
            display. As we interact with the map, it is also possible to click on each building and
            a pop-up with associated data is opened. Each pop-up shows organized relevant
            information as well as a link to extended textual data and non-textual outputs about the
            selected building to explore the spatial environment at will. This is a work in progress
            and its results are still to come, but the main aim is to enable researchers and users
            to query the database in the future and, by doing so, to address new questions of the
            historical environment through computational analysis and interactive presentation
            [Whiteman et al. 2018]. </p>
         <p>In the particular field of monastic architecture, Wulfman, Mylonas, Loyer, Bonde, and
            Maines developed the MonArch Project website to explore the ways in which complex
            relationships among textual, architectural, and archaeological evidence can be
            represented in non-traditional formats to create a new form of scholarly expression for
            their work about the Abbey of Saint-Jean-des-Vignes in Soissons (France) [Wulfman et at.
            2007]. They realized that archaeological evidence supports and illustrates the textual
            narrative at the same time that the latter contextualizes the archaeology and monastic
            architecture, so they proposed a web infrastructure that allows authors to present their
            arguments and also users of the website to develop their own interpretations around
            monasticism, the abbey’s structures, place, community, and economy based on an
            interactive interface.<note> Brown University, The MonArch Project, <ref
                  target="http://monarch.brown.edu/">http://monarch.brown.edu/</ref>.</note>
         </p>
         <p>This project demonstrates the potential of digital representation in a web-context to
            publish detailed corpora of material findings, to present the spatial dimensions of
            social relationships, and to recover the human actions performed in the past [Bonde et
            al. 2009]. However, in what refers to the presentation and dissemination of the past
            architectural spaces the results are limited. They created an interactive site plan of
            the Romanesque abbey with a time slider and clickable phases showing some evidence
            options for that period, but the user is not able to directly interact with each spatial
            element or to have access to historical or excavated data from the visual argument, so
            the exploratory possibilities are somehow restricted as well as the provision of
            information to understand the nature of evidence and hypothesis.</p>
         <p>Another promising project is an in-process collaborative platform, called SIG 4D,
            presented by Rollier-Hanselmann, Petty, Mazuir, Faucher, and Coulais for the case study
            of Cluny Abbey (France), considered the greatest building of European Christendom in the
            12th century [Rollier-Hanselmann et al. 2014]. By using the TerraExplorer Pro software,
            they try to integrate 2D maps and 3D models created from historical data and
            archaeological excavations into one single GIS database and research system. Their aim
            is to offer scholars a digital tool for research analysis, where the access to disparate
            data is possible as well as its comparison to better understand the Cluniac site. The
            project is focused on studying the relationship between the abbey and the surrounding
            landscape through the hybrid nature of the archaeological artefacts. For this purpose,
            they argue that it is essential the collaboration and the combination of data coming
            from different disciplines. In the digital realm, the authors also recognize that the
            diversity of data and its integration in a single geographic system bring technical
            difficulties they still have to solve. Web-mapping and online dissemination of the SIG
            4D seem to be additional aims as they presented in the project workflow
            [Rollier-Hanselmann et. al 2014, 174], but no access to the system is accessible
            yet.</p>
         <p>The third and last case study that this state of the art comprises is the Sera project,
            led by José Ignacio Cabezón [Budapesti 2019, 28-29].<note> The Tibetan &amp; Himalayan
               Library, Sera Monastery, <ref target="https://www.thlib.org/places/monasteries/sera/"
                  >https://www.thlib.org/places/monasteries/sera/</ref>
            </note> It is focused on Sera, one of the largest and most important monasteries in the
            Tibetan world. Cabezón created a multimedia, interactive database that allows users to
            explore different aspects of Sera: its physical layout, history, material culture,
            educational system, and ritual life that, on the whole, defined what he called the
            richness and complexity of Tibetan monastic life.<note> Cabezón, J. I., “Sera Monastery
               Project Overview”, <ref

            </note> The project includes a section devoted to the physical space of the monastery.
            Sera buildings are classified according to their form into: compounds, complexes, or
            freestanding structures.<note> Cabezón, J. I., “The Space of Sera (Se ra’i khor yug)”,
                  <ref

            </note> A compound is said to be an enclosure, that is, a single building or a group of
            adjoining buildings with an interior courtyard, such as the main regional houses,
            apartments, or lama residences. A complex is a group of buildings that share some kind
            of association, but no necessarily adjoining and enclosed. Freestanding buildings are
            single structures with no association to nearby ones and with no perimeter wall. </p>
         <p>The architecture of Sera is represented in an interactive web-map.<note> The Tibetan
               &amp; Himalayan Library, Sera Interactive Map, <ref

                  >https://www.thlib.org/places/monasteries/sera/spaces/map/</ref>
            </note> They gathered data of mayor structures within the monastery, images, GPS
            readings, and field notes during a field trip that, later on, were the foundation to
            develop an image catalogue and the narrative descriptions of each building, compound,
            and complex of the monastery. Then, they created a digital map of the monastic site
            using a GIS software that was finally converted into a web-deliverable, flash map of the
            monastic architecture. The map is said to integrated the narrative descriptions and the
            image database, however it is no longer working after Adobe Flash Player was retired in
            2020. This is also what happened with the MonArch Project website.<note> Brown
               University, The MonArch Project, <ref target="http://monarch.brown.edu/site"

         </p>
         <p>The previous examples demonstrate the potentials of a web-map, not only as a means to
            access and showcase a project, but also as a research tool that allows public to
            explore, interpret, and analyze data in the wholeness of each case study, to pose novel
            questions, and to create new ways to engage with and gain knowledge about historical
            built environments. They also illustrate different ways to address the representation of
            architectural space and spatiotemporal analysis in a web context mainly from
            archaeological excavations and historical data. Different software tools were used in
            each case study in accordance with data and purposes of analysis, but also depending on
            funding. Moreover, while web-maps of DECIMA and Mountain Estate are fully functional,
            the MonArch and Sera Projects are deprecated and the SIG 4D for Cluny Abbey seems to be
            a desktop system on the way to being transformed into a web-map. A common concern in
            these projects is looking for new forms of publication in what refers to 2D maps that,
            first, enables interaction with different source of data, and secondly, aims to open new
            paths for query and exploration (Figure 6). </p>
         <p>The four examples are efforts to build increasingly more complex maps of visible and
            invisible aspects of a place. They aspire to be more-than-representational and they put
            emphasis on one particular user interaction: exploration. Anyone who approaches these
            maps is given various possible paths to “dive within” them and explore different
            questions. We argue that they are attempts to move towards more integrated spatial
            frameworks for research while they also illustrate some challenges and potentials of
            what has recently emerged as deep mapping practices in the field of Spatial Humanities
            [Bodenhamer 2010] [Bodenhamer et al. 2013] [Bodenhamer et al. 2015] [Murrieta-Flores,
            Martins 2019] [Roberts 2016].<note> This brief historiographic context related to deep
               mapping was added to the paper based on the suggestions provided by reviewers to
               which we want to express our gratitude for their constructive thoughts. Deep maps or
               deep mapping are not terms we have found ourselves using to any great extent in
               Digital Samos work to date, but we have certainly identified some common threads in
               recommended literature to which our web-map is in conversation with.</note>
         </p>
         <p>Although there is no scholarly consensus on what deep mapping entails as a practice or
            what a deep map is as a product [Earley-Spadoni 2016, 96] [Roberts 2016], the four
            previous examples do aim to “record and represent the grain and patina of place through
            juxtapositions and interpretations of the historical and the contemporary… the
            conflation of oral testimony, anthology, memoir, biography, natural history and
            everything (their authors) might ever want to say about a place” [Pearson, Shanks 2001,
            64-65]. They are not simply digital maps, but “subtle and multilayered views of small
            area(s) of the earth” [Bodenhamer 2010, 27] [Bodenhamer et al. 2013, 174] that take
            advantage of the digital tools to comprise layers of meaning and process and to develop
            routes for new forms of spatial narratives. They are also “shaped by a particular
            scholarly vision but offering an open-ended, exploratory environment” that is only
            limited by available data, framework design, query tools, and the end user’s critical
            eye, knowledge, and imagination [Ridge 2013, 177].</p>
         <p>They allow us to set the goals of the interactive web-map for our Digital Samos project
            in accordance with our research questions. First, through the web-map we aimed to make
            the spatiotemporal analysis of the monastic site at Samos accessible to a broader
            audience. Besides, we considered important to allow interaction between the user and the
            platform, not only as a way to engage new audiences, but also to enable them to learn
            about this historical site at its own pace. Another goal was to make readable the
            relations between sources upon which the research was built and any project output in
            order to create a reliable web environment, where intellectual integrity is guaranteed.
            In addition, we prioritized a fully functional result in what refers to the final
            representation of change over time in the web context. To achieve a detailed web-display
            of spatial features was considered a high issue along with their embedded data and
            topographical context, instead of a simplification of the original geometries into
            points, or ideal shapes. This implies a series of difficulties from a technical
            perspective, as we will explain in the following section. </p>
         <p>Digital Samos is in conversation with many concerns in literature about deep mapping, as
            not only aspires to delineate and give shape to the locational properties of a
            particular monastic place. It also tries to go deep in the horizontal surface and to
            embrace the verticality of spatiotemporal analysis along with multimedial navigability
            for critical reflection and open-ended exploration [Bodenhamer 2010, 26-29] [Ridge 2013,
            178] [Roberts 2016, 3]. By going deeper there are more layers we discover and Digital
            Samos aims to give an answer to how we can hold them all together, that is, how we can
            frame them as a map, as deep mappers seek [Roberts 2016, 3]. All in all, the web-map of
            Digital Samos aims to renew the interest in the monastic past realm through
            accessibility and dissemination, interaction and public engagement, transparency and
            rigorousness, all of which is inside an integral platform, a new research tool to
            further our knowledge about this site in its intactness by means of interactive visual
            presentation and interpretation. </p>
         <p>From fixed CAD to an integral web-map </p>
         <p>The next step of the process was to deal with how to make all these goals possible. This
            was not only a technical challenge and an experiment in a new way of communicating this
            project about monastic architecture, urban history and landscape, but it was also an
            iterative process of thinking and learning through web development in an intellectual
            way. This is what we aim to explain next.</p>
         <p>To understand the process of making the integral web-map demands, first, to remind that
            the project has a conceptual focus on space and on its dynamic transformation over time.
            Therefore, space and time are two key factors to be represented in our web-based
            environment. All maps and models previously generated in the project visualize
            spatiotemporal changes by using computer-aided design (CAD) technologies. Therefore, the
            first step was to explore how it might be possible to turn the existing visualizations
            of past spaces into a web-map that meets all the goals set before.</p>
         <p>A first way to approach this challenge could be to generate one image per each phase of
            the evolving monastic complex and to display all of them in a website created with a
            content management system (CMS), even in relation with a timeline. When a map or plan is
            displayed in a website as a fixed image or as a series of images showed in chronological
            order, they do not usually have associated data to each feature represented, beyond the
            one we may add manually through embedded external hyperlinks, for instance. In addition
            to that, if we showed maps or architectural plans in this way, they would not be
            georeferenced either. As a result, the historical site would not dialogue with current
            physical realm. We would not enable audience to interpret and understand the relations
            between present and past monastic compounds by looking at both at the same time. These
            were some of the limits that early attempts in the sphere of website representation of
            urban history projects dealt with, lack of geo-referencing and accuracy of dependency
            relationships between documentation and visualizations, weak user interaction options,
            and short-term sustainability [Cardesín Díaz 2018].</p>
         <p>Our aim is to push the concept of CAD maps that revealed the complexity of spatial
            changes over time by means of phased representations much further, toward a more
            integral and effective interface (Figure 7). We considered creating a digital and
            interactive two-dimensional map to portray spatial changes over time in permanent
            relationship with: previous and following realms, the present monastic complex, research
            sources, and extant physical remains. For the first attempt, we left the incorporation
            of the existing three-dimensional models pending for a future scale-up of the project.
            Although the sense of space provided by a two-dimensional map is limited, it is
            generally best to start simple and expand the project in following developments. As for
            time, the aforementioned two-dimensional web-map in the singular was conceived,
            actually, as many maps overlapped. Each one will represent a main phase of the process
            of changes at San Julián de Samos over time. We aimed that the multiple maps might be
            displayed or hidden by the user at will as a way to explore and discover spatial changes
            and relations between them in the interaction. In order to simplify the process of
            making, we also selected the most relevant stages to be represented. For that reason,
            each stage would be an abstraction that does not visualized changes on a short-term time
            basis. Although we are aware that the analytical nature of the project showed is reduced
            with this decision, to increase the number of stages will be possible and easier in
            future developments of the web-map, after learning how to face the whole process for a
            lower number of them.</p>
         <p>Each single spatial feature in our existing phased maps and models shapes a building, a
            property, a road, or any other part of the monastic built environment in the past
            according to historical sources and current physical remains. We always try to show how
            it actually was. When sources or remains are scarce, ambiguous or even non-extant,
            hypotheses had to be developed by forcing a dialogue between available evidence. The
            hypothetical parts of our maps were made visible by means of color-coded lines. However,
            connections between spatial features and historical documentation or physical remains
            that supported the reconstruction were missing in the definite maps and models. The
            reason was that the software application used to generate them, AutoCAD. When this
            project started, this CAD program did not offer the possibility to associate non-spatial
            information to each spatial feature. In other words, there were no attributes appended
            to features displayed in our maps and models, although all of them were classified in
            layers according to their type, the level of knowledge and the source. However,
            historical data that supported the reconstructions was not readable within the 2D or 3D
            graphic outputs, unlike text-based research findings where we can quote any reference to
            a book or an archival document, for instance, by embedding its text directly in our
            written argument [McClure, Worthey 2019]. This sort of quotation would be fundamental to
            create a transparent and rigorous visual output, where integrity is ensured, as we
            previously pointed [Hatchwell et al. 2019]. It would also end up in the creation of
            self-explanatory digital maps and models about historical sites opened to scientific
            evaluation, again like research scholarship in the form of text [Münster et al.
            2018].</p>
         <p>With all this in mind, the next step towards the web-map was to resort to a geographic
            information system (GIS). They are designed to store, manage, analyze, and display
            spatial data, either past or present. In research about historical built environments
            and urban history, GIS has already been proved as a powerful tool to track and analyze
            changes in time. Historical maps created with GIS have many potentials: to define
            shapes, to create layers, to assign attributes to those shapes and layers, to represent
            the passage of time to some extent, and to use visualization as a means of inquiry, both
            in desktop and online applications [Camerlenghi, Schelbert 2018]. In particular, we
            decided to use QGIS, a free and open source geographic information system.</p>
         <p>At this point, the following question could arise: why not simply use a GIS system since
            the very beginning? This is a question that often appears in the discussions about the
            best approach to historical 2D/3D drawing, mapping and modelling of past architectural
            spaces. The short answer is that computer-aided design (CAD) and drafting applications
            (e.g. AutoCAD) and 3D computer graphics software (e.g. Blender, 3D max) offers much more
            degree of freedom with regards to freehand design and 3D modelling that is not possible
            in GIS or in HBIM [Lanjouw 2021] [Boeykens 2018, 72-75]. CAD tools and 3D graphics
            software better allow the process of reasoning or intellectual representation that is
            needed for the understanding and rigor reconstruction of complex past architectures. For
            instance, they enable the scholar to properly describe the actual irregularities of
            historical complex built environments, which are much more difficult to be represented
            with GIS or HBIM applications [Lanjouw 2021] [Boeykens 2018, 72-75]. On the contrary,
            GIS, as well as HBIM software, do integrate various types of data, so vector features
            may have associated datasheets with historical information that can be finally turned
            into web-maps.</p>
         <p>To move the project from AutoCAD to QGIS was not an immediate process. We had to adapt
            the existing CAD files to a new program and way of working within it, along with
            continuous thoughts regarding how to improve the representation of spatiotemporal
            changes in a new web-based context as well as how to manage and structure textual data
            and spatial features in accordance with the proposed aims (Figure 8).</p>
         <p>The first step was to geo-reference the CAD files so in the web output they will be
            displayed in relation with present cartography. The following step was to turn CAD files
            into shapefiles (SHP) to be readable by QGIS.<note> GISConvert, <ref
                  target="https://www.gisconvert.com/">https://www.gisconvert.com/</ref>. There are
               also QGIS plug-ins to insert topographic lines from CAD to QGIS, as well as
               information related to natural resources as rivers. Both topography and natural
               resources at each stage of the monastic site evolution represent the historical
               compound that is not exactly the same as the present one. </note> This was not a
            direct step. Each map generated with CAD represents one phase of the monastic site’s
            biography through multiple overlapped layers. Each layer comprises diverse types of
            geometries: lines, circles, polylines, points... and each geometry might represent a
            single spatial feature or just one part of it. This is an important issue to clearly
            distinguished, for instance, between remains and hypothesis by using CAD tools. In QGIS
            each SHP file or layer of the project is only able to comprised one type of geometry:
            points, lines, or polygons. This difference between both programs forced the creation of
            a series of individual CAD files to later represent each stage of the monastic site at a
            distinct moment in time within QGIS. Each of them only comprises one type of geometry
            readable in QGIS. For instance, in the case of the CAD map that represented the monastic
            site from the twelfth century to the fifteenth century, we generated nine CAD files that
            were converted into SHP files in a following step: “contour_lines” (lines),
            “guest_house” (polygons), “Romanesque_church” (polygons), “Romanesque_cloister”
            (polygons), “Chapel_of_the_Cypress” (polygons), “hospital” (polygons), “roads”
            (polygons), “rivers_1” (polygons), “rivers_2” (lines).</p>
         <p>However, this initial division of each phased CAD map into multiple layers prior to
            their conversion into SHP files was not only due to one technical reason. It also
            resulted from thinking about: what type of historical information supported each graphic
            reconstruction; how we aimed to structure it; and in which way spatial features should
            be visualized to ensure a clear and friendly understanding, interpretation, and
            evaluation of the final interface by users. To find a proper answer to all these
            questions was the result of an iterative process of thinking, making, checking the
            results and moving the process forwards or backwards to test other ways of making
            through all of which we learnt and advanced the project.</p>
         <p>For instance, the files called “contour_lines” and “rivers_2” in the group of SHP files
            of the monastic site from the twelve to the fifteenth centuries only comprise one type
            of geometry: lines. Therefore, the initial thought could be to merge them in a single
            file if we only consider it as a technical issue. However, if we also reflect about how
            they should be displayed for an easy visual understanding by means of color-coded lines
            and fills, the separation between the two files is needed.</p>
         <p>The layers called “Romanesque_church” and “Romanesque_cloister” could also perfectly be
            within a single SHP file called “monastic_buildings” along with the QGIS layers of
            “guest_house”, “Chapel_of_the_Cypress” and “hospital”. All of them just comprise one
            type of geometry (polygons). Besides, the attribute table with information on spatial
            features of the layer can be organized with the same structure, as they are all under
            the consideration of monastic buildings. However, if we think about how to display the
            question of change over time in the web-based map without forgetting the diverse
            evolving nature of each monastic building, we come to the conclusion that their
            separation is also needed for an integral and legible visual reading and understanding
            of the resulting interface. Although it is possible to assign diverse attributes to each
            spatial feature within the same layer, we cannot follow the same path in what refers to
            their visualization yet, as the styling options (color, fill, type of line...) of a
            vector layer will be applied to all its spatial features.</p>
         <p>To go in depth in this issue, the next example is a reflection about how to best
            represent a historical fact with spatial consequences, which is the fire of 1534 in the
            Romanesque cloister, in the web-map. It affected one part of the monastic complex and
            monks decided to rebuild it immediately. Based on sources, the shape of the spatial
            feature was not altered. So to visualize it by means of changes of shape in a
            two-dimensional representation is not possible. To make easier the legibility of this
            change in the period corresponding to the monastic site in the first half of the
            sixteenth century beyond the addition of a textual annotation, the cloister is
            represented by a different line-coded polygon. As a result, one historical fact with
            architectural consequences is somehow made visible to the observer (Figure 9).</p>
         <p>After the first four groups of layers called “The Place”, “Pre-twelve century”, “From
            twelve to fifteenth centuries” and “First half of the sixteenth century” were created
            and georeferenced onto a contemporary cartography in QGIS,<note> National Air
               Orthophotography Programme (PNOA). Spanish National Geographic Institute (IGN), <ref
                  target="https://www.ign.es/iberpix2/visor/"
                  >https://www.ign.es/iberpix2/visor/</ref>.</note> the following step was to learn
            how this simple GIS map could be turned into a web-map. For this purpose, we made some
            trials with two QGIS plug-ins: QGIS Cloud Free and QGIS2WEB. The first plug-in was
            tested in QGIS 3.4. The free application is presented as a web-GIS platform for
            publishing unlimited public maps and data on the internet for non-commercial and
            non-government uses, but with storage for their databases limited up to 50Mb.<note> QGIS
               Cloud Plans, <ref target="https://qgiscloud.com/en/pages/plans"
                  >https://qgiscloud.com/en/pages/plans</ref>.</note> The process to create and
            publish a QGIS project is quite easy by taking just a few steps.<note> Sourcepole AG,
               QGIS Cloud, <ref target="https://qgiscloud.com/en/pages/quickstart"
                  >https://qgiscloud.com/en/pages/quickstart</ref>.</note> However, the trials made
            with our databases were not fulfilling as the plug-in worked unstable in the latest
            release of QGIS, as the QGIS Cloud Support Team confirmed. Besides, we soon realized
            that the storage limit of 50Mb to upload the local database of our maps in QGIS Cloud
            Free would not be enough once we have created the missing groups of layers.</p>
         <p>In regards to QGIS2WEB, it also enables users to create an OpenLayers/Leaflet web-map
            from a QGIS project, but this is not automatically published in an online platform, as
            it happens with QGIS Cloud. In other words, we can generate the HTML, CSS and JavaScript
            files that defined the web-map with QGIS2WEB, but then we need a web hosting to release
            it. Trials carried out with this plug-in allowed us to create a simple interactive map
            in a quick way. It is possible to set what layers or group of layers will be visible or
            hidden in the web-map as well as to select the base-map onto which they will be
            georeferenced. We can also add a series of tools for user’s interactivity, such a scale
            and zoom, an address search for locations, a layers list, a measure tool, the option to
            highlight features, and to show pop-ups when mouse hovers over features.<note> Morales
               A. “Publica tus mapas en la web con qgis2web”, <ref
                  target="https://mappinggis.com/2016/03/crea-aplicaciones-webmapping-con-qgis/"
                  >https://mappinggis.com/2016/03/crea-aplicaciones-webmapping-con-qgis/</ref>.</note>
            However, we also checked that QGIS2WEB did not represent all the spatial features
            defined in our QGIS project and, above all, it has many limitations to control and
            customize the resulting web-map according to the project requirements, unless we
            manually enhance the basic template generated by the plug-in (Figure 10).</p>
         <p>In any case, the exploration of these two ways to create a web-map from a QGIS project
            led us to learn about Leaflet. Leaflet is one of the two powerful web-mapping libraries
            used by QGIS2WEB developers. It is an open-source JavaScript library designed to create
            friendly interactive maps that work efficiently in all major desktop and mobile
               platforms.<note> Agafonkin V. “Leaflet: an open-source JavaScript library for
               mobile-friendly interactive maps”, <ref target="https://leafletjs.com/"
                  >https://leafletjs.com/</ref>.</note> Leaflet API is said to be simple to read and
            easy to use even for beginner JavaScript developers. It is well-documented in its
            website, where we also found tutorials to get started with Leaflet basics as well as
            lots of plug-ins to extend its functionalities.</p>
         <p>Another relevant feature of Leaflet is that we can create a web-map from map vectors
            defined by GeoJSON objects.<note> Leaflet. “Using GeoJSON with Leaflet”, <ref
                  target="https://leafletjs.com/examples/geojson/"
                  >https://leafletjs.com/examples/geojson/</ref>.</note> GeoJSON is a JSON format
            that encodes a geometry (one geographical feature) or a collection of geometries by
            defining their coordinates along with their non-spatial attributes [Crickard 2014,
            41-44]. The features include points, line strings, polygons, and multipart collections
            of these types (multi-points, multi-line strings, and multi-polygons). The non-spatial
            attributes are similar to the attribute table with textual information associated to a
            layer in QGIS.</p>
         <p>For several months, the in-process work of Digital Samos was focused on learning how to
            use Leaflet and what potentials it offers for the interactive map of the monastic site
            at Samos. In addition to that, the in-process work revealed that if we aimed to meet all
            the aforementioned goals for free, we would need to design a custom-built platform; that
            is, a manually coded web-map (Figure 11). Otherwise, its future capabilities would be
            limited. However, making the decision of custom-designing the website to display our
            research involves dealing with a series of challenges that we also discovered in the
            in-process work. </p>
         <p>Struggling with integrity of visual and textual data in web-mapping: challenges and
            opportunities</p>
         <p>The web-map of Digital Samos is hosted by the Universidade da Coruña, as a way to
            guarantee its future sustainability in addition to a custom-design solution (Figure 12).
            Its code is written with three programming languages: HTML, CSS and JavaScript. HTML
            provides a means to create the structure of the website: the main sections and their
            content. The interactive web-map was created with Leaflet, which is a JavaScript mapping
            library, as we previously said. CSS was used for describing the presentation of the HTML
            structure and the interactive map; that is, its layout or graphic design (format, fonts,
            style, colors...). </p>
         <p>In the present article, we are not going to explain how we developed the code for the
            interactive web-map, but we will reflect about the functionalities implemented in the
            web-based map to meet our goals, some of the problems we faced in the process, a
            critical evaluation of the current solutions and some thoughts about what things we had
            left out in this first cut of the web presence and how we aim to move it forward in the
            future. </p>
         <p>The interactive web-map layout is divided into two main parts. The left one is devoted
            to long-form textual narrative. The spatial data is showcased in the right container.
            The latter is much wider as a way to visually highlight the focus of the project on
            spatiotemporal changes by using digital representation. When we open the interactive map
            we find a short, but needed explanation about how to use it in the left side, and the
            empty topography and hydrology of the place we study is shown on the right part.</p>
         <p>The very first functionality of the map is the layers control in its upper right side
            (Figure 13). It is opened or closed if we move the mouse over it. It comprises two
            groups of layers. The first one displays the sub-web-maps that visualize each stage of
            the monastic site evolution in chronological order. The second group, separated by a
            grey line, is composed of the base-maps used to geo-reference the previous layers. None
            of the layers are displayed by default, so if we want to start our exploration of the
            map, we have to click the radio button corresponding to one of them. In brief, this is
            explained in the non-textual left container of the map, where we recommend beginning the
            exploration by clicking on the first layer called “The Place”. If we do so, the area
            where the monastery was built is visualized in a two-dimensional representation in the
            website. We can learn about it if we scroll the textual narrative to the section with
            the same title. The platform always tries to make it easy, but subtle, to follow the
            recommended exploration by representing the same structure in the layers control and in
            the sections of the narrative left trail. These first features give user freedom to
            explore the web-based spatial environment at will, but it also provides a clear and
            simple path through the spatial and data content by the addition of an accompanying
            textual narrative. In a future development, we aim to create one-to-one connections
            between the name of each layer within the layers control and the narrative section by
            the same name, so whether you click on one or the other, both textual and non-textual
            parts of the web-map will be displayed at the same time. This way integrity and
            legibility will be enhanced.</p>
         <p>Another functionality of the present platform is that we can always display a phased map
            of the monastic site onto the current cartography due to the addition of two base-maps:
            Google Satellite and Google Street View. This way, the website enables users to
            visualize any re-created past realm of the monastery, the village and their context in
            relation with the present built environment (Figure 14). We can discover what artefacts
            are preserved, altered or lost, for instance, by means of visual comparison. We think it
            would be also an effective tool to better understand the spatial changes between
            consecutive time periods if we could visualize two or more phased web-maps at the same
            time. However, the basic layers control of Leaflet just comprises two groups of layers:
            layers within the first group are displayed one by one, but layers of the second group

            a number of phased web-maps would of course be essential to make clearer the spatial
            change over time to human eye. This could be done by means of a multi-mode viewer that
            allows user to study overlapped transparent layers or synchronized multiple side-by-side
            maps [Henel 2019].<note> See, for example: Institut Cartogràfic i Geològic de Catalunya.

         <p>All previous features give an answer to how to represent space and time in a web-based
            environment, by starting simple with a two-dimensional map that we aim to expand to a
            three-dimensional model integrated in the platform somehow in the future. For now, we
            show what was where and when. This is the basic spatiotemporal knowledge for any
            historical exploration of the past monastic site. Each layer of the web-map is defined
            by discrete, measurable elements that represent the space, the answer to what was where
            and how the different elements were related to each other. However, we also pointed out
            previously that we aimed to create a self-explanatory web-map through the integration of
            historical non-textual data within the two-dimensional context in order to ensure
            transparency, legibility and evaluation.</p>
         <p>For this purpose, we implemented functionalities of highlighting features and pop-up
            windows. When the user hovers the cursor on the map, most of its spatial features change
            their color. It means that they have assigned attributes with embedded historical data
            to display and explore by clicking on a particular highlighted object. These one-to-one
            connections aim to extend the interaction between user and the map as well as to create
            an integrated platform. Pop-up windows were designed to not obscure the visibility of
            the underlying map by means of transparent backgrounds when they are opened. This way,
            not only do they favor the integration of textual data within the map with immediacy,
            but they also ensure a permanent vision of the spatial feature within its context.</p>
         <p>In this part of the in-process work, we ruminated on what textual information should be
            showed and how to structure it at length. So far we have created three main different
            types of pop-ups. The first type is used in the case of spatial features such as roads,
            rivers, bridges, dams and the hypothetical area of the first monastic settlement (Figure
            15). Historical data about them is scarce, so the pop-up window is designed to only
            display the name of the feature.</p>
         <p>The second type of pop-up window was defined for monastic buildings (Figure 16). In
            their current layout, data is displayed starting with the name of the building. Next we
            show the main art history style period and the construction date, if known. We also
            indicate whether the selected entity is extant or not currently. We gathered references
            to events that caused spatial changes in the period visualized, such as a fire, an
            ongoing reconstruction... As the present layers embrace long-term time periods, we
            considered it relevant to highlight what spatial changes were taking place at the moment
            and why, beyond the knowledge we gain through the spatial feature that recreates them.
            Finally, there is a hyperlink called “View more”. The creation of this linked
            information is still a work in progress, but the idea is, when clicked, user could
            extend their knowledge through: detailed maps of the selected building,
            three-dimensional models to be able to experience the space, access to historical and
            contemporary photographs, brief historical descriptions... all of which expand the
            understanding and analysis of the question of change over time.</p>
         <p>The third main type of pop-up window was created for the spatial features that represent
            farming properties and residential plots located in the surroundings of the monastery
            and in the village (Figure 17). It is the most complex pop-up as data come from very
            disparate sources in each time period, among which we find or not the name of the
            property, the name of the owner, the name of the tenant or subtenant, their jobs, the
            location, the tenancy year, the holding type, etc. As for now, the third type of pop-up
            is actually designed with four possible displays that better structure and show data
            related to farming and residential plots in accordance with the most relevant historical
            documents in four of the seven phases already represented in the platform. Each pop-up
            is a rich subset of data that comes mainly from two types of archival documentation:
            rental agreements and books of demarcations from the sixteenth and seventeenth
            centuries. We can find up to twenty different variables displayed in the third type of
            pop-ups. We tried to structure historical information in a similar order to enable the
            integration of web tools for spatial data query and analysis within the platform in the
            future. For instance, simple questions regarding the names of tenants or the rents of
            their properties face with tools that read multiple data sets at a time might reveal new
            insights into the evolving nature of the monastic site and its human and socioeconomic
            history.</p>
         <p>Last but not least, although we can learn about what artefacts in the historical site/s
            are extant today through the information gathered in the pop-ups, the web-map in its
            current form does not provide, we admit, a clear but needed graphic distinction between
            evidence and hypothesis, or even between different levels of probability regarding the
            recreation of lost built entities or plot tissues. To overcome this weak point in terms
            of an accurate communication of the visual outcome, one solution would be to use
            color-coded lines as we previously created for the CAD maps. In the present form of our
            web-based environment, graphic design already contributes to convey conceptual issues
            regarding spatial changes, for instance, through different types of lines to distinguish
            between ended monastic buildings (solid lines) and works in progress (dash lines) within
            each phase. In future developments, we will go on working in the map layer styling as it
            impacts visual analysis and, therefore, it is an essential and constant consideration
            for producing web-maps both for individual and public viewing.</p>
         <p>Conclusions</p>
         <p>This article introduced the Digital Samos interactive web-map, an online 2D
            representation of spatiotemporal changes implemented for one of the largest and most
            ancient monastic sites in Spain, San Julián de Samos. Digital Samos web-map was first
            released in late April 2019 and it offers fully functional access to six main stages of
            the site’s biography: the empty place prior to the foundation of the monastery; the
            monastic settlement before the 12th century; the monastery of the Late Middle Age; the
            transformations of the monastic site in the first half of the 16th century along with
            the formation of the nearby Samos village; the spatial changes that took place in the
            second half of the same century; and its ending in the early 17th century. In November
            2019 we added a new spatiotemporal layer, the one corresponding to the first steps
            towards the mayor transformation of the monastic site from the late 17th century that
            were not completed until the 18th century. The latter is still pending to be added to
            the interactive map, as well as the complex monastic compound of the early 19th century
            prior to secularization.</p>
         <p>Unlike existing web-map displays for monastic architecture, the Digital Samos prototype
            addresses an open representation of past compounds without compromising interaction with
            each feature, the accuracy of geometries and the integration of historical data in the
            web output. We offer a practical solution to create a self-explanatory or
            “self-speaking” virtual product due to the integration of both visual (graphic) and
            textual (written) data that complement each other in a novel and friendly digital
            environment. We show a way to overcome some limitations of fixed images for the
            interpretation and presentation of research outcomes in urban and architectural
            historical studies in and outside academia. We make use of the potentials of digital
            vectorised maps that may inspire others to dream big by working gradually with spatial
            and temporal data in the study of built environments that, like this web-map, were not
            built in a day. </p>
         <p>The present article documents the project workflow, pitfalls and challenges to convert
            two separate initial research outputs (vector maps/plans) and historical data into one
            integral virtual product for presentation and dissemination of our spatiotemporal
            analysis in the field of architectural history where not only buildings, but also
            topography, geographical features and monasticism history play a role that is visualized
            in the web context. </p>
         <p>The process reveals some technical challenges for non-technical backgrounds as well as
            some needed improvements to be implemented in future development. We tried to
            communicate both effectively from the particular subdomain of architectural history
            research in and through web technology. We situated our argument within a broader
            context of research and we included explanations of the significance of our web-map in a
            way that could be easily applied in other case studies. We also offer a cost-effective
            and sustainable solution to overcome limitations caused by the lack of funding or the
            use of specific commercial software that may affect the continuation of digital projects
            over time, its evolution towards new stages, or the possibility to involve specialists
            with technical backgrounds. </p>
         <p>Digital Samos is woven with some common threads and complex requirements that are under
            consideration in the wider discussions and debates around deep maps. It develops a
            multilayer and multi-scalar spatial structure for a view of a particular monastic area
            that is meant to be “visual, time-based and open-ended” [Bodenhamer et al. 2013, 174].
            It is designed as an exploratory environment where scholars and public alike might gain
            knowledge through the exploration of a particular place or pursue their own questions
            [Ridge 2013, 177]. It has a capacity for thick expert description that might be unstable
            and changing in response to new data or insights [Bodenhamer 2010, 27] [Roberts 2016,
            5]. It also embraces the spatiotemporal contingent to incorporate time into analyses
            that are spatially contextualized [Bodenhamer et al. 2013, 172] [Roberts 2016, 5]. It
            calls into the question the primacy of texts as the foundation of knowledge by taking
            advantage of the potential of technology and it walks towards an alternative
            construction of spatial narratives that embraces complexity, multiplicity, and
            simultaneity [Bodenhamer 2010, 28-29]. During the process of constructing this
            prototype, we can learn and understand what works best in this new arena and make the
            most of thinking through making. The case study offered identifies a gap in the way
            spatial change over time in complex built environments is approached and disseminated in
            academia, and it proposes a solution that might help unravelling or getting at least a
            better understanding of a complex monastic site. With this approach we are able to
            integrate the complexity of the spatial transformations over time at San Julián de
            Samos, allowing us to present and make readable the large variety of information and
            interpretation the research contained, through explorable layers of meaning and process
            that lead to new forms of spatial narratives in a web context. In sum, it is another
            effort to move forward a more integrated spatial framework for humanities research as
            literature about deep mapping demands [Bodenhamer et al. 2013, 175]. </p>
         <p>Through the work we present in this article, its open-ended results, the challenges we
            posed and the opportunities we approach, we hope to contribute, both conceptually and
            technically, to move forward the application of web-mapping tools in urban history and
            architectural history for a better understanding, presentation and dissemination of
            complex built environments. We expect this web-map to favor the engagement of a broader
            audience in and out academia through its attractive, clear and integrated appearance
            that, undoubtedly, makes visible to the observer eyes the complexity of one monastic
            built environment while it changed over time. We think it opens new possibilities for
            publication of visual research beyond traditional raster graphics that, on the whole,
            aims to no longer be considered just a visual demonstration or end visual product, but
            essential pieces of the research arguments themselves.</p>
