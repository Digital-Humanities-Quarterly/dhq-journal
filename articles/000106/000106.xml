            <p>Does digital pedagogy have to be electronic? This paper grows out of a sense that
               digital pedagogy is too frequently conceived in terms of instructional technologies.
               Technology, at least in its electrified forms, can be a limiting factor in imagining
               how humanities instruction can be <soCalled>digital</soCalled>: something to get your
               hands on, to deal with in dynamic units, to manipulate creatively. What might an
               electronically-enabled pedagogy look like if we pulled the plug? This paper surveys
               several examples to suggest that an unplugged digital humanities pedagogy can be just
               as productively disorienting as doing humanities digitally, and can potentially help
               students prepare for and contextualize their learning experiences with instructional
               technologies or in online environments.</p>

            <p>Amid the ongoing debates about theorists, practitioners, and pretenders, we can look
               to the classroom for an important lesson: to be a digital humanist, you don’t even
               need a computer.</p>

            <head>Hacking the Yacking</head>
            <p>What does it mean to do digital humanities? To be a digital humanist? Whatever it
               means, it potentially puts one in a newly advantageous professional position, able to
               make a claim on the relatively conspicuous resources devoted to digital humanities in
               a time of scarcity. The buzz factor and professional incentives are drawing new
               attention to and participation in the DH community. Partly as a result, DH has
               reached the inevitable if unpleasant stage of authenticity arguments <ptr target="#kirschenbaum2010a"/>, <ptr target="#waltzer2010"/>. Debates about what
               defines and qualifies digital humanism periodically flare, with opinions spread along
               a spectrum from <soCalled>Big Tent</soCalled> inclusivity (come one, come
               all) to code or computational exceptionalism (<q>more hacking, less
                  yacking</q>). The root questions themselves are not new; digital humanities
               sometimes seems to exist only in a state of self-definition, which ironically may be
               one of its strengths as a historiography of contemporary humanities knowledge work.
               But what is new are the concerns about the relative status of insider/outsider or
               theorist/practitioner, running in parallel to recent concerns about alternative
               academic employment (#alt-ac) and professorial jobs <ptr target="#nowviskie2010a"/>,
               digital scholarship and peer review <ptr target="#fitzpatrick2009"/>, and the
               relations of librarians and researchers <ptr target="#ramsay2010a"/>. What follows is
               a small provocation concerning these debates: DH is not the exclusive domain of
               theorists or practitioners. To be a digital humanist, you don’t even need a
               computer.</p>
            <p>Jerome McGann does not especially like computers. Or so he confessed one day to his
               surprised employees (myself included) at the <title rend="italic">Rossetti
                  Archive</title>. They just happened to be the interpretive machines capable of
               carrying out his current intellectual projects, or opening those projects to
               questions he had yet to imagine. That archive has a significant place in the
               evolution of the digital humanities, but can the same be true more generally for the
               field? Is it possible to speak of the digital humanities, as it becomes more broadly
               construed, without computers? Without electronics? Humanities computing, for its
               part, seems hard-wired to computers by definition. And some of the most interesting
               questions and opportunities of the digital humanities are inconceivable without the
               media environments which facilitate or reveal them. In other words, you cannot even
               imagine the work you can do before you’ve invented or experienced the tools or the
               social dynamics they enable. On the other hand, it may be worth trying, precisely
               because of the felicitous disorientation that characterizes the digital humanities in
               the first place: its <cit><quote rend="inline" source="#flanders2009">productive unease</quote>
               <ptr target="#flanders2009"/></cit> and the <cit><quote rend="inline" source="#liu2009">unexpected anomalies
                  generative of new meaning</quote>
               <ptr target="#liu2009" loc="19"/></cit>.</p>
            <p>The digital humanities has made hacking a discipline. <soCalled>Hacking</soCalled>
               these days means to adapt, manipulate, and make productive use out of a given
               technology or technological context or platform. The term’s popular and professional
               usages are widespread, including into academic and pedagogical contexts such as the
               professional productivity blog <ref target="http://chronicle.com/blogs/profhacker/">ProfHacker</ref>, the energetic experiments with the classroom by Cathy Davidson
               and HASTAC, and the alternative scholarly publication <title>Hacking the
                  Academy</title> by Dan Cohen and Tom Schienfeldt (and lots of others).
                  <soCalled>Hacking</soCalled> education overlaps with but is not synonymous with
               digital humanities. Edu-hacking is frequently used in its service, especially to
               produce unfamiliar and alien perspectives on representation and intellectual
               protocols. It also suggests an obvious question: Can the digital humanities be
               hacked? <note>That possibility is in some ways fueling the recent authenticity
                  debates: the hackers are themselves being hacked.</note> What follows is an
               approach to that question through the classroom, the generative domain of hacking
               education with instructional technology. Various commenters have worried that DH
               overlooks the institutional struggles of <soCalled>ed tech</soCalled> within higher
               education <ptr target="#waltzer2010"/>, or has been overly focused on scholarship at
               the expense of pedagogy <ptr target="#brier2010"/>. This essay proposes an answer to
               such critique in imagining a low-tech (or even no-tech) approach to DH. More broadly,
               it suggests that edu-hacking and DH are and must remain closely related. Debates
               about inclusivity and opportunism in DH have overshadowed the conversation about its
               life in the classroom. These are the implications of the examples to follow, all of
               which demonstrate how <soCalled>digital pedagogy</soCalled> might be productively
               hacked.</p>

            <head>Teaching Naked</head>
            <p>Can there be a digital pedagogy without computers? Amid the influx of electronics
               into classrooms and the rising debates, popular and professional, about how computers
               and the internet affect reading, cognition, and learning, now seems like a good time
               to ask. There are vigorous critiques of a headlong rush to technologize education
               from those who suspect its deleterious effects upon learning <ptr target="#bauerlein2008"/>, <ptr target="#carr2010b"/>. There are also healthy
               critiques of instructional technology from people very sympathetic to educational and
               humanities computing, who point out that technology cannot change the classroom
               without first changing the pedagogy (see, for example, <ptr target="#krause2010"/>).
               As a result, discussions about digital pedagogy and effective uses of instructional
               technologies are flourishing across social media as well as conventional academic
               settings. Former president of the MLA Gerald Graff has an <cit><quote rend="inline" source="#graff2009">optimistic sense of the potential of these technologies — if we heed [the]
                  wake-up call to use them in imaginative ways</quote>
               <ptr target="#graff2009" loc="7"/></cit>. That imaginative horizon is wide, but it might be
               limited by keeping digital pedagogy synonymous with tools to utilize, or with the
               particular technologies of digital media. Mark Bauerlein, who is generally
               pessimistic about the educational benefits of technology, predicts that <cit><quote rend="inline" source="#bauerlein2010">over the next 10 years, educators will recognize that certain
                  aspects of intelligence are best developed with a mixture of digital and
                  nondigital tools</quote>
               <ptr target="#bauerlein2010"/></cit>. This is not much of a concession, as the digital and
               nondigital are still consigned to being tools, and still separate things to be
               mixed.</p>
            <p>Can we redefine these very categories? Their difference may be overrepresented;
               instructional technology, after all, includes books and backpacks and overhead
               lighting. To heed the <soCalled>wake-up call</soCalled> or to recalibrate education
               in the digital age, we must not only explore unfamiliar technologies but also
               defamiliarize those we think we already know <ptr target="#mcgann2001a"/>. Indeed, the
               two projects are dialectical.<note>Much as the <title rend="italic">Rossetti
                     Archive</title> has suggested for hypermedia and bibliography.</note> It is
               because I am a vigorous user of instructional technologies that I am interested to
               pull their plugs. How might we reimagine analog teaching in terms of the digital? How
               can we incorporate the opportunities of digital pedagogy without presuming its
               discontinuity with nondigital tools and methods, or its own self-limiting status as a
               toolkit? One generative way of imagining digital pedagogy might be outside the
               context of electronics, imagining instead a digital pedagogy unplugged.</p>
            <p>Perhaps the most common shortcoming of digital pedagogy is how frequently it gets
               conceived in terms of instructional technology.<note>See ProfHacker’s report from the
                  Educause conference for a brief and trenchant critique of the institutionalization
                  of this perspective, <cit><quote rend="inline" source="#jones2010">simply the apotheosis of higher
                     education’s thirty-year change from a public good to a commodity</quote>
                  <ptr target="#jones2010"/></cit>.</note> For many teachers, especially early- or
               non-adopters, digital pedagogy is often presumed to be just something that uses
               electronic tools or computers. This is unsatisfying as it often limits the teaching
               to the extent of its tools. Two familiar problems arise. First, if the tool you have
               is a hammer, it is tempting to treat problems as nails. If presentation software
               makes it easy to share lecture notes, the lecture hall can turn into a place for
               showing bullet points instead of teaching. The second problem is treating technology
               as merely a tool: something that accomplishes a task you were already doing, but with
               (electro-) mechanical advantage. For the pedagogy, not much has changed.</p>
            <p>Electronics are machines, and they can become fascinating interpretive machines. But,
               at the risk of provoking the ire of engineers and programmers, the tools are easy.
               What is hard is imagining how to use them and, harder still, imagining the social
               conditions they might enable and, hardest of all, creating the institutional
               structures in which they will flourish.<note>As several scholars have recently
                  argued, the biggest problems faced by the digital humanities are not
                  technological, but institutional <ptr target="#mcgann2010"/> or legal and social
                     <ptr target="#kirschenbaum2010e"/>.</note> In terms of teaching, how do we work
               towards the learning environments we may have never had before? How do we break the
               thrall to tools and technologies which may limit the horizon of our pedagogical
               creativity? How might we even imagine a <soCalled>digital pedagogy</soCalled> without
               the potentially limiting factor of electronics? What if we just started <q>teaching naked</q>?</p>
            <p>This is the catchphrase of José Bowen, a dean at Southern Methodist University, whose
               profile appeared not long ago in <title rend="italic">The Chronicle</title>
               <ptr target="#young2009b"/>. Bowen is not anti-technology either. His modest proposal
               to <q>teach naked</q> actually just means removing all the
               computers and projectors from his classroom, which he did at SMU. Bowen was reacting
               to the ineffectiveness of pedagogy when it gets governed by the tools it uses: in
               short, by those PowerPoint lectures that rain down boredom in a hail of bullet
               points. He does advocate offering students podcasts and online discussion groups and
               even PowerPoint lectures, but outside of class meetings. During class time — and
               fully clothed — Bowen invites all the Q&amp;A and in-person discussion that these
               technologies had senselessly displaced. Taking a similar approach at the high-school
               level, chemistry teachers Jonathan Bergmann and Aaron Sams are successfully
               experimenting with vodcasting to create what they call <cit><quote rend="inline" source="#bergmann2011">the
                  flipped classroom</quote>
               <ptr target="#bergmann2011"/></cit>. In these models, students bring questions about the
               digital resources they have hypothetically pored over in preparing for class.
               Instructional technology is not banished but instead moved to the pedagogical
               periphery. In making such moves, these teachers support Bauerlein's promotion of
                  <cit><quote rend="inline" source="#bauerlein2010">the non-digital space as a crucial part of the
                  curriculum</quote>
               <ptr target="#bauerlein2010"/></cit>. Like Bauerlein, Bowen would segregate digital and
               analog pedagogy, or electronic and human teaching, for their particular strengths.
               But can we reconcile them instead? Can we imagine <q>teaching
                  naked</q> as more than merely doing without, but as something already
               integrated to the circuit of its electronic counterpart? What if instead we kept the
                  <soCalled>digital</soCalled> in the non-electronic senses of that word: something
               to get your hands on, to deal with in dynamic units, to manipulate creatively?</p>

         <div>
            <head>The Technology of Cultural Studies</head>
            <p>According to Sean Latham, this is what cultural studies already does. In <title rend="quotes">New Age Scholarship: The Work of Criticism in the Age of Digital
                  Reproduction</title>, Latham riffs on Walter Benjamin to suggest how the <q>loss of aura</q> or dematerialization of digitized objects, such
               as in electronic archives, links up nicely to the demystification of cultural
               hierarchies he endeavors to teach.<note>There are problems with the assumption that
                  digital archives and objects somehow lack materiality (see McGann). Though subject
                  to critique, Latham’s argument does provoke thinking about researching and
                  teaching cultural studies through different media.</note> Instructing students
               about disparate, heterogeneous, and highly contingent cultural formations — which is
               the bailiwick of cultural studies, according to Latham — is to prepare them for an
               analogous experience in the digital realm. <quote rend="inline" source="#latham2004">Cultural studies and
                  digital technology</quote>, Latham suggests, <cit><quote rend="inline" source="#latham2004">each activate
                  the energies of the other, generating the coordinates by which we can begin to map
                  the infinite density of culture in the age of its digital reproduction</quote>
               <ptr target="#latham2004" loc="420"/></cit>. Latham thinks of cultural studies as a
               technology itself, which might give students a critical selectiveness in navigating
               electronic realms and archives and their floods of flattened, ambiguously
               differentiated cultural objects. Further, it potentially empowers students to
               establish contingent interpretations of their own in these emerging digital
               spaces.</p>
            <p>Latham ambitiously claims that cultural studies only fulfills the promise of its
               method in the digital realm, where we sort and resort contingent, rare, popular, and
               heterogeneous materials into dynamic critical narratives <ptr target="#latham2004" loc="413"/>. But it is not hard to imagine how we might unplug Latham’s <quote rend="inline" source="#latham2004">technology of cultural studies</quote> and still keep it running. As
               Latham implies, to teach this way is to already use a kind of proto-digital pedagogy.
               For instance, imagine inviting students into a classroom where you have literally
               scattered dozens of heterogeneous documents around the room. For his part, Latham
               might plant documents related to modernist little magazines: letters, corrected page
               proofs, sample issues, reviews, newspaper stories, and various images. The subject
               could be just about anything. Imagine another array of materials relating to cholera
               outbreak in Victorian London and the imagination of individual and collective
               identity in urban spaces. One might offer maps, statistical surveys, journalistic
               exposés, impassioned editorials, urban sketches, snippets of fiction. Students could
               gather, assemble, and present to the class the critical narratives they
               collaboratively determine and argue. Discussion could proceed about how to present,
               exhibit, or visualize those relations. This is old and new fashioned at once, as if
               curating a special collection and imitating the IVANHOE game developed by McGann,
               Johanna Drucker, Bethany Nowviskie, and others.</p>
            <p>Does this even make sense? Can such an interactive environment like IVANHOE even work
               when denuded of its socially networked, asynchronous, abstractly visualized, and
               self-archiving functions? Why not find out? Those differences as well as shortcomings
               can become vital aspects of the class discussion: what kind of mediated environments
               might facilitate this? What interpretive machines might the students imagine,
               electronic or otherwise? What might they even potentially build, given the conditions
               of the media they’re working in? The game’s creators stress how IVANHOE keeps
               students aware of their interpretation as itself a critical act: it provides <cit><quote rend="inline" source="#drucker2003">self-conscious insight […] into the processes of interpretation
                  constituted by any and every act of reading</quote>
               <ptr target="#drucker2003" loc="vii"/></cit>. By unplugging the game or doing preliminary
               exercises with analog collections, one might help students to appreciate, by
               contrast, their active mediation of similar work in the digital field, which too
               frequently seems transparent, or so flattened that students fail to notice its own
               critical topologies.</p>

         <div>
            <head>Work in the Text Mines</head>
            <p>In this case, the goal is to keep students’ attention on the critical labor that
               digital resources seem to dissolve. This is not to privilege learning on paper but to
               imagine its digital futures. Daniel Pitti, now Associate Director the Institute for
               Advanced Technology in the Humanities (IATH), teaches classes on XML, TEI, and
               Encoded Archival Description (EAD) at the Rare Book School at the University of
               Virginia. He begins the class by handing out a printed recipe, and then gives
               students a set amount of time to make a list, on their own, of what they think are
               that object’s salient formal properties which they would want (ultimately) to render
               in code. The subsequent discussion quickly reveals the surprising differences in
               features the students hoped to describe, and further demonstrates how even the most
               programmatic of documents has proliferating ways of describing its material, textual,
               and graphical features. Students come to perceive how analog or physical documents
               are already and complexly encoded in n-dimensions. How do you mark that up? How do
               you imagine an archive or finding system that can accommodate deceivingly
               non-programmatic artefacts of all document types and materials? <cit><quote rend="block" source="#mcgann2009">For materially different types of artifacts — printed texts, maps, photographs —
                  divisioning and classifying become yet more complicated when the ultimate purpose
                  is to arrange them in a system that permits coherent analysis and study. The
                  problem is greatly amplified when the manipulable physical properties scale to
                  radically different measures, as is the case with a depository that includes
                  paper-based objects and born-digital objects.</quote>
               <ptr target="#mcgann2009" loc="839"/></cit> The scale of the problem seems like a recipe
               for a headache. Scaling up from a simple recipe, Pitti elegantly invites students
               into the provocative complexities of text encoding and information architecture. </p>
            <p>Another disarming and elegant example comes from Brad Pasanek. Pasanek’s research is
               heavy into algorithms and text mining; he collaborates and publishes with a computer
               scientist. He also teaches British literature of the long eighteenth century. These
               domains came into contact when, one day, a little frustrated with his students’
               lackluster insights into the basic themes of Austen’s <title rend="italic">Pride and
                  Prejudice</title>, he went home and <soCalled>text mined</soCalled> the novel with
               pink and blue highlighters. Just the title terms: pink for every instance of <q>pride</q>, blue for <q>prejudice</q>. The
               next class he returned with his marked-up book, flipping through the pages to show
               the bursts of color.<note>To <soCalled>mark up</soCalled> the book with highlighters
                  is to encode certain semantic elements in color. The exercise also anticipates the
                  critical activity of coding for the Web, where HTML is reconceived as
                     <soCalled>highlighted text mark-up language</soCalled>.</note> The class
               energetically started correlating them to important moments in the plot, to
               transitions in how the key terms were conceived. The exercise was an ice breaker
               (valuable in itself, as any teacher knows), but Pasanek accomplishes much more with
               it.</p>
            <p>Consider one prevalent critique about how we read (or don’t read) electronic texts;
               Latham explains it as follows: <cit>
                  <quote rend="inline" source="#latham2004">The digital text seemingly makes reading too easy, allowing
                     one to search out specific terms without the labor required to place them in
                     their proper context</quote>
                  <ptr target="#latham2004" loc="416"/>
               </cit>. Text mining a novel with highlighters restores that missing labor of search.
               This is not merely to reverse engineer what students can already do with a search
               engine, or simply to take away the electro-mechanical advantage of such a tool and
               make busywork. (Noting that many search results functions will highlight the
               keywords/strings a user has searched for.) Rather, the exercise makes students
               reflect on how their reading labor is both constitutive and mediated. Pasanek’s
               exercise integrates at least two kinds of reading: first, linear or intensive or deep
               or close reading, which the defenders of paper books insist provides the
               all-important context for understanding; and second, extensive or distant reading in
               which context is measured on a very different scale.<note>Carr sketches out a kind of
                  surface or frenetic reading against a deep reading or deep thinking model <ptr target="#carr2010b"/>. Franco Moretti’s <quote rend="inline" source="#moretti2000">distant
                     reading</quote> is not necessarily allied with reading online or with
                  information technology; rather, <cit><quote rend="inline" source="#moretti2000">distance […] is a condition
                     of knowledge</quote>
                  <ptr target="#moretti2000" loc="57"/></cit>. But, when moved into an electronic context,
                  distant reading can help articulate a method for online sources and instructional
                  technologies.</note> Distant reading allows us to survey and map texts from a
               higher critical elevation, as it were. Pasanek’s prototype seems exactly the kind of
                  <soCalled>hybrid</soCalled> critical work that does both.<note>Compare to what
                  Latham suggests about using digital archives: <cit><quote rend="inline" source="#latham2004">The reading of
                     surfaces […] should not be starkly opposed to a deep reading that is somehow
                     more proper or authentic. Instead, the digital archive requires a hybrid type
                     of critical work, one which matches the ability to pursue connections across
                     texts with a studied awareness of the historical specificity of the printed
                     word</quote>
                  <ptr target="#latham2004" loc="419"/></cit>. </note> It allows for specificities within
               close contexts as students read, and for connections within and across texts. It is
               like reading from the middle, except that it alternates close and distant
               perspectives to generate its critical current.<note>Put a different way, as Lydgate
                  insists in Middlemarch: <cit><quote rend="inline" source="#eliot1994">there must be a systole and diastole
                     in all inquiry, […] a man’s mind must be continually expanding and shrinking
                     between the whole human horizon and the horizon of an object-glass</quote>
                  <ptr target="#eliot1994" loc="640"/></cit>.</note> The exercise defamiliarizes the act
               of reading, reveals its continuity with digital text mining, and offers insights that
               may not solely exist in either realm.</p>
            <p>Flipping quickly through the marked-up book, the first thing one notices is the
               abundance of <q>pride</q> relative to <q>prejudice</q>. Depending on how its counted, pride shows up between six and
               nine times more than prejudice.<note>The variation depends on whether or not one
                  includes <q>proud</q> and <q>prided</q>. It is also interesting that neither <q>pride</q> nor <q>prejudice</q> show up in top 50 or
                  even top 150 most frequent words (excluding common stop words) in the novel. This
                  makes them relatively invisible to such online word cloud tools as Wordle and
                  TagCrowd.</note> There’s food for thought here: whereas pride describes a
               character trait, prejudice is more of a relational term: changeable, situational, and
               more dangerous to accuse someone of. Browsing through the text more deliberately, the
               first big splash of color comes (as one might expect) with Mr Darcy’s debut,
               specifically after he declines to dance with Elizabeth Bennet at the first ball <ptr target="#austen2005" loc="20–21"/>. The second color splash comes later when, at
               Netherfield, Miss Bingley invites Elizabeth to stroll about the room, trying to get
               Darcy’s attention while scrutinizing his character <ptr target="#austen2005" loc="56"/>. The third color burst comes (again, as one might anticipate) when Elizabeth meets
               Wickham and he describes (lies about) his history of mistreatment at Darcy’s hands
                  <ptr target="#austen2005" loc="80–81"/>. At this point, we might consider why the
               color has been splashing at all: the multiple instances of the term <q>pride</q> at these moments. Rereading them, we can see how
                  <q>pride</q> is not just an epithet hurled at Darcy, but a
               concept which certain characters — specifically Elizabeth’s friend Charlotte Lennox,
               then Miss Bingley, and then Wickham — discuss with Elizabeth for its appropriateness,
               even its potential merits. At a distance, we see the <soCalled>hot spots</soCalled>;
               moving closer, we analyze their contexts; and somewhere in the middle we start to
               learn about the novel’s reformation of pride through Elizabeth’s perspective. Pride,
               as the novel eventually suggests, does have a place.</p>
            <p>Of course you don’t have to text mine the novel to understand this. Such
               interpretations should be obvious to any attentive reader of the novel. That these
               readers are sometimes not so attentive is a big part of Pasanek’s point. Now for
               prejudice. The first instance occurs when Elizabeth, just after having heard
               Wickham’s story, gets awkwardly paired with Darcy at the second ball <ptr target="#austen2005" loc="92"/>. By contrast, a couple of prejudices appear when
               Elizabeth and Jane later learn the truth about Wickham but hesitate to publicize his
               bad character <ptr target="#austen2005" loc="218"/>. What about both <q>pride</q> and <q>prejudice</q> — the
               instances where the novel’s title terms are co-present? There are three. The first
               when, after Elizabeth hotly rejects Darcy’s unfortunate first proposal of marriage,
               he gives her a long letter explaining everything <ptr target="#austen2005" loc="198"/>. The second when Elizabeth visits Pemberley and hears glowing appreciation of
               Darcy from one of his servants <ptr target="#austen2005" loc="239"/>. The third when
               Elizabeth eventually accepts Darcy’s marriage proposal and they reflect back on his
               explanatory letter <ptr target="#austen2005" loc="348–49"/>. In each case, the
               subjects are Darcy’s maturation and his rationale for recent actions; in each
               context, this information is private and privileged; in each instance, characters
               reflect on the very relations and reformation of the novel’s title terms.</p>
            <p>There is a much more one could think about here. And there are many critical
               questions to raise about the method. But this should testify to the value of such an
               exercise. Particularly for students whose interface with digital texts and resources
               is driven by search engines, or guided by keywords and text strings. Unplugging the
               search engine can help students perceive the limitations as well as the possibilities
               of what makes these engines run: pattern matching, which by itself is a far cry from
               reading at any distance. It sharpens students’ attention to forms of analysis that
               explore the analog and digital domains along a continuum. It helps students to
               interrogate the various kinds of readings they can do therein. And it reveals all of
               those kinds of readings as actively constituting critical interpretations.</p>

            <head>On Not Reading in the Digital Humanities</head>
            <p>There are simpler approaches toward these goals which are no less effective in
               imagining a hybrid pedagogy. Stephen Ramsay offers another interesting example. Just
               as Ramsay tries to combine the <quote rend="inline" source="#ramsay2009">technical with the
                  philosophical</quote> in his graduate courses in the digital humanities, so he
               also combines different configurations of the seminar <ptr target="#ramsay2009"/>.
               For instance, after working on programming on Mondays and Wednesdays, his class
               devotes Fridays to a theoretical text on new media or the digital humanities. But no
               one gets to read it in advance. Instead, on <soCalled>No-Reading
                  Fridays</soCalled>, the class takes turns reading, paragraph by paragraph, the text
               projected on the classroom’s screen. After two such Fridays grappling with
               Heidegger’s <title rend="quotes">The Question Concerning Technology</title>, the
               class had covered only eight paragraphs, but Ramsay declares that <quote rend="inline" source="#ramsay2009">I truly think that this is one of most enlightening class
                  discussions I’ve ever been a part of (either as a student or a teacher).</quote>
               The format allows the seminar to flourish, and <quote rend="inline" source="#ramsay2009">the professor is
                  only a very small part of what’s going on.</quote>
            </p>
            <p>Why is this different from a seminar where everyone works from the same edition of a
               physical book? In some ways it isn’t. But for a graduate course in digital
               humanities, where much of the attention is on the digital realm and on theories of
               new media, it is a chance for everyone to be on the same page — literally — where the
               page is projected on the wall.<note>Relatedly, anyone who attended a Technology in
                  the Arts and Sciences Camp (aka THATCamp) knows that its most crucial piece of
                  technology is the whiteboard.</note> Because no one (save the professor) has read
               it before, the seminar reimagines real-time information processing in a very old
               fashioned way. This is <q>teaching naked</q> as it is meant to
               be understood: using technology effectively, subordinating it to the pedagogical
               goals of the class.<note>In this context, see David Parry’s lucid response to the
                     <soCalled>teaching naked</soCalled> concept <ptr target="#parry2009"/>.</note> Though not quite unplugged, Ramsay’s digital pedagogy offers similar
               critical distance and welcome counterpart to the course’s engagement with computers
               and media theory. This too is digital humanities, and very productive of deep reading
               and discussion in the flesh. The digital is hands-on, offering the <quote rend="inline" source="#ramsay2011b">haptic engagement</quote> that Ramsay argues is crucial to DH's
               hermeneutic of building <ptr target="#ramsay2011b"/>.</p>
         </div>
         <div>
            <head>Digital Pedagogy Unplugged</head>
            <p>No one, I think, would dispute the credentials of these teacher-scholars as digital
               humanists. In their sensitivity to the necessary interplay of electronic and analog
               forms, they also blur the fallacious divides of theorist-practitioner,
               insider-outsider, educator-hacker in ways that seem especially salutary in the
               context of DH's persistent debates. They enrich the notion of the digital humanist as
               a <soCalled>hybrid scholar</soCalled>, according to Julia Flanders,
               underscoring how digital scholarship proceeds through <quote rend="inline" source="#flanders2009">hybridizations that challenge our notions of discipline</quote>
               <ptr target="#flanders2009"/> — and that even challenge our notions of the digital,
               as well as the inchoate discipline emerging from it. Their examples more specifically
               suggest how an unplugged pedagogy, so to speak, can still be productively digital.
               These case studies are meant neither to prescribe nor to exhaust the possibilities;
               they are simply a handful of the strategies which I’ve happened to encounter. But
               they all provide creative answers to a question that every teacher needs to ask: how
               to imagine pedagogy in a digital age. David Parry is bold to say that <quote rend="inline" source="#parry2009">[t]eaching without digital technology is an irresponsible
                  pedagogy</quote>, but correct in that the future, and the future of education, is
               digital <ptr target="#parry2009"/>. This might be gently rephrased to suggest that it
               is irresponsible to teach with technology without a digital pedagogy. And though
               there are all sorts of ways to construct a digital pedagogy, one powerful approach
               begins with pulling the plug.</p>
