            Analysis</head>

         <p>One of the emerging grand challenges for digital humanities in the next decade is to
            address rapidly expanding repositories of electronic text. A number of efforts, such as
               <ref target="http://books.google.com/">Google Book Search</ref> and the <ref
               target="http://theeuropeanlibrary.org/">Bibliothèque numérique européenne</ref>, are
            digitizing the holdings of many of the world's great research libraries. The resulting
            collections will contain nothing less than, in Gregory Crane's view, the <cit>
               <quote rend="inline" source="#crane2006">stored record of humanity</quote>
               <ptr target="#crane2006"/>
            </cit>. This expansion beyond existing digital collections will be one of at least a
            couple of orders of magnitude, and will introduce a variety of new problems beyond
            simply scale, including heterogeneity of content and granularity of objects. The
            problems posed by the emerging global digital library offer opportunities for
            collaborative work between scholars in the humanities and computer scientists in many
            domains, from optical character and page recognition to historical ontologies <ptr
               target="#argamon2006"/>. The papers presented here reflect initial collaborative work
            between the ARTFL Project at the University of Chicago and the Linguistic Cognition
            Laboratory at the Illinois Institute of Technology on one subset of the technologies
            required for a future global digital library: the intersection of machine learning, text
            mining and text analysis.</p>
         <p>Traditional models of text analysis in digital humanities have concentrated on searching
            for a relatively small number of words and reporting results in formats long familiar to
            humanities scholars, most notably concordances, collocation tables, and word frequency
               breakdowns.<note>The PhiloLogic text search and analysis package, developed at ARTFL,
               is one of many examples of such traditionally oriented systems. Documentation,
               downloads and samples are available at <ref target="http://philologic.uchicago.edu/"
                  >http://philologic.uchicago.edu/</ref>.</note> While effective for many types of
            questions, this approach will not scale effectively beyond collections of a relatively
            modest size, as result sets for even uncommon groups of words will balloon to a size not
            readily digestible by humans. Furthermore, this approach does not lend itself to
            abstract discussions of entire works, the oeuvre of an author or period, or issues
            related to the language of gender, genre, or ethnicity. It places the onus on the user
            to construct queries and assimilate results, without leveraging the capacity of machines
            to identify patterns in massive amount of data.</p>
         <p>Machine learning and text mining approaches appear to offer a compelling complement to
            traditional text analysis, by having the computer sift through massive amounts of text
            looking for <q>suggestive patterns.</q> The power of modern machine learning systems to
            uncover patterns in large amounts of data has led to their widespread use in many
            applications, from spam filters to analyzing genetic sequences. And the potential for
            using these sophisticated algorithms to find meaningful patterns in humanistic texts has
            been recently observed. Drawing a link between Ian Witten's general description of data
            mining and the practice of literary criticism, Stephen Ramsay states that <quote
               rend="inline" source="#ramsay2005">[f]inding interesting patterns and regularities in
               data is generally held to be of the deepest significance.</quote> Any such findings
            must be approached with critical prudence, he warns, as they will contain <cit>
               <quote rend="inline" source="#ramsay2005">the spurious, the contingent, the inexact,
                  the imperfect, and the accidental in a state of almost guaranteed
                  incompleteness</quote>
               <ptr target="#ramsay2005" loc="186"/>
            </cit>. Ramsay is quite correct to point out both the potential power and pitfalls of
            applying text mining to questions in the humanities. Our current work is to design sets
            of relatively constrained experiments using text mining systems on specific problems in
            order to examine what works, what does not work, and just what such results might
            mean.</p>
         <p>To this end, the ARTFL Project has developed a set of machine learning extensions to
            PhiloLogic, our full-text search and analysis system.<note>See <ref
                  target="http://philologic.uchicago.edu/philomine/"
                  >http://philologic.uchicago.edu/philomine/</ref> for samples, documentation, and
               downloads. Not all machine learning and text mining tasks in the following papers
               used Philomine.</note> PhiloMine replaces the notion of <q>searching</q> a database
            for one or more words with <q>task</q> submission. We currently view three broad classes
            of <q>tasks</q>: predictive text mining, comparative text mining, and
            clustering/similarity analysis. Predictive mining approaches are widely used in
            applications such as spam e-mail filters, which are trained on samples of spam and
            non-spam messages and used to identify incoming junk mail. This supervised learning
            technique can be applied to a wide variety of tasks, such as learning on topically
            classified articles in the <title rend="italic">Encyclopédie</title> and assigning these
            classes to unclassified articles or parts of other documents. It is common in digital
            humanities to work with corpora where many classifications, such as gender or
            nationality of author, are already known. In this case, machine learning algorithms may
            be used to compare texts based on different attributes. For example, one may compare
            works by American and non-American Black playwrights, returning measures of how well the
            classification task was performed, identifying incorrectly classified documents, and the
            features (often words) most characteristic of the distinction. Finally, document
            similarity and clustering is an unsupervised form of machine learning, designed to
            identify groups of documents statistically that share common features. We are using
            nearest neighbor document similarity, for example, to identify passages in one text that
            may have been copied from an earlier document.</p>
         <p>The three papers which follow use all three approaches to attempt to shed light on
            specific research questions in the humanities. <title rend="quotes">Gender, Race, and
               Nationality...</title> examines how well machine learning tools can isolate stylistic
            or content features of authors and characters by gender, race, and nationality in a
            large collection of works by Black playwrights. In general, the classification results
            on a range of mining tasks were quite good, suggesting that these techniques can
            effectively distinguish, for example, the writing of male and female or American and
            non-American authors. In some cases, the results provide insight into the texts as
            literary works, but in others we found the intellectual value of the feature sets to be
            less interesting. We also found that, while classifying texts under binary oppositions
            is generally effective for the machine learning algorithms employed, doing so tends to
            reduce complex works and corpora to very limited sets of common features.</p>
         <p>In <title rend="quotes">Vive la différence...</title>, we examine a single binary
            classification, on gender of author in French literature predominantly from the 17th to
            the early 20th centuries. Using balanced male and female corpora, we found substantial
            agreement with Olsen's previous studies of gendered writing in published works, with our
            results supporting his observation of a more personal and emotional sphere of female
            authorship. Our results also comport with Argamon's previous work (with Koppel) on the
            British National Corpus, where female writing was found to be characterized by more
            frequent use of personal pronouns, with male writing characterized by more frequent use
            of determiners and numerical quantifiers. Additionally, a number of strong thematic
            groups of content words were found for both genders that were consistently useful in
            classification across the time period represented in the corpus, suggesting some
            enduring differences between male and female writing in the corpus.</p>
         <p>The third paper, <title rend="quotes">Mining Eighteenth Century Ontologies...</title>,
            uses predictive classification to examine the ontology of Diderot and d'Alembert's
               <title rend="italic">Encyclopédie</title>. Our initial experiments attempting to
            classify the unclassified articles of the Encyclopédie led us to reconsider the
            coherency of the editors' classification scheme and overall distribution of classes in
            the entire work. Lastly, applying this ontology of the classes of knowledge to the
               <title rend="italic">Journal de Trévoux</title>, an 18th century scholarly journal,
            we were able to make several new connections between the two corpora that went
            previously unnoticed.</p>
         <p>The power of machine learning and text mining applications to detect patterns is clearly
            demonstrated in these papers, yet several issues arose during this work which we believe
            should be raised. The first is the surprisingly small size of the patterns detected. In
            all of the experiments, the systems dutifully created models to fit classes, but these
            were often based on quite tiny fractions of all of the available features -- a mere 60
            surface words can adequately distinguish hundreds of American and non-American plays by
            black authors. Similarly, we find that for both predictive classification and clustering
            tasks, the number of features for most tasks used is a tiny fraction of all possible
            features. Resulting features may well reflect a <q>lowest common denominator</q> which,
            while perfectly adequate for specific mining tasks, may not be as useful in
            characterizing works in an intellectually satisfying fashion. The fact that our studies
            examining the issue of gendered writing arrived at similar conclusions regarding the
            differences between male and female writing and characterizations may thus in part be an
            artifact of the way learners and classifiers function. Finally, our classification tasks
            are generally considered to have produced a significant result when we achieve an
            accuracy of 70% or more, although the most successful tasks can surpass 95%. When
            examining the features most useful to the model, we must not assume that their
            importance holds for the documents whose class could not be predicted; indeed, their
            incorrect classification suggests that these documents may have quite different patterns
            of word usage.</p>
         <p>The <q>lowest common denominator</q> problem would also appear to be related to a second
            concern which may be specific to machine learning on humanities texts. By treating
            relatively small numbers of documents with very large numbers of possible features,
            classifiers are thus given a wide range of features to accomplish any particular task.
            While we used different techniques to validate results, including n-fold cross
            validation and random falsification, there would appear to be some danger of obtaining
            results based on the construction of the task itself. Even if significant results are
            found, showing, e.g. that classification by a particular binary opposition can be
            performed reliably at 80% accuracy, in itself this says little about the underlying
            phenomenon under investigation. A binary opposition that is thus <q>empirically
               supported</q> may well be an epiphenomenon that is merely correlated with another
            underlying complex of causes, which remain to be teased out. So finding such
               <q>statistical patterns</q> is, ultimately, merely the first step in what must be a
            critically well-grounded argument, supported also by evidence external to the
            classification results themselves.</p>
         <p>To help us argue for the general efficacy of machine learning approaches and address the
            concerns set forth above, we include a reaction piece by Sean Meehan, who writes about
            the anxieties of doing criticism by algorithm. Meehan raises the issue of distance in
            any critical endeavor, pointing out that interpretive analysis is always <q>a dynamic
               between tools and texts.</q> In the end, he sounds the theme of scholarly
            circumspection and care that we try to bring out in all of the articles. Using machine
            learning tools on humanities texts requires the same understanding of the texts and
            degree of self-awareness that are necessary for any literary critical study.</p>
         <p>As we hope these small scale experiments have demonstrated, text mining and machine
            learning algorithms offer novel ways to approach problems of text analysis and
            interpretation. One can pose questions of many hundreds or thousands of documents and
            obtain results that are interesting and sometimes even striking. It further seems clear
            that text mining will be a powerful technology deployed in order to make the emerging
            global digital library manageable and meaningful.</p>
