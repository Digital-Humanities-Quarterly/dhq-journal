                  <p>This article demonstrates the value of “scalable reading” of historical travel
                     guides, combining traditional close reading with computer-assisted distant reading.
                     Aiming to scrutinize the persistence of older tourist attractions under communism,
                     we
                     analyse guidebooks intended for similar audiences but produced under different
                     political regimes. More specifically, we compare three travel guides to the same
                     geographical area produced between 1905 and 1959: one to communist cold war
                     Czechoslovakia, one to democratic interwar Czechoslovakia, and one to the
                     Habsburg-era Czech lands and Slovakia. We analyse the geographic distribution of
                     attractions by geolocating the guidebook toponyms and visualizing them with
                     Geographic Information Systems (GIS). This distant reading is complemented with a
                     hermeneutic analysis grounded in a close reading of the guidebook text. The
                     combination of these approaches documents the similarities in the symbolic
                     representation of the country’s attractions across political caesuras and provides
                     a
                     methodological template for future explorations of travel guides with historical
                     GIS.</p>

                  <div class="ptext" id="p1">Scholars interested in the history of travel and tourism have long relied on
                     historical guidebooks as a primary source to past patterns of mobility and cultural
                     ideals. The guidebook’s descriptive and prescriptive nature — describing places,
                     peoples, and cultures, and ordering them in a normative hierarchy of attractiveness
                     —
                     is a treasure trove of information about the practices and ideas constituting past
                     travel cultures [<a class="ref" href="#parsons2007">Parsons 2007</a>]. Historians have been keen to query
                     guidebooks for insights about aesthetic sensibilities, communications and
                     infrastructures, and representations of the other. The preferred method for studying
                     such themes has been qualitative, close readings of travel guides (classical examples
                     of this include [<a class="ref" href="#buzard1993">Buzard 1993</a>]; [<a class="ref" href="#koshar2000">Koshar 2000</a>]). Only
                     recently have tourism historians begun to employ digitally enabled methods, for
                     instance Historical Geographic Information Systems (HGIS) exploring the origins of
                     nineteenth-century Baltic spa guests [<a class="ref" href="#antons2021">Antons 2021</a>] and the family
                     networks of Grand Tour travellers to Italy [<a class="ref" href="#andersonetal2017">Anderson et al. 2017</a>], or
                     semantic modelling of Baedeker travel guides [<a class="ref" href="#czeitschner_krautgartner2017">Czeitschner and Krautgartner 2017</a>]. Scholars of the ancient world have also
                     demonstrated the value of HGIS for studying travel times in the Roman Mediterranean
                     [<a class="ref" href="#meeks_grossner2012">Meeks and Grossner 2012</a>] and for understanding Pausanias’s <cite class="title italic">Periegesis Hellados</cite> — a complex cultural geography of Greece
                     often referred to as the first guidebook [<a class="ref" href="#fokaetal2021">Foka et al. 2021</a>]. What we
                     propose in this article, though, is for historians of modern tourism to take
                     advantage of the comparatively homogenous nature of modern guidebooks and harness
                     HGIS for new, computer-assisted tourism histories.</div>

                  <div class="ptext" id="p2">The primary aim of this article is to scrutinize the persistence of older tourist
                     attractions under communism in Czechoslovakia. In doing so, we also demonstrate the
                     promising methodological avenues for “scalable reading” of the tourist guidebook
                     as a historical source, combining traditional close reading with computer-assisted
                     distant reading [<a class="ref" href="#fickers_clavert2021">Fickers and Clavert 2021</a>]. More specifically, the article
                     illustrates the potential of systematically mapping the spatial information contained
                     in guidebooks diachronically and in combination with qualitative, contextualizing
                     sources. Approaching modern guidebooks to the same destination as time series enables
                     the researcher to chart the rise and fall of touristic sites. The possibility to
                     pinpoint the omission and disappearance of tourist attractions over time and across
                     large geographical areas is particularly promising as such absences easily pass
                     unnoticed during traditional close readings. The method also allows for visualizing
                     attraction hierarchies by comparing the touristic sites contained in comprehensive
                     guidebooks with those in compact guidebooks from the same period. Such observations
                     can then inspire further research into changes and continuities in touristic
                     infrastructure and forms of attraction. In these efforts, the current work thus seeks
                     to bridge the gap between quantitative and qualitative uses of GIS ([<a class="ref" href="#knowles2014">Knowles 2014</a>, p. 207]; [<a class="ref" href="#marti-henneberg2011">Martí-Henneberg 2011</a>, p. 4–5]; [<a class="ref" href="#blevins2021">Blevins 2021</a>, p. 4–13]).</div>

                  <div class="ptext" id="p3">This article illustrates some of the methodological opportunities outlined above
                     through a scalable reading of the first guidebook to communist Czechoslovakia for
                     western travellers after the Second World War. The guidebook <cite class="title italic">Czechoslovakia </cite>
                     [<a class="ref" href="#chysky1959">Chyský 1959</a>] was published eleven years after the communist coup in
                     1948, and produced by Čedok, the Czechoslovak National Tourist Organization. To
                     provide diachronic contextualization we compare this guidebook with two predecessors
                     similar in terms of audience and scope, but markedly different in terms of production
                     context. Closest in time is the <cite class="title italic">Guide to the Czechoslovak
                        Republic</cite>
                     [<a class="ref" href="#kral1928">Král 1928</a>], Čedok’s first travel guide for foreign readers published
                     under the democratic interwar government a decade after the republic’s foundation
                     in
                     1918. Čedok published no similar volumes between 1928 and 1959, which makes the two
                     publications ideal for a study of how the communist tourist authorities sought to
                     present the country. The continuity in intended audience (foreign, primarily western
                     tourists) combined with the radically differing political circumstances allows for
                     novel insights into the persistence of old travel ideals under communism. The two
                     volumes are further contextualized by comparison with the reputable German guidebook
                     publisher Baedeker’s comprehensive <cite class="title italic">Austria–Hungary including
                        Dalmatia and Bosnia</cite> from 1905, which covered the geographical area that
                     became Czechoslovakia after 1918. Taken together, the travel guides allow us to trace
                     the (dis)continuities of tourist attraction distribution in communist
                     Czechoslovakia.</div>

                  <div class="ptext" id="p4">In 1957, more than one hundred diplomats and travel industry representatives from
                     twenty-nine countries converged on Prague in Czechoslovakia for a five-day conference
                     on international tourism. The event took place four years after the death of Stalin
                     in 1953 at a time when the Communist government, in power since the coup in February
                     1948, was gradually improving its diplomatic relations with the West. Organised by
                     Čedok, the primary aim of the conference was to promote Czechoslovakia as an
                     international tourist destination and ease the mobility of Western tourists across
                     the Cold War divide. The organizers hoped that the global meeting would facilitate
                     contacts and sow the seeds of future collaboration between airlines, railways, and
                     tourist associations of all continents. Shortly before the Prague conference, the
                     travel bureaus of the socialist states had held a separate meeting in Carlsbad where
                     they concluded that “the most effective path to mutual
                     understanding and comprehension is for nations to speak to nations in the most
                     direct manner, by tourism.”<a class="noteRef" href="#d3e298">[1]</a> The
                     declaration echoed a stance taken by the Czechoslovak Politburo two years earlier
                     as
                     it revised its policy towards Western tourism in the autumn of 1955 [<a class="ref" href="#bechmannpedersen2018">Bechmann Pedersen 2018</a>, p. 132]. Back then, the leading political
                     organ recognized that “at present, the development of tourism is
                     of particular political importance. Foreign trade is becoming one of the
                     instruments of mitigating international tensions.”<a class="noteRef" href="#d3e304">[2]</a></div>

                  <div class="ptext" id="p5">In terms of formal tourism policy, the years 1955–56 marked the country’s turning
                     point away from Stalinist isolation and towards the search for a “common ground between East and West in the postwar world order” later
                     epitomised by the award-winning Czechoslovak pavilion at the 1958 Brussels World’s
                     Fair [<a class="ref" href="#giustino2012">Giustino 2012</a>, p. 188]. In 1955, Čedok made its first
                     arrangements with western travel companies and the following year it invited forty
                     western travel industry representatives to the country. Starting in March 1956,
                     Czechoslovakia also began to issue regular tourist visas and Čedok prepared thirteen
                     hotels of higher standard specifically for western guests [<a class="ref" href="#bechmannpedersen2019">Bechmann Pedersen 2019</a>, p. 236]. Instead of seeing Western tourists
                     solely as a threat to national security, the Communist regime prepared to capitalise
                     on international tourism as a tool for cultural diplomacy and an invisible
                     export.</div>

                  <div class="ptext" id="p6">To some extent the efforts of the Communist regime to attract foreign visitors and
                     win international recognition through tourism mirrored initiatives of the newly
                     founded Czechoslovak state in the interwar period. After the breakaway from the
                     Austro-Hungarian empire at the end the First World War, the new state utilised
                     international tourism to gain recognition abroad as an independent nation worthy of
                     its sovereignty [<a class="ref" href="#jeschke2021">Jeschke 2021</a>, p. 68]. Čedok was quickly
                     established as the country’s national travel agency and a semi-official tool of
                     nation branding with several foreign offices ([<a class="ref" href="#stemberk2009">Štemberk 2009</a>, p. 156–160]; [<a class="ref" href="#mucke2021">Mücke 2021</a>, p. 77]). The country also
                     participated in transnational collaboration on tourism, hosting the second
                     international congress of national tourist organizations in 1926 [<a class="ref" href="#secretariatgeneral1926">Le Secrétariat-Général 1926</a>]. These congresses were continued immediately
                     after the Second World War when the International Union of Official Tourist
                     Organizations (IUOTO) was established with Czechoslovakia as a member. Following the
                     February coup in 1948, though, the Stalinist regime in Prague left the organization
                     at the onset of the Cold War.</div>

                  <div class="ptext" id="p7">Nine years later, in 1957, the country returned to the international tourist
                     organization it had once helped found. The same year the international tourist
                     conference in Prague crowned the reorientation of Czechoslovakia’s international
                     tourism policy. Čedok representatives were sent on at least 14 different trips to
                     Western Europe, North America, and Africa where they attended travel fairs and
                     surveyed the local travel industry for potential partners.<a class="noteRef" href="#d3e333">[3]</a> These efforts to attract foreign tourists raised
                     fundamental questions with significant ideological ramifications. What, in fact, were
                     communist Czechoslovakia’s tourist attractions, and how could they be ordered in a
                     hierarchy of attractiveness? Where should Western visitors be invited to travel and
                     why? Security interests would have to be balanced against economic interests as the
                     spatial distribution of tourist sites for foreigners risked interfering with military
                     zones and state security efforts to thwart western cultural influences and spying.
                     One aspect of the political dilemmas of international tourism to Cold War
                     Czechoslovakia is captured in a US embassy cable sent from Prague to Washington DC
                     in
                     1957.

                           bemoan the fact that there is no up-to-date guidebook to the Czechoslovak capital
                           city. Recently an embassy officer asked an employee of ARTIA, the responsible
                           state publishing house, why this was so. “Oh,” the
                           Czech replied, “you have no idea what a difficult task it is,
                           how great is the responsibility involved in determining which buildings and
                           other landmarks should be included in such a guidebook and what reasons should
                           be given for visiting them. So many offices and ministries would have to be
                           consulted by an author, so many decisions would have to be made…”<a class="noteRef" href="#d3e342">[4]</a></p>
                     </blockquote> Disregarding its somewhat
                     satirical tone, the dialogue recounted in the cable illustrates Mary Heiman’s point
                     how, in Czechoslovakia’s “political system that routinely
                     disgraced and punished anyone who stepped out of line with the current policy
                     directives, there was not a lot of scope for independent initiative.”
                     [<a class="ref" href="#heimann2009">Heimann 2009</a>, p. 211] Four years earlier, however, amidst
                     Stalinist show trials and campaigns to root out “bourgeois
                     elements,” Čedok had in fact compiled an 80-page guide in Czech to Prague
                     and its environs [<a class="ref" href="#kral1953">Král 1953</a>]. Yet its lengthy sections on “The recreation of Prague workers,”
                     “Prague on the road to socialism,” and “In the footsteps of the workers’ movement and the history of the
                     Communist Party in Prague” did not provide an ideal template for a
                     guidebook geared to a western audience. Complicating matters further and exemplifying
                     the dynamic and sometimes contradictory process of de-Stalinisation in
                     Czechoslovakia, the editor of the 1953 guidebook was the prominent geographer Jiří
                     Král — author of Čedok’s 1928 <cite class="title italic">Guide to the Czechoslovak
                        Republic</cite> — who had been forced into retirement after the Communists came
                     to power and now worked as a tourist guide in Prague to make ends meet. The estranged
                     and somewhat eccentric Král was only rehabilitated in 1966, so he and his manuscript
                     would have been unlikely candidates for the symbolically important job of introducing
                     the country to western readers [<a class="ref" href="#martinek2008">Martínek 2008</a>, p. 128–130].<a class="noteRef" href="#d3e374">[5]</a>

                  <div class="ptext" id="p8">The task of producing the first postwar guidebook for western tourists to
                     Czechoslovakia instead fell on Jiří Chyský. The son of Čeněk Chyský, an important
                     figure in the Czech tourist movement and author of guidebooks to Prague ([<a class="ref" href="#chysky1934">Chyský 1934</a>]; [<a class="ref" href="#chysky1948">Chyský 1948</a>]), Chyský junior had himself
                     edited a Czech tourist guide to Prague in 1955 and written a booklet on the
                     organization of domestic tourism the same year. Jiří Chyský was also an ardent
                     communist and an employee of the Ministry of Justice who had helped the Party seize
                     control of the scout movement in 1948, so he was undoubtedly attuned to the politics
                     of tourism. Among his collaborators on the international guidebook project were Milan
                     Skalník, an accomplice in the purge of the scout movement, and Vladimír Adamec,
                     author of several guidebooks for domestic readers in the 1950s [<a class="ref" href="#lesanovsky2009">Lešanovský 2009</a>, p. 16]. Unfortunately the Čedok archive has been
                     lost, which makes further investigations into the production of the two guidebooks
                     difficult [<a class="ref" href="#hais2008">Hais 2008</a>, p. 5]. From other government sources we
                     nevertheless know that in 1958, the Czechoslovak authorities reached an agreement
                     with the Geneva-based guidebook publisher Louis Nagel, who was seeking to establish
                     his publishing house as the leading provider of guides to Eastern Europe. Nagel’s
                     had
                     already published guides to Moscow and Leningrad [<a class="ref" href="#moscouleningrad1956">Moscou et Léningrad 1956</a>]
                     and Hungary [<a class="ref" href="#schreiber1957">Schreiber 1957</a>], and according to Čedok’s investigations,
                     Nagel’s guides enjoyed a fine reputation in Switzerland and France as reliable and
                     objective. The manuscript was eventually provided by Čedok in collaboration with
                     Chyský, and seven other authors. Nagel’s published the result in 1959 simultaneously
                     in English, French, and German editions. The print-run amounted to 3,000 copies to
                     be
                     sold through Western channels aiming to earn hard currency profits.<a class="noteRef" href="#d3e393">[6]</a>

                  <div class="ptext" id="p9">Nagel’s 1959 guidebook to Czechoslovakia is a typical artefact of the cultural Cold
                     War in which the superpowers vied for popular support at home and abroad. It lends
                     itself well to the kind of close readings of descriptions and prescriptions that
                     historians have honed since the cultural turn of the 1980s. However, with its 290
                     pages and an index of more than 600 entries, this list of toponyms meets the “big
                     data” criteria set forth by Graham et al. to be “big
                     enough” for “computational intervention to make new

                     [<a class="ref" href="#grahametal2022">Graham et al. 2022</a>, p. 3]. HGIS provides another way of exploring
                     the guidebook’s officially approved image of Czechoslovakia as a destination of
                     Western tourism. It also allows for comparisons with the attractions represented by
                     guidebooks from other periods or produced by other publishers. In this way,
                     historical comparisons of guidebooks allow for diachronic studies of a destination’s
                     tourist attractions across political caesuras, thereby querying the relation between
                     politics and tourism from a new perspective.</div>

                  <div class="ptext" id="p10">Building a suitable corpus of guidebooks for exploration with HGIS involves several
                     methodological challenges. First, attempts to build long time series face the problem
                     of genre fluidity as the modern tourist guidebook is barely 200 years old. Before
                     the
                     publication of the first travel guides by Baedeker and Murray in the 1830s, travel
                     writers liberally mixed advice with art history, geology, folklore, and political
                     commentary. It was only with the introduction of authoritative, standardized, and
                     regularly updated texts for travellers in the middle of the nineteenth century that
                     travel writing and travel guide parted ways [<a class="ref" href="#schaff2022">Schaff 2022</a>]. To ensure
                     relative conformity of the compared texts, we recommend limiting a travel guide
                     corpus to modern, post-1830s guidebooks.</div>
                  
                  <div class="counter"><a href="#p11">11</a></div>
                  <div class="ptext" id="p11">The second challenge concerns the creation of a meaningful sample from the heaps of
                     modern guidebooks churned out by a vast number of publishing houses around the world
                     as leisure travel developed from an elite privilege to a mass phenomenon. In this
                     study, the focus is on the officially approved image of Czechoslovakia as represented
                     by travel guides produced by the state tourist agency targeted at foreigners. We
                     therefore chose to focus on two travel guides produced by the same organization
                     (Čedok), geared towards the same audience of relatively affluent foreigners with time
                     to spare for a longer journey abroad; <cite class="title italic">Guide to the Czechoslovak
                        Republic</cite>
                     [<a class="ref" href="#kral1928">Král 1928</a>], and <cite class="title italic">Czechoslovakia</cite>
                     [<a class="ref" href="#chysky1959">Chyský 1959</a>]. Čedok did not publish any similar travel guides for
                     foreign tourists between 1928 and 1959, only some small brochures. To provide further
                     historical contextualization we also compare with the 1905 Baedeker guide to
                     Austria–Hungary. While the German version of this Baedeker guidebook was regularly
                     updated until the outbreak of the First World War, the edition from 1905 was the
                     final one published in English before the eventual dissolution of the Habsburg
                     Empire. Čedok’s 1928 guidebook was published simultaneously in German and English,
                     while the Čedok/Nagel guidebook from 1959 was published simultaneously in German,
                     English, and French. We chose to compare the English editions of the three guidebooks
                     since minimizing the number of German toponyms in the corpus reduced the need for
                     disambiguating place names.</div>

                  <div class="ptext" id="p12">Working with twentieth century guidebooks entails a third methodological challenge.
                     As the personal idiosyncrasies of travel writing gave way to the formulaic
                     descriptions of frequently updated guidebooks the literary status of the genre
                     diminished. Twentieth century guidebooks attained an ephemeral quality similar to
                     grey literature with lasting consequences for preservation and access. Given the
                     short half-life and low literary standing of these books, library and archive
                     collections are often patchy. And even if one successfully locates a complete series
                     of a guidebook title, a fourth challenge emerges: twentieth century guidebooks rank
                     just about rock bottom of current digitization priorities. This is unsurprising, as
                     the preserved books are often in good conditions, oftentimes under copyright, and
                     perceived to be of marginal relevance to the national community’s cultural heritage.
                     Since we did not possess the means required for producing digitized editions with
                     high quality machine-readable text we opted for a simpler and more efficient method
                     to prepare the data for computer-assisted analysis. Instead of working with complete
                     guidebook texts we digitized, cleaned, and mapped only the toponyms included in the
                     guidebook indexes. This cost-saving method builds on the reasonable assumption that
                     the guidebook editors included all the places they deemed most relevant to foreign
                     tourists in the three indexes. Our assumption is supported by the fact that the
                     guidebooks contained comprehensive indexes (see Table 1) referring to an average of
                     2–3 unique toponym per content page. However, some of the toponyms are duplicates
                     as
                     the English-language indexes also included alternate names in Czech, Slovak, German,
                     and Hungarian. The precise number of toponyms and unique positions for each guidebook
                     is listed in table 1. Note that these numbers do not include indexed toponyms outside
                     the 1959 borders of Czechoslovakia, nor do they include geographic entities that are
                     not meaningfully represented by a single coordinate (e.g. rivers, mountain ranges,
                     large forests). Such toponyms are also excluded from the maps.</div>

                     the analysis is to identify continuity and change in tourist attractions — not to

                     every town or village mentioned in the travel guide merely to help readers navigate
                     from one attraction to another. In the process we excluded toponyms listed as
                     subentries under the bigger cities in the 1905 and 1959 guidebooks (such as palaces,
                     churches, and museums) since our focus is on the countrywide range of attractions.
                     Mapping the changing tourist geography of a city like Prague would undoubtedly yield
                     interesting results. However, precise geocoding at street level during a period of
                     rapid urban development would require manual labour beyond the scope of this project.

                     combined the gazetteers for Czechia, Slovakia, and Hungary and linked them with

                     toponyms featured in the travel guide indexes we supplemented the gazetteer with
                     English and German spelling variations from WikiData, bringing the total number of
                     languages to five. From the onset, our gazetteer thus contained 156,932 toponyms

                     Matching (ASM): the problem of declaring whether two non-identical strings of
                     characters match. It is a classical computer science problem that has inspired
                     numerous solutions in the form of metrics declaring a pair a match or not based on
                     a
                     predetermined threshold ([<a class="ref" href="#levenshtein1966">Levenshtein 1966</a>]; [<a class="ref" href="#navarro2001">Navarro 2001</a>]; [<a class="ref" href="#cohen_ravikumar_fienberg2003">Cohen, Ravikumar, and Fienberg 2003</a>]; [<a class="ref" href="#davisjr_desalles2007">Davis Jr. and De Salles 2007</a>]). Machine Learning models offer another solution,
                     but while they tend to perform better, they also require training on large amounts
                     of
                     annotated data and typically lead to static models, needing retrained whenever new

With more than 3,000 toponyms to
                     geolocate and a need to minimize false positives, we opted for a very restrictive
                     threshold to ensure that only highly similar toponyms were auto-matched

                     mapping its indexed toponyms along with the indexes of the 1905 and 1928 guidebooks.
                     Figure 1 shows the results, with each dot representing the coordinate of a toponym
                     within the borders of Cold War Czechoslovakia. Given our analytical focus on the
                     tourist attractions in 1959 we chose to map all guidebooks on the same projection
                     of
                     communist Czechoslovakia’s political borders. Our emphasis on the country’s cold war
                     borders admittedly yields a somewhat misleading impression of the earlier guidebooks
                     since the area’s political geography appeared entirely different during the
                     Austro-Hungarian Empire and the interwar period. Most importantly, in the Dual
                     Monarchy before the Great War the Czech lands belonged to Austria whereas Slovakia
                     constituted a part of Upper Hungary. Moreover, interwar Czechoslovakia also included
                     the area east of Slovakia known as Carpathian Ruthenia (part of present-day Ukraine).
                     We nevertheless decided to exclude Ruthenian toponyms from our analysis since this
                     poor and remote region cursorily mentioned in the 1928 guidebook was transferred to
                     the Soviet Union after the Second World War and thus did not feature in the 1959

                     distinctive sandstone rock formations; and the High Tatra Mountains on Slovakia’s

                     western half of present-day Czechia) and thinner distribution in the mountainous
                     Slovakia compared to the 1959 guidebook’s more balanced representation of Czech and
                     Slovak attractions. (Note here that the overall “lower temperature” of the 1959

                  <div class="ptext" id="p20">The high density of attractions in Bohemia on the 1905 and 1928 maps is an expected
                     finding. Bohemia had traditionally been the richest and most populous part of the
                     country and the West Bohemian spa triangle outlined by Carlsbad (Karlovy Vary),
                     Marienbad (Mariánské Lázně), and Franzensbad (Františkovy Lázně) had a long history
                     of attracting visitors from far-away lands [<a class="ref" href="#large2015">Large 2015</a>]. The
                     borderland’s spa towns continued to cater to an international clientele after the
                     First World War while numerous historical castles perched on hilltops and charming
                     chateaux surrounded by romantic gardens provided spectacular tourist sights. The
                     pre-WWII density of attractions along the borders with present-day Austria, Germany,
                     and Poland illustrates the transformation of areas characterized by high hills and
                     deep forests into recreational sites for hiking, camping, and skiing in the early
                     twentieth century. These parts of the country, Bohemian Switzerland, the Bohemian
                     Forest (Šumava), and the Giant Mountains, were deemed such important tourist
                     attractions that they merited special fold-out maps in the 1928 guidebook,
                     underlining their touristic value and accessibility. Both the 1905 Baedeker and the
                     1928 Čedok guide also included detailed maps of the High Tatra Mountains, and the
                     area’s many summits, saddles, valleys, lakes, hiking routes, and huts were
                     meticulously described and indexed in all three guidebooks, which explains the
                     “high temperature” there.</div>

                  <div class="ptext" id="p21">More surprising, though, is the relatively thin representation of western Bohemia
                     in
                     the 1959 guidebook and the more balanced representation of Czech and Slovak
                     attractions. The first difference is a likely effect of the cold war militarization
                     of this region where the Warsaw Pact bordered directly with NATO. For security
                     reasons, the Czechoslovak authorities did not want western tourists roaming too close
                     to the state border, which at this point was not yet fully demarcated and fortified
                     [<a class="ref" href="#bechmannpedersen_noack2019">Bechmann Pedersen and Noack 2019</a>, p. 4]. The second difference
                     indicates an attempt to present the two parts of the country, the Czech lands and
                     Slovakia, as equally attractive, despite the latter’s more remote location from the
                     western tourist’s point of the view (which the guidebooks all adopted). Writing on
                     behalf of the new state’s official tourist organisation, Král seems to have
                     recognized the political obligation to give Slovakia a more detailed treatment
                     already in 1928; a concern that did not burden a commercial guidebook publisher like
                     Baedeker at the turn of the century. In his introduction, Král explained that
                     
                     <blockquote>
                        <p>The greatest attention is of course devoted to the
                           world famous Spas. But also those regions, which nature has endowed with such
                           uncommon attractions — notably in Slovakia and Subcarpathian Russia — and where
                           so far, the foreigner has only rarely found his way, are dealt with here,
                           allowing at least a rough idea to be formed by him, who would penetrate into
                           districts where both people and nature have a character of their own, even if
                           conditions are sometimes below the standard of comfortable tourism.

                     </blockquote> Král’s guidebook devoted just 48 of its
                     272 pages (18%) to Slovakia but it was nevertheless considered exemplary compared
                     to
                     contemporary handbooks on Czechoslovakia. Writing a few years later, a reviewer of
                     two English-language travel guides to Czechoslovakia (published outside the country)
                     held up the reviewed books against Kral’s and found Slovakia treated “in a very perfunctory way” and “rushed
                     through in a very cursory manner”
                     [<a class="ref" href="#jhr1931">J. H. R. 1931</a>, p. 371]. Three decades later, the authors of the 1959
                     guidebook were careful to steer clear of the exoticizing language enveloping Slovakia
                     and the historical bias towards attractions in Bohemia and Moravia. Numerically, 85
                     of its 290 pages (29%) covered Slovakia. </div>

                  <div class="ptext" id="p22">To further probe the (dis)continuities between the three guidebooks we analysed the
                     indexed toponyms with the help of a clustering algorithm. This method allowed us to
                     merge coordinates referring to the same tourist site. For instance, the 1959 index
                     contained an entry for “Bouzov, castle” while the 1928
                     index had an entry for “Bouzov”, the Moravian village next
                     to the castle. The geocoding process assigned different coordinates for the two
                     entries, but since the attraction is the same, the clustering algorithm is useful
                     to
                     group such entries under a single coordinate. The clustering process also eliminates
                     the problem that our multilingual gazetteer would sometimes contain near-identical
                     coordinates for identical toponyms. The clustering algorithm merged any points within
                     a radius of roughly 4 km calculated as the great-circle distance of the coordinates
                     into the same cluster. The low radius was chosen to avoid an avalanche of clustering
                     creating meaningless superclusters. When all positions within the radius had been
                     placed in the same cluster, the cluster’s coordinates were calculated as the
                     arithmetic mean of the member coordinates. The method allows for the subtraction of
                     clusters between maps, which renders the (dis)continuities more visible.</div>

                     spas, many of which had been popular with foreign guests since the nineteenth
                     century, e.g. Carlsbad, Marienbad, Franzensbad, Bad Königswart (Lázně Kynžvart), Bad
                     Gräfenberg (Lázně Jeseník), Pistyan (Kúpele Piešťany), and Kúpele Korytnica. The
                     clusters also contain some of the country’s picturesque old towns and famous castles
                     including Český Krumlov, Karlštejn, Kroměříž, Křivoklát, and Loket. Natural landmarks
                     such as peculiar rock formations, scenic cliffs, caves, forests, valleys, hills, and
                     mountains also feature in all three guidebooks. Among the historical landmarks with
                     an established pedigree as tourist attractions included in the books is the
                     Austerlitz battlefield near Brno where Napoleon defeated the Austrian and Russian
                     armies in 1806.</div>

                     outline above. The map includes 290 clusters comprised of 680 unique,
                     close-neighbouring positions. The map is largely identical to Figure 3, though it
                     includes even more famous castles and chateux (e.g. Pernštejn, Kost, and Zvíkov),
                     some of which had possibly been closed to the public or in poor condition around
                     1905. The shared clusters between 1928 and 1959 also contain some remotely located
                     dwellings such as the small Moravian town of Kralice where the humanistic scholar
                     Comenius worked on a famous bible translation in the seventeenth century. By 1959
                     a
                     Kralice Bible Museum had opened, which the communist-era guidebook hastened to stress

                     the attractions unique to each guidebook (Figures 5 and 6). Using the same clustering
                     algorithm we eliminated clusters containing toponyms from both indexes so that the
                     remaining points were attractions at least 4 km away from any attraction listed in
                     the other guide. Figure 5 thus shows the 480 toponym clusters (636 positions)
                     included in the 1928 guidebook but not present in the 1959 guidebooks. The figure
                     confirms the observation that the 1928 guidebook contained many more references to
                     attractions along the western borders and a heavier emphasis on Bohemia. In
                     comparison, the attractions unique to the 1959 guidebook (Figure 6) are
                     overwhelmingly located in Slovakia, especially around Komárno on the border to
                     Hungary and in the mountains of Central Slovakia. The Moravian Karst north of Brno
                     and the Haná region around Olomouc where the Javoříčské caves were discovered in 1938
                     also contains toponym clusters unique to the 1959 guidebook. Other unique toponyms
                     represent recently constructed dams and the new recreational areas that had sprung
                     up
                     in their vicinity (e.g. Brno and Slapy).</div>

                  <div class="ptext" id="p26">Returning to the question of the relation between politics and tourism, we can thus
                     conclude based on the toponym distribution maps that the 1959 Čedok editors departed
                     from their predecessors’ emphasis on Bohemia to present a more balanced picture of
                     Czechoslovakia. Otherwise, the result of this distant reading of guidebooks points
                     to
                     the continuity. With a 4 km clustering radius, the communist-era guidebook contains
                     290 clusters shared with the interwar guidebook and 173 unique clusters (193
                     positions). A closer look at the unique clusters show that many of them contain
                     attractions unconnected with the Czechoslovak railroad network. The editor of the
                     1928 guidebook had deliberately organized the text in accordance with the railways,
                     which explains why these harder-to-reach attractions feature exclusively in the 1959
                     guidebook. As Felix Jeschke writes about editor Jiří Král’s selection criteria,
                     “the railways were the network that made the country
                     accessible, offering a pre-ordered system of routes. Places not served by the
                     railway were not presented as destinations and had to be sought out by intrepid
                     travellers themselves.”
                     [<a class="ref" href="#jeschke2021">Jeschke 2021</a>, p. 81] Examples of such attractions added to the
                     1959 edition include the medieval castle of Smolenice, the baroque castle at
                     Milotice, the excavation of fossilised trilobites at Skryje, the remote Slovak
                     hunting grounds at Remetské Hámre, and the small wooden churches built in Byzantine
                     style near Svidník. The addition of sights like these support our argument that the
                     1959 guidebook presented a country rich in romantic attractions dating back
                     centuries.</div>

                     guidebook emphasized the country’s inherent appeal to tourists attracted by nature
                     and historical architecture: “The very many natural beauties of
                     Czechoslovakia make the country a tourist’s paradise”
                     [<a class="ref" href="#chysky1959">Chyský 1959</a>, p. 22]. The Czechoslovak landscape has a “fresh and green appearance”

                     [<a class="ref" href="#chysky1959">Chyský 1959</a>, p. 10]. As we have already shown, the country’s
                     numerous castles and chateaux featured prominently. Pernštejn is “one of the most valuable architectural monuments”
                     [<a class="ref" href="#chysky1959">Chyský 1959</a>, p. 133]. Karlštejn is “out of a

                     [<a class="ref" href="#chysky1959">Chyský 1959</a>, p. 62] and Konopiště was “sumptuously rebuilt”
                     [<a class="ref" href="#chysky1959">Chyský 1959</a>, p. 65]. Readers had to look carefully to find
                     tourist sites more explicitly related to contemporary politics or the history of
                     communism. For instance, the Slovak National Uprising against the German occupants
                     and their fascist collaborationists in August 1944 is relegated to a historical
                     sidenote in small print in the section on Banská Bystrica, the city where the
                     uprising took place. The museum dedicated to this event of considerable importance
                     to
                     the party’s self-understanding [<a class="ref" href="#radonic2014">Radonic 2014</a>, p. 492] is only

                     [<a class="ref" href="#chysky1959">Chyský 1959</a>, p. 219]. The scalable reading of the 1959 guidebook
                     produced by communist Czechoslovakia’s National Tourist Organization thus
                     demonstrates the continuity with the interwar branding of the country’s many tourist
                     sights.</div>

                  <div class="ptext" id="p28">In her work on heritage management in communist Czechoslovakia, Cathleen Giustino
                     [<a class="ref" href="#giustino2013">Giustino 2013</a>, p. 50] has shown how an ideological ambiguity
                     was at play in the country’s castles and chateaux. After the Second World War, dozens
                     of former aristocratic residences were confiscated and turned into state-owned
                     museums, which became popular sites of domestic tourism. And as party loyalists often
                     noted, the sites lacked clearly encoded ideological messages. The translation of
                     communist cultural policy into heritage management and tourist site administration
                     did not result in a simple eradication of the aristocratic material culture.
                     Communist leaders had more pressing concerns than exhibition design at backwater
                     tourist sites, leaving art historians and tour guides some discretion to promote
                     their site’s high-cultural attractions. Our scalable reading of the 1959 guidebook
                     suggests that its editors also had the liberty to steer clear of awkward ideological
                     messages that could rub western readers the wrong way. Instead, the book appears
                     tailored to the educated and historically interested international audience.
                     Returning to the guidebook author’s dilemma recounted in the US embassy cable, our
                     analysis shows that the editors eventually opted for continuity, including many of
                     the attractions already mentioned in the 1905 and 1928 guidebooks. This tendency can
                     be traced back to stylish photo books published by Artia, the state publishing house,
                     since 1953, showcasing the beauties of Prague, as well as castles and chateaux,
                     interspersed with images of socialist society [<a class="ref" href="#paulous1953">Paulouš 1953</a>]. Books
                     like these were sold at the Brussels Expo in 1958 where the Czechoslovak pavilion
                     also introduced visitors to historic monuments with photos of castles and chateaux,
                     hoping that it would attract foreign tourists to Czechoslovakia [<a class="ref" href="#giustino2012">Giustino 2012</a>, p. 208].<a class="noteRef" href="#d3e744">[13]</a> This
                     hope, however, remained frustrated for a few more years. It was only by the mid-1960s
                     that Western tourists started to arrive in Czechoslovakia in significant numbers and
                     not until 1978 did the total number of visitors from non-socialist countries exceed
                     one million [<a class="ref" href="#franke1984">Franke 1984</a>, p. 380]. Still, the attempts to
                     “normalize” the image of communist Czechoslovakia in the West and reassert
                     its status as a worthy destination of international tourism began already in the
                     1950s. By building on the legacy of romantic attractions established in the
                     nineteenth century, Čedok tailored the guidebook to western audiences and showcased
                     the entire country as ready for consumption by foreign visitors.</div>

                     Cold War was at the centre of the first form of tourism, it was a contextual
                     chronological marker in the second [<a class="ref" href="#bechmannpedersen_noack2019">Bechmann Pedersen and Noack 2019</a>, p. 4–8]. The visualization of toponyms presented in this article allows for
                     a distant reading of tourist attractions in Czechoslovakia and illustrates the
                     symbolic continuity with the pre-war era, undisturbed by the Cold War, which our
                     close reading also supported. Naturally, this was only symbolic. It goes without
                     mentioning that the experiences of western tourists on the ground differed greatly
                     from those of the interwar period, and that other sources than guidebooks are needed
                     for research into this matter. Still, our scalable reading reveals the symbolic
                     attempt by Czechoslovak authorities to normalize tourist relations across the Iron
                     Curtain and re-integrate communist Czechoslovakia in the international tourist
                     industry by perpetuating a pre-socialist tourist legacy. Our study has thus shown
                     the
                     efficacy of analysing travel guides with HGIS and pointed out a promising new
