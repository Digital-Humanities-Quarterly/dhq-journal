            Comparing different versions or “variants” of fiction has a long scholarly history and requires large amounts of labor. While a number of tools exist to assist in comparison of textual variants, we introduce a suite of scripts to allow scholars with even limited technical background to detect and visualize these edits across the progression of the text. Within this, we propose a novel methodology for the classification of edits in variants, which may in the future be incorporated into any variant analysis tool or assist textual scholarship more broadly. We demonstrate this proposed methodology on three variants of Andy Weir’s science fiction novel, The Martian.

         <p>Abstract</p>
         <p>This paper introduces Coleto, an automatic collation
                tool for the comparison of variant texts in English, German, or French, which
                separates edits from variant texts so that textual changes can be classified and
                contextualized. Coleto’s proposed methodology for the classification of edits in
                variants includes: major/minor expansion, major/minor condensation, changes to
                numbers and whitespace, and common orthographic features. From this classification
                schema, Coleto generates: an aligned table of edits in the variants, visualizations
                of the frequency of classified edits, and a visualization of edit density across the
                progression of the texts. As a sample use case, we present mixed-method analyses of
                Andy Weir’s science fiction bestseller, <hi rend="italic">The Martian</hi>, aided by
                Coleto’s functions and generated outputs. Code available at: <ref target="https://github.com/dh-trier/coleto">https://github.com/dh-trier/coleto</ref>

         <div>
            <head>1. Introduction</head>
            <p>This paper began with the desire to combine close
                    and distant reading to compare three versions (or “variants”) of Andy Weir’s
                    science fiction novel,
                    <hi rend="italic">The Martian </hi>(2011, 2014, 2016). We
                    wished to formally describe the changes to the texts made by two professional
                    edits, then interpret how these thousands of textual changes, some big but
                    mostly small, alter readings of the texts. While a number of automatic collation
                    and variant comparison tools exist, none of them easily provide information on
                    the textual changes that we were most interested in when analyzing <hi rend="italic">The Martian</hi>, including: (1) a visualization of edits
                    across the course of the entire texts; (2) all of the edits aligned and isolated
                    from their original textual contexts; and (3) automatic classification of these
                    thousands of edits. As no available tool performs all of these functions, we
                    created one, and now present Coleto, a Python suite which inputs two variant
                    text files (in English, German, or French) and creates a number of outputs: a
                    visualization of edits across the progression of the texts, which indicates
                    sections of the texts that contain greater or fewer edits; a .tsv table
                    containing all of the textual changes presented side-by-side and categorized by
                    type of edit; and visualizations of frequencies of edit types.<note>
                            Coleto is available on GitHub: <ref target="https://github.com/dh-trier/coleto">https://github.com/dh-trier/coleto</ref>, <ref target="https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.4569328">https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.4569328</ref>. </note>
            </p>
            <p> Interested users, even those with minimal coding
                    experience, may use Coleto to quickly gain a variety of information about their
                    variant texts. Comparing variant texts has a long scholarly history, yet to
                    perform genetic/textual criticism requires a great amount of manual work:
                    scholars place the variants side by side and read them through closely, pen or
                    highlighter in hand. Coleto can reduce the massive effort of manual comparison
                    and provide faster and easier access to all of the edits in variant texts,
                    classified and presented in easy-to-use formats. With Coleto, philologists and
                    scholars of genetic/textual criticism may gain speed, new information and new
                    precision, at worst, and new insights, at best. </p>
            <p> Coleto’s primary methodological improvement to
                    collation is our suggested classification of edits in variants. Collation tools
                    have previously provided information on insertion, deletion, and (sometimes)
                    transposition, but the study of some variant texts may be improved by additional
                    rule-based classification: expansion major/minor, condensation major/minor, as
                    well as common orthographic features including punctuation (e.g. commas),
                    hyphenation (e.g. large-ish → largish), whitespace (e.g. in to → into),
                    capitalization (e.g. earth → Earth), and italics (e.g. again → <hi rend="italic">again</hi>). We also defined another type of edit, “numbers”, for edits
                    common in <hi rend="italic">The Martian</hi>, e.g. 4 → four, or abbreviations
                    involving numbers, e.g. 80 km → 80 kilometers.</p>

            </head>
            <p>
               <hi rend="italic">The Martian</hi> by Andy Weir is a
                    best-selling science fiction novel about an astronaut named Mark Watney who is
                    stranded alone on Mars. Using science and ingenuity, Watney secures food, water,
                    oxygen, and shelter, establishes communication with NASA back on Earth, and
                    finally reaches a spaceship that enables his rescue. The text of <hi rend="italic">The Martian</hi> exists in three complete variants. Weir
                    originally self-published <hi rend="italic">The Martian</hi> on his personal
                    website in 2011 (hereafter, <hi rend="italic">Martian1</hi> or <hi rend="italic">M1</hi>), then began selling it on Amazon.com in 2012, for 99 cents, where
                    it sold 35,000 copies in three months (Alter 2017). A major New York publisher,
                    Crown, no doubt impressed by this self-publishing success, bought the rights
                    from Weir, edited the text, and re-released it in 2014 (hereafter, <hi rend="italic">Martian2</hi> or <hi rend="italic">M2</hi>). Describing this
                    edit from <hi rend="italic">Martian1</hi> to <hi rend="italic">Martian2</hi> in
                    interviews, Weir has said, “The editing process was pretty smooth. It was not a
                    lot of changes at all” (Savage 2015), as well as, conversely, “...there were a
                    lot of edits and changes... No significant plot changes, nothing like that, but
                    a lot of the wording. It’s much more polished” (Debic 2014). A third variant was
                    published by Crown in 2016, <hi rend="italic">The Martian: Classroom
                        Edition</hi>, which removes the text’s extensive profanity to market the
                    novel to educational audiences (hereafter,
                    <hi rend="italic">Martian3 </hi>or <hi rend="italic">M3</hi>). Explaining this decision, Weir stated, “I got a lot of emails
                    from science teachers who said, ‘Man I’d love to use your book as a teaching
                    aid, but there’s so much profanity in it that we can’t really do that’” (Alter
                    2017). </p>
            <p> Our experiments first seek to formally describe the
                    textual changes in the professional edits to <hi rend="italic">The Martian</hi>,
                    especially as Weir’s inconsistent public statements on the first edit make it
                    unclear how extensive this editing process was. Figure 1 summarizes the textual
                    variation between <hi rend="italic">Martian1</hi>, <hi rend="italic">Martian2</hi>, and Martian3, as performed by the statistics feature of
                    Wdiff (von Gagern 2014).<note>

                            Wdiff defines “changed” as “A changed word is one that has been replaced or is part of a replacement.” Deletion and Insertion thus refer to words which are added or removed with words taking their place in the text. <ref target="https://www.gnu.org/software/wdiff/manual/wdiff.html">https://www.gnu.org/software/wdiff/manual/wdiff.html</ref>
               </note>
            </p>
            <p>Quantitatively, Wdiff’s collation statistics lends
                    weight to Weir’s statement that there were “not a lot of changes at all” in the
                    first edit to <hi rend="italic">The Martian</hi>, as 92.4% of his self-published
                    version is shared with the Crown Publishers edition. But 7.6% is not an
                    insubstantial textual change, as changing even a few words in a literary text
                    can potentially alter its interpretation. The basic collation provided by Wdiff
                    thus leaves many questions about both edits to <hi rend="italic">The
                        Martian</hi> unanswered. Are there passages or sections of <hi rend="italic">The Martian</hi> that received especially high amounts of edits? How many
                    edits comprise the 6,319 words transformed to 9,205 words in the first edit, or
                    the words changed in the second edit? Are the edits mostly minor corrections to
                    e.g. punctuation, or more substantial changes such as added paragraphs? Are the
                    edits long or short? How many of these edits can be automatically classified,
                    and classified how? Did <hi rend="italic">Martian3</hi>, the “Classroom Edition”
                    (intended to remove profanity for student readers) alter any text <hi rend="italic">besides</hi> the profanity? And moving on to interpretation,
                    how do the hundreds of minor textual changes, such as capitalization and the
                    rendering of numbers and scientific abbreviations, alter readings of the texts?
                    To begin to answer these, we apply Coleto to the texts.</p>

            <p>A number of tools exist to assist in comparison of
                    textual variants. Wdiff compares text files on a word-per-word basis and
                    provides statistics of insertions, deletions, and changes (von Gagern 2014).
                    Archival and philological websites allow parallel visual inspection of variants

                    2015). The Versioning Machine is a long-running open-source tool that displays
                    variant texts and manuscript images side-by-side, with a number of changes
                    highlighted (Schreibman et al., 2003). Juxta and its web-based interface Juxta
                    Commons provided user-friendly collation and visualization of changes in plain
                    text files (Wheeles and Jensen 2013). Juxta Commons as a web service was shut
                    down in September 2020, although its source code remains online.<note>

               </note> CollateX is advanced software for textual collation providing
                    users with alignment tables as well as a visualization of variant changes as a
                    word-level graph (Dekker &amp; Middell 2011). TRAViz provides sophisticated
                    collation and aims to improve on CollateX’s visualization methodology (Jänicke
                    et al. 2015; Jänicke and Wrisley 2017). Elisa Nury has introduced the PyCoviz
                    tool to visualize collation based on CollateX (2019). Other tools not
                    specifically focused on variant comparison could also be useful for variant
                    comparison tasks, for instance TRACER, a suite for detection of text re-use
                    (Büchler et al. 2014).</p>
            <p> Different users and their research tasks will be
                    drawn to one or more of these collation tools over the other. While existing
                    collation suites generally approach collation visualization through side-by-side
                    comparison of text chunks or sentence-level comparison, Coleto takes a different
                    approach: to identify and separate all of the edits in variant texts, classified
                    by rule-based methods and presented in output documents and visualizations. This
                    assists our close and distant reading of <hi rend="italic">The Martian</hi>, as
                    we wished to interpret the cumulative effect of hundreds of minor textual
                    changes. As digital humanities collation tools can and do build upon one
                    another, Coleto’s open-source code and methodology for classifying edits can be
                    incorporated into any other collation suite. </p>
            <p>In addition to work in digital genetic criticism
                    (e.g. van Hulle 2008, Ferrer 2011), previous studies which apply digital methods
                    to the interpretation of variants of relatively recent fiction include Yufang
                    Ho’s comparison of the 1966 and revised 1977 versions of John Fowles’s novel <hi rend="italic">The Magus</hi> (2011). Martin Paul Eve examined differences in
                    the U.S. and U.K. editions of David Mitchell’s <hi rend="italic">Cloud
                        Atlas</hi>, including collation and comparison of a single character’s
                    narrative, arguing that “textual variance [is] an element of <hi rend="italic">Cloud Atlas</hi> that can and should be <hi rend="italic">read</hi>” (Eve
                    2016, 27; Eve 2019), an assertion that we follow. In addition, Thomas Crombez
                    and Edith Cassiers have analyzed Luc Perceval’s adaptation of Dostoyevsky’s <hi rend="italic">The Brothers Karamazov</hi> into a theater play, based on
                    extensive materials from the director’s Dropbox account and using Neil Fraser’s
                    “diff_match_patch” library to great effect (Crombez and Cassiers 2017).</p>

            <head>4. Advancing the classification of edits in
                    variant texts</head>
            <p>Existing schemas to classify edits in variant texts
                    have so far been limited. The established methodology for classifying edits in
                    scholarly editing is based on a distinction between “accidentals” and
                    “substantives”, as defined by the widely-used Greg-Bowers tradition, which is
                    also included, for instance, in the MLA Committee on Scholarly Editions’ <hi rend="italic">Guidelines for Editors of Scholarly Editions</hi> (Modern
                    Language Association, 2011).<note> Greg-Bowers was originally designed for the disciplinary goal of interpreting authorial intention, and although authorial intention as the dominant paradigm of textual criticism and scholarly editing was disrupted in the 1980s, notably with Jerome J. McGann’s A Critique of
                                Modern Textual
                                Criticism (1983), and scholars have continued to evolve the goals of textual criticism and scholarly editing, the fundamental methodological categories of the Greg-Bowers tradition have persisted. Scholars are not unanimous in supporting
                                Greg-Bowers, for instance G. Thomas Tanselle, who found the terms
                                “accidentals” and “substantives” to be “misleading and often
                                untenable in their implication of a firm distinction in all cases”
                                (Greetham, 1992, pp. 335-36).</note> Importantly for
                    digital texts, there is no widely-applicable or widely-followed typology of
                    edits in digital scholarly editing and collation, with different materials
                    calling for different typologies (TEI-L 2016). We therefore suggest the
                    following categories of edits in variant texts, as integrated in Coleto (Table
                    1).</p>

                        1. Coleto’s classification schema for types
                        of edits in variants of text.</p>
            <p>Script-identifiable edits are those that can be
                    confidently classified into types based on formal linguistic features alone;
                    these include changes related to capitalization, whitespace, hyphenation,
                    spelling of numbers, and changes to scientific abbreviations. For the rest of
                    the edits that cannot be easily defined in a rule-based way, we classify them
                    based on the nature and extent of the edit, under the proposed term,
                    “Semantically Open Edits”: the well-established categories in existing collation
                    tools of deletion and insertion, but supplemented by expansion and condensation
                    categories. For the latter two, a distinction between small and large edits is
                    beneficial, but the choice is (perhaps inevitably) an arbitrary one. For the
                    following experiments, we defined “major” edits as having a Levenshtein distance
                    greater than 5,<note>
                            Levenshtein distance is a metric for quantifying the difference between two strings: this counts each character-level addition, deletion or transformation required to turn one string into another string. Each individual edit may concern several directly adjacent words, which is why many edits involve Levenshtein distances higher than 5. In the edit from <hi rend="italic">M1 </hi>to<hi rend="italic"> M2</hi>, 2634 (or 49.7%) of the edits are minor and
                                2664 (or 50.3%) are major, according to our definition. The median
                                Levenshtein difference we observed was 4. For a discussion of this
                                and other methods of approximate string matching, see Navarro,
                                2001.</note> but users of Coleto may select their own
                    preferred Levenshtein value in the configuration file.</p>

            </head>
            <p>As its target audience is humanities researchers,
                    Coleto is designed for ease of use, so users need only download the code from
                    GitHub, place two variant texts in.txt format in the Data folder, choose
                    configurations in the config.yaml file, and run the run_coleto Python script.
                    Coleto then performs the following tasks: (1) Preprocessing of texts: splits
                    texts into one sentence per line to prepare for alignment; (2) Align texts using
                    Wdiff; (3) Perform analysis: rule-based detection and classification of edits;
                    (4) Generate overview table; and (5) Generate statistics and visualizations.</p>
            <p>Coleto also generates a number of outputs, the first
                    being a data table in the .tsv format of all the edits in the variants, aligned
                    in one convenient place (Table 2).</p>

                    the .tsv table generated by Coleto. The next visualization is of our suggested,

                    <hi rend="italic">M1 </hi>to <hi rend="italic">M2</hi>,
                    which provide evidence for a commentator to reconcile author Andy Weir’s
                    conflicting statements on the first edit: “It was not a lot of changes at all”,
                    and “...there were a lot of edits and changes... No significant plot changes,
                    nothing like that, but a lot of the wording”. While changes to hyphenation,
                    capitalization, etc. may be of interest to some research tasks, they are
                    undoubtedly of little interest to others, and the assignment of edits into finer
                    classifications assists researchers in isolating the specific edits they wish to
                    examine.</p>
            <p>The third visualization generated by Coleto renders
                    all of the edits across the progression of the texts (Figure 5).
                    Script-identifiable and “other edits” are visualized as different series, with
                    the value of each series calculated by the sum of the absolute Levenshtein
                    distances for each sentence of the text, with Savitzky-Golay smoothing
                        applied.<note>
                            Savitzky-Golay filtering is a smoothing algorithm relying on a least-squares based, best-fit method, originally developed to filter out noise-induced variation in data while producing minimal distortions of the actual signal (see Savitzky and Golay, 1964). </note>

            <p>The data and visualizations generated by Coleto may
                    assist in a variety of formal, hermeneutic, and mixed-method studies. In this
                    section, we return to our original goal of investigating textual issues in
                    variants of <hi rend="italic">The Martian</hi>, which can also illustrate
                    Coleto’s benefits for researchers.</p>

                        in profanity</head>
               <p>Profanity is a key stylistic feature
                        of<hi rend="italic"> The Martian</hi>, as exemplified
                        by the novel’s opening lines in <hi rend="italic">M1</hi> and <hi rend="italic">M2</hi>: “I’m pretty much fucked. That’s my considered
                        opinion. Fucked.” Profanity may be the most important stylistic feature in
                        the textual history of <hi rend="italic">The Martian</hi>, as the <hi rend="italic">raison d'être</hi> for an entire variant, <hi rend="italic">M3</hi>, the “Classroom Edition,” was to remove the
                        novel’s copious profanity for educational audiences. Profanity is also a
                        touchstone for issues of censorship and commercialization in discourse
                        around the film adaptation of <hi rend="italic">The Martian</hi>. While the
                        film only explicitly includes two verbal instances of <hi rend="italic">fuck</hi>, the offending word is also written on screen and alluded to
                        a number of other times, as Jacob Brogan writes: “[<hi rend="italic">fuck</hi> is] often suggested in the way that sex might be in a
                        different sort of all-ages movie.” (Brogan 2015). Brogan reads <hi rend="italic">The Martian</hi> film’s limited use of <hi rend="italic">fuck</hi> as a metafictional device, the film “pointedly nodding to its
                        own limitations [... and] making reference to one of the most bizarre
                        guidelines of the MPAA’s PG-13 rating, the principle that a film can include
                        only one, and in some very rare cases two, (non-sexual) uses of the word.”
                        Brogan also suggests Watney’s frequent use of <hi rend="italic">fuck</hi> as
                        emblematic of the character’s psychology: “Indeed, Watney’s access to the
                        one thing he’s not supposed to say — and his willingness to keep saying
                        it — indexes his indomitability.” As another impression, <hi rend="italic">The
                            Martian</hi> foregrounds the use of conversational American English to
                        render almost all of its narrative, a tone underscored by its frequent
                        profanity. An improved formal understanding of profanity in <hi rend="italic">The Martian</hi> texts could thus support a variety of
                        research questions.</p>
               <p> While locating profanity in texts is a simple
                        matter of query, Coleto’s generated tables bring additional speed and
                        convenience to comparing the profanity in <hi rend="italic">M2</hi> and <hi rend="italic">M3</hi> (Table 3), while the generated visualizations
                        provide additional context (Figure 6).</p>

                            6: Visualization by Coleto of edits between <hi rend="italic">Martian2</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Martian3</hi> across the progression of the texts (Script-identifiable Edits in red, Semantically Open Edits in blue).</p>
               <p>Note that the y-axis is much smaller here than in Figure 5, as the edit from
                        <hi rend="italic">Martian2 </hi>to <hi rend="italic">Martian3</hi> (removing and replacing profanity) was much smaller than
                        the edit from <hi rend="italic">Martian1</hi> to <hi rend="italic">Martian2</hi>. The large spike around sentence 3600 in Figure 6
                        demonstrates how Coleto highlights areas of large edits which scholars may
                        wish to investigate further. In this case, however, the explanation is
                        mundane: small textual variation surrounding a particularly long string of
                        code that NASA sends to Watney on Mars.</p>

               <p>Manually reviewing the separated edits in

                        etc. As some examples beyond corporeal profanity, “Jesus Christ” is changed
                        to a secular “Wow<hi rend="italic">”</hi>, “Thank God” is removed, and a

                        criticized the spirit of the edit and noted inconsistencies, such as another
                        instance of <hi rend="italic">Jesus Christ </hi>that
                        remains in the text.</p>
               <p>None of the bowdlerization in <hi rend="italic">Martian3</hi> is surprising, as the express purpose of the text was to
                        remove or reduce profanity and other potentially offensive content. But we
                        wished to also know whether <hi rend="italic">Martian3</hi> altered any text
                            <hi rend="italic">besides</hi> potentially offensive content — perhaps
                        Weir or his editors used the occasion of a new edition to make some final
                        corrections? — and the table generated by Coleto can quickly answer this
                        question, as well. By manual inspection and sifting of the dataframe, it
                        emerges that <hi rend="italic">Martian3</hi> also makes factual corrections
                        to scientific details, as well as occasional replacement of continuous verbs
                        and other minor stylistic features (Table 4).</p>

                            4. Selection of edits from <hi rend="italic">Martian2</hi> to <hi rend="italic">Martian3</hi>, including manually added comments.</p>
               <p> By separating and classifying edits, Coleto can
                        also serve as an exploratory research tool by assisting in the spotting of
                        non-obvious trends. For instance, manually inspecting the data table of
                        changes from the earlier <hi rend="italic">Martian1</hi> to <hi rend="italic">Martian2</hi>, we stumbled upon the discovery that
                        profanity was cut in this first edit, as well. This was a surprise, given
                        the large frequency and foregroundedness of profanity in <hi rend="italic">Martian2</hi>. It emerges that in the first edit of <hi rend="italic">The Martian</hi>, from self-published novel to major publishing house
                        release, <hi rend="italic">fuck</hi> and <hi rend="italic">shit</hi> (and
                        their word forms) were substantially reduced, by about 33% and 15%,
                        respectively. Numerous other words and phrases were also softened with
                        “lesser” profanity, more varied profanity, or non-profanity (e.g. “the shit
                        hits the fan” → “all hell breaks loose”) in the first edit. </p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">The Martian</hi> thus has the
                        dubious distinction of having been bowdlerized three times: in <hi rend="italic">M2</hi>, which reduced profanity significantly, the
                        thorough scrubbing of profanity in <hi rend="italic">M3</hi>, the “Classroom
                        Edition,” and finally in the film adaptation, which abided by a (reported)
                        film board’s code of two <hi rend="italic">fuck</hi>s allowed, but winked at
                        the audience through additional implied profanity. This textual history
                        should inform readings of profanity in any variant or adaptation of <hi rend="italic">The Martian</hi>, and perhaps any discussion of the
                        protagonist Mark Watney’s nonconformist characterization.</p>

               <head>6.2 Interpreting changes to numbers and
                        abbreviations</head>
               <p>When comparing variants manually, or even with
                        existing collation tools, it can be difficult to gain a sense of the
                        frequency and distribution of edits, especially very minor stylistic edits.
                        For instance, in the first edit of <hi rend="italic">The Martian</hi>, it is
                        readily apparent that numerous minor stylistic/orthographic changes have
                        been made to the way scientific abbreviations and numbers are written, such
                        as “L” → “liter” and “8” → “eight”, but existing variant analysis tools
                        provide no simple way to quantify these and gain a sense of this type of
                        edit’s distribution.</p>
               <p>From the script-identifiable edits of <hi rend="italic">The Martian</hi>, Coleto classifies 868 edits to the
                        rendering of numbers and scientific values in the first edit, from <hi rend="italic">M1</hi> to <hi rend="italic">M2</hi>. While individual
                        instances of such numerical changes may seem interpretively insignificant,
                        hundreds of them scattered across the text have a <hi rend="italic">cumulative</hi> effect upon readings of the text. In protagonist Mark
                        Watney’s narration in <hi rend="italic">Martian1</hi>, the use of cardinal
                        numbers and short scientific abbreviations support the fiction that Watney
                        is a scientist working in dangerous conditions, too focused on surviving the
                        life-threatening conditions on Mars to bother writing “kilometers” or
                        “forty-one” out in full. Plausibility is a central concern of science
                        fiction (Stockwell 2014), and when such abbreviations and numerals are
                        expanded in <hi rend="italic">Martian2</hi>, this may increase readability,
                        but weakens the stylistic realism of Watney’s voice.</p>
               <p>In <hi rend="italic">Martian1</hi>, however,
                        Weir did not only write “L” for “liter” or “8” for “eight” in the voice of
                        astronaut Mark Watney, but also in the third-person narration of the NASA
                        scientists back on Earth, which has a jarring effect on readability (Table
                        5):</p>

               <p>In addition to plausibility, scientific rigor is
                        another central concern of science fiction (Stockwell 2014, 78), especially
                        the subgenre of “hard science fiction,” and Weir pays careful attention to
                        the accuracy of scientific and mathematical explanations throughout <hi rend="italic">The Martian</hi>. Weir went as far as to code a computer
                        program that plotted the trajectory of the fictional <hi rend="italic">Hermes</hi> spacecraft to ensure scientific accuracy in <hi rend="italic">The Martian</hi>. Weir’s dedication to scientific accuracy
                        was so great that a NASA scientist later reviewed Weir’s trajectory
                        calculations, and concluded that Weir had gotten them right (Burke 2015). </p>
               <p>In the process of writing and publishing <hi rend="italic">Martian1</hi> online, readers occasionally pointed out
                        corrections to mathematics and science presented in the novel, which Weir
                        then incorporated (Dickerson 2015)<hi rend="italic">.</hi> While locating
                        these scientific corrections in the variants of <hi rend="italic">The

                        numerical digits. The side-by-side data table generated by Coleto, however,
                        greatly speeds up this manual search (Table 6).</p>

               <p>The most substantial spike in Coleto’s
                        visualization of edits between <hi rend="italic">M1</hi> and <hi rend="italic">M2</hi> in Figure 5, above, occurs at the very end of the
                        novel: the removal of the 263-word epilogue at the end of <hi rend="italic">Martian1</hi> and a 255-word addition at the end of <hi rend="italic">Martian2</hi>, which substantially alters the novel’s closure. In both
                            <hi rend="italic">M1</hi> and <hi rend="italic">M2</hi>, Watney, finally
                        safely aboard the rescue spacecraft, is happy to be alive and states, “This
                        is the happiest day of my life.” In <hi rend="italic">Martian1</hi>,
                        however, a brief epilogue follows this. Some time after his rescue in space,
                        Watney, now safely back on Earth, is employed by NASA to train the crew of
                        an upcoming space mission. Watney sits upon a bench, killing time, when a
                        young boy recognizes him as the famous astronaut. Watney tolerates the boy’s
                        attention, until the boy poses a question: </p>
               <p>“So Mr. Watney,” the
                            boy said, “If you could go to Mars again, like, if there was another
                            mission and they wanted you to go, would you go?”</p>
               <p>Watney scowled at him.
                            “You out of your fucking mind?”</p>
               <p>“Ok time to go,” the
                            mom said, quickly herding the boy away. They receded in to [sic] the
                            crowded sidewalk.</p>
               <p>Watney snorted in
                            their direction. Then he closed his eyes and felt the sun on his face.
                            It was a nice, boring afternoon. (<hi rend="italic">M1</hi>,
                        331-32)</p>
               <p>This is a typical epilogue in fiction, as
                        defined by the Russian Formalist Boris Eikhenbaum: it sets the perspective
                        by a shift in time and provides some sort of after-history of the major
                        characters (Torgovnick, 1981, p.11). This epilogue of <hi rend="italic">M1</hi> may be read to evince the lack of internal growth by Watney,
                        who remains emotionally disengaged and contemptuous of playing the role of
                        hero. Watney’s harrowing adventures on Mars have not altered his
                        nonconformist characterization, a nonconformity encapsulated throughout the
                        text by — and on the final page of the novel, reiterated by — the most
                        foregrounded stylistic feature in the novel: profanity. The epilogue of <hi rend="italic">M1</hi> also shuts the door on potential sequels, which
                        could be read as authorial and textual nonconformity with commercial
                        expectations for science fiction novels.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Martian2</hi>, however, cuts
                        this pessimistic epilogue and inserts a substantial amount of optimistic
                        text just before the novel’s end. In <hi rend="italic">M2</hi>’s new ending,
                        Watney expresses gracious appreciation for all the parties involved in his
                        rescue — his crewmates, NASA, the Chinese space program, the billions of
                        people who hoped for his survival — and affirms a widespread faith in human
                        nature: </p>
               <p>The cost for my
                            survival must have been hundreds of millions of dollars. All to save one
                            dorky botanist. Why bother?</p>
               <p>Well, okay. I know the
                            answer to that. Part of it might be what I represent: progress, science,
                            and the interplanetary future we’ve dreamed of for centuries. But
                            really, they did it because every human being has a basic instinct to
                            help each other out. It might not seem that way sometimes, but it’s
                            true. (<hi rend="italic">M2</hi>, 368-69)</p>
               <p>This greatly alters the tone of the novel’s
                        ending, revises Watney’s growth and characterization, and now leaves open
                        the possibility of sequels. The correlation between reduced profanity in <hi rend="italic">M2</hi> and Watney’s character is notable: as the text
                        itself becomes more conformist, so does its protagonist.</p>

            <head>7. Conclusion and future work</head>
            <p>A traditional scholar who sat down to compare the
                    first two variants of <hi rend="italic">The Martian</hi> would possibly, but
                    possibly not, have noticed the reduced profanity, although the changed epilogue
                    is impossible to miss. If such a scholar were sufficiently rigorous and willing
                    to invest the necessary time, they would undoubtedly locate the corrected
                    science and note the changes to abbreviations, numerals, and other minor
                    stylistic aspects, as well. Coleto, like any collation tool, does not seek to
                    replace such diligent genetic criticism, but to supplement it with speedier
                    information and new precision, as well as provide a method that scales to longer
                    texts which may challenge the time and patience of scholars performing manual
                    comparison of variant texts.</p>
            <p>Coleto could naturally be adapted per research
                    topic, and may hopefully be useful for critical interest in, <hi rend="italic">inter alia</hi>, variants of fiction, the role of the editor, and text
                    re-use. Some tantalizing use cases for comparing variants of fiction come from
                    the rapidly emerging global phenomenon of digital self-published
                        best-sellers,<note> Examples of this phenomenon include <hi rend="italic">Fifty Shades of
                                Grey</hi> (originally published as fan-fiction and later at author E.L. James’ website) and <hi rend="italic">Wu
                            Kong</hi> (a Chinese Internet novel turned big-budget action film). Some 40 self-published authors on Amazon had sold over a million copies of their e-books by 2016 (Alter 2016), while Hollywood is reportedly “snapping up” self-published authors in 2017 (Kean 2017). </note>
                    in which, like <hi rend="italic">The Martian</hi>, texts often exist in a
                    self-published variant as well as a later professionally-edited variant.</p>
            <p>A significant weakness of Coleto is its inability to
                    detect transpositions, as it relies on Wdiff for collation. For instance, Wdiff
                    does not detect if a sentence is removed, but then replaced a few pages later in
                    the novel — Coleto would classify this as an unrelated deletion and insertion.
                    While Coleto could be integrated with transposition-detecting software in the
                    future, for now, a pragmatic research suggestion would be to use Coleto in
                    tandem with CollateX (Dekker &amp; Middell, 2011), as described e.g. in Schöch
                    (2016). Comparing <hi rend="italic">Martian1</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Martian2</hi> in CollateX results in 98 transpositions detected. Of these,
                    10 involve punctuation and should be considered artefacts of the method. Another
                    33 represent transpositions of a single word, showing stylistic preferences on
                    the word-order level. Yet another 21 concern multi-word expressions which change
                    the overall construction of a sentence or paragraph more substantially. Finally,
                    34 concern segments of more than 5 words, typically in the range of a short
                    phrase to several sentences. In all cases, the scope of movement is rather
                    small, with transpositions remaining very localized phenomena. This inspection
                    of transpositions in this test case shows that, quantitatively and above all
                    qualitatively, transpositions were not a major part of the first edit to <hi rend="italic">The Martian</hi>, but naturally this step might play a greater
                    role in variants of other texts.</p>
            <p>For further work on Coleto, we plan to pursue the
                    quantitative investigation into the semantics of edits by using word embedding
                    models, thereby quantifying the amount of actual semantic distance between two
                    tokens in an edit, rather than the surface-level Levenshtein distance. Some
                    notable challenges we expect are defining edits concerning spelling mistakes
                    (where misspelled words may not be in a model’s vocabulary) and edits involving
                    different numbers of words (where it is not obvious which words establish
                    semantic distance).</p>
