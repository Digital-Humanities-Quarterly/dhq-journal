        <div>
            <head>1. Introduction</head>
            <p>This paper began with the desire to combine close and distant reading to compare
               three versions (or <term>variants</term>) of Andy Weir’s science fiction novel, <title
                  rend="italic">The Martian </title>(2011, 2014, 2016). We wished to formally describe
               the changes to the texts made by two professional edits, then interpret how these
               thousands of textual changes, some big but mostly small, alter readings of the texts.
               While a number of automatic collation and variant comparison tools exist, none of
               them easily provide information on the textual changes that we were most interested
               in when analyzing <title rend="italic">The Martian</title>, including: (1) a visualization
               of edits across the course of the entire texts; (2) all of the edits aligned and
               isolated from their original textual contexts; and (3) automatic classification of
               these thousands of edits. As no available tool performs all of these functions, we
               created one, and now present Coleto, a Python suite which inputs two variant text
               files (in English, German, or French) and creates a number of outputs: a
               visualization of edits across the progression of the texts, which indicates sections
               of the texts that contain greater or fewer edits; a .tsv table containing all of the
               textual changes presented side-by-side and categorized by type of edit; and
               visualizations of frequencies of edit types.<note> Coleto is available on GitHub:
                     <ref target="https://github.com/dh-trier/coleto"
                     >https://github.com/dh-trier/coleto</ref>, <ref
                     target="https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.4569328"
                     >https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.4569328</ref>. </note>
            </p>
            <p> Interested users, even those with minimal coding experience, may use Coleto to
               quickly gain a variety of information about their variant texts. Comparing variant
               texts has a long scholarly history, yet to perform genetic/textual criticism requires
               a great amount of manual work: scholars place the variants side by side and read them
               through closely, pen or highlighter in hand. Coleto can reduce the massive effort of
               manual comparison and provide faster and easier access to all of the edits in variant
               texts, classified and presented in easy-to-use formats. With Coleto, philologists and
               scholars of genetic/textual criticism may gain speed, new information and new
               precision, at worst, and new insights, at best. </p>
            <p> Coleto’s primary methodological improvement to collation is our suggested
               classification of edits in variants. Collation tools have previously provided
               information on insertion, deletion, and (sometimes) transposition, but the study of
               some variant texts may be improved by additional rule-based classification: expansion
               major/minor, condensation major/minor, as well as common orthographic features
               including punctuation (e.g. commas), hyphenation (e.g. <emph>large-ish</emph> → <emph>largish</emph>),
               whitespace (e.g. <emph>in to</emph> → <emph>into</emph>), capitalization (e.g. <emph>earth</emph> → <emph>Earth</emph>), and italics
               (e.g. <emph>again</emph> → <emph>again</emph>). We also defined another type of edit,
               <q>numbers</q>, for edits common in <title rend="italic">The Martian</title>, e.g. <emph>4</emph> → <emph>four</emph>, or
               abbreviations involving numbers, e.g. <emph>80 km</emph> → <emph>80 kilometers</emph>.</p>

            <head>2. Use case: <title rend="italic">The Martian</title>
            </head>
            <p>
               <title rend="italic">The Martian</title> by Andy Weir is a best-selling science fiction
               novel about an astronaut named Mark Watney who is stranded alone on Mars. Using
               science and ingenuity, Watney secures food, water, oxygen, and shelter, establishes
               communication with NASA back on Earth, and finally reaches a spaceship that enables
               his rescue. The text of <title rend="italic">The Martian</title> exists in three complete
               variants. Weir originally self-published <title rend="italic">The Martian</title> on his
               personal website in 2011 (hereafter, <title rend="italic">Martian1</title> or <title
                  rend="italic">M1</title>), then began selling it on Amazon.com in 2012, for 99 cents,
               where it sold 35,000 copies in three months <ptr target="#alter2017"/>. A major New York publisher,
               Crown, no doubt impressed by this self-publishing success, bought the rights from
               Weir, edited the text, and re-released it in 2014 (hereafter, <title rend="italic"
                  >Martian2</title> or <title rend="italic">M2</title>). Describing this edit from <title
                  rend="italic">Martian1</title> to <title rend="italic">Martian2</title> in interviews, Weir
               has said, <quote rend="inline">The editing process was pretty smooth. It was not a lot of changes at all</quote>
               <ptr target="#savage2015"/>, as well as, conversely, <quote rend="inline">...there were a lot of edits and changes...
               No significant plot changes, nothing like that, but a lot of the wording. It’s much
               more polished</quote> <ptr target="#debic2014"/>. A third variant was published by Crown in 2016, <title
                  rend="italic">The Martian: Classroom Edition</title>, which removes the text’s
               extensive profanity to market the novel to educational audiences (hereafter, <title
                  rend="italic">Martian3 </title>or <title rend="italic">M3</title>). Explaining this
               decision, Weir stated, <quote rend="inline">I got a lot of emails from science teachers who said, ‘Man
               I’d love to use your book as a teaching aid, but there’s so much profanity in it that
               we can’t really do that’</quote> <ptr target="#alter2017"/>. </p>
            <p> Our experiments first seek to formally describe the textual changes in the
               professional edits to <title rend="italic">The Martian</title>, especially as Weir’s
               inconsistent public statements on the first edit make it unclear how extensive this
               editing process was. Figure 1 summarizes the textual variation between <title
                  rend="italic">Martian1</title>, <title rend="italic">Martian2</title>, and Martian3, as
               performed by the statistics feature of Wdiff <ptr target="#vongagern2014"/>.<note> Wdiff, <ref

                     and Insertion thus refer to words which are added or removed with words taking
                     their place in the text. <ref

            <p>Quantitatively, Wdiff’s collation statistics lends weight to Weir’s statement that
               there were <quote rend="inline">not a lot of changes at all</quote> in the first edit to <title rend="italic">The
                  Martian</title>, as 92.4% of his self-published version is shared with the Crown
               Publishers edition. But 7.6% is not an insubstantial textual change, as changing even
               a few words in a literary text can potentially alter its interpretation. The basic
               collation provided by Wdiff thus leaves many questions about both edits to <title
                  rend="italic">The Martian</title> unanswered. Are there passages or sections of <title
                  rend="italic">The Martian</title> that received especially high amounts of edits? How
               many edits comprise the 6,319 words transformed to 9,205 words in the first edit, or
               the words changed in the second edit? Are the edits mostly minor corrections to e.g.
               punctuation, or more substantial changes such as added paragraphs? Are the edits long
               or short? How many of these edits can be automatically classified, and classified
               how? Did <title rend="italic">Martian3</title>, the <title rend="quotes">Classroom Edition</title> (intended to remove
               profanity for student readers) alter any text <title rend="italic">besides</title> the
               profanity? And moving on to interpretation, how do the hundreds of minor textual
               changes, such as capitalization and the rendering of numbers and scientific
               abbreviations, alter readings of the texts? To begin to answer these, we apply Coleto
               to the texts.</p>

            <head>3. Related Work</head>
            <p>A number of tools exist to assist in comparison of textual variants. Wdiff compares
               text files on a word-per-word basis and provides statistics of insertions, deletions,
               and changes <ptr target="#vongagern2014"/>. Archival and philological websites allow parallel
               visual inspection of variants with annotations such as linguistic information or
               highlighting <ptr target="#vandalenoskam2015"/>. The Versioning Machine is a long-running
               open-source tool that displays variant texts and manuscript images side-by-side, with
               a number of changes highlighted <ptr target="#schreibman2003"/>. Juxta and its web-based
               interface Juxta Commons provided user-friendly collation and visualization of changes
               in plain text files <ptr target="#wheeles2013"/>. Juxta Commons as a web service was
               shut down in September 2020, although its source code remains online.<note>

               </note> CollateX is advanced software for textual collation providing users with
               alignment tables as well as a visualization of variant changes as a word-level graph
               <ptr target="#dekker2011"/>. TRAViz provides sophisticated collation and aims to
               improve on CollateX’s visualization methodology <ptr target="#janicke2017"/> <ptr target="#janicke2015"/>.
               Elisa Nury has introduced the PyCoviz tool to visualize collation
               based on CollateX <ptr target="#nury2019"/>. Other tools not specifically focused on variant comparison
               could also be useful for variant comparison tasks, for instance TRACER, a suite for
               detection of text re-use <ptr target="#buchler2014"/>.</p>
            <p> Different users and their research tasks will be drawn to one or more of these
               collation tools over the other. While existing collation suites generally approach
               collation visualization through side-by-side comparison of text chunks or
               sentence-level comparison, Coleto takes a different approach: to identify and
               separate all of the edits in variant texts, classified by rule-based methods and
               presented in output documents and visualizations. This assists our close and distant
               reading of <title rend="italic">The Martian</title>, as we wished to interpret the
               cumulative effect of hundreds of minor textual changes. As digital humanities
               collation tools can and do build upon one another, Coleto’s open-source code and
               methodology for classifying edits can be incorporated into any other collation suite. </p>

               previous studies which apply digital methods to the interpretation of variants of
               relatively recent fiction include Yufang Ho’s comparison of the 1966 and revised 1977
               versions of John Fowles’s novel <title rend="italic">The Magus</title> <ptr target="#ho2011"/>. Martin Paul

            <head>4. Advancing the classification of edits in variant texts</head>
            <p>Existing schemas to classify edits in variant texts have so far been limited. The
               established methodology for classifying edits in scholarly editing is based on a
               distinction between <term>accidentals</term> and <term>substantives</term>, as defined by the widely-used
               Greg-Bowers tradition, which is also included, for instance, in the MLA Committee on
               Scholarly Editions’ <title rend="italic">Guidelines for Editors of Scholarly
                  Editions</title> <ptr target="#mla2011"/>.<note> Greg-Bowers was
                  originally designed for the disciplinary goal of interpreting authorial intention,
                  and although authorial intention as the dominant paradigm of textual criticism and
                  scholarly editing was disrupted in the 1980s, notably with Jerome J. McGann’s <title rend="italic">A
                  Critique of Modern Textual Criticism</title> (1983), and scholars have continued to evolve
                  the goals of textual criticism and scholarly editing, the fundamental
                  methodological categories of the Greg-Bowers tradition have persisted. Scholars
                  are not unanimous in supporting Greg-Bowers, for instance G. Thomas Tanselle, who
                  found the terms <term>accidentals</term> and <term>substantives</term> to be <quote rend="inline">misleading and often
                     untenable in their implication of a firm distinction in all cases</quote> <ptr target="#greetham1992" loc="335–36"/>.
                  </note> Importantly for digital texts, there is no
               widely-applicable or widely-followed typology of edits in digital scholarly editing
               and collation, with different materials calling for different typologies <ptr target="#teil2016"/>.
               We therefore suggest the following categories of edits in variant texts, as
               integrated in Coleto (Table 1).</p>

            <p>Script-identifiable edits are those that can be confidently classified into types
               based on formal linguistic features alone; these include changes related to
               capitalization, whitespace, hyphenation, spelling of numbers, and changes to
               scientific abbreviations. For the rest of the edits that cannot be easily defined in
               a rule-based way, we classify them based on the nature and extent of the edit, under
               the proposed term, <term>Semantically Open Edits</term>: the well-established categories in
               existing collation tools of deletion and insertion, but supplemented by expansion and
               condensation categories. For the latter two, a distinction between small and large
               edits is beneficial, but the choice is (perhaps inevitably) an arbitrary one. For the
               following experiments, we defined <term>major</term> edits as having a Levenshtein distance
               greater than 5,<note> Levenshtein distance is a metric for quantifying the difference
                  between two strings: this counts each character-level addition, deletion or
                  transformation required to turn one string into another string. Each individual
                  edit may concern several directly adjacent words, which is why many edits involve
                  Levenshtein distances higher than 5. In the edit from <title rend="italic">M1
                     </title>to<title rend="italic"> M2</title>, 2634 (or 49.7%) of the edits are minor and
                  2664 (or 50.3%) are major, according to our definition. The median Levenshtein
                  difference we observed was 4. For a discussion of this and other methods of
                  approximate string matching, see <ptr target="#navarro2001"/>.</note> but users of Coleto may
               select their own preferred Levenshtein value in the configuration file.</p>

            </head>
            <p>As its target audience is humanities researchers, Coleto is designed for ease of use,
               so users need only download the code from GitHub, place two variant texts in .txt
               format in the Data folder, choose configurations in the config.yaml file, and run the
               run_coleto Python script. Coleto then performs the following tasks: (1) Preprocessing
               of texts: splits texts into one sentence per line to prepare for alignment; (2) Align
               texts using Wdiff; (3) Perform analysis: rule-based detection and classification of
               edits; (4) Generate overview table; and (5) Generate statistics and
               visualizations.</p>
            <p>Coleto also generates a number of outputs, the first being a data table in the .tsv
               format of all the edits in the variants, aligned in one convenient place (Table
               2).</p>

            <p>This first visualization provides researchers with a bird’s-eye view of changes
               between two variant texts. And if a researcher wishes to examine, for instance, all
               of the Expansion Major edits, these are tagged in the .tsv table generated by Coleto.
               The next visualization is of our suggested, more narrowly defined,
               script-identifiable edits. We have so far implemented: numbers, punctuation,
               capitalization, hyphenation, whitespace, and italics (Figure 4).</p>

               Figure 4 displays that 2,226 script-identifiable minor textual edits were detected
               in the editing process from <title rend="italic">M1 </title>to <title rend="italic">M2</title>,
               which provide evidence for a commentator to reconcile author Andy Weir’s conflicting
               statements on the first edit: <quote rend="inline">It was not a lot of changes at all,</quote> and <quote rend="inline">...there
               were a lot of edits and changes... No significant plot changes, nothing like that,
               but a lot of the wording.</quote> While changes to hyphenation, capitalization, etc. may be
               of interest to some research tasks, they are undoubtedly of little interest to
               others, and the assignment of edits into finer classifications assists researchers in
               isolating the specific edits they wish to examine.</p>
            <p>The third visualization generated by Coleto renders all of the edits across the
               progression of the texts (Figure 5). Script-identifiable and “other edits” are
               visualized as different series, with the value of each series calculated by the sum
               of the absolute Levenshtein distances for each sentence of the text, with
               Savitzky-Golay smoothing applied.<note> Savitzky-Golay filtering is a smoothing
                  algorithm relying on a least-squares based, best-fit method, originally developed

                  history of <title rend="italic">The Martian</title>, as the <title rend="italic">raison

                  Profanity is also a touchstone for issues of censorship and commercialization in
                  discourse around the film adaptation of <title rend="italic">The Martian</title>. While
                  the film only explicitly includes two verbal instances of <emph
                     >fuck</emph>, the offending word is also written on screen and alluded to a
                  number of other times, as Jacob Brogan writes: <quote rend="inline">[<emph>fuck</emph> is]
                  often suggested in the way that sex might be in a different sort of all-ages
                  movie.</quote> <ptr target="#brogan2015"/>. Brogan reads <title rend="italic">The Martian</title> film’s
                  limited use of <emph>fuck</emph> as a metafictional device, the film
                  <quote rend="inline">pointedly nodding to its own limitations [... and] making reference to one of the
                  most bizarre guidelines of the MPAA’s PG-13 rating, the principle that a film can
                  include only one, and in some very rare cases two, (non-sexual) uses of the word.</quote>
                  Brogan also suggests Watney’s frequent use of <emph>fuck</emph> is
                  emblematic of the character’s psychology: <quote rend="inline">Indeed, Watney’s access to the one
                  thing he’s not supposed to say — and his willingness to keep saying it — indexes
                  his indomitability.</quote> As another impression, <title rend="italic">The Martian</title>
                  foregrounds the use of conversational American English to render almost all of its
                  narrative, a tone underscored by its frequent profanity. An improved formal
                  understanding of profanity in <title rend="italic">The Martian</title> texts could thus
                  support a variety of research questions.</p>
               <p> While locating profanity in texts is a matter of simple query, Coleto’s generated
                  tables bring additional speed and convenience to comparing the profanity in <title
                     rend="italic">M2</title> and <title rend="italic">M3</title> (Table 3), while the
                  generated visualizations provide additional context (Figure 6).</p>

               <p>Note that the y-axis is much smaller here than in Figure 5, as the edit from <title
                     rend="italic">Martian2 </title>to <title rend="italic">Martian3</title> (removing and
                  replacing profanity) was much smaller than the edit from <title rend="italic"
                     >Martian1</title> to <title rend="italic">Martian2</title>. The large spike around
                  sentence 3600 in Figure 6 demonstrates how Coleto highlights areas of large edits
                  which scholars may wish to investigate further. In this case, however, the
                  explanation is mundane: small textual variation surrounding a particularly long
                  string of code that NASA sends to Watney on Mars.</p>

               <p>Manually reviewing the separated edits in Coleto’s generated .tsv table reveals
                  that over 290 of the edits to <title rend="italic">Martian3</title> remove or soften

                  is removed, and a line involving the epithet <emph>gay</emph> is also

                  Susan Ohanian (2016), who criticized the spirit of the edit and noted
                  inconsistencies, such as another instance of <title rend="italic">Jesus Christ

               <p>None of the bowdlerization in <title rend="italic">Martian3</title> is surprising, as
                  the express purpose of the text was to remove or reduce profanity and other
                  potentially offensive content. But we wished to also know whether <title
                     rend="italic">Martian3</title> altered any text <title rend="italic">besides</title>
                  potentially offensive content — perhaps Weir or his editors used the occasion of a
                  new edition to make some final corrections? — and the table generated by Coleto
                  can quickly answer this question, as well. By manual inspection and sifting of the
                  dataframe, it emerges that <title rend="italic">Martian3</title> also makes factual
                  corrections to scientific details, as well as occasional replacement of continuous
                  verbs and other minor stylistic features (Table 4).</p>

               <p> By separating and classifying edits, Coleto can also serve as an exploratory
                  research tool by assisting in the spotting of non-obvious trends. For instance,
                  manually inspecting the data table of changes from the earlier <title rend="italic"
                     >Martian1</title> to <title rend="italic">Martian2</title>, we stumbled upon the
                  discovery that profanity was cut in this first edit, as well. This was a surprise,
                  given the large frequency and foregroundedness of profanity in <title rend="italic"
                     >Martian2</title>. It emerges that in the first edit of <title rend="italic">The
                     Martian</title>, from self-published novel to major publishing house release, <title
                     rend="italic">fuck</title> and <title rend="italic">shit</title> (and their word forms)
                  were substantially reduced, by about 33% and 15%, respectively. Numerous other
                  words and phrases were also softened with <q>lesser</q> profanity, more varied
                  profanity, or non-profanity (e.g. <q>the shit hits the fan</q> → <q>all hell breaks
                  loose</q>) in the first edit. </p>
               <p>
                  <title rend="italic">The Martian</title> thus has the dubious distinction of having been
                  bowdlerized three times: in <title rend="italic">M2</title>, which reduced profanity
                  significantly, the thorough scrubbing of profanity in <title rend="italic">M3</title>,
                  the <title rend="quotes">Classroom Edition,</title> and finally in the film adaptation, which abided by a
                  (reported) film board’s code of two <emph>fuck</emph>s allowed, but
                  winked at the audience through additional implied profanity. This textual history
                  should inform readings of profanity in any variant or adaptation of <title
                     rend="italic">The Martian</title>, and perhaps any discussion of the protagonist
                  Mark Watney’s nonconformist characterization.</p>

               <head>6.2 Interpreting changes to numbers and abbreviations</head>
               <p>When comparing variants manually, or even with existing collation tools, it can be
                  difficult to gain a sense of the frequency and distribution of edits, especially
                  very minor stylistic edits. For instance, in the first edit of <title rend="italic"
                     >The Martian</title>, it is readily apparent that numerous minor
                  stylistic/orthographic changes have been made to the way scientific abbreviations
                  and numbers are written, such as <emph>L</emph> → <emph>liter</emph> and <emph>8</emph> → <emph>eight,</emph> but existing
                  variant analysis tools provide no simple way to quantify these and gain a sense of
                  this type of edit’s distribution.</p>
               <p>From the script-identifiable edits of <title rend="italic">The Martian</title>, Coleto
                  classifies 868 edits as the rendering of numbers and scientific values in the
                  first edit, from <title rend="italic">M1</title> to <title rend="italic">M2</title>. While
                  individual instances of such numerical changes may seem interpretively
                  insignificant, hundreds of them scattered across the text have a <title rend="italic"
                     >cumulative</title> effect upon readings of the text. In protagonist Mark Watney’s
                  narration in <title rend="italic">Martian1</title>, the use of cardinal numbers and
                  short scientific abbreviations support the fiction that Watney is a scientist
                  working in dangerous conditions, too focused on surviving the life-threatening
                  conditions on Mars to bother writing <q>kilometers</q> or <q>forty-one</q> out in full.
                  Plausibility is a central concern of science fiction <ptr target="#stockwell2000"/>, and when
                  such abbreviations and numerals are expanded in <title rend="italic">Martian2</title>,
                  this may increase readability, but weakens the stylistic realism of Watney’s
                  voice.</p>
               <p>In <title rend="italic">Martian1</title>, however, Weir did not only write <emph>L</emph> for
                  <emph>liter</emph> or <emph>8</emph> for <emph>eight</emph> in the voice of astronaut Mark Watney, but also in the
                  third-person narration of the NASA scientists back on Earth, which has a jarring
                  effect on readability (Table 5):</p>

               <p>In addition to plausibility, scientific rigor is another central concern of
                  science fiction <ptr target="#stockwell2000" loc="78"/>, especially the subgenre of <q>hard science
                  fiction,</q> and Weir pays careful attention to the accuracy of scientific and
                  mathematical explanations throughout <title rend="italic">The Martian</title>. Weir went
                  as far as to code a computer program that plotted the trajectory of the fictional
                     <title rend="italic">Hermes</title> spacecraft to ensure scientific accuracy in <title
                     rend="italic">The Martian</title>. Weir’s dedication to scientific accuracy was so
                  great that a NASA scientist later reviewed Weir’s trajectory calculations, and
                  concluded that Weir had gotten them right <ptr target="#burke2015"/>. </p>
               <p>In the process of writing and publishing <title rend="italic">Martian1</title> online,

                  in the novel, which Weir then incorporated <ptr target="#dickerson2015"/>. While locating these scientific corrections in the variants of <title

               <p>The most substantial spike in Coleto’s visualization of edits between <title
                     rend="italic">M1</title> and <title rend="italic">M2</title> in Figure 5, above, occurs
                  at the very end of the novel: the removal of the 263-word epilogue at the end of
                     <title rend="italic">Martian1</title> and a 255-word addition at the end of <title
                     rend="italic">Martian2</title>, which substantially alters the novel’s closure. In
                  both <title rend="italic">M1</title> and <title rend="italic">M2</title>, Watney, finally
                  safely aboard the rescue spacecraft, is happy to be alive and states, <quote rend="inline">This is the
                  happiest day of my life.</quote> In <title rend="italic">Martian1</title>, however, a brief
                  epilogue follows this. Some time after his rescue in space, Watney, now safely
                  back on Earth, is employed by NASA to train the crew of an upcoming space mission.
                  Watney sits upon a bench, killing time, when a young boy recognizes him as the
                  famous astronaut. Watney tolerates the boy’s attention, until the boy poses a
                  question: </p>
               
               <p><quote rend="block"><p><q>So Mr. Watney,</q> the boy said, <q>If you could go to Mars again, like, if there was
                  another mission and they wanted you to go, would you go?</q></p>
               <p>Watney scowled at him. <q>You out of your fucking mind?</q></p>
               <p><q>Ok time to go,</q> the mom said, quickly herding the boy away. They receded in to
                  [sic] the crowded sidewalk.</p>
               <p>Watney snorted in their direction. Then he closed his eyes and felt the sun on his
                  face. It was a nice, boring afternoon. </p><ptr target="#m1" loc="331–32"/></quote> </p>
               
               <p>This is a typical epilogue in fiction, as defined by the Russian Formalist Boris
                  Eikhenbaum: it sets the perspective by a shift in time and provides some sort of
                  after-history of the major characters <ptr target="#torgovnick1981" loc="11"/>. This epilogue of
                     <title rend="italic">M1</title> may be read to evince the lack of internal growth by
                  Watney, who remains emotionally disengaged and contemptuous of playing the role of
                  hero. Watney’s harrowing adventures on Mars have not altered his nonconformist
                  characterization, a nonconformity encapsulated throughout the text by — and on the
                  final page of the novel, reiterated by — the most foregrounded stylistic feature
                  in the novel: profanity. The epilogue of <title rend="italic">M1</title> also shuts the
                  door on potential sequels, which could be read as authorial and textual
                  nonconformity with commercial expectations for science fiction novels.</p>
               <p>
                  <title rend="italic">Martian2</title>, however, cuts this pessimistic epilogue and
                  inserts a substantial amount of optimistic text just before the novel’s end. In
                     <title rend="italic">M2</title>’s new ending, Watney expresses gracious appreciation
                  for all the parties involved in his rescue — his crewmates, NASA, the Chinese
                  space program, the billions of people who hoped for his survival — and affirms a
                  widespread faith in human nature: </p>
               <p><quote rend="block"><p>The cost for my survival must have been hundreds of millions of dollars. All to
                  save one dorky botanist. Why bother?</p>
               <p>Well, okay. I know the answer to that. Part of it might be what I represent:
                  progress, science, and the interplanetary future we’ve dreamed of for centuries.
                  But really, they did it because every human being has a basic instinct to help
                  each other out. It might not seem that way sometimes, but it’s true.</p><ptr target="#m2" loc="368–69"/></quote> </p>
               
               <p>This greatly alters the tone of the novel’s ending, revises Watney’s growth and
                  characterization, and now leaves open the possibility of sequels. The correlation
                  between reduced profanity in <title rend="italic">M2</title> and Watney’s character is
                  notable: as the text itself becomes more conformist, so does its protagonist.</p>

            <head>7. Conclusion and future work</head>
            <p>A traditional scholar who sat down to compare the first two variants of <title
                  rend="italic">The Martian</title> would possibly, but possibly not, have noticed the
               reduced profanity, although the changed epilogue is impossible to miss. If such a
               scholar were sufficiently rigorous and willing to invest the necessary time, they
               would undoubtedly locate the corrected science and note the changes to abbreviations,
               numerals, and other minor stylistic aspects, as well. Coleto, like any collation
               tool, does not seek to replace such diligent genetic criticism, but to supplement it
               with speedier information and new precision, as well as provide a method that scales
               to longer texts which may challenge the time and patience of scholars performing
               manual comparison of variant texts.</p>
            <p>Coleto could naturally be adapted per research topic, and may hopefully be useful for
               critical interest in, <term>inter alia</term>, variants of fiction, the
               role of the editor, and text re-use. Some tantalizing use cases for comparing
               variants of fiction come from the rapidly emerging global phenomenon of digital
               self-published best-sellers,<note> Examples of this phenomenon include <title
                     rend="italic">Fifty Shades of Grey</title> (originally published as fan-fiction
                  and later at author E.L. James’ website) and <title rend="italic">Wu Kong</title> (a
                  Chinese Internet novel turned big-budget action film). Some 40 self-published
                  authors on Amazon had sold over a million copies of their e-books by 2016 <ptr target="#alter2016"/>,
                  while Hollywood is reportedly <q>snapping up</q> self-published authors in 2017
                  <ptr target="#kean2017"/>. </note> in which, like <title rend="italic">The Martian</title>, texts
               often exist in a self-published variant as well as a later professionally-edited
               variant.</p>
            <p>A significant weakness of Coleto is its inability to detect transpositions, as it
               relies on Wdiff for collation. For instance, Wdiff does not detect if a sentence is
               removed, but then replaced a few pages later in the novel — Coleto would classify
               this as an unrelated deletion and insertion. While Coleto could be integrated with
               transposition-detecting software in the future, for now, a pragmatic research
               suggestion would be to use Coleto in tandem with CollateX <ptr target="#dekker2011"/>,
               as described e.g. in <ptr target="#schoch2016"/>. Comparing <title rend="italic">Martian1</title>
               and <title rend="italic">Martian2</title> in CollateX results in 98 transpositions
               detected. Of these, 10 involve punctuation and should be considered artefacts of the
               method. Another 33 represent transpositions of a single word, showing stylistic
               preferences on the word-order level. Yet another 21 concern multi-word expressions
               which change the overall construction of a sentence or paragraph more substantially.
               Finally, 34 concern segments of more than 5 words, typically in the range of a short
               phrase to several sentences. In all cases, the scope of movement is rather small,
               with transpositions remaining very localized phenomena. This inspection of
               transpositions in this test case shows that, quantitatively and above all
               qualitatively, transpositions were not a major part of the first edit to <title
                  rend="italic">The Martian</title>, but naturally this step might play a greater role
               in variants of other texts.</p>
            <p>For further work on Coleto, we plan to pursue the quantitative investigation into the
               semantics of edits by using word embedding models, thereby quantifying the amount of
               actual semantic distance between two tokens in an edit, rather than the surface-level
               Levenshtein distance. Some notable challenges we expect are defining edits concerning
               spelling mistakes (where misspelled words may not be in a model’s vocabulary) and
               edits involving different numbers of words (where it is not obvious which words
               establish semantic distance).</p>
