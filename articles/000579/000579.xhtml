                  <h2>Abstract</h2> 
                  <p>This paper introduces Coleto, an automatic collation tool for the comparison of variant
                     texts in English, German, or French, which separates edits from variant texts so that
                     textual changes can be classified and contextualized. Coleto’s proposed methodology
                     for
                     the classification of edits in variants includes: major/minor expansion, major/minor
                     condensation, changes to numbers and whitespace, and common orthographic features.
                     From
                     this classification schema, Coleto generates: an aligned table of edits in the variants,
                     visualizations of the frequency of classified edits, and a visualization of edit density
                     across the progression of the texts. As a sample use case, we present mixed-method
                     analyses of Andy Weir’s science fiction bestseller, <cite class="title italic">The Martian</cite>,
                     aided by Coleto’s functions and generated outputs. Code available at: <a href="https://github.com/dh-trier/coleto" onclick="window.open('https://github.com/dh-trier/coleto'); return false" class="ref">https://github.com/dh-trier/coleto</a>

                  <div class="ptext" id="p1">This paper began with the desire to combine close and distant reading to compare
                     three versions (or “variants”) of Andy Weir’s science fiction novel, <cite class="title italic">The Martian </cite>(2011, 2014, 2016). We wished to formally describe
                     the changes to the texts made by two professional edits, then interpret how these
                     thousands of textual changes, some big but mostly small, alter readings of the texts.
                     While a number of automatic collation and variant comparison tools exist, none of
                     them easily provide information on the textual changes that we were most interested
                     in when analyzing <cite class="title italic">The Martian</cite>, including: (1) a visualization
                     of edits across the course of the entire texts; (2) all of the edits aligned and
                     isolated from their original textual contexts; and (3) automatic classification of
                     these thousands of edits. As no available tool performs all of these functions, we
                     created one, and now present Coleto, a Python suite which inputs two variant text
                     files (in English, German, or French) and creates a number of outputs: a
                     visualization of edits across the progression of the texts, which indicates sections
                     of the texts that contain greater or fewer edits; a .tsv table containing all of the
                     textual changes presented side-by-side and categorized by type of edit; and
                     visualizations of frequencies of edit types.<a class="noteRef" href="#d4e202">[1]</a>

                  <div class="ptext" id="p2"> Interested users, even those with minimal coding experience, may use Coleto to
                     quickly gain a variety of information about their variant texts. Comparing variant
                     texts has a long scholarly history, yet to perform genetic/textual criticism requires
                     a great amount of manual work: scholars place the variants side by side and read them
                     through closely, pen or highlighter in hand. Coleto can reduce the massive effort
                     of
                     manual comparison and provide faster and easier access to all of the edits in variant
                     texts, classified and presented in easy-to-use formats. With Coleto, philologists
                     and
                     scholars of genetic/textual criticism may gain speed, new information and new
                     precision, at worst, and new insights, at best. </div>

                  <div class="ptext" id="p3"> Coleto’s primary methodological improvement to collation is our suggested
                     classification of edits in variants. Collation tools have previously provided
                     information on insertion, deletion, and (sometimes) transposition, but the study of
                     some variant texts may be improved by additional rule-based classification: expansion
                     major/minor, condensation major/minor, as well as common orthographic features
                     including punctuation (e.g. commas), hyphenation (e.g. large-ish → largish),
                     whitespace (e.g. in to → into), capitalization (e.g. earth → Earth), and italics
                     (e.g. again → <cite class="title italic">again</cite>). We also defined another type of edit,
                     “numbers”, for edits common in <cite class="title italic">The Martian</cite>, e.g. 4 → four, or
                     abbreviations involving numbers, e.g. 80 km → 80 kilometers.</div>

                     novel about an astronaut named Mark Watney who is stranded alone on Mars. Using
                     science and ingenuity, Watney secures food, water, oxygen, and shelter, establishes
                     communication with NASA back on Earth, and finally reaches a spaceship that enables
                     his rescue. The text of <cite class="title italic">The Martian</cite> exists in three complete
                     variants. Weir originally self-published <cite class="title italic">The Martian</cite> on his
                     personal website in 2011 (hereafter, <cite class="title italic">Martian1</cite> or <cite class="title italic">M1</cite>), then began selling it on Amazon.com in 2012, for 99 cents,
                     where it sold 35,000 copies in three months [<a class="ref" href="#alter2017">Alter 2017</a>]. A major New York publisher,
                     Crown, no doubt impressed by this self-publishing success, bought the rights from
                     Weir, edited the text, and re-released it in 2014 (hereafter, <cite class="title italic">Martian2</cite> or <cite class="title italic">M2</cite>). Describing this edit from <cite class="title italic">Martian1</cite> to <cite class="title italic">Martian2</cite> in interviews, Weir
                     has said, “The editing process was pretty smooth. It was not a lot of changes at all”
                     <span class="error"><a class="ref" href="#savage2015">#savage2015</a></span>, as well as, conversely, “...there were a lot of edits and changes...
                     No significant plot changes, nothing like that, but a lot of the wording. It’s much
                     more polished” <span class="error"><a class="ref" href="#debic2014">#debic2014</a></span>. A third variant was published by Crown in 2016, <cite class="title italic">The Martian: Classroom Edition</cite>, which removes the text’s
                     extensive profanity to market the novel to educational audiences (hereafter, <cite class="title italic">Martian3 </cite>or <cite class="title italic">M3</cite>). Explaining this
                     decision, Weir stated, “I got a lot of emails from science teachers who said, ‘Man
                     I’d love to use your book as a teaching aid, but there’s so much profanity in it that
                     we can’t really do that’” [<a class="ref" href="#alter2017">Alter 2017</a>]. </div>

                     professional edits to <cite class="title italic">The Martian</cite>, especially as Weir’s
                     inconsistent public statements on the first edit make it unclear how extensive this
                     editing process was. Figure 1 summarizes the textual variation between <cite class="title italic">Martian1</cite>, <cite class="title italic">Martian2</cite>, and Martian3, as

                        Martian</cite>, as 92.4% of his self-published version is shared with the Crown
                     Publishers edition. But 7.6% is not an insubstantial textual change, as changing even
                     a few words in a literary text can potentially alter its interpretation. The basic
                     collation provided by Wdiff thus leaves many questions about both edits to <cite class="title italic">The Martian</cite> unanswered. Are there passages or sections of <cite class="title italic">The Martian</cite> that received especially high amounts of edits? How
                     many edits comprise the 6,319 words transformed to 9,205 words in the first edit,
                     or
                     the words changed in the second edit? Are the edits mostly minor corrections to e.g.
                     punctuation, or more substantial changes such as added paragraphs? Are the edits long
                     or short? How many of these edits can be automatically classified, and classified
                     how? Did <cite class="title italic">Martian3</cite>, the “Classroom Edition” (intended to remove
                     profanity for student readers) alter any text <cite class="title italic">besides</cite> the
                     profanity? And moving on to interpretation, how do the hundreds of minor textual
                     changes, such as capitalization and the rendering of numbers and scientific
                     abbreviations, alter readings of the texts? To begin to answer these, we apply Coleto

                     collation visualization through side-by-side comparison of text chunks or
                     sentence-level comparison, Coleto takes a different approach: to identify and
                     separate all of the edits in variant texts, classified by rule-based methods and

                     cumulative effect of hundreds of minor textual changes. As digital humanities
                     collation tools can and do build upon one another, Coleto’s open-source code and
                     methodology for classifying edits can be incorporated into any other collation suite.

                        Fucked.” Profanity may be the most important stylistic feature in the textual
                        history of <cite class="title italic">The Martian</cite>, as the <cite class="title italic">raison
                           d'être</cite> for an entire variant, <cite class="title italic">M3</cite>, the “Classroom
                        Edition,” was to remove the novel’s copious profanity for educational audiences.
                        Profanity is also a touchstone for issues of censorship and commercialization in
                        discourse around the film adaptation of <cite class="title italic">The Martian</cite>. While
                        the film only explicitly includes two verbal instances of <em class="emph">fuck</em>, the offending word is also written on screen and alluded to a
                        number of other times, as Jacob Brogan writes: “[<em class="emph">fuck</em> is]
                        often suggested in the way that sex might be in a different sort of all-ages
                        movie.” [<a class="ref" href="#brogan2015">Brogan 2015</a>]. Brogan reads <cite class="title italic">The Martian</cite> film’s
                        limited use of <em class="emph">fuck</em> as a metafictional device, the film
                        “pointedly nodding to its own limitations [... and] making reference to one of the
                        most bizarre guidelines of the MPAA’s PG-13 rating, the principle that a film can
                        include only one, and in some very rare cases two, (non-sexual) uses of the word.”
                        Brogan also suggests Watney’s frequent use of <em class="emph">fuck</em> as
                        emblematic of the character’s psychology: “Indeed, Watney’s access to the one
                        thing he’s not supposed to say — and his willingness to keep saying it — indexes
                        his indomitability.” As another impression, <cite class="title italic">The Martian</cite>
                        foregrounds the use of conversational American English to render almost all of its
                        narrative, a tone underscored by its frequent profanity. An improved formal
                        understanding of profanity in <cite class="title italic">The Martian</cite> texts could thus
                        support a variety of research questions.</div>

                     reduced profanity, although the changed epilogue is impossible to miss. If such a

                     numerals, and other minor stylistic aspects, as well. Coleto, like any collation

                     variants of fiction come from the rapidly emerging global phenomenon of digital
                     self-published best-sellers,<a class="noteRef" href="#d4e1989">[10]</a> in which, like <cite class="title italic">The Martian</cite>, texts

                  <div class="ptext" id="p42">A significant weakness of Coleto is its inability to detect transpositions, as it
                     relies on Wdiff for collation. For instance, Wdiff does not detect if a sentence is
                     removed, but then replaced a few pages later in the novel — Coleto would classify
                     this as an unrelated deletion and insertion. While Coleto could be integrated with
                     transposition-detecting software in the future, for now, a pragmatic research
                     suggestion would be to use Coleto in tandem with CollateX [<a class="ref" href="#dekker2011">Dekker and Middell 2011</a>],
                     as described e.g. in Schöch (2016). Comparing <cite class="title italic">Martian1</cite>
                     and <cite class="title italic">Martian2</cite> in CollateX results in 98 transpositions
                     detected. Of these, 10 involve punctuation and should be considered artefacts of the
                     method. Another 33 represent transpositions of a single word, showing stylistic
                     preferences on the word-order level. Yet another 21 concern multi-word expressions
                     which change the overall construction of a sentence or paragraph more substantially.
                     Finally, 34 concern segments of more than 5 words, typically in the range of a short
                     phrase to several sentences. In all cases, the scope of movement is rather small,
                     with transpositions remaining very localized phenomena. This inspection of
                     transpositions in this test case shows that, quantitatively and above all
                     qualitatively, transpositions were not a major part of the first edit to <cite class="title italic">The Martian</cite>, but naturally this step might play a greater role
                     in variants of other texts.</div>

                     spelling mistakes (where misspelled words may not be in a model’s vocabulary) and
