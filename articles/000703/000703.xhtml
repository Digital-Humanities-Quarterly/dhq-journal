                  <p>In the article, we present, theorize and contextualize an investigation of
                     					figurative language in a corpus of Hebrew liturgical poetry from late antiquity,
                     					from both a manual and a computational point of view. The study touches upon
                     					questions of distribution and patterns of usage of figures of speech as well
                     as
                     					their literary-historical meanings. Focusing on figures of speech such as
                     					metaphors and similes, the corpus was first annotated manually with markers on
                     					papers, and a few years later it was annotated manually again, this time in a
                     					computer-assisted way, following a strictly categorized approach, using CATMA
                     					(an online literary annotation tool). The data was then transferred into
                     					ViS-À-ViS (an online visualization tool, developed by Münz-Manor and his team)
                     					that enables scholars to “see the wood” via various visualizations that
                     					single out, inter alia, repetitive patterns either at the level of the text or
                     					the annotations. The tool also enables one to visualize aggregated results
                     					concerning more than one text, allowing one to “zoom out” and see the
                     					“forest aspect” of the entire corpus or parts thereof. Interestingly, after
                     					visualizing the material in this way, it often turns out that the categories
                     					themselves need to be re-assessed. In other words, the categorization and
                     					visualization in themselves create a sort of hermeneutical circle in which both
                     					parts influence one another reciprocally.</p>
                  				
                  <p>Through the case study, we seek to demonstrate that, by using correct methods and
                     					tools (not only ViS-À-ViS but others also), one can ultimately use visualization
                     					of categorization as the basis for what might be called “established
                     					speculation”, or “not-trivial generalization”, which means, an
                     					interpretative act that tries to be based on clear findings, while at the same
                     					time enjoying the advantages of “over interpretation”. This approach, we
                     					argue, enables one to see the trees without losing sight of the wood, and vice
                     					versa; or “to give definition”
                     					– at least tentatively – “to the microcosms and
                     					macrocosms which describe the world around us” [<a class="ref" href="#weingart2022">Weingart 2022</a>], be they factual or fictional.</p>

                  <div class="ptext" id="p1">The experiment described and discussed in this article began with Münz-Manor’s
                     					doctoral dissertation entitled “Studies in the Figurative
                     					Language of Pre-Classical Piyyut”, submitted to the senate of the Hebrew
                     					University of Jerusalem in 2006 [<a class="ref" href="#munzmanor2006a">Münz-Manor 2006a</a>]. The
                     					dissertation explored the use of metaphor, simile, epithets, and other
                     					figurative devices in the earliest stratum of Hebrew liturgical poetry, composed
                     					in the Galilee in the fifth century of the Common Era, also known as piyyut,
                     a
                     					Greek loan word meaning poetry. The corpus includes all the known poems from
                     					that time period and was recovered from medieval manuscripts of the Cairo
                     					Genizah. It includes 211 poems by various poets, most of them anonymous, with
                     a
                     					word count of 47,556. Earlier studies suggested that, unlike in many other
                     					corpora of poetry, figurative language in early piyyut is rather marginal, and
                     					the main goal of the dissertation was to corroborate (or refute) this rather
                     					intuitive assertion and to some extent to quantify it. At the same time, the
                     					dissertation had a qualitative and literary goal, namely to carefully analyze
                     					the poems by reading them closely, and to draw poetic conclusions from the
                     					usage, or lack thereof, of figurative language by the poets [<a class="ref" href="#munzmanor2011">Münz-Manor 2011</a>].</div>
                  				
                  <div class="counter"><a href="#p2">2</a></div>
                  <div class="ptext" id="p2">At the beginning of the century, long before the computational approach began to
                     					bring its influence to bear on the Israeli academy, the method used was rather
                     					simple.<a class="noteRef" href="#d3e270">[2]</a> The poems in the corpus were read, word by word, using colored
                     					highlighters to mark the different figurative devices, such as metaphors,
                     					metonymies, and similes. This was painstaking, to be sure, but by the end of
                     a
                     					process that took several months, the entire corpus was annotated. In hindsight,
                     					although there existed a notion of a clear-cut categorization of figurative
                     					language in the corpus, no well-defined “tagset” was created. To put it
                     					another way, even though this phase was managed in a relatively systematic way,
                     					it was not based on ontological thinking in the full sense of the term. The
                     					major figurative devices were annotated in an entirely flat hierarchy of
                     					metaphor, metonymy, synecdoche and simile. The use of these concepts was of
                     					course based on a strong theoretical foundation, but the definitions bore some
                     					flexibility. Indeed, at the time, the notion of a tagset as a defined and more
                     					or less stable logical representation of the categories was not an idea
                     					Münz-Manor had thought of.</div>
                  				
                  <div class="counter"><a href="#p3">3</a></div>
                  <div class="ptext" id="p3">As previously noted, in the second stage, an analysis was carried out in which
                     					different examples were drawn from the annotated corpus. Here, a more detailed
                     					analysis of literary phenomena was carried out, such as metaphors with biblical
                     					connotations [<a class="ref" href="#munzmanor2006b">Münz-Manor 2006b</a>], similes that were created due to
                     					structural features of the poems [<a class="ref" href="#munzmanor2009">Münz-Manor 2009</a>], figurative
                     					epithets [<a class="ref" href="#munzmanor2016">Münz-Manor 2016</a>] and the like. In other words, only after
                     					annotating the entire corpus on a very rudimentary level was the “tagset”
                     					enhanced, in a process which was neither efficient, systematic nor clever. At
                     					any rate, the main phenomena that were discovered were grouped into chapters
                     and
                     					analyzed in depth. Despite this there remained a gap between the scope of the
                     					textual infrastructure prepared for the research and the doctoral chapters,
                     					which were theoretical and interpretive in nature, and did not necessarily
                     					exhaust the quantitative potential that was encapsulated in the preparatory
                     					work.</div>
                  				
                  <div class="counter"><a href="#p4">4</a></div>
                  <div class="ptext" id="p4">The conclusion of the dissertation was that the use of figurative language was
                     					indeed relatively marginal in the corpus, but that at the same time the usage
                     					that did occur was interesting and innovative. Although most of the discussion
                     					and conclusion was qualitative, a short passage did touch upon the quantitative
                     					aspects, even if in a scant way: 
                     <blockquote>
                        <p>Out of approximately
                           					5000 poetic lines, only 1000 contained figurative devices of any description,
                           					namely 20 percent. Moreover, the number of lines that contained developed
                           					figurative usage, which in most cases means a usage that runs across the entire
                           					line, was scarce, only 100…. the piyyutim [= piyyut in the plural] employ almost
                           					exclusively metaphors; the number of similes is surprisingly small, as well as
                           					the number of metonymies and synecdoches [<a class="ref" href="#munzmanor2006a">Münz-Manor 2006a</a>, pp. 238–239].</p>
                     </blockquote>These comments were not further developed or expanded
                     					upon, and remain almost the only reference to the quantitative aspects that
                     					emerged from the painstaking preparatory work. In retrospect, this fact should
                     					probably be understood as a reflection of the well-known hesitancy of literature
                     					studies with regard to numbers [<a class="ref" href="#english2010">English 2010</a>, p. xiii] [<a class="ref" href="#goldstone_etal2014">Goldstone and Underwood 2014</a>, 359–362]. Many of the dissertation’s
                     					chapters were published as journal articles and it seemed that this scholarly
                     					chapter in the author’s career had ended.</div>
                  				
                  <div class="counter"><a href="#p5">5</a></div>
                  <div class="ptext" id="p5">That being said, fifteen years later, as our shared interest in computational
                     					literary studies grew, we came across CATMA (Computer Assisted Text Markup and
                     					Analysis), a web annotation tool developed at the University of Hamburg and now
                     					at the Technical University of Darmstadt [<a class="ref" href="#gius_etal2022">Gius et al. 2022</a>], and a
                     					new scholarly project emerged. CATMA enables the annotation of every element
                     in
                     					the text (and not the text as a whole – an issue that we will discuss later)
                     					according to tagsets defined by the user. Once the tagging has been
                     					accomplished, the user can execute queries concerning both the text and the
                     					tagged text. Working with this tool, the first thing that caught Münz-Manor’s
                     					eye was that the interface seemed almost identical to his dissertation’s
                     					print-outs, namely the text highlighted with colors to depict the different
                     					annotations. But, unlike the initial work which was entirely manual, the main
                     					advantage of CATMA, or of any other computer-based annotation tool, is the
                     					ability to run basic or complex queries and to retrieve data. Thus, for example,
                     					in a hypothetical digital project equivalent to the doctoral thesis described
                     					earlier, the researcher could retrieve in seconds, and for the first time, a
                     					distribution of the figurative devices in the entire corpus, whether in a set
                     of
                     					poems or a specific one; a list of frequent metaphoric words; or a percentage
                     of
                     					figurative versus literal words. Such data is foundational for a combined
                     					qualitative-quantitative research. Moreover, the un-dogmatic conceptual
                     					principle of CATMA [<a class="ref" href="#horstmann2020">Horstmann 2020</a>] enables the annotators to
                     					enhance, refine or redefine the tagset on the go.<a class="noteRef" href="#d3e306">[3]</a> As previously noted, the
                     					manual tagging during the initial phase of writing the dissertation forced
                     					Münz-Manor to use a one-dimensional and rigid “tagset” that, on the one
                     					hand, facilitated the tedious endeavor but, on the other, restricted the
                     					potential for complex analysis.</div>
                  				
                  <div class="counter"><a href="#p6">6</a></div>
                  <div class="ptext" id="p6">We began to wonder what would happen if CATMA were used to explore figurative
                     					language in <span class="hi italic">piyyut</span>, transforming the hypothetical idea
                     					described above into a reality. This experiment would have twofold importance;
                     					firstly, it would provide another perspective on the literary question at hand,
                     					and secondly it would serve as an unusual methodological trial of digital versus
                     					analogue approaches. We decided to run an experiment: we would “upload” the
                     					manual annotations from the doctoral print-outs to the system and see where it
                     					would take us [<a class="ref" href="#munzmanor2022">Münz-Manor 2022</a>]. Here we took another important
                     					decision, which was to stick strictly to the original annotations in order for
                     					the experiment to be as sound as possible. As literary scholars, who cannot
                     					ignore the subjective nature of interpretation, it was an intuitive act: the
                     					decision whether a word is figurative or not is a hermeneutical one, and
                     					different scholars would tend to annotate the word differently. Moreover, even
                     					the same annotator might interpret the word differently at a later date or in
                     a
                     					different context. It was because of this that we decided not to touch the
                     					original annotations when migrating from the analogue dissertation to the
                     					digital experiment; but we shall return to this point towards the end of this

                     					easy to run basic queries and to (re)assess some of the key findings of the
                     					dissertation [<a class="ref" href="#munzmanor2022">Münz-Manor 2022</a>], 370-3). The most pressing question
                     					was whether figurative language in the corpus is marginal or not. Interestingly,
                     					it turns out that the question is not that simple. Let us consider some numbers:
                     					the corpus includes 47,556 words, out of which 5113 are figurative. In other
                     					words, the share of figurative words in the corpus is 11%, a small fraction to
                     					be sure. In that sense, we can say that the quantitative results corroborate
                     the
                     					qualitative ones from the dissertation. But “small” in comparison to what?
                     					In the dissertation this question could not have been answered and probably did
                     					not seem worthwhile at the time. In order to correlate the results, we examined
                     					them against two new corpora that have now been annotated for figurative
                     					language: the Book of Psalms from the Bible and the poetry of Pinchas the
                     					Priest, a ninth-century poet from Tiberias. These corpora were selected for a
                     					particular reason; the Book of Psalms is the foundational corpus of Hebrew
                     					poetry and <span class="hi italic">piyyut</span> has a direct connection to it even if
                     					the late antique poets sought to distance themselves from the canonical text.
                     					The <span class="hi italic">oeuvre</span> of Pinchas, on the other hand, builds heavily
                     					on the early <span class="hi italic">piyyut</span> and represents the inner development
                     					of this specific literary tradition after three hundred years of development.
                     					Simply put, the original corpus of the PhD dissertation was placed in diachronic
                     					comparison with an early and a late corpora.</div>

                     					of Pinchas 9%. So, on comparing the two, it appears that the original corpus
                     of
                     					the dissertation was not so under-figurative as seemed at first sight. In fact,
                     					it stands in between the classical book of Hebrew poetry, the Psalms, and a
                     					later poet that belonged directly to the literary tradition of piyyut. It is
                     					hard to draw a conclusion solely from these quantitative observations with
                     					regard to the history of Hebrew poetry in its diachronic development as far as
                     					the usage of figurative language is concerned, yet it definitely marks a
                     					promising scholarly path for future studies.</div>

                     					One of the meaningful categories for the analysis in the dissertation was the
                     					relation between figurative language and the specific genre or sub-genre of the
                     					poems. Piyyut is characterized by a strict generic classification and naturally
                     					some (sub)genres tend to use figurative language more than others. The
                     					quantification of the results allowed one to examine easily what the figurative
                     					density (the ratio between figurative and non-figurative words) of each genre
                     					might be, and here, too, the results corroborated some of the initial findings
                     					while refuting others. Most notably is the genre of the Hosha’not (hosanna),
                     					which ranked at 25% of figurative density. That is to say, in general, every
                     					fourth word is figurative. If we compare this phenomenon to the overall
                     					figurative density of the corpus, which is 11%, it really stands out. Curiously,
                     					in Münz-Manor’s dissertation it was noted, in passing to be honest, that this
                     					genre is low on figurative language [<a class="ref" href="#munzmanor2006a">Münz-Manor 2006a</a>, p. 61].
                     					Where did such an incorrect assertion come from? The Hosha’not are very short
                     					and in the style of a litany, a list of attributes of the people of Israel. So
                     					even if many of these epithets are figurative, the poem as a whole does not
                     					sound very figurative. Here we encounter an interesting case where the
                     					quantitative and the qualitative represent separate lines that do not meet while
                     					both are valid. Quantitatively, there are many figurative words, however, their
                     					aesthetic impression is low and possibly does not call for a detailed literary
                     					analysis; or does it? We do not think we can or should decide on such matters,
                     					but it demonstrates quite nicely that opening the door to quantitative
                     					considerations expands the literary toolkit and the hermeneutical
                     					possibilities.</div>

                     					annotating to computer-assisted manual annotating, which undoubtedly provides
                     					better analytical capabilities [<a class="ref" href="#jacke2018">Jacke 2018</a>], should lead to
                     					research which can be measured quantitatively, and whose conclusions will –
                     					almost by definition – be more robust. Simply put, although the research
                     					procedure was essentially the same, what Münz-Manor was able to do for the first
                     					time with the digital tool allowed him to say clearer things about the entire

                     a
                     					digital tool might well have coincided with a certain and widespread perception
                     					of the adopting of the computational option as a move in the direction of
                     					objectivity, scientification, and the like. However, as we shall see, and as
                     					other scholars have already argued (for example: [<a class="ref" href="#rieder_etal2012">Rieder and Röhle 2012</a>], the picture is more complex, since, even in such a case, this move has a
                     					price.</div>

                  <div class="ptext" id="p12">To begin with, we must ask ourselves if, and to what extent, the
                     					computer-assisted manual annotating is really so conceptually similar to the
                     					non-computerized manual one. Manual annotation in the digital humanities is
                     					sometimes described as an area of the good old close reading within the new
                     					realm of distant reading. This is both true and not true: it is true because,
                     					unlike some algorithmic analytic methods which are now very common in
                     					computational literary studies, human digital annotation is based on sensitive
                     					attention to every detail in the text, and is definitely a way of reading. And
                     					it is not true, because, unlike close reading, annotation in digital humanities
                     					is usually supposed to be based not only on clearly defined categories, but also
                     					on much more developed systematic thought, which, in turn, affects the scope
                     of
                     					annotation: Often, a modest and well-defined annotating task is expanded to
                     					encompass many more phenomena, in an attempt to fully exploit the opportunities
                     					inherent in more and more annotated data. Traditional close reading is not
                     					adversely affected by this consideration. This problem, in brief, stems from
                     the
                     					multifaceted nature of digital modeling operations – including annotating, as
                     a
                     					form of modeling: such operations sometimes seek to focus on a specific
                     					pre-defined research question, at the same time as seeking to prepare the
                     					research object for future analysis, based on as-yet-unknown questions [<a class="ref" href="#flanders_etal2016">Flanders and Jannidis 2016</a>]. As a result, manual-annotation-based projects
                     					tend to lack (or, better, to challenge) another important and characteristic
                     					feature of close reading: sampling. As Paul Fleming puts it, “an essential element of close reading relies not just on the
                     					quality of the reading performed, but also on the example chosen. It has to be
                     					the right example” [<a class="ref" href="#fleming2017">Fleming 2017</a>, p. 437]. It is
                     					not surprising, then, that in Münz-Manor’s initial work, a sort of disconnect
                     					between the annotation process and the body of the dissertation chapters becomes
                     					apparent: while each chapter chooses the “right example”, these examples
                     					weren’t chosen for their representativity, but because they were interesting
                     or
                     					important to the author for some reason or other. The aim of the annotating
                     					process, by contrast, was only to prepare an infrastructure, and in the end that
                     					infrastructure remained largely in the shadows.</div>

                     					context of traditional literature research. It reflects the gap between the
                     					amount of data prepared and the relatively free discussions that do not
                     					necessarily derive from it. It is, among other things, what gives this kind of

                     					limit itself from using such a method, even in relatively simple cases which

                     					literary studies, without giving up systematic category-based annotation? Even
                     					when annotation is driven by interpretive considerations, at the end of the
                     					process a layer of information is obtained that is perceived as rigid, whose
                     					reprocessing with statistical tools may not reveal its interpretive richness.
                     					Doesn’t the meticulousness of manual annotating avoid the additional
                     					interpretive step beyond what emerges directly from the accumulation of data?

                     					readers, who wrote that “this sounds awfully boring”,
                     					Piper playfully agrees: “It is! Generalizations should
                     					be boring, cautious, incremental, and slow” [<a class="ref" href="#piper2020">Piper 2020</a>, p. 60]. It is impossible to deny the logic of this approach, which
                     					expresses a central element in the research experience in the age of data. It
                     is
                     					hard, however, not to feel the stark contrast between this approach and that
                     of,
                     					say, Jonathan Culler, who offers the opposite perspective of the
                     					pre-computational age: 
                     <blockquote>
                        <p>Moderate interpretation […]
                           					though it may have value in some circumstances, is of little interest […]. Many
                           					“extreme” interpretations, like many moderate interpretations, will no
                           					doubt have little impact, because they are judged unpersuasive or redundant or
                           					irrelevant or boring, but if they are extreme, they have a better chance […]
                           of

                           					reflected on than if they strive to remain “sound” or moderate [<a class="ref" href="#culler1992">Culler 1992</a>, 110].</p>

                     					to the data may even be questionable, but nevertheless reveal a different kind
                     					of truth. When we put the debate this way, with all due respect to data-driven

                     					that this type of tagging strongly encourages a focusing on details – on the
                     					parts of the tree – and often makes it difficult to see the whole picture, the
                     					“wood”. Even when the user analyzes the annotated material, their analysis
                     					is usually question-dependent, revealing a small subset of the dimensions of
                     the
                     					tagging. At this point, we believe, the need for an advanced visualization of
                     					the hermeneutic metadata, that is, the manual annotations, becomes urgent – and
                     					this is where the tool that will be described below comes into play. While
                     					visualization can be question-dependent, it can also be used more freely. And

                     					the tool seeks to provide users with more than mere visualizations, namely, it
                     					provides an interface that supports what might be called speculative
                     					hermeneutics, by allowing for a smooth transition between the smallest detail

                     					of the latent pattern began with a close reading of the poems and the manual
                     					annotation process; continued with a distant-reading visualization that exposed
                     					the patterns, without ignoring the fact that these patterns are based on a very
                     					sensitive reading; and concluded with going back to the text in order to
                     					interpret the finding – and sometimes reinterpret the text. This workflow

                  <div class="ptext" id="p43">Literary studies can benefit greatly from walking a moderate line, where one
                     					piece of evidence after another is gathered, and everything is done in a
                     					measured and balanced way, with openness to criticism, rather than indulging
                     in
                     					generalizations based on rhetorical persuasion. Our approach here is not very
                     					different from Piper’s, although we believe that this argument goes quite
                     					naturally hand in hand with computational research projects that rely heavily
                     on
                     					the systematic annotation of texts, rather than on machine learning algorithms,
                     					which – despite being based on pre-existing annotated texts – emphasize the
                     					distance from the text itself. As long as we still wish to <span class="hi italic">read</span> – in a purely literal sense – this is probably the safest approach.
                     					It could also respond to Adam Hammond's justified call for the validation of
                     					research findings in the digital humanities [<a class="ref" href="#hammond2017">Hammond 2017</a>].
                     					However, the price of such a procedure is not only that too much focusing on
                     					details can hide the bigger picture, and sometimes even leave the researcher
                     					with the feeling that reaching it is impossible, or that it is insufficiently
                     					well founded, but also such research may lose some of its significance, its
                     					raison d'être, and so become, in one way or another, less meaningful. If we echo
                     					again what was presented before as a kind of (imagined) dispute between Piper
                     					and Culler, the question is how to find the golden path between a
                     					textual-anchored generalization on the one hand, and, on the other, a
                     					“healthy” speculation that will advance the research – with a calculated
                     					risk – into new and unexpected areas.</div>

                  <div class="ptext" id="p44">Here, we argue, a different attitude to categories can help: It is usually
                     					difficult to move directly from the smallest details to the bigger picture. We
                     					therefore suggest focusing on categories, as a research object located somewhere
                     					in the middle, and anyway requiring some abstraction – while bearing in mind
                     					that categories might have non-trivial relationships with both the details and
                     					the picture. Simply put, we propose a more playful approach to the
                     					epistemological status of categories, one that does not leave them solely as
                     the
                     					cornerstone of the annotation process, but returns to examine them again and
                     					again from a critical perspective. From a more philosophical point of view, it
                     					can be said that this approach offers a back-and-forth movement between two
                     					different types of categorization: a categorization based on generalizations
                     –
                     					that is, collecting and extracting all the data until categories that contain
                     					them correctly are defined – versus a categorization based on formalization,
                     					that is, by removing all actual data until an abstract category is formed (see
                     					[<a class="ref" href="#thomasson2022">Thomasson 2022</a>, § 1.3].</div>
                  				
                  <div class="counter"><a href="#p45">45</a></div>
                  <div class="ptext" id="p45">This approach also has a pedagogical aspect, which in our opinion is fundamental
                     					for the teaching of computational research to humanities students, and
                     					symptomatic of the subject at hand. We can demonstrate this from our shared
                     					experience in teaching manual digital annotating of literary texts. When we
                     					teach CATMA to our students – and we do it a lot – we are used to telling them
                     					that the main place where their traditional theoretical thinking is supposed
                     to
                     					undergo computational operationalization is in setting the tagset, that is, in
                     					the translating of abstract concepts into a category system. The daring ones
                     					usually adopt the proposal and try to formulate a whole world of fuzzy ideas
                     as
                     					a tagset, which, flexible as it may be, is more rigid by definition than the
                     					primordial thoughts with which the students set out. But then, when they are
                     					starting to annotate, they want to tag everything; they want to add new tags,
                     or
                     					correct the old ones; and that almost always happens. In a way, they are good
                     					students. Once they are exposed to the power of systematic annotation, they
                     					become addicted to it. They fall in love with the straight-forward use of a
                     					category system: it offers them an attractive intellectual alternative in its
                     					solidity, in its precision, in its caution. They start like Culler, and end like
                     					Piper. When, later, they analyze their annotations through a concrete query,
                     					with or without some basic visualizations, they transform their annotations into
                     					something tangible, and the process comes to a head: metadata becomes data, and
                     					interpretation becomes a rigid text. “A Trojan horse”, is what Johanna
                     					Drucker (2011) once called visualizations with too much explanatory power. When
                     					we try to challenge the students and say – “now speculate, please!” –
                     					they find it difficult to achieve. They see, of course, the richness of the
                     					data; they see – hopefully – the preciseness and carefulness of the local
                     					annotations; after all the hard work they have invested, they can treat it as
                     					reliable information. This is all good. But the leap towards a certain kind of
                     					reduction, or more creative speculation, or a bit less grounded but nonetheless
                     					legitimate generalization, ends up being viewed with circumspection and as a
                     					serious challenge.</div>

                     					learned from moving the research discussed above from a paper-based environment
                     					to a computerized environment, but also with these students in mind. We argue
                     					that excessive textual anchoring of speculations and hypotheses comes with a
                     					price, and offer a visualization approach that tries to deal with this; not only
                     					in order to achieve the digital equivalent of “the right example” chosen –
                     					a speculative generalization of the entire “tree”, or “wood”, based on
                     					the careful annotation of its parts – but also in order to push the researcher
                     					to rethink or rephrase their categories, by moving as freely as possible between
                     					generalization-based categorization and formalization-based categorization. It
                     					might encourage the researcher to redefine his or her category system, and this
                     					time not only on the basis of detailed interpretation, but also on the basis
                     of
                     					a (careful) reduction.</div>

                     					yet possible with the tool presented here, but in our opinion can outline one
                     of
                     					the next steps in research. What if we take to an extreme the promise of a
                     					tension between the data-driven attitude and hypothesis-driven attitude. Many
                     					human annotators hope that at some point the machine will learn how to annotate
                     					the text, and continue automatically with their own manual sensitive work;
                     					actually, some annotation tools already do this.<a class="noteRef" href="#d3e775">[8]</a> But what if we try it the other way
                     					around, and speculate about the opposite possibility, where we start from the
                     					forest, from generalization about the trees or the wood as a whole – that is,
                     					from a hypothesis – and only then present it to the annotator, while asking him
                     					or her: Can you reject this generalization? Can you interpret the text
                     					differently so that the data will ultimately undermine the validity of the
                     					generalization?<a class="noteRef" href="#d3e790">[9]</a> Or, alternatively, can you explain the
                     					validity of this claim by abstraction instead of generalization? Such an
                     					exercise’s purpose is not to encourage the interpreter to manipulate (in a
                     					negative sense) the data, but to challenge him or her in a very concrete way;
                     to
                     					aid him or her in thinking differently about the data and generalizations
