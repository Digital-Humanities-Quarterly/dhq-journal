                  <p>Cecilia Lindhé is Associate Professor at HUMlab, Umeå University in Sweden.
                     Lindhé holds a PhD (2008) in Comparative Literature from Uppsala University and
                     she has continuously been working with issues that involve digital research
                     infrastructure, information technology and pedagogy. Her current research spans
                     ancient/medieval rhetorical and aesthetic theory in relation to digital
                     materiality, digital representation of cultural heritage, screen culture and
                     digital literature and art. At present Lindhé is involved in three research

            <!-- Include a brief abstract of the article -->
            <p>In this article, the significance of the rhetorical and modern definitions of
               ekphrasis will be discussed through the lens of digital literature and art. It
               attempts to reinscribe the body in ekphrastic practice by adding touch to the
               abstracted visualism of the eye, and emphasize defining features of the ancient
               usage: orality, immediacy and tactility. What I call the digital ekphrasis with its
               emphasis on enargeia, its strong connections with the ancient definition, and on the
               bodily interaction with the work of art, conveys an aesthetic of tactility;
               digitalis=finger. By tracing and elucidating a historical trajectory that takes the
               concept of ekphrasis in the ancient culture as a starting point, the intention is not
               to reject the theories of the late 1900s, but through a reinterpretation of ekphrasis
               put forward an example of how digital perspectives on classic concepts could
               challenge or revise more or less taken-for-granted assumptions in the humanities. In
               this context ‘the digital’ is not only a phenomenon that could be tied to certain
               digital objects or used as a digital tool, but as an approach to history, with strong
               critical potential. The aim is to show that one of the most important features of our
               digital culture is that it offers new perspectives – not only on current technology –
               but also on literary, cultural and aesthetic historical practices.</p>

            <!-- Include a brief teaser, no more than a phrase or a single sentence -->
            <p>Digital literature and art align with the ancient ekphrasis, especially in the way
               that its rhetorical meaning is about effect, immediacy, aurality, and tactility.</p>

            <head>Introduction</head>
            <p>In his manifesto <title rend="quotes">Tactilism</title> (1921), the futurist F. T.
               Marinetti sketches out the principles of a tactile art form. He suggests that
               theaters where the spectators interact by holding on to ribbons that <quote
                  rend="inline" source="#marinetti1924">produce tactile sensations with different
                  rhythms</quote> and tactile rooms where the floor beneath the dancers’ feet flows
               with running water can accomplish a multisensory engagement <ptr
                  target="#marinetti1924" loc="199"/>. This futurist aesthetics that emphasizes
               immediacy and aims at penetrating the senses of the reader, viewer, and listener,
               without interpretative reflection, is physiological in nature, and obviously
               intimately connected to interactivity and touch: <quote rend="inline"
                  source="#marinetti1924">A visual sense is born in the fingertips,</quote>
               Marinetti claims <ptr target="#marinetti1924" loc="199"/>.<note> Compare the title of
                  Mark B. N. Hansen’s chapter <title rend="quotes">Seeing through the Hand</title>
                  in <ptr target="#hansen2006"/>.</note> Touching artifacts, such as sculptures,
               paintings and the objects of the <title rend="italic">Wunderkammer</title>, was
               commonplace practice in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, and in ancient
               times cult statues and images were not mere representational objects – physical
               interaction was expected.<note> See for example <ptr target="#morris1995"/>, <ptr
                     target="#weddle2010"/>, <ptr target="#alcock1994"/>.</note> Since the
               conceptual art movements of the 1950s and 60s, touching artifacts has again become
               customary and more recently due to the increased corporeal engagement with digital
               interfaces <ptr target="#classen2005"/>. This emphasis on tactility contradicts
                  <q>the tactiloclasm</q> that permeates aesthetic theory where the work of art is
               viewed as untouchable, and concerned with ocular scrutiny only <ptr
                  target="#huhtamo2008"/>.<note> Huhtamo writes, <cit>
                     <quote rend="inline" source="#huhtamo2008">We could speak of
                           <q>tactiloclasms</q> – cases where physical touching is not only absent,
                        but expressly prohibited and suppressed</quote>
                     <ptr target="#huhtamo2008" loc="75"/>
                  </cit>. The emphasis on sight in western cultural practices is well documented.
                  See e.g. <ptr target="#paterson2007"/>, <ptr target="#classen1993"/>, <ptr
                     target="#crary1990"/>
                  <ptr target="#jay1993"/>, <ptr target="#huhtamo2006" loc="17–21"/>.</note> How are
               we to account for the change in aesthetic expression when the interface encourages
               the spectator to touch the artifact and thus positions the entire body as essential
               for the experience and interpretation of the artwork?<note> Mark B. N. Hansen has
                  written extensively about how digital environments profoundly has affected
                  embodied meaning. See for example Mark B. N. Hansen, <ptr target="#hansen2004"/>,
                     <ptr target="#hansen2006"/>. I am aware of the distinction between body and
                  embodiment, where the former concept was introduced by theorists to establish a
                  difference between the body as a static and biological given concept and the body
                  as a historically situated experience. Here I use <q>body,</q> but in the sense of
                     <q>embodiment.</q> For a discussion about body and embodiment, see also <ptr
                     target="#hayles1999"/>.</note> A productive way to discuss these issues is
               through an examination of <emph>ekphrasis</emph> – a concept this article aims to
               revise.</p>
            <p>The established definition of the term –– the description of pictorial art in words
               –– is actually a twentieth-century invention that has been modified for the analysis
               of printed texts. I will hereafter term it the <term>printed ekphrasis</term>.<note>
                  This article is grounded on Ruth Webb’s distinction between the modern and ancient
                     <term>ekphrasis</term>, see <ptr target="#webb2009"/>, but to emphasise the
                  influence of printing technology on <term>ekphrasis</term> during the last
                  centuries I have chosen to use <term>the printed ekphrasis</term> and <term>the
                     rhetorical ekphrasis.</term> There are other scholars that have noted a modern
                  tendency to associate ekphrasis with art only, see for example <ptr
                     target="#maguire1981"/>, <ptr target="#hewlettkoelb2006"/>.</note> As a
               critical term and literary genre, this type of <term>ekphrasis</term> focuses on
               words describing visual objects – a well-known ekphrastic poem is John Keats’ <title
                  rend="quotes">Ode on a Grecian Urn</title> (1820). The <term>printed
                  ekphrasis</term> is derived from the nineteenth-century museum – <quote
                  rend="inline" source="#heffernan1993">the shrine where all poets worship in the
                  secular age,</quote> in the words of Heffernan — and has since been defined and
               discussed with reference to the printed word.<note> James A. W. Heffernan writes: <cit>
                     <quote rend="inline" source="#heffernan1993">Twentieth century ekphrasis
                        springs from the museum, the shrine where all poets worship in a secular
                        age.</quote>
                     <ptr target="#heffernan1993" loc="138"/>
                  </cit>
               </note>. The ancient rhetorical practice of <term>ekphrasis</term> is, on the other
               hand, defined by the assumption of a live audience and emphasizes immediacy and the
               impact on the listener. Further, it is much broader and includes not only artistic
               representations but also <emph>any</emph> description in nature or culture. When an
               orator spoke about a place, a monument or an event unseen or unfamiliar to the
               audience he was supposed to use details to create a visual image <quote rend="inline"
                  source="#quintilian1953">in the eyes of the mind</quote> of the listeners <ptr
                  target="#quintilian1953" loc="8.3.62"/>. The <term>rhetorical ekphrasis</term>
               encompasses aspects relevant for our digital age that have not been fully perceived
               before; digital literature and art align with this concept of <term>ekphrasis</term>,
               especially in the way that its rhetorical meaning is about effect, immediacy,
               aurality, and tactility. The multimodal patterns of performativity in the rhetorical
               situation stage a space-body-word-image-nexus with relevance for how we could
               interpret and discuss digital aesthetics. </p>
            <p>By paying attention to the <term>rhetorical ekphrasis</term> and the oral culture’s
               focus on the audience, I wish to bring out a<emph> digital ekphrasis</emph> in which
               the primary focus is not the description of the subject matter, or the visual object,
               but rather the process of visualization.<note> I should already here hasten to add
                  that the aim of this study is not to attempt to account for the reader’s
                  perception, but for the reading strategies that are inscribed in the work. </note>
               This article attempts then, via the <emph>rhetorical ekphrasis</emph>, to reinscribe
               the body within the <term>printed ekphrasis</term> by adding touch to the abstracted
               visualism of the eye, and emphasize defining features of the ancient usage: orality,
               immediacy and tactility. The <term>digital ekphrasis</term> with its emphasis on
                  <emph>enargeia</emph> (vividness), its strong connections with the ancient
               definition, and on the bodily interaction with the work of art, conveys an aesthetic
               of tactility; <emph>digitalis=finger</emph>. By tracing and elucidating a historical
               trajectory that takes the concept of <term>ekphrasis</term> in the ancient oral
               culture as a starting point, the intention is not to reject the theories of the late
               1900s, but through a reinterpretation of <term>ekphrasis</term> put forward an
               example of how digital perspectives on classic concepts could challenge or revise
               more or less taken-for-granted assumptions in the humanities. </p>
            <p>Here, the significance of the ancient rhetorical definition, as well as the modern
               definition of <term>ekphrasis</term>, will be studied through the prism of digital
               literature and art.<note> For a discussion about the delicate difference between
                  digital literature and art, see <ptr target="#simanowski2011"/>. </note> In this
               context <q>the digital</q> is not only a phenomenon that could be tied to certain
               digital objects or used as a digital tool, but as an approach to history, with the
               same critical potential as for example post-structuralism, gender theory or
               post-colonialism. The aim is to show that one of the most important features of our
               digital culture is that it offers new perspectives – not only on current technology,
               but also on our literary and cultural history, or our <emph>literacy</emph>, even.
               The dominance of print technology during the last five hundred years has certainly
               formed how we relate to art objects. With the advent of print technology, the
               rhetorical emphasis on speech over writing generated <quote rend="inline"
                  source="#guillory2010">a reordering in which writing – in the remediated form of
                  print – would come increasingly to dominate the most important social venues of
                  communication,</quote> writes John Guillory in an essay on the concept of
               mediation <ptr target="#guillory2010" loc="326"/>. This could be compared to the ways
               in which the rhetorical meaning of <term>ekphrasis</term> has been obscured by print
               technology in a similar way to how the <cit>

                  <ptr target="#guillory2010" loc="321"/>
               </cit>. </p>
            <p>This article, then, has as its wider scope to deconstruct the filter of printing
               technologies, with which we look at cultural history, and instead – with <q>the
                  digital</q> as a lens in the form of digital literature and art – renegotiate an
               aesthetic practice that emanates from both rhetoric <emph>and</emph> print
               technology. Accordingly, I want to highlight one possible way for the digital
               humanities: the digital as a critical lens on aesthetic concepts and cultural
               history. </p>

               rhetoric, the origin of <term>ekphrasis</term> is documented in the first centuries
               AD where it occurs in the <title rend="italic">Progymnasmata</title> – compositional
               exercises used in the Hellenistic schools. The <title rend="italic"
                  >Progymnasmata</title> consists of four treatises attributed to Theon, Hermogenes,
               Nikolaos, and Aphthonios. Theon defines <term>ekphrasis</term> as <cit>

               </cit>. Etymologically, <term>ekphrasis</term> originates from Greek <emph>ek</emph>
               (out) <emph>phrazein</emph> (to explicate, declare) and meant originally <q>to tell in full</q> (<emph>εκφραζω</emph>). The goal
               of <term>ekphrasis</term> was <emph>enargeia</emph> (<emph>εναργεια</emph>) – to make
               the motif graphic and alive for the spectator to <q>see</q> what was before him.
                  <term>ekphrasis </term>is also a literary genre and frequently used in Greek and
               Latin literature where it appears for instance during the Homeric period in the
                  <title rend="italic">Iliad</title>, later in Hesiod’s <title rend="italic">Shield
                  of Herakles</title>, Euripides’ <title rend="italic">Electra </title>and <title
                  rend="italic">Ion</title>, in Vergil’s <title rend="italic">Aeneid</title> and in
                  <title rend="italic">Eikones</title> by Philostratus. Some later well known and
               frequently quoted <emph>ekphrases</emph> features in Dante’s <title rend="italic"
                  >Divine Comedy</title>, in Shakespeare’s <title rend="italic">The Rape of
                  Lucrece</title>, in John Ashbery’s <title rend="italic">Self-Portrait in a Convex
                  Mirror</title> and in Rita Dove’s <title rend="quotes">Agosta the Winged Man and
                  Rasha the Black Dove,</title> to mention just a few.</p>
            <p>In the past few decades, attempts at defining <term>ekphrasis</term> conclude that it
               is a verbal description of, or interpretation of a visual work of art. For a long
               period of time, Leo Spitzer’s definition from 1955 set the tone: <cit>
                  <quote rend="inline" source="#spitzer1962">[T]he poetic description of a pictorial
                     or sculptural work of art, which description implies […] the reproduction
                     through the medium of words, of sensuously perceptible objets d’art (<q>ut
                        pictura poesis</q>)</quote>
                  <ptr target="#spitzer1962" loc="72"/>
               </cit>. In <title rend="italic">Museum of Words</title> James A. W. Heffernan works
               out a now well established definition: <emph>[E]kphrasis is the verbal representation
                  of visual representation</emph>
               <ptr target="#heffernan1993" loc="3"/>. Even Heffernan’s definition has been
               criticized though, primarily for being too narrow since it does not include
               literature on literature or abstract art. Claus Clüver has suggested the following
               expansion of Heffernan’s definition: <cit>
                  <quote rend="inline" source="#cluver1997">
                     <emph>Ekphrasis is the verbal representation of a real or fictitious text

                  </quote>
                  <ptr target="#cluver1997" loc="26"/>
               </cit>. By using a semiotic concept of text that also embraces music and
               architecture, the limits of <term>ekphrasis</term> are expanded to allow for art that
               is not merely visual. Tamar Yacobi chooses instead to depart from so-called
                  <emph>ekphrastic models</emph>. These refer to qualities that are common to many
               images such as a specific technique, form, shared motifs or certain traits that are
               characteristic of an artist’s production <ptr target="#yacobi1999"/>. While Yacobi
               wishes to open up the concept to different kinds of image associations, other
               researchers maintain that <term>ekphrasis</term> must build on lucidity,
                  <emph>enargeia</emph>. Somewhere in between Heffernan and Yacobi is Murray
               Krieger, who in <term>ekphrasis</term>: <title rend="italic">The Illusion of the
                  Natural Sign</title> starts from the classical demand for lucidity but extends the
               concept to include everything that links up with spatiality. Krieger’s description of
               how <term>ekphrasis</term> arrests the temporal flow of the narrative as it is
               dedicated to explore spatial dimensions, displays how strongly, still, this
               discussion is anchored in <emph>paragone</emph>, the tradition of the rivalry of the
                  <q>sister arts</q> articulated in the aesthetic theories of e.g. G. E. Lessing and
               Edmund Burke <ptr target="#krieger1992" loc="7"/>. <note> Heffernan also emphasis the
                  rivalry between the art forms: ”Because it verbally represents visual art,
                  ekphrasis stages a contest between rival modes of representation: between the
                  driving force of the narrating word and the stubborn resistance of the fixed
                  image” <ptr target="#heffernan1993" loc="6"/>.</note> This line of thought, which
               establishes a binary between spatial and temporal art forms in relation to
                  <term>ekphrasis</term>, has been continued by scholars such as Krieger and
               Heffernan. W. J. T. Mitchell also writes about the struggle of domination between
               word and image and further argues that <term>ekphrasis </term>is an ideological
               tension between text and image: <cit>
                  <quote rend="inline" source="#mitchell1995">The central goal of ekphrastic hope
                     might be called <q>the overcoming of otherness.</q> Ekphrastic poetry is the

                     alien modes of representation called the visual, graphic, plastic or

                  <ptr target="#mitchell1995" loc="156"/>
               </cit>. Scholars have also written about musical, pictorial and reverse
                  <term>ekphrasis</term> and consequently it has been used to describe not only
               verbal transformations of the visual.<note> See for example <ptr target="#bruhn2000"
                  />, <ptr target="#stewart2006"/>, <ptr target="#bolter1996"/>.</note> Attempts
               have thus been made to expand the concept in different directions, but common to the
               theorists discussed above, is their stressing the primary relevance of the referent,
               the visual object. However, in her important study of <term>ekphrasis</term> and
               film, <title rend="italic">Writing and Filming the Painting</title>, Laura M. Sager
               Eidt claims that <term>ekphrasis</term> does not need to be a purely verbal
               representation of a visual object <ptr target="#eidt2007"/>. If the goal of the
                  <term>ekphrasis </term>is to make the reader or spectator <emph>see</emph>, it is
               possible to push the emphasis from the verbal representation to the
                  <emph>effect</emph> it has on the audience/spectator. To assume such an
                  <emph>enargeia</emph>-perspective ties <term>ekphrasis</term> to reception rather
               than to the referent, and Eidt presents both a potential opening towards the
               rhetorical <emph>ekphrasis</emph> with her <q>cinematic ekphrasis</q> and for
               studying artworks that are not merely verbal. Another important exception is Andrew
               Sprague Becker’s <title rend="italic">The Shield of Achilles and the Poetics of
                  Ekphrasis</title>, in which he uses the rhetorical <term>ekphrasis </term>to
               analyze the Homeric Shield described in chapter 18 of <title rend="italic">The
                  Iliad</title>. Becker criticizes the focus on <term>ekphrasis</term> and
                  <q>picture-like representation</q> and writes, <cit>

            <p>As we have seen above, in contemporary research, <term>ekphrasis</term> is a
               technical device that is used mainly to analyze texts or textual fragments that
               describe visual objects. But that was not the case in antiquity when<emph>
                  ekphrasis</emph> could refer to a specific manner of speaking and writing, and
               could also include descriptions of places and people, as well as of events and
               stories. In fact, only Nikolaos mentions sculptures and pictures as object of
                  <term>ekphrasis</term> and is doing so as a subcategory of <term>ekphrasis</term>
               <ptr target="#kennedy2003" loc="166–8"/>. Contrary to modern usage then, the purpose
               of the ancient definition was not to primarily describe works of art even if
               reference literature such as <title rend="italic">Oxford Classical Dictionary</title>

               an event or a place were to be depicted so vividly as to make it come alive in the

               the credibility of the images to a later moment in time. The oral speaker situation
               entails there not being much room for interpretation, which of course requires images

               descriptions, focus on events or symbols instead of actions), but it is rather the

               more deeply, which creates a distinction between words that, as it were, stays on the

                  <term>ekphrasis</term> are grounded: <emph>phantasia</emph>. In a rhetorical
               context <emph>phantasia</emph> signifies the orator’s internal image that he
               communicated to the listener and in doing so activated images that were latently
               stored in the listener’s mind.<note> For a difference between poetic and rhetorical
                     <emph>phantasia</emph>, see Quintilian 6.2.29-32.</note> Interesting and

               how, as orator, one should practice foreseeing which mental pictures would be
               required to make the <term>ekphrasis</term> successful. According to Aristotle,
                  <emph>phantasia </emph>is a process by which images were presented to the mind and
               he describes how sense impressions were imprinted on the soul, or in a physical way,
               inscribed to that part of the body that constitutes memory, creating so called
               memory-images (<emph>phantasmata</emph>) and in doing so emphasizes the physicality
               of these images.<note> Aristotle, <title rend="italic">On Memory and

               ontological status of the visual object where the visual is a quality of the
               referent, whereas the rhetoricians emphasized the process of visualization and the
               effect it had on the listener.<note> For example, both Quintilian and Longinos are
                  concerned with the effect on the listener, rather than the ontological status of
                  the subject of the visions <ptr target="#webb2009" loc="95, 118"/>.</note> The
               significance of the body and the emphasis on bodily senses in the rhetorical
               situation were thus crucial.<note> This has also been emphasized by Mary Carruthers:
                     <emph>Enargeia </emph>addresses not just the eyes, but all the senses. It is
                  easy to forget this when we read rhetoric texts, because the emphasis is so much
                  on the visual sense. But the visual leads on to and is accompanied by an
                  engagement of all the other senses in a meticulously crafted fiction.” See <ptr

            <head>Why, or, Why not Ekphrasis?</head>
            <p>As Robert Denham’s bibliography <title rend="italic">Poets on Paintings </title>
               shows, the critical interest in <term>ekphrasis</term> has increased since the 1950s
                  <ptr target="#denham2010"/>. And a propos the widespread use of
                  <term>ekphrasis</term> in twentieth-century literature, one calls to mind Edna
               Longley’s 1988 essay <title rend="quotes">No More Poems About Paintings?</title>
               During this time, artistic, technological and ideological conditions have changed,
               but theories of <term>ekphrasis</term> have remained relatively constant and current
               research deals, above all, with the printed <term>ekphrasis</term>. As we have seen
               above, the ancient practice of <term>ekphrasis </term>and the concept used in modern
               literary criticism belong to fundamentally different systems, as well as different
               media configurations. Hewlett Koelb, in her highly relevant book <title rend="italic"
                  >The Poetics of Description</title>, even claims that <cit>
                  <quote rend="inline" source="#hewlettkoelb2006">this new ecphrasis with its
                     emphasis on obviously mediated subject matter is not just narrower but in its

                  <ptr target="#hewlettkoelb2006" loc="5"/>
               </cit>. This discrepancy between the two systems could account for why new media
               theorists place the two concepts in the same category, but also are reluctant to use
                  <term>ekphrasis</term> as a critical tool and artistic device in computer based
               media art.<note> In <title rend="italic">Remediation</title> Bolter and Grusin

                     <term>ekphrasis</term> is just mentioned in passing when general subject
                  matters are listed. Works of art have no special status. However, in a recent
                  essay Aaron Kashtan argues that interactive fiction can be analysed within the
                  same literary tradition as for example visual prose and ekphrastic textuality. See

            <p>Aya Karpinska’s digital poem <title rend="italic">ek-stasis</title> appears to be a

                  Engberg’s highly relevant dissertation, <title rend="italic">Born Digital. Writing
                     Poetry in the Age of New Media</title>, a CD that includes a clip of <title

               textual fragments, in different shades of gray, can be read from the front as well as
               from the back and some words are suspended in the air against a black background. No
               directions are given as to how or in which order the poem should be read, rather it
               is about paving your way among rectangles and words: <quote rend="inline"

               Maria Engberg <ptr target="#engberg2007" loc="47"/>. The title <emph>ekstasis
                  </emph>(<emph>ἓκστ</emph>
               <emph>ă</emph>
               <emph>σις</emph>: Greek <emph>ek</emph>: <q>out of</q>, <q>from</q> and
                  <emph>stasis</emph>: <q>state of</q>) means <q>being put out of its place</q> and ecstasy signifies a
               state of rapture where memory is lost and transcendence to a non-corporeal realm
               takes place. As Engberg points out: <cit>
                  <quote rend="inline" source="#engberg2007">These works create an experience of a
                     place in which the text is one part, at times with surprisingly stark and
                     minimalist visual expression. The <q>virtual reality</q> of these works does
                     not rely on high intensive graphic representation, but rather on our
                     imagination and those few cues that are needed for the reader/user to
                     experience the work spatiotemporally</quote>
                  <ptr target="#engberg2007" loc="85"/>
               </cit>. <emph>Virtual reality</emph>, which <emph>ek-stasis</emph> metaphorically
               stages, is characterized by a new way of looking if compared to photography or film
               since the perspective no longer is static; in <emph>virtual reality </emph>the
               beholder has, as it were, fallen through the frame and finds herself in a world
               completely made up of visual data. But, in Karpinska’s poem, things do not really
               work that way, since the reader can never be immersed into the graphical world. The
               reading takes place in an oscillation between presence and absence and in the midst
               of bodily interaction and decoding. By using letters instead of pictures, while
               simultaneously creating images in the form of text shaping geometrical and spatial
               formations, the work forces the reader to interact with the interface and it
               continuously stages play that oscillates between the corporeal and the
                  <emph>extra</emph>-corporeal. The poem alienates traditional reading and
               emphasizes – thematically as well as formally – the necessity of touch. This is not
               an ekphrastic poem, Engberg claims, although its title could be said to allude to the concept.<note>

                           >ek-stasis</title>, however, does not seem to be a verbal description of

               the printed text and the modern <term>ekphrasis</term> is taken as our point of
               reference. Meanwhile, it is observed how the poem stages an illusory place that is
               experienced in parallel with the reading of the text. As we will see below, a similar
               tension between presence and absence constitutes the <term>ekphrasis</term> of
               antiquity. <emph>Ek-stasis</emph> stages simultaneity and in N. Katherine Hayles’
               words, a <emph>feedback loop </emph>through the reader’s interaction with the work.
               According to Hayles the electronic text is processual. This means that the existence
               of a work is dependent on computer files and software that execute words of command
               and hardware that can run the software: <cit>
                  <quote rend="inline" source="#hayles2006">These digital characteristics imply that
                     the poem ceases to exist as self-contained object and instead becomes a
                        <emph>process</emph>, an event brought into existence when the program runs
                     on the appropriate software loaded onto the right hardware</quote>
                  <ptr target="#hayles2006" loc="181–2"/>
               </cit>. The computer produces the text as an event and the reader’s interactions
               modify and thus determine the direction of the text, functioning like a physical
               feedback looping back to the machine admonishing it to change its behaviors. This
               feedback is a form of simultaneity that can be described as more direct than the
               experience of reading printed literature.<note> Of course, already Marshall McLuhan
                  associated simultaneity with the instant speed of electricity, in opposition to
                  the sequential logic of print. See <ptr target="#mcluhan1964"/>.</note>
            </p>
            <p>According to Oliver Grau, immersion is a key to understanding the development of new
               media and in <title rend="italic">Virtual Art</title> he reports the long history of
               the dream of stepping into the artwork itself. Grau’s point of departure is the
               European tradition of mural paintings, like the ones in the Villa dei Misteri in
               Pompeii, which were intended to create immersion and illusion <ptr target="#grau2003"
                  loc="7"/>. Grau claims that <quote rend="inline" source="#grau2003">the
                  expression <q>virtual reality</q> is a paradox, a contradiction in terms, and it
                  describes a space of possibility or impossibility formed by illusionary addresses
                  to the senses.</quote> He contends further, <quote rend="inline"
                  source="#grau2003">the visual strategies of immersion in the virtual reality of
                  the computer and its precursors in art and media history</quote> differ
               fundamentally from imagination addressed through words, as expressed by the concept
               of <term>ekphrasis</term>
               <ptr target="#grau2003" loc="15"/>. Obviously, the interaction between visual,
               verbal, auditive and kinetic elements in digital literature and art puts the concept
               of <term>ekphrasis</term> in a different light: the visual object can be described by
               a voice or a text while also being possible to mobilize and in that way assume new
               formations. Further, the visual object may transform into a verbal formation and vice
               versa and can actually be staged when the reader or user to a higher degree creates
               the artwork through physical actions. And even though virtual reality environments
               stage a total impression of the image, the user is still interacting with interfaces
               in the form of a headmounted display, goggles and gloves.<note> There is also the
                  case of augmented reality where the computer is not drawing the whole visual scene
                  but augment the user’s view of the physical world. </note> Just as Grau describes
               the characteristics of VR and immersion as a space of possibility and impossibility,
               the ancient <term>ekphrasis</term> is dependent on an <q>as-if-presentness.</q> In
               Quintilian’s description of <emph>enargeia</emph> an <q>as if</q> (<emph>quam
                  si</emph>) always figures: <emph>enargeia</emph> is about illusion and takes place
               in an ongoing tension between presence and absence <ptr target="#webb2009"
                  loc="168–9"/>. It is this oscillation or process of visualization that is of
               interest here, not the representation of the object. The opposition between what is
               seen and what is imagined is misleading. Even advanced VR-systems where the spectator
               is exposed to a full visual presence could be said to play on an
                  <q>as-if-presentness.</q> In <title rend="quotes">There Are No Visual
                  Media</title>, W. J. T. Mitchell maintains that the term <q>visual media</q> is
               misleading since it is so strongly associated with vision. He asserts that the visual
               is intimately linked with other senses like hearing and touch. But this, he states,
               does not include the <term>ekphrasis</term>: <quote rend="block"
                  source="#mitchell2007">The crucial role of ekphrasis, however, is that the
                     <q>other</q> medium, the visual graphic, or plastic object, is never made
                  visible or tangible <emph>except</emph> by way of the medium of language. One
                  might call ekphrasis a form of nesting without touching or suturing, a kind of
                  action-at-distance between two rigorously separated sensory and semiotic tracks,
                  one that requires completion in the mind of the reader. This is why poetry remains
                  the most subtle master-medium of the <emph>sensus communis</emph>, no matter how
                  many spectacular multimedia inventions are devised to assault our collective

            <p>This could be true if we assume the modern print-based definition and do not take
               qualities, such as tactility, immediacy and aurality, of the multisensory qualities
               of the ancient <term>ekphrasis</term> into consideration. However, Mitchell does
               argue that all media are <emph>mixed media</emph> and in their realization depend
               upon all the senses. In a complex media ecology the verbal is not simply verbal but
               is also intimately connected with the senses and other medial expressions. The
               occurrence of visual elements in VR-environments, digital art and literature, could,
               with Bolter, Ryan and Grau, be said to deny, or make ekphrasis a redundant concept,
               but this is only if we apply the print-based definition of the term and do not take
               the immediacy, performativity and multisensory circumstances of rhetoric into
               account. One reason why theorists make no difference between the rhetorical and the
               printed <term>ekphrasis </term>and argue that <term>ekphrasis</term> is redundant
               within new media art could be discussed in the light of Guillory’s analysis of the
               origin of the media concept, where he argues that a current problem with the media
               concept is related to how <quote rend="inline" source="#guillory2010">[c]ultural
                  disciplines founded on the older scheme of the fine arts […] manifest a falsely
                  residual character because they remain theoretically unintegrated into the system
                  of the media</quote>
               <ptr target="#guillory2010" loc="360"/>. To stimulate cultural disciplines that are
               founded on the older scheme of the arts it is of importance not only to discuss,
               analyze and understand non-digital artifacts in relation to <q>older technologies</q>
               (for example how print technology influenced the novel and the concept of genre), but
               also to investigate how the digital perspective could challenge theory, method and
               our view on history. Guillory again: <cit><quote rend="inline" source="#guillory2010">If
                  a new instauration of the cultural disciplines is to be attempted, it is all the
                  more necessary that scholars of culture strongly resist relegating the traditional
                  arts to the sphere of antiquated technologies, the tacit assumption in the losing
                  competition between literature and the new media</quote>
               <ptr target="#guillory2010" loc="361"/></cit>. Consequently, it is vital to understand
               digital culture and technology, not only as the latest and currently predominant
               technology, but also as a critical perspective that could revitalize media historical
               approaches in the traditional disciplines. And naturally, it is equally important to
               let older media theory (rhetoric for example) influence analyses of digital
               culture.</p>

            <p>In her <title rend="italic">Representations: Images of the World in Ciceronian
                  Oratory</title>, Ann Vasaly stresses the importance of place and the occasional

                  source="#vasaly1993">a study of Cicero’s references to the visual environment

               <ptr target="#vasaly1993" loc="129"/></cit>. The difference between a verbally constructed
               scene and the one where the audience could gaze at, for example, the scene of a
               crime, is a matter of degree. However, the goal for an orator was not mainly to
               describe the visual object, but was rather about the <emph>process </emph>of
               visualization and of how he led his <cit><quote rend="inline" source="#vasaly1993"

               reactions in motion, even before a voice starts to speak, characterizes the
               interactive installation <title rend="italic">Screen</title>.<note> By Noah
                  Wardrip-Fruin together with Josh Carroll, Robert Coover, Shawn Greenlee, Andre
                  McLain and Benjamin Shine. <title rend="italic">Screen</title> was first shown in
                  2003, a later version was made for <title rend="italic">SIGGRAPH</title> in 2007. </note>
               <title rend="italic">Screen</title> problematizes language’s ability to represent
               memory and it does so through the orchestration of an aesthetics that combines oral,
               print and digital communication strategies. The user can listen to words, read words
               and touch words. Words are read out loud, they are displayed in temporal sequence on
               a page-like wall, but they also move around in a three dimensional space. <title
                  rend="italic">Screen</title> is created and can be viewed in a CAVE environment,
               typically a four-surfaced room that includes three walls and a floor display. Text or
               graphics can be projected on to the three surrounding walls as well as to the floor.
               When the reader enters the cave wearing goggles and gloves a text is displayed at one
               of the walls as well as read out loud by a male speaker. Words that sometimes feel
                  <q>so vivid […] that we feel we can almost
                  reach out and touch them</q> could not only be read as a description of
                  <emph>enargeia</emph>, but also become enacted in a literal way when the words
               start to peel away from the walls and float freely in the space that surrounds the
               reader. She can try to put them back in place with the data glove but it becomes
               increasingly difficult when the words are detaching themselves faster and faster.
               This could be compared to Ruth Webb’s description of <term>ekphrasis</term> as words
               being a force acting on a listener <ptr target="#webb2009"/>. Eventually, when too
               many words are floating around the reader, the rest come off and the texts collapse. </p>
            <p>As Roberto Simanowski points out, <title rend="italic">Screen</title> raises
               questions about memory and place: <quote rend="inline" source="#simanowski2011">[…]
                  what […] defines memory. Is it what is stored in an external medium or what one
                  carries around in the mind?</quote>
               <ptr target="#simanowski2011" loc="46"/> Put differently, <title rend="italic"
                  >Screen</title> raises questions about the spatiality of memory recollection. The
               mnemonic system developed in the ancient period is based on loci, the placement of
               allegorical images within constructed mental architectures such as a building or a
               landscape (<ptr target="#carruthers2008"/>, <ptr target="#yates2010"/>).
                  <emph>Memoria</emph> and the practice of <emph>loci communes</emph> thus stressed
               the importance of linking spatiality to memory images <ptr target="#quintilian1953"
                  loc="11, Ii"/>
               <emph>sqq</emph>. <title rend="italic">Screen</title> brings the close connection
               between visualization and memory in ancient theories and techniques of memorization
               to the fore. Memory and meaning are temporarily established through the bodily
               interaction with words that peel off and are put back in place. But the words keep
               coming off at an increasing speed, which places the reader in a constant tension
               between presence and absence, between significance and non-significance. As we have
               seen, a similar tension between presence and absence constitutes the rhetorical
                  <term>ekphrasis</term>. Webb explains: <quote rend="inline" source="#webb2009"
                  >The audience (whether readers, listeners, viewers or spectators) combine a state
                  of imaginative and emotional involvement in the worlds represented with an
                  awareness that these worlds are not real</quote>
               <ptr target="#webb2009" loc="168–9"/>. The oscillation between presence and absence has
               points of contact also with <emph>enargeia</emph> and the rhetorical
                  <emph>ekphrasis,</emph> which accentuates the tension present in all reading
               between being situated and physically anchored, while creating presence in the
               fictive universe that we attempt to visualize while reading. </p>
            <p>A defining feature of the rhetorical <term>ekphrasis</term> was not just an efficient
               use of verbal description, but concerned also immediacy and immersion through the
               senses. In <emph>Progymnasmata</emph>, Hermogenes describes <term>ekphrasis</term> as
               an expression that brings about sight through sound: <cit><quote rend="inline"
                  source="#kennedy2003">Virtues (aretai) of an ecphrasis are, most of all, clarity
                  (saphêneia) and vividness (enargeia); for the expression should almost create
                  seeing through hearing</quote>
               <ptr target="#kennedy2003" loc="65"/></cit>. The auditive dimension of
                  <term>ekphrasis</term> has been lost in the modern definition, but was of course
               an important element in the rhetorical situation. The audible features of<emph>
                  Screen</emph> could be compared to the speaker as guide showing the listener
               around. The spoken words direct the reader’s attention towards the text and the
               speakers lead the reader through the work. Again, let us read the definition of
                  <term>ekphrasis</term> as it could be translated: <quote rend="inline"
                  source="#webb2009">Ekphrasis is a descriptive [periegematikos] speech which

                  tour</quote>
               <ptr target="#webb2009" loc="54"/>.<note> This could be compared to the rhetorical
                  concept of <emph>ductus</emph> that: <quote rend="inline"
                     source="#carruthers2010b">analyse the experience of artistic form as an

                     itself.</quote> See <ptr target="#carruthers2010b" loc="214"/>
               </note> Quintilian also writes about how visual impressions aroused by

               <quote rend="inline" source="#quintilian1953">makes us seem not so much to narrate

               however, Hellenistic visual art and poetry also created modes of viewing in order to
               involve and integrate viewers and readers visually as well as spatially into
                  compositions.<note> See <ptr target="#wands2006"/> and <ptr target="#zanker2003"

            <p>In the digital <emph>ekphrasis,</emph> emphasis is moved from the problem of
               representing a visual object with words, to the user’s bodily interaction with an
               environment, her relational experience where the words act as a quasi-physical force
               acting upon her.<note> In this context it would be highly relevant to also discuss
                  the concept of performativity (actio, pronuntiatio) that lies at the heart of
                  rhetoric. In a forthcoming article I discuss how rhetorical <emph>actio
                  </emph>(the realization of a speech by vocalization and accompanying physical
                  movements) in digital literature and art is performed by the user rather than the
                  speaker.</note> Digital interfaces direct attention to the physical interaction
               and to the materiality of the work, and thus encourage a rediscovery of a
               bodily/tactile and multisensory experience in relation also to non-digital artifacts.
               That reading takes place, and always has, in a tension between the corporeal, the
               spatial and the metaphorical goes without saying, but digital works inevitably
               foreground and refocus the relation between immediate and embodied touch, since the
               reader is so distinctly inscribed in its structure through the active feedback loop
                  <ptr target="#scarry1999"/>. The print-based definitions of <term>ekphrasis</term>
               often disregard the immediacy that was its condition in antiquity. Immediacy is
               characteristic of processual electronic literature, which at the same time demands of
               its user a more painstaking interpretative or decoding practice. Both <title
                  rend="italic">Ek-stasis</title> and <title rend="italic">Screen</title> stage
               immediacy, or a direct <emph>feedback loop</emph> through the reader’s interaction
               with the work. Without drawing a direct analogy between the ancient and the
               contemporary view of the reader/listener it could be illuminating to bring out the
               ancient rhetor’s emphasis on involving the listener in the course of events. Webb
               writes: <cit><quote rend="inline" source="#webb2009">To emphasize the rhetorical nature
                  of <term>ekphrasis</term> is also to draw attention to the vestigial orality of

            <p>During the last years a substantial critique of the hegemony of vision in our western
               cultural heritage has surfaced.<note>See footnote 3.</note> Indeed, sight was
               considered the noblest of senses during antiquity, which we find in the writings of
               for example Heraclitus, Plato and Aristotle. However, the emphasis on aurality and
               physical engagement was also important in the oral, rhetorical situation. In <title
                  rend="italic">The Senses of Touch</title>, Mark Paterson has shown how Greek
               histories of measurement were multisensory and dependent on the body. Paterson
               writes: <quote rend="block" source="#paterson2007">Before it becomes an abstracted,
                  visual set of symbols on a surface, at one stage geometry involved the actual
                  bodily process of measuring space. In the measuring process, the hands, feet, eyes
                  and body are all involved in spatial apprehension and perception. Spatial
                  relations mediated through the body become represented in abstract form through a
                  set of visual symbols. As we know, such visual symbols become part of a whole
                  system of representation, geometry, which is subtracted from the original,
                  embodied measuring process. <ptr target="#paterson2007" loc="60"/>
               </quote>
            </p>
            <p>The development of geometry into an abstract form also meant an active forgetting of
               the senses, which implies a move from <cit><quote rend="inline" source="#paterson2007"
                  >the variability of the senses and sensory experience to the static invariability
                  of a desensualized, abstract space</quote>
               <ptr target="#paterson2007" loc="65"/></cit>. This is, according to Paterson, symptomatic
               for the way the body has been written out of the cultural history of the West and
               instead emphasis has been put on the visual sense. The development of geometry
               represents a parallel to the way printing technology has cemented the concept of
                  <term>ekphrasis</term> to something that is concerned with ocular scrutiny only,
               and as a consequence <term>ekphrasis </term>has been described as a redundant
               critical tool for analyzing digital artifacts. The <emph>digital ekphrasis</emph>,
               though, could be used as a critical device that picks up immediacy and tactility,
               that were so central during antiquity, and by doing so rejects discourses that try to
               transcend the body. Taking touch and physical interaction into account could then
               enable a reactivating of all the senses in analyses of earlier (print-bound)
               ekphrastic practice as well. As we have seen, in antiquity <term>ekphrasis </term>was
               an important link to creating the desired intimate communication situation between
               speaker and listener, and the emphasis on all the bodily senses played a crucial
               role. Digital interactive installations foreground the importance of space in a
               similar sense to how ancient rhetoric was based on its performance in particular
               (public) spaces – such as the agora and the stage – or with Mary Carruthers: <cit><quote
                  rend="inline" source="#carruthers2010a">[T]he heart of rhetoric, as of all art,
                  lies in its performance; it proffers both visual spectacle and verbal dance to an

               <ptr target="#carruthers2010a" loc="2"/></cit>. By uncovering the past through the digital

               dismissal of <term>ekphrasis</term> in relation to digital artifacts, the hegemony of

            <p>As shown by the discussions above, it seems possible to re-interpret the concept of

               static fixing of boundaries between image and text and demonstrates how the
               rhetorical non-text based <term>ekphrasis</term> with its call for interaction and
               tactility stages dissolution of traditional forms. Rereading the printed
                  <term>ekphrasis </term>by way of the ancient emphasis on <emph>enargeia</emph> and
               the immediacy of the rhetorical multisensory situation, and further taking into
               consideration the dependence upon physical interaction of digital works, the process
               of visualization or, differently put, the constant tension between presence and
               absence together with physical interaction, becomes the constituting factor of
                  <term>ekphrasis</term>. By exploring tactical and auditive aspects in relation to
               ancient rhetoric and digital interfaces, one can also begin to ask with Paterson
                  <cit><quote rend="inline" source="#paterson2007">whether it is possible to go beyond
                  the ocular centric in traditional aesthetic and literary practices, and consider
                  other modes of experience and forms of attention, such as those made available by
                  touch</quote>
               <ptr target="#paterson2007"/></cit>. Further, the digital interface as a critical lens
               could renegotiate rhetorical and aesthetic theories, but also offer new ways to think
               about the specificity of print – for example, to see the printed codex as an
               interactive object rather than a static artifact.<note>That digitalization offers the
                  possibility to re-examine the notion of the printed codex-bound book have among
                  others Jerome McGann, Johanna Drucker and Andrew Piper shown. On this view, the
                  codex book is distinguished by being a <q>program</q> that <q>does</q> and
                     <q>executes</q> rather than a static artifact and in that sense constitutes a
                  prerequisite of digital programming: both are distinguished by performativity.
                  McGann writes that a book is never <q>self-identical</q> – it does not stand in
                  opposition to digital literature’s presupposed openness and performativity; it
                  does not close upon itself as a static, life-less artifact. See <ptr

                     target="#piper2009"/>.</note> Or, in other words, to re-discover written and
