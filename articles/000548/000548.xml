      <body>
         <p>The digital revolution has changed the approach to research, especially for humanities.
            In the last decades the process of image scanning, transcription and creation of digital
            archives of text has materialized, but many scholars aren't conscious of the results it
            can achieve for their studies. For that reason, Analysis of Ancient and Medieval Texts
            and Manuscripts: Digital Approaches aims to show the possibilities given by
            computer-assisted methods in the analysis of ancient and medieval codices. In
            particular, there is a focus on the combination and comparison of data, which can lead
            to better results than in the past. Even if the publication dates to 2014 and in these
            last few years the research has improved, the volume is an important instrument to
            explore the world of digital humanities and its potential contributions to research. The
            book is divided into five sections – each of them dedicated to a certain aspect of
            manuscripts’ analysis. As explained in the acknowledgements, the articles contained in
            this compiled volume were presented in a workshop organized on April 2-3, 2012 in Leuven
            and Brussels.</p>
         <p>The four essays of the first section, <title rend="quotes">Stemmatology,</title>
            recognize the importance of computer-assisted methods, but suggest combining them with
            the classical approach elaborated by Karl Lachmann and Paul Maas. The first article, by
            Tuomas Heikkilä, shows the results of using six algorithms to know the textual tradition
            of the first ten chapters of the Vita et miracula s. Symeonis: RHM, Semstem, R&amp;B,
            MP, NJ and NeighborNet. All the algorithms revealed three large groups which correspond
            to the preliminary grouping based on Lachmannian-Maasian method, but there are some
            difficulties with contamination of the text. The same problem occurs in the following
            article by Philipp Roelli, who analyzed Petrus Alfonsi’s Dialogus and recognized that
            the algorithm had not been able to distinguish many <hi rend="italic">Leitfehler
            </hi>(or <hi rend="italic">errores significativi</hi>). </p>
         <p>The third and the fourth essays illustrate similar studies, with the purpose “to extend
            philology through the aid of the computer” [Andrews and Macé 2014, 70]: Jean-Baptiste
            Camps and Florian Cafiero applied the algorithm to Li Bestiaires d'Amours of Richart de
            Fornival to create a stemma codicum and compare it with the true stemma; Alberto
            Cantera, meanwhile, analyzed the manuscripts of the Avestan corpus, with all the
            difficulties related to a text composed orally and transmitted in that way for a long
            time. We can say, based on their experiments, that the computer-assisted method has the
            advantage of saving time during the analysis, but it still needs improvement: therefore
            the suggestion is to combine it with the classical approach, as they compensate each
            other. In fact, they use the same material and the same principles, but in a different
            way and with different achievements. So we stand to benefit from the possibilities that
            the two approaches offer, promising the same result in the study of a document in the
            future.</p>
         <p>Figure 1. The true stemma of Li Bestiaires d'Amours of Richart de Fornival and the one
            created by Camps and Cafiero with an algorithm [Andrews and Macé 2014, 85]</p>
         <p>The second section, “Statistics and Stylistics”, comprises three articles referring to
            the application of statistical methods in analysis of a text. The first one, by Armin
            Hoenen, illustrates the experiment of producing an artificial tradition by using an
            algorithm (ATG), in order to develop a potent stemmatology. The algorithm, as if it was
            a copyist, has analyzed an input manuscript and introduced several letter changes to the
            copy it has produced, with the purpose being to get an output corpus similar to real
            corpora. This study is only the first step, but it has revealed that copyists tended to
            make mistakes for several reasons, not only for the resemblance of the letters: in fact
            there are other influencing factors like their proficiency, mother tongue, or
            concentration of the scribe. Just at the beginning, its first results have referred to
            single letters, and next Hoenen wants to investigate the distribution of words and
            variants. </p>
         <p>An interesting experiment is made by Karina van Dalen-Oskam and described in the second
            essay. Its aim was to consider Jacob van Maerlant’s Scolastica, trying to distinguish
            the text edited by modern editors from the one transmitted by medieval codices. The
            results have shown the similarities between the two versions, which is not surprising,
            but can be useful to recognize the attitudes towards the texts. Therefore van
            Dalen-Oskam, referencing the article “The Scribe as Editor” by Elspeth Kennedy [Kennedy
            1970], notes that the experiment gives a not-very-convenient conclusion: the scribe is
            like an editor who made choices for the transmission, just as nineteenth-century and
            contemporary editors do. For this reason in order to prepare new editions, we should be
            aware of the importance of scribes’ work and not only of the text itself – recalling the
            title of a volume by Leighton D. Reynolds and Nigel G. Wilson, texts and transmission
            are two essentials elements for philological studies and the one necessarily implies the
            other [Reynolds and Wilson 1983].</p>
         <p>The last article of this section is by Francesco Stella, with the collaboration of Luca
            Verticchio and Stefania Pennasilico. Considering the lexicon of epistolary corpora in
            Latin from the republican to the humanistic period (Cicero, Pliny the Younger,
            Augustine, Alcuin of York, Abelard and Petrarch), the study wanted to understand the
            historical development of the Latin language using the program Analisi lessicale. It
            permitted identifying the most frequent terms (et, in, non, est, ut), the empty terms
            (enim is one of the most used) or the variation of forms in the different authors
            analyzed, in order to make statistical conclusions. Starting from this experiment the
            hope is to deepen the relationships between diction and social-cultural communication,
            with the purpose to formulate a general hypothesis related to the literary language. </p>
         <p>Figure 2. Stella’s ten most common terms in Cicero, Pliny the Younger, Augustine and
            Alcuin of York [Andrews and Macé 2014, 166]</p>
         <p>The third section, “Intertextuality”, focuses on the possibilities offered by several
            digital archives – important sources to analyze a text and its tradition. One of them is
            the project Musisque Deoque, dedicated to Latin poetry and described in the first essay
            by Linda Spinazzè. The digital archive is useful for specific researches towards the
            document, like filtering specific meters out or finding words in a particular position
            of the verse, but it also allows inserting a digital edition into the corpus. Therefore
            Spinazzè has shown the way to edit Maximianus’ elegiac work for Musisque Deoque, noting
            the possibility to read the critical apparatus, to interrogate variants and to get
            information related to a specific codex. Its instrument is the prototype for the
            creation of a cyberspace for classical literature, which represents the future of
            humanities with a collaboration between philology and technology.</p>
         <p>The three following essays explore other digital archives, whose aims are similar to
            Musisque Deoque: Samuel Rubenson describes the database of the Apophthegmata Patrum,
            which is able to analyze at various levels the corpus of monastic fathers, with the
            possibility for a scholar to share his work on a text and to give an updated version of
            the text itself; Charlotte Tupman and Anna Jordanous talk about the Sharing Ancient
            Wisdoms (SAWS) project and several methods to link and share the relationship between
            one wisdom text and another; finally Maxim Romanov illustrates a way to study the
            Arabical sources by developing text-mining techniques, in order to extract information
            from a certain document thanks to metadata. </p>
         <p>Figure 3. Musisque Deoque digital archive</p>
         <p>The fourth section, “Script analysis”, examines the importance of paleography to the
            study of ancient and medieval manuscripts. Just as philology, the discipline has
            advanced over the last few years of the digital revolution. In the first essay Ainoa
            Castro Correa gives an overview of the paleographical problems to analyze a codex,
            referring in particular to several tools applied to the Visigothic script. After
            research in the archives, Castro Correa has created a database of the documentation from
            the early medieval history of Galicia in order to extract different information from
            each text: the signature, the type of writing and other notes that can be useful in the
            study of a codex. Castro Correa has also used Adobe Photoshop to develop analysis of the
            Visigothic script, because certain elements can be understood only with the use of an
            image. For this reason the author built a catalogue of graphic forms which included
            several aspects like the form of the letter or the abbreviations, and then compared all
            the images. That experiment has allowed the creation of a graphic profile by using
            metadata, which in the future can be considered the first step to study an ancient or a
            medieval document. There are obviously some difficulties to overcome – for example the
            script variations of a certain scribe – but we can be positive that in few years there
            could be a collaboration between the experienced paleographic eye and digital
            paleography.</p>
         <p>The second essay of this section, by Eugenio R. Luján and Eduardo Orduña, explores the
            Hesperia databank of Palaeohispanic languages, which collect the inscriptions from the
            Iberian Peninsula, excepts for the ones in Latin, Greek and Phoenician. Therefore it is
            explained how to navigate the database and that it is possible to do researches in a
            text and see its variants, and also to look for lexical and bibliographical references
            by using specific entries. </p>
         <p>Figure 4. The Hesperia databank of Palaeohispanic languages</p>
         <p>The last section of the book, “Codicology”, refers to the manuscript itself, seen as the
            medium by which we know ancient and medieval literature. Its two articles show
            collaboration between the discipline and the most recent technologies, in order to aid
            greatly the study of writing. The first one, by Ira Rabin, discusses the possibility to
            employ ink identification to create a database which could give more information during
            the analysis of a codex. After explaining the different types of ink (soot, plant,
            iron-gall and inks of a mixed composition), there is an overview of the analytic
            procedures which can be used to identify a certain ink: the Vibrational spectroscopy,
            the analysis by X-ray fluorescence technique, and the multi-color microscope. </p>
         <p>The second article, by Patrick Andrist, starts with a question asked by the author to
            few colleagues: “how important is it that the date of a manuscript is more or less
            correct?” [Andrews and Macé 2014, 309]. The date is obviously significant in cataloguing
            ancient texts, but we face difficulty in giving precise information. Accordingly Andrist
            illustrates several methods to prepare the online description of a document, like the
            mono-layer and bi-layer model which also permit one to understand the structure and the
            content of a codex.</p>

               target="https://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/btv1b107229706"/>) </p>
         <p>The volume ends with an essay in which Joris J. Van Zundert discusses the methodological
            innovation of digital scholarly editions. Their aim is to collect and present a text in
            multiple visualizations, in order to illustrate all the necessary information of certain
            text. That can be achieved also by printed editions, but such tasks as indexing and
            bibliography are easier to access with the digital medium. Van Zundert also talks about
            two important capabilities of the digital codex: interactivity and processing. In fact,
            it is possible to edit, change or annotate a document based on his interpretation, which
            in a print text can be done only in the margins. The hope is that in the future we could
            improve the potential offered by the digital revolution and exceed its current limits.
            As Van Zundert says in conclusion, “Thus we have a glass half full. Good, now let us
            fill it further.” [Andrews and Macé 2014, 344].</p>
         <p>Analysis of Ancient and Medieval Texts and Manuscripts: Digital Approaches is an
            important source with which to understand how the digital revolution has changed, and
            also changes, the approach to literary studies. The essays of the volume express, in
            most cases, the first steps for the future development of collaborations between
            philology, paleography, codicology and the most recent technologies, with the assumption
            that many aspects still need to be improved. Even in six years much progress has been
            made because today classical studies participants make use of digital resources and
            cannot ignore their contribution to research. </p>
         <p>We can therefore recall some of the most important projects of recent years, like ones
            developed by Monica Berti at the University of Leipzig: the Digital Fragmenta
            Historicorum Graecorum (DFHG) and the Digital Athenaeus, which intend to provide a
            digital version of Fragmenta Historicorum Graecorum (FHG) and Athenaeus’ Deipnosophists
            and extract from the texts additional information not included in the print edition. A
            significant database is also Divination and Greek History (Archaic to Classical).
            Reassessing Greek Oracular Responses, created by Maurizio Giangiulio at the University
            of Trento: its aim is to edit, commentate, and translate Delphic literary responses,
            analyzing their narrative framing and collecting as many loci paralleli as possible.
            Another Italian project is Online Humanities Scholarship: A Digital Medical Library
            based on Ancient Texts (DIGMEDTEXT) by Isabella Andorlini of the University of Parma,
            which provides electronic editions of ancient medical sources (papyri, ostraca and
            tablets) and the possibility to examine texts, translations, commentary, metadata and
            images. To conclude, it is worth mentioning the project Iliadoscope, developed by David
            Bouvier and Ariane Jambé at the University of Lausanne: the intent is to visualize the
            Iliad with its paraphrase and scholia in the Byzantine manuscript Genavensis græcus 44,
            comparing the texts and searching for lexical correspondences. The above are only few
            projects of the last few years, but they demonstrate how computer-assisted methods are
            an essential source for humanities and their use will inevitably grow in the future.
            That is really an achievement.</p>
