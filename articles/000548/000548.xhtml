                     the Humanities, <cite class="title italic">Digital Yoknapatawpha</cite> is an
                     international and collaborative project composed of William Faulkner scholars
                     and technologists. Its goal is to create a comprehensive database of all the
                     locations, characters, and events in Faulkner’s Yoknapatawpha fictions with the
                     aim of visualizing the data through a series of “deep
                     atlases” and other displays. This paper traces the development
                     cycle of a supplementary narrative structure analysis dashboard that allows
                     users to explore the chronology, narrative status, and date range of all of the
                     texts set in his mythic county. In doing so, it bridges some of the significant
                     gaps between narratological theory and computational methods, opens up a
                     conversation about representing narrative data, and suggests some possible
                     avenues for research with the dashboard.

                     narratolology to computation,” as Mani already lamented in 2013 [<a class="ref" href="#mani2013">Mani 2013</a>]. He lists narratologists’ concern with discourse over
                     fabula, and the relatively rudimentary quality of narrative generation, as
                     causes of this one-way traffic. In addition to these, two large deterrents to
                     the more widespread adoption of methods in computational narratology are the
                     inter-related issues of scale and scalability. The first denotes the semantic
                     level at which events are parsed. To be insightful for narratology, texts need
                     to be broken down into meaningful narrative units that are more capacious than a
                     predicate and more precise than a summary. Relatedly, the process needs to be
                     scalable to a wide-range of texts to facilitate for insightful comparison. Up
                     until now, the challenging trade-off has been that solutions at a scale
                     appropriate for narratological analysis are not scalable because they require
                     laborious human intervention, and unsupervised solutions are scalable but not at
                     the right scale for narratological analysis. This is perhaps why projects that
                     try to innovate narratology through computational methods are often mired in the
                     proof-of-concept phase. Disappointingly, this has meant that the potential of
                     all this groundbreaking work remains untapped by the larger community of
                     literary scholars.

                     intuitive approach to visualizing the shape of narrative is one that displays
                     chronological order versus story order. This approach was actually devised by
                     the Russian Formalists at the beginning of the twentieth century, and has been
                     returned to time and again by digital humanists. By drawing on visualizations

                     adjacent digital work, I demonstrate the comparative power of such charts and
                     the scalability of the method across different types of fictional texts. As
                     such, the goal of this paper is to open up a larger conversation between digital
                     humanists and narrative theorists, and consider the best practices for
                     translating narratological concepts into encoded narrative data that can be
                     productively visualized. A principal part of this conversation is the necessity
                     of establishing a meaningful and shared visual language that clearly represents
                     fundamental narrative concepts to a broader audience. Much of this language has
                     already been in place for some time, but it has been scattered across different

                  <div class="ptext" id="p6">Historically, there have been two important observations about narrative. The
                     first, by Aristotle, is that a narrative has a beginning, middle, and an end,
                     and that these are usually connected through causality. The second, by the
                     Russian Formalists, is the separation of the <em class="term">fabula</em> (story
                     material) from the <em class="term">syuzhet</em> (the way the author shapes the
                     material), an insight mirrored concurrently by E.M. Forster who more strictly
                     defines the separation as one between story and plot [<a class="ref" href="#baroni2016">Baroni 2016</a>]
                     [<a class="ref" href="#forster1927">Forster 1927</a>]
                     [<a class="ref" href="#shklovskii1990">Shklovskiĭ 1990</a>]. As self-evident as these two distinctions are,
                     operationalizing them into a hermeneutic for textual analysis is fraught with
                     problems. As Gerald Prince aptly points out, “Narrative
                     sequences…are semantic and not semiotic in nature”
                     [<a class="ref" href="#prince2016">Prince 2016</a>]. That is to say, narrative sequences are not easily
                     broken down into constituent parts based on linguistic and logical properties.
                     The scope and length of individual narrative events are influenced by a whole
                     host of factors, including rhetorical devices, extra-textual and inter-textual
                     connections, figures, tropes, irony, narrative frequency, narrative speed,
                     narrative authority, and narrative reliability to name a few [<a class="ref" href="#prince2016">Prince 2016</a>]. In this, it is hard to ignore the lessons of
                     deconstruction and post-structuralist narratology [<a class="ref" href="#fludernik2005">Fludernik 2005</a>]. Any attempt to grab a single narrative thread tugs at the entire warp and
                     woof of a text’s intertextuality. Delimiting a text into discrete units always
                     imposes an artificial structure from without. This is to say nothing of the
                     problems that arise when decomposing narrative if the experience of the reader
                     is considered. After all, from a functionalist approach, narrative needs a
                     reader to (re)-constitute it, and, therefore, narrative sequence is not a type
                     of “deep structure,” but rather something that exists
                     in discourse. John Pier observes that for functionalists, “sequence is assimilated into the broader question of intersequentiality and
                     the dynamic relations occurring between the telling/reading and the
                     told”
                     [<a class="ref" href="#pier2016">Pier 2016</a>]. Which is to say, the sequencing of events in a text
                     does not exist external to a reader. Thus, while it might be self-evident that a
                     narrative sequence is a series of events, what constitutes those events and how
                     they are constituted is remarkably difficult to pin down.

                     with remarkable sophistication and accuracy. To decompose a narrative at any
                     level of competency, a computer has to perform a series of inter-related and

                     has been done on the computational understanding of narrative falls outside the
                     ambit of literary studies, and has focused largely on corpora within specific
                     and, often, bounded knowledge domains, including, among others, economics [<a class="ref" href="#lakoff2010">Lakoff &amp; Narayanan 2010</a>], law enforcement [<a class="ref" href="#baber2011">Baber et al. 2011</a>], medicine

                     offers, but is not directly applicable to literary studies, because so much of
                     literary production traverses multiple knowledge domains and deliberately
                     subverts anticipated text structures. More simply, it is more probable that the
                     language, style, and format of two fictional texts are more dissimilar than two
                     medical reports, legal briefs, or, even news reports. This dissimilarity makes
                     it challenging for an unsupervised computational approach to establish and
                     detect patterns that can be iterated across a large corpus with a high degree of
                     consistency.

                     processing or some form of machine learning to aid with the parsing of text.
                     Among these is the aptly named, “Syuzhet” package, developed
                     by Matthew Jockers and available on CRAN (Comprehensive R Archive Network). The
                     package allows users to draw on four different sentiment dictionaries to score
                     the overall sentiment of a text or to chart how “positive
                     and negative sentiments are activated across the text”
                     [<a class="ref" href="#jockers2017">Jockers</a>]. The advantage of this approach is that text
                     analysis can be automated. While Jockers’s work has sparked a lot of interest,
                     it has also received some criticism [<a class="ref" href="#swafford2015">Swafford 2015</a>]. One issue is
                     that his use of the word “plot” has no bearing on the concept
                     of chronological order of events, but rather how different sentiment structures
                     are articulated across a text. An alternative approach taken by Koichi Takeuchi
                     uses a predicate-argument structure thesaurus to determine narrative states,
                     actions, and change-in-states. This allows for “multi-dimensional relations between predicates with their arguments
                     containing relations between the change-of-state and its goal”
                     [<a class="ref" href="#takeuchi2016">Takeuchi 2016</a>]. Though Takeuchi’s study is geared towards
                     automatic narrative generation, it can also be used to decompose a narrative.
                     Being able to detect a change-in-state in a predicate is useful for
                     understanding the syntactic building blocks of a narrative, but is too granular
                     for addressing narrative changes in a text for narratological analysis. Another

                     analysis. As Eric Hoyt et al. explain, “[o]f all narrative
                     forms, the motion picture screenplay may be the most perfectly pre-disposed
                     for computational analysis”
                     [<a class="ref" href="#hoyt2014">Hoyt 2014</a>]. This is because the text is already semi-structured
                     with characters identified by dialogue and narrative units separated into
                     scenes. Since the process of narrative analysis of scripts lends itself to
                     automation, a number of analogous projects have emerged independent of one
                     another that generate a visualization of narrative progression over time. These
                     include work done by Sharma and Rajamanickam [<a class="ref" href="#sharma2013">Sharma &amp; Rajamanickam 2013</a>],
                     <em class="term">ScripThreads</em>

                     [<a class="ref" href="#kim2018">Kim et al. 2018</a>]. The underlying assumption with all of these projects
                     is that the script scene sequence is consonant with the plot event sequence.
                     From a strict narratological perspective this need not always be the case.
                     Events can also be conveyed to the audience through diegetic and extradiegetic
                     elements, as, for example, when a character reveals his or her backstory through
                     dialogue with another character, or when there is a voice-over that relates past
                     or future events. Presumably, these events occur at a different date than the
                     chronological order of the scene. To account for this discrepancy in any
                     automated parsing method adds a substantial level of complication. While this by
                     no means invalidates such projects, it merely underscores that the question of
                     the appropriate scale of a narrative event is still unsettled.

                     computational narrative analysis are those of scale and scalability. The
                     projects that rely on manual encoding are generally fine-grained enough to
                     provide consistent narratological insight, but the labor involved does not scale
                     well. Meanwhile, automated methods tend to be too course-grained to allow for
                     meaningful comparison between texts, or, conversely, they provide analysis at
                     the level of the predicate, which is not functional for narrative analysis. As
                     Prince points out, “narratologists agree that narrative
                     sequences represent linked series of situations and events and fur¬ther
                     agree that these sequences can be expanded or summarized, that they can be
                     combined with other sequences in specifiable ways such as conjunc¬tion,
                     embedding, or alternation, and that they can be extracted from larger

                     [<a class="ref" href="#prince2016">Prince 2016</a>]. This type of narrative modularity can only be
                     achieved if event units contain more than predicate-level information, and
                     account for a unified ontology of space, time, and character within an event,
                     while at the same time being more specific than a summary of the text. While
                     there is no precise determination as to what this scale might be, the method

                     uncontentious, encoding events has presented some of the most difficult
                     theoretical and practical challenges. Since a database can only store discrete
                     information, delimiting events, which tend to be non-discrete, necessarily
                     requires interpretation because the boundaries that separate beginnings and
                     endings are unclear and subjective [<a class="ref" href="#mani2013">Mani 2013</a>]. In an ideal
                     scenario, events are entered at the same level of granularity with the same
                     consistency across the corpus. Impinging on this ideal are practical
                     considerations. Digital projects that require manual encoding quickly run into
                     limitations like data collection scope, the labor available, and the possibility
                     of introducing human error. The slightest change in the definition of event
                     boundaries can exponentially increase project completion time. An example is
                     instructive here. Faulkner’s “Red Leaves,” is a short
                     story about the ritualistic burial of Issetibbeha that requires a
                     “hunt” of his body-servant who is to be buried next to
                     him. In the following passage, the African American servant is returning to the
                     burial site and along the way he comes across one of the Chickasaw:
                     <blockquote>
                        <p>
                           [A](1) In the middle of the afternoon he came face to
                           face with an Indian. (2) They were both on a footlog across a slough —
                           the Negro gaunt, lean, hard, tireless and desperate; the Indian thick,
                           soft-looking, the apparent embodiment of the ultimate and the supreme
                           reluctance and inertia. (3) The Indian made no move, no sound; he stood
                           on the log and (4) watched the Negro plunge into the slough and swim
                           ashore and crash away into the undergrowth. <br />[B](5)Just before
                           sunset he lay behind a down log  [<a class="ref" href="#faulkner1995">Faulkner 1995</a>].
                           
                        </p>
                     </blockquote> There are many ways to divide up the events in this text. The
                     first is to say that the entire paragraph and the following sentence constitute
                     an event because it starts in the middle of the afternoon and goes till sunset.
                     This is a period of several hours, and should therefore be considered one
                     extended event: the servant running away. The other option, [AB], uses the
                     paragraph division to split the passage in two and considers [A], the meeting
                     with the “Indian,” and [B], lying behind a log, as two
                     different moments. The last option would be to divide every individual action
                     and description into an event (1,2,3,4,5). This approach appears ideal from a
                     data perspective, because it gives the greatest amount of detail. The drawback
                     is that entering five different records is much more laborious than the first
                     approach. Since, each event record requires the entry of thirteen variables, the
                     difference is between entering thirteen or sixty-five data points. Scaled to the
                     level of the text, a story that might take thirty hours to encode suddenly takes
                     a hundred and fifty hours. As each story in the <em class="term">DY</em> database is also
                     peer-reviewed and subsequently curated for additional data entry, changing the
                     scale also increases the labor required downstream in the production cycle.

                  <div class="ptext" id="p15">For DY, the scale of an event is defined as, “1 setting, 1
                     unbroken length of time, 1 main focus and 1 narrative style is 1 continuous
                     Event”
                     [<a class="ref" href="#railton2015">Railton et al. 2015</a>]. This definition has remained remarkably durable
                     throughout the production process. The narrative is capsulized into units that
                     are intelligible as self-sufficient ontologies. An event can therefore be
                     de-contextualized from the larger narrative, and still make sense as an action
                     performed by a character or characters at a particular place. Needless to say,
                     applying this definition consistently throughout the encoding process does not
                     happen without debate. Usually, the bone of contention is whether an event
                     remains one continuous action when a key character enters or exits a location,
                     and how to break up events where characters are travelling for an indeterminate
                     amount of time and space. Notably, <em class="term">DY</em>’s definition of an event uses
                     page number as a proxy for discourse time (the amount of time it takes to read
                     the passage) and does not measure story time, (the duration of the event in the
                     text) [<a class="ref" href="#chatman1978">Chatman 1978</a>]. An event may span several pages and describe
                     an action that happens in an instant, or, conversely, may only be one sentence
                     and take years. Thus, it is possible to show the order of events, but not the
                     narrative pacing that dictates that order.

                     purposes of the main visualization, the events need to be placed in
                     chronological order. There are few literary texts that adhere to a strict
                     chronological order, and Faulkner’s are certainly not among these. This makes
                     for great reading, but challenging encoding. Fortunately, while many of
                     Faulkner’s events are narrated out of order, they do follow an underlying total
                     order [<a class="ref" href="#richardson2012">Richardson 2012</a>].

                     Backus document three, relatively minor, orphan events. In their opinion, “the matter is too minute to warrant further discussion”

                     These events must be entered somewhere so they can be sequenced in the
                     animation, and whatever position they are given changes the total order of the

                     large, the final chronologies for each text were ultimately the result of
                     textual scholarship. It should be noted that sorting events through computation
                     is possible, however; as Burg et al., have shown in their work using constraint
                     logic programming to infer the most probable order of events for “A Rose for Emily”

                     account for any authorial irregularities in a plot. As Faulkner likely did not
                     anticipate that his fiction would be manually encoded by a group of scholars for
                     the purposes of visualization, he did not iron out plot timeline
                     inconsistencies. Perhaps the most famous example of this is his work on <cite class="title italic">The Mansion</cite>. For the final drafts of the novel,
                     Faulkner was extremely reluctant to correct timeline discrepancies with his
                     previous novels and adjust misalignments with historical events [<a class="ref" href="#railton2015">Railton et al. 2015</a>]. Any system that relies on causality and strict date
                     ordering would run into trouble sorting this text.

                     result of interpretation, collaboration, and compromise. Nevertheless, part of
                     the success of the encoding process has been the intuitive ease of data entry
                     achieved by framing the data within fundamental narratological concepts.
                     Annotators with various levels of technical expertise could be onboarded and
                     taught to encode by working on a short-story that was then checked for
                     consistency. On average each text event coding went through seven passes. The
                     initial pass of hand-coding the events in the paper copy of the text,
                     transcription to a spreadsheet, sorting the events by chronology in a
                     spreadsheet, entry into the database, peer-review by a fellow database editor,
                     another review by the director or one of the associate directors, and another
                     final review for inconsistencies before being brought online. This very
                     intensive vetting process reduces the possibility of human error and
                     inconsistency, but, of course, cannot guarantee its elimination. Importantly,
                     one of the valuable lessons about the encoding process is that the data should
                     only go live once all errors have been removed. Once an erroneous entry makes
                     its way into the database it is very hard to discover and revise. Furthermore,
                     as all the encoders were Faulkner scholars, there was a continuous temptation by
                     editors to introduce ever more narrative features to capture the richness of
                     Faulkner’s writing. Needless to say, this would have meant continuously recoding
                     eight thousand different entries representing six thousand pages of narrative
                     text, significantly adding to the prospective workload. Such efforts were thus
                     held in abeyance until the completion of the initial encoding of all the texts.
                     Currently, the <em class="term">DY</em> team is adding an additional level of nuance to
                     each event by labelling each event with keywords. This process has greatly
                     profited from the fact that the event structure is already in place.

                  <div class="ptext" id="p20">Taking the narrative data and turning it into visualizations presents its own
                     suite of challenges. There are no established conventions for representing
                     digitally encoded narratives. Without standard practices, it is hard to
                     interpret and compare different narrative data visualizations. In this regard,
                     Faulkner’s texts are particularly tricky to visualize because he experimented
                     with narrative structures throughout his career. Scholars have described his
                     complex narrative techniques as everything from the “frozen
                     moment” to enclosure of past, present, and future [<a class="ref" href="#riojellifffe2001">Rio-Jellifffe 2001</a>]
                     [<a class="ref" href="#skei1999">Skei 1999</a>]. Reflecting on his writing, Faulkner once famously
                     conceived of the past and present as one long sentence: 
                     <blockquote>
                        <p>
                           There is no such thing really as was because the past
                           is. It is a part of every man, every woman, and every moment. All of his
                           and her ancestry, background, is all a part of himself and herself at
                           any moment. And so a man, a character in a story at any moment of action
                           is not just himself as he is then, he is all that made him, and the long
                           sentence is an attempt to get his past and possibly his future into the
                           instant in which he does something. [<a class="ref" href="#faulkner1965">Faulkner 1965</a>]
                           
                        </p>
                     </blockquote> Faulkner’s theory of the long sentence and the continuously present past,
                     represents a fundamental complication for visualization. A faithful rendering of
                     his vision would have to project the narrative past and the narrative present on
                     top of one another, which would, at best, lead to an amorphous blob. On the
                     other hand, showing events as a discreet sequence does not do justice to the way
                     Faulkner weaves the past through the present in his work.

                  <div class="ptext" id="p21">A related challenge is that Faulkner’s idea of the past being eternally present
                     led him to experiment with time throughout his career; arguably each of the
                     novels is a reworking of the same theory in a different form. Ideally, a
                     visualization that captures Faulkner’s use of time has to be consistent across
                     all his works to provide a basis for comparison, but also flexible enough to
                     capture the idiosyncrasies of each text. For instance, the <cite class="title italic">Sound and the Fury</cite> and <cite class="title italic">Absalom,
                        Absalom!</cite> are both about the past, but “[o]ne is
                     a drama about knowing events, the other a drama of events defused and
                     disconnected”
                     [<a class="ref" href="#labatt2005">Labatt 2005</a>]. These differences in the way time is constructed
                     are compounded when expressed across the entire corpus. Any visualization of his
                     narrative, including the ones provided by the narrative structure analysis
                     dashboard, can only provide a provisional and limited insight into the

                     meaningful to literary scholars. The resulting interface allows users to compare
                     up to four charts, and toggle between chronological order and date range. The
                     charts also have some functionality that is native to plotly.js that enables a
                     more scoped view of the data, and the ability to download the chart. Along with
                     the main narrative structure chart, there are also charts showing the percentage
                     of different forms of narration; the ratio of flashbacks, flashforwards, and
                     linear event sequences; and a frequency diagram of events across the dates of
                     the story. The various tools all work together to allow users to compare the
                     narrative structure of fourteen novels and fifty-six short stories.

                        order in which it is told. They are meant to showcase the plot structure of
                        a text in one, easy to compare, view. Each line segment represents one
                        event. Events that comprised less than a page come across as a dot, while
                        events that amounted to multiple pages are line segments, though for novels
                        most line segments appear as dots due to scaling. The length of events only
                        captures their discourse time, and does not correspond to their significance
                        or textual duration. These segments are plotted by page number on the x-axis
                        and chronological order on the y-axis.<a class="noteRef" href="#d4e768">[8]</a> When events happen earlier, they are lower down.
                        Conversely, events that happen later in the chronology are higher up on the
                        chart. If the story and the plot coincide, and events are told in the order
                        that they happen, the slope is forty-five degrees. This is rarely the case
                        for Faulkner, or any author. Instead, there are usually troughs or peaks in
                        the line. These are indications of analepsis (flashback) or prolepsis
                        (flashforward), respectively.<a class="noteRef" href="#d4e771">[9]</a> Borrowing from an
                        example by David Herman, if story and plot coincide, the order of events
                        plotted out as a line segment is ABC (see Figure 2). If Faulkner tells the
                        story in a different order and uses a flashback, the order is BAC. Visually,
                        line segment A will come sequentially after B on the x-axis, but appear
                        lower down on the y-axis (see Figure 3). In that same vein, if there were a
                        flashforward the story would be told ACB and segment C would precede B on
                        the x-axis, but be higher up on the y-axis (see Figure 4) [<a class="ref" href="#herman2002">Herman 2002</a>].

                        status of an event. Narrative status answers the question: “Who/what is responsible as the source of this
                        Event?”
                        [<a class="ref" href="#railton2015">Railton et al. 2015</a>]. This concept does not map neatly onto any
                        language available in narrative theory, and using any adjacent definition
                        likely leads to more confusion than clarity. Be that as it may, each event
                        is identified as having one of five narrative statuses: 1)
                        <em class="emph">Narrated</em> by a first or third person narrator; 2)
                        <em class="emph">Told</em> by a character in the story; 3)
                        <em class="emph">Remembered</em> through a character’s consciousness; 4)
                        <em class="emph">Hypothesized</em> when something might have happened; 5)
                        <em class="emph">Narrated</em>+<em class="emph">consciousness</em> when Faulkner combines
                        narration with stream of consciousness. The last case was created
                        specifically for <cite class="title italic">Light in August</cite>, though
                        examples appear sporadically throughout other texts. Using these categories,
                        the chronological data can be subsetted according to narrative status.
                        Encoding narrative status for a text is not a necessary compotent for
                        creating storyline charts, and the applicability of the narrative categories
                        beyond Faulkner remains to be seen. It would be challenging, for example, to
                        encode James Joyce’s <cite class="title italic">Ulysses</cite> with purely these
                        type of narrative status classifiers. Nonetheless, the resulting
                        visualization shows events as both a change in location or character, and as
                        a change in narrative status (Figure 5).

                        Benjy’s chapter is the first in the novel, but is actually meant to be third
                        sequentially. This is clear visually because the first series of yellow dots
                        up until page 74 can be slotted into the space on the y-axis between 264 and
                        265. This is not particularly revelatory since the chapter titles are dated,
                        but it does confirm that the sequence is in the right order. Second, many of
                        the details in the narrative present are actually quite regular in their
                        sequence, it is the past that appears confused and is frequently nonlinear.
                        Upon closer inspection, even here there are patterns in the sequence. In
                        terms of narrative status, it is interesting to note just how much of the
                        <cite class="title italic">Sound and the Fury</cite> is told through memory.
                        The first two chapters are recounted to a large extent to through the
                        memories Benjy and Quentin have. Meanwhile, in the last two chapters the
                        event sequence is far more linear, and the narrative status is more
                        consistently narrated than the previous two sections. The novel appears to
                        move from chaos and disorder to order and stability, and it is perhaps all
                        the more poetic that the novel ends with “each in its
                        ordered place”

                        Sometimes the range is a week, a month, or even a couple of years. In order
                        to identify and delimit date ranges as much as possible, textual references
                        to real historical events, such as the Louisiana Purchase or the Battle of
                        First Manassas, are used as anchors to which other relative dates are
                        tethered. Even this is not always possible, since relative time indications

                     for other scholars to use the data for their own work. It makes little sense to
                     create a dynamic user-driven visualization if it is only meant to lead to
                     predetermined answers. That being said, there are a number of fruitful areas of
                     investigation that the dashboard makes possible. The first of these is to see if
                     there is a pattern in the way Faulkner structures the plots of his texts. One of
                     Faulkner’s central concerns is how the past inhabits the present, but it is
                     unclear if he does so in continuously new ways or if there is a signature
                     “Faulknerian style” with which he works and reworks this
                     material. A related issue is the change or consistency in his use of chronology,
                     narrative status, and date ranges throughout his career. In Faulkner studies,
                     there is a generally accepted arc of Faulkner’s development that divides his
                     literary output into several distinct periods. It would be interesting to see if
                     this structured division of his writing is visible in the visualizations or if
                     these tell a different story.

                  <div class="ptext" id="p34">Beyond Faulkner, the visual language used in this paper and the accompanying
                     dashboard are prompts for a larger discussion about representing and
                     interpreting digitally encoded narratives. The framework for narrative analysis
                     provided by <em class="term">DY</em> is precise enough to highlight meaningful
                     differences, while being broad enough not to be limited to Faulkner. The visual
                     language used for the dashboard is similar to projects within disparate
                     knowledge domains, suggesting their intelligibility. A broader adoption of
                     plot/story charts would usher in the ability to start comparing different
                     authors on reasonably equal narratological footing. One obvious point of
                     contrast for Faulkner is a contemporaneous author like Ernest Hemingway, many of
                     whose short stories take place almost entirely in the narrative present. Yet,
                     the trauma of the past is always lurking just under the surface about to
                     explode. Similarly, it would be interesting to compare Faulkner’s writing to
                     that of realist authors like Kate Chopin, who more strictly adheres to the
                     conventions of chronological unity.

                     fundamental truth about a text, as early structuralist narrative theorists might
                     have imagined. Nevertheless, these rasters for interpretation slice up texts in
                     unexpected ways, providing new insights yet to be imagined, much less

                     productively mined by literary scholars and computer scientists for his

                     narrative theory to analyze Faulkner. It is somewhat idiosyncratic in its
                     outlook though [<a class="ref" href="#reed1973">Reed 1973</a>]. James Phelan and Peter J.
                     Rabinowitz’s critical introduction to narrative theory provides an excellent

                     with regard to time, plot, and progression [<a class="ref" href="#herman2012">Herman 2012</a>].
