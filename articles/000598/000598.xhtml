                  <h2>Abstract</h2>
                  
                  <p>New Year’s speeches held by leading politicians–mostly prime ministers or
                     presidents–have a long and firm tradition in Europe and have become an institution
                     instead of being a crowing event for conciliatory efforts. From the perspective of
                     political communication, New Year’s speeches fulfil a triple function in the
                     intersection of the past, the present and the future. First, they summarise the past
                     year from the perspective of the political leadership and, hence, recall, reconstruct
                     and remind the most important events of the year. Second, New Year’s speeches
                     describe the present and, thus, can be understood and analysed as reality
                     constructions, as windows to the current state of affairs. And third, New Year’s
                     speeches serve as road maps to the future, into the new year. In this sense, a New
                     Year’s speeches summarises the most important future challenges, expectations and
                     opportunities. </p>
                  
                  <p>This article stems from the assumption that a nonlinear analysis of textual data
                     based on network analysis could provide us with new ontological understanding about
                     structural coherence and holes within a document corpora. It adopts a different
                     viewpoint to discourse analysis based on social network analysis. The paper
                     introduces a nonlinear way to analyse texts as networks in order to visualise and
                     analyse how concepts are connected and to explore structural closeness and holes
                     within a corpus of unstructured textual documents.</p> 
                  
                  <p>The results indicate a
                     discursive turn in Germany, Austria and Switzerland after the breakout of the global
                     financial crisis in 2008. But at the same time, the results evidence similarities
                     across the three countries how the crisis and its impact was framed to discourses.
                     In
                     all countries, the use of concepts related to crisis and insecurity has increased
                     dramatically since 2008. However, this vocabulary is not solely limited to the
                     financial crisis. The “insecurity and crisis” frame referred both
                     to the financial crisis, the armed conflict in Ukraine and to the refugee crisis.</p>

                  <div class="ptext" id="p1">During the past decade advances in text mining have demonstrated that political issues
                     and topics can be identified from unstructured textual documents with good accuracy.
                     Examples from digital parliamentary studies or computational discourse analysis have
                     brought up evidence how especially topic modelling can be applied on large document
                     corpora to gain overviews over thematic structures of political texts, but also how
                     these structures change over time. Most of these studies analyse large, even huge
                     textual corpora with thousands of lengthy documents. Such “big text” analysis is often
                     seen as typical example of how digital methods can – even should – be applied in social
                     sciences and the Humanities.</div>
                  
                  <div class="counter"><a href="#p2">2</a></div>
                  <div class="ptext" id="p2">In this article I focus on the problem of using digital methods and tools on a smaller
                     corpus of unstructured textual documents, namely New Year’s addresses, with varying
                     political content and as addressed to a wide public audience, the citizens in general.
                     Although politicians often favour longer speeches and verbal battles when it comes
                     to
                     struggle for political issues, especially the growing relevance of social media driven
                     political communication has strengthened the role of short textual documents like
                     tweets, postings, statements or commentaries in political discourse. Since most short
                     textual contributions are designed to take stand on current affairs and actual political
                     questions, they offer an interesting empirical material to explore not only how
                     politicians take stand on current affairs, but also the structure and dynamics of
                     issue-driven political discourses.</div>
                  
                  <div class="counter"><a href="#p3">3</a></div>
                  <div class="ptext" id="p3">This article is based on the understanding that sort political texts can be a valuable
                     source when it comes to identifying topics and issues that really matter under the
                     current political circumstances. Rising a current topic in a short political text
                     can be
                     seen as an act of politicalisation [<a class="ref" href="#palonen2007b">Palonen 2007b</a>, 62–66], i.e. an action
                     marking the issue as political by detecting its political potential and thus expanding
                     the presence of the political and presenting a particular representation of
                     “reality” [<a class="ref" href="#koller2014">Koller 2014</a>, 164]. This is especially relevant for addresses
                     and speeches given by high representatives of a nation like president or prime minister.
                     All issues taken up in such texts are automatically labelled as being politically
                     significant, so that the speech itself can be read as an attempt to persuade the target
                     audience to accept this position [<a class="ref" href="#shim2015">Shim et al. 2015</a>, 56].</div>
                  
                  <div class="counter"><a href="#p4">4</a></div>
                  <div class="ptext" id="p4">The empirical results of this article suggest that New Year’s addresses offer a valuable
                     and interesting source for the exploration of topical issues enjoying political and
                     societal relevance. The argument here is rooted in the understanding that if an issue
                     is
                     taken up in a New Year’s address, the issue is considered as important and becomes
                     politicised [<a class="ref" href="#palonen2007a">Palonen 2007a</a>]. Hence, the corpus of German,
                     Austrian, and Swiss New Year’s addresses offers an interesting source to explore topical
                     discourses from both national and comparative, cross-national perspective.</div>
                  
                  <div class="counter"><a href="#p5">5</a></div>
                  <div class="ptext" id="p5">From the methodological perspective the application of digital text mining and analysis
                     tools on a corpus of short texts consisting of several hundred words in average requires
                     an adapted approach. This, because most tools for text mining have been developed
                     for
                     large-to-huge text corpora with millions of words and use statistical methods to model
                     the corpus. Although these methods produce results also when applied to small corpora,
                     the results tend to be biased and their reliability compromised. In order to circumvent
                     these problems I use a rather novel approach of Text Network Analysis (TNA) using
                     a
                     non-linear approach to re-construct textual documents as a network of words appearing
                     close to each other in the original documents [<a class="ref" href="#paranyushkin2011">Paranyushkin 2011</a>]. One of the
                     key advantages of TNA is that since TNA is rooted in (Social) Network Analysis the
                     resulting network can be visualised and analysed by methods and tools developed for
                     network analysis. Another advantage is that networks can be created without any arduous
                     preprocessing, although lemmatisation and stopword removal are strongly encouraged.
                     One
                     main objective of this article is the introduction of TNA as an alternative, relatively
                     easy to use explorative tools for both text mining and topic modelling.</div>
                  
                  <div class="counter"><a href="#p6">6</a></div>
                  <div class="ptext" id="p6">The analysis and results presented in this article should evidence the power of TNA
                     as a
                     topic modelling and exploration tool for short(er) text documents. The analysis
                     introduces a non-linear way to analyse texts as networks and to present results based
                     on
                     graphical visualisations making it easier to capture and understand structural
                     characteristics hidden in the corpus. The results, in turn, provide interesting insights
                     in thematic continuity and change in political topics in the analysed three
                     German-speaking countries. Further, a detailed discussion of the results confirm the
                     accuracy of the main findings of my TNA analysis, thus providing additional support

                     gained a stronger role and impact among social scientists interested in parliamentary
                     debates, political speeches or other textual materials on political affairs. A great
                     majority of such kind of contributions has focused on the identification of the main
                     content through the analysis of commonly used words, by focusing on the content
                     different words as used, or through the analysis of co-occurring words.<a class="noteRef" href="#d4e219">[1]</a>

                  <div class="ptext" id="p9">A known challenge with political speeches is that such texts normally tackle several
                     topics or issues. However, changes from one topic to another can be be hard to detect
                     with methods based on a bag-of-words approach. This, because such an approach transforms
                     the document in a word frequency table. Although such a table is rather simple to
                     handle
                     and analyse, the other side of the coin is that such a transformation destroys the
                     original structure of the text, making it impossible to gain understanding about where
                     different words appear in the original text [<a class="ref" href="#hearst1994">Hearst 1994</a>].

                     positions among experts. In this article I expand this underlying assumption to include
                     politicians as well, and make the initial assumption that politicians tend to what
                     I
                     would call “thematic recycling”, i.e. the endeavour to take up the same – or similar –
                     issues over and over again on different occasions. Hence, a corpus of political textual
                     documents from a politician can be assumed to share similar topics across different
                     documents. Further, as in the case of expert texts we can, with some caution, generalise
                     this assumption and expect to find shared topics by politicians sharing same or highly
                     similar political insights rooted in certain ideological positions. Accordingly, we
                     can
                     expect to find shared latent topics and political positions also in documents delivered
                     by different political actors sharing a similar political landscape.</div>

                  <div class="ptext" id="p11">Thus far most studies dealing with the problem of identifying topics across documents
                     in
                     a document collection have applied methods of topic modelling, mostly Latent Dirichlet
                     Allocation (LDA) [<a class="ref" href="#blei2003">Blei et al. 2003</a>]. There are many good reasons for this,
                     maybe the most important being its flexibility in defining the “document,” allowing the
                     researcher to condition the topic distribution on paragraphs or time chunks, for
                     example. However, as a method based on statistical modelling LDA also has some important
                     caveats and pitfalls limiting its analytical power especially as regards shorter text
                     documents and smaller corpora. One limitation being highly relevant for this article
                     is
                     that most LDA-based applications require datasets of several hundred documents, at
                     minimum, to ensure validity and reliability of the results [<a class="ref" href="#light2014">Light 2014</a>, 117].

                     on the one hand, how words are used within statements, and how thematically similar
                     statements “glue” different texts together across contexts, on the other. These thematic
                     pathways building on statements and connecting different contexts should help us to
                     understand the deep thematic backbone underlying the document corpus [<a class="ref" href="#busse2013">Busse 2013</a>, 43ff].

                  <div class="ptext" id="p13">The analysis presented in the next section is an application of Text Network Analysis
                     (TNA), a method originally presented by Paranyushkin (2011) and rooted in theoretical
                     foundations of Social Network Analysis (SNA). According to Paranyushkin TNA seeks
                     to
                     discover “repetitive patterns derived from the text’s structure, using their
                     connectivity and the intensity of interactions between them as the only criteria for
                     their belonging together” [<a class="ref" href="#paranyushkin2011">Paranyushkin 2011</a>, 5]. It is a non-linear approach transforming texts to a
                     network of words by respecting the original structure of the texts. [<a class="ref" href="#shim2015">Shim et al. 2015</a>, 58], who use TNA to identify policy frames of nuclear energy policy across different
                     countries, summarise the method by stating that it seeks “to identify salient words and
                     concepts in order to extract underlying meanings and frames from the structure of
                     concept networks.” As the contributions of both Paranyushkin and Shim et al. evidence
                     TNA offers a very powerful tool with a robust fundament in network analysis and a
                     rather
                     simple and straightforward application. Further, text networks can be created as
                     flexibly conditioned on e.g. sliding window techniques, sentences, or paragraphs.
                     This
                     gives a researcher additional flexibility to test different approaches to figure out
                     the
                     most suitable text unit for the analysis.</div>

                  <div class="ptext" id="p14">This article stems from the assumption that TNA as a non-linear analysis of textual
                     data
                     could provide us with new ontological understanding about structural coherence and
                     holes
                     within a document corpora. This new ontological understanding, however, is not only
                     expected to shed light on how concepts connect in order to form statements. Instead,
                     it
                     can also help us to explore structures relevant for the understanding of how statements
                     are organised within and across contexts. Through the application of network
                     visualisations and the analysing of structural properties of text networks the
                     underlying data can be explored from alternative perspectives in order to trace back
                     discursive patterns within the text corpus.</div>

                  <div class="ptext" id="p15">One key difference of TNA compared to more traditional tools and techniques of text
                     mining is that TNA understands its input as network data consisting of <em class="term">nodes</em> (or <em class="emph">vertices</em>) connected by <em class="emph">edges</em> and having an own structure (topology) [<a class="ref" href="#paranyushkin2011">Paranyushkin 2011</a>] [<a class="ref" href="#ruohonen2013">Rouhonen 2013</a>]
                     [<a class="ref" href="#scott2013">Scott 2013</a>]. A common technique is to use word-based units – 
                     single words or n-grams - as nodes and co-occurrences as edges. Although this is the
                     most common way, nothing actually prevents the researcher from using e.g. phrases
                     as
                     nodes, just to mention another example illustrating the analytical flexibility of
                     TNA.
                     Since TNA works based on network theory, it does not require any predefined ontological
                     structure or pattern of text, nor does it superimpose any extra layer of ontologies
                     on
                     top of the textual data, which may - as [<a class="ref" href="#paranyushkin2011">Paranyushkin 2011</a>, 4] correctly states – create
                     “a strong subjective (and even cultural) bias into the structure of the resulting text
                     graphs.” Further, the researcher is not limited to the use of text theories or text
                     mining tools (although nothing prevents her to use this kind of theories or tools
                     in the
                     analysis), but can apply a wide range of network analysis tools and methods to explore,
                     analyse and visualise structural properties of the text networks. In other words,
                     TNA
                     gives the researcher the possibility to explore and analyse textual units conditioned
                     to
                     a certain structure and, thus, to explain why different textual units take different
                     positions and roles by focusing on the network structure of the text.</div>

                     German-speaking countries, Germany, Austria and Switzerland<a class="noteRef" href="#d4e310">[2]</a> covering
                     the years from 2000 to 2021. These three countries were selected, first, based on
                     the
                     shared language providing us the possibility to compare the use of language of high
                     politics across these countries. Second, all three countries belong to the same
                     cultural-political space, Central Europe, with a strong, continental orientation and
                     a
                     centuries-long experience and tradition of German cultural, economic, and political
                     influence, but also dominance [<a class="ref" href="#jordan2005">Jordan 2005</a>]. Besides the two more or less
                     uniting criteria, the third selection criterion was a dividing factor: Germany and
                     Austria are members in the European Union (EU), whereas Switzerland is only indirectly
                     involved in European integration through its membership in the European Free Trade
                     Association (EFTA) and a set of bilateral agreements with the EU. Switzerland is also
                     member of the Schengen area allowing any person, irrespective of nationality, to cross
                     the internal borders without being subjected to border checks. Currently, most of
                     the EU
                     countries plus the non-EU countries Iceland, Norway, Switzerland and Liechtenstein
                     have
                     joined the Schengen area. Against this background I expect these three countries to
                     form
                     an “imagined community” (Benedict Anderson) and to share certain values, interests and
                     world views reflected by the New Year’s addresses. Further, I expect German and Austrian
                     New Year’s addresses to share discursive patterns related to EU affairs, especially
                     to
                     the euro crisis (since 2008), the conflict in Ukraine (since 2014), and the refugee

                     From the perspective of political communication, New Year’s addresses
                     fulfil a triple function in the intersection of the past, the present and the future.
                     First, they summarise the past year from the perspective of the political leadership
                     and, hence, recall, reconstruct and remind the most important events of the year.
                     Second, New Year’s addresses describe the present and, thus, can be understood and
                     analysed as reality constructions, as windows to the current state of affairs. And
                     third, New Year’s addresses serve as road maps to the future, into the new year. In
                     this
                     sense, a New Year’s addresses summarises the most important future challenges,

                     are comparable with the Presidential Inaugural Addresses of the U.S. and this article
                     methodologically benefits from the study of [<a class="ref" href="#light2014">Light 2014</a>] on the United States’ Inaugural
                     Addresses. From the perspective of social sciences I am not primarily interested in
                     the
                     use of language, but issues mentioned and described in the addresses. This viewpoint
                     is
                     rooted in the assumption that a political phenomenon, topic or event gains in importance
                     if mentioned in a New Year’s address. Here I also follow the idea that New Year’s
                     addresses offer insights into shifts in political priorities, interests, and
                     opinions [<a class="ref" href="#light2014">Light 2014</a>]. Against this background I am convinced that a
                     longitudinal, computational analysis of German, Austrian and Swiss New Year’s addresses
                     can help us to a better understanding of how the political landscape has changed between

                     short time of 10 to 15 minutes. Consequently, these speeches are relative compact
                     in
                     size. The average speeches length of a German new New Year’s speech was 892 tokens
                     and
                     standard deviation (sd) was 111. In Austria and Switzerland the average lengths were

                     (sd=58) and 562 (sd=159) respectively (Figure 1). Quite understandably
                     the amount of unique tokens is somewhat lower, since certain words are used several
                     times during a speech. For German New Year’s addresses, there were 362 unique tokens
                     in
                     average (sd=33), for Austrian and Swiss speeches the average number of unique tokens

                     317 (sd=27) and 255 (sd=60) respectively. Swiss New Year’s addresses seem to have
                     become
                     shorter over time, whereas both German and Austrian New Year’s addresses remain relative
                     stable over time (Figure 1). Generally speaking a country’s size seem to matter here,
                     as German New
                     Year’s addresses are slightly longer than the Austrian or Swiss addresses. My
                     explanation for this observed difference stems from the differences in political and
                     economic importance. Germany’s central role in European politics results in broader
                     political agenda, so that there are more issues and topics to be addressed to in a

                     analysed in the four steps. First, I used the package ’udpipe’<a class="noteRef" href="#d4e390">[5]</a> to
                     tokenise, part-of-speech tag, and lemmatise the documents. After this step, the data
                     was
                     structured as a data table consisting of 53893 words and 5277 unique lemmata, enriched
                     with descriptive metadata about the country and the year, as well sentence indices.
                     In
                     the third step, I used text mining and explorative data analysis tools from the package

                     text analyses and to transform textual data to different sets of text network data.
                     The
                     applied text mining methods will be described in the next section. For the text network
                     network creation I used both bi-grams by linking two consecutive words, as well
                     skipgrams of length two by combining non-adjacent words that were three, four or five
                     words apart.<a class="noteRef" href="#d4e399">[6]</a> Both the
                     bi-grams and skipgrams were created within the boundaries of the same sentence based
                     on
                     the sentence index included in the data structure. (2) in the case of concepts used

                     Similarity is here calculated as cosine measure, a term-based comparison between
                     documents in a document corpus, and has a value range from 0 (no similarity at all)
                     to 1
                     (full similarity).<a class="noteRef" href="#d4e421">[7]</a> I reduced noise in the

                     pronouns, and proper nouns. In the network visualisation nodes represent different
                     New
                     Years addresses and are coloured with country-specific colours so that German addresses
                     are coloured with yellow, Austrian with red, and Swiss addresses with white. I have
                     also
                     added labels to help the reader to identify different addresses. Nodes are connected
                     by
                     edges, of which width is visualised proportional to the cosine measure of the two
                     addresses connected by that edge. In my data the cosine measures ranged from 0.103
                     (between the Swiss addresses 2006 and 2020) to 0.641 (between the German addresses
                     2009
                     and 2010), but I have removed edges with cosine measure below 0.400 in order to improve
                     the readability of the network visualisation. Further, I used a force-directed layout
                     and optimised it to position addresses with higher similarity closer, those with lesser
                     to each other so that the clusters of more similar addresses are easier to identify.</div>

                  <div class="ptext" id="p25">As regards the similarity network two observations seem appropriate. First, the New
                     Year’s addresses evidence a stronger similarity within, and weaker similarity across
                     countries. This is clearly visible in the network structure as well, as addresses
                     from
                     different countries form clear and distinct cluster in the visualisation (see Figure
                     2). Overall, the average
                     similarity for cross-country addresses is 0.318 (min=0.114, max=0.514), for national
                     addresses the average similarity is 0.384 (min=0.103, max=0.614). If we set the
                     threshold value for cosine measure to 0.5, only two cross-national combinations, namely
                     Austria 2018 – Switzerland 2020 (0.505) and Germany 2014 – Switzerland 2018 (0.514),
                     exceed this limit. Varieties of national political agenda and circumstances seem to
                     explain these observed differences, thus underlining the primacy of national topical
                     issues. An interesting result is also that the cosine similarity between German and
                     Austrian addresses is significantly higher (mean=0.355) than that between
                     German/Austrian and Swiss addresses (mean=0.277). This difference is at least partly
                     explained by the EU membership, as certain topical issues both German and Austrian
                     addresses tackle are connected to EU politics.</div>
                  
                  <div class="counter"><a href="#p26">26</a></div>
                  <div class="ptext" id="p26">And second, similarity seems to be stronger between between chronologically close
                     addresses and weaker between addresses with greater temporal distance. I tested this
                     with a simple Pearson’s correlation test and calculated the correlation between the
                     cosine measure and the temporal distance in years between the New Year’s addresses.
                     The
                     correlation was -0.085 (p&lt;0.001), thus confirming the hypothesis that the similarity
                     measure decreases when the temporal distance between compared addresses increases.
                     This
                     seems logical when reflected against the fact that New Year’s addresses tackle topical
                     issues at the end of a year. The longer the temporal distance between two addresses,
                     the
                     more probable there has been significant changes in political circumstances affecting
                     the vocabulary used in the addresses. Hence, this observation also gives support to
                     the
                     argument that New Year’s addresses offer an interesting and valuable perspective on
                     a
                     year’s prevailing political reality.</div>

                     between the countries and over time. In order to better understand this variance I
                     applied a specific text mining method, called term frequency, inverse document frequency
                     <em class="term">(tf-idf)</em> analysis, to adjust the frequency of a word for how
                     rarely it is used in the collection of New Year’s addresses of each country. A word’s
                     inverse document frequency (<em class="term">idf</em>) was then applied to explore
                     words that are not used very much during the whole period from 2000 to 2021. I divided
                     each national collection of New Year’s addresses into three distinct periods of
                     2000-2009, 2010-2019, and 2020-2021. Here the idea was to capture changes in the
                     vocabulary over time within a country, most probably caused by changes in topical
                     issues
                     or political circumstances. The results of this <em class="term">tf-idf</em> analysis
                     are presented in Figure 3. In
                     this barplot we can see for each country the most important words in each distinct
                     period of time. Hence, the Figure 3 highlights temporal changes within each country,
                     but preserves national
                     differences. In my opinion three central findings from this analysis are worth being

                     evident in Germany across the time periods, but also clearly visible in Austrian
                     addresses of the last two periods. As regards Germany, during the first period
                     (2000-2009) words like “wiederaufbau” (rebuilding), “betroffen” (upset), and mitgefühl“”
                     (sympathy, compassion), together with such words like “naturkatastrophe” (natural

                     Germany was the hardest hit country in Europe and the flood resulted in heated political
                     discussions in the eve of the Federal elections 2002. In Austrian addresses of this
                     period words like “jahrhudert” (century), “katastrophe” (catastrophe), and
                     “hilfsbereitschaft” (helpfulness) document the presence of the 2002 flood – which hit

                  <div class="ptext" id="p29">Another issue in this period was the outbreak of the sovereign debt crisis in the
                     eurozone in 2008/2009. This economic crisis is present in German addresses through
                     words
                     like “globalisierung” (globalisation), “wirtschaft” (economy), “arbeitslosigkeit”,
                     (unemployment). Contrary to Germany, the eurozone crisis is not very present and visible
                     in Austrian addresses in this period of time. A possible explanation to this difference
                     might be found in the different roles the two countries played in the early stage
                     of the
                     eurozone crisis. Germany as the strongest economy in the eurozone played a central,
                     designing role from the very beginning of the eurozone crisis [<a class="ref" href="#mullerbrandeckbocquet2010">Müller-Brandeck-Bocquet 2010</a>] [<a class="ref" href="#janning2016">Jsnning and Möller 2016</a>]

                     crisis. In addition to that I would also stress the economy-oriented political culture
                     in Germany. The strong role of economic questions as a central shaping factor of German
                     domestic and European politics increases the weight of topical economic issues in
                     public
                     debates. Against this background it is not surprisingly that the eurozone crisis
                     occupied a more significant space in public debates in German compared to Austria

                     from economy to refugee politics. In 2015 Chancellor Merkel decided to keep German
                     state
                     borders open to refugees coming mainly from the Middle East. Although this political
                     turn was captured in positive political slogans like “Willkommenskultur” (culture of
                     welcoming) or – most prominently – “Wir schaffen das” (we can do it/ we manage it), the
                     fact that words like “flüchtling” (refugee), “zusammenhalt” (sticking together),
                     “herausforderung” (challenge), “außengrenze” (outer border), or “aufnehmen” (receive,

                     in

                     refugee crisis evidence the usefulness of <em class="term">tf-idf</em> analysis when it
                     comes to explore discursive changes. Contrary to Germany, the refugee crisis was not
                     central in Austrian New Year’s addresses. Instead, the national political and economic
                     setting seem to dominate Austrian addresses. Terms like “marktwirtschaft” (market
                     economy), “lebensqualität” (quality of life), or “finanz”(finance) tackle economic
                     consequences of the eurozone crisis. The word “politikverdrossenheit” (jadedness with
                     politics) refers to domestic political turbulences behind the rise of the right-wing
                     populist Freedom Party of Austria (FPÖ) in the mid-2010s. Although this rise was partly
                     supported by the refugee crisis, it was also an expression of disillusionment with
                     the

                     addresses seem to <em class="emph">avoid</em> topical political issues and to
                     concentrate on the construction of neutral narratives. A possible explanation for
                     this
                     might be found in the fact that in Switzerland, as opposed to Germany and Austria,
                     the
                     federal president giving the New Year’s address is not the head of state, but just
                     the
                     head of Switzerland’s Federal Council, and only carries out some representative duties.
                     Hence, the federal president is merely a mediator between the different parts of the
                     Swiss federal state.</div>

                  <div class="ptext" id="p33">The results presented thus far indicate two main aspects. First, New Year’s addresses
                     offer a valuable and reliable source to explore topical issues and tackle changes
                     in
                     political and public discourses. And second, although the national political agenda
                     and
                     circumstances seem to have a stronger impact on the content of the addresses,
                     significant European political incidents and events, e.g. the refugee crisis or the
                     Covid-19 pandemic disease, seem to cause changes across countries. This leads us to
                     the
                     final analysis, an attempt to explore shared topics. For this analysis I constructed
                     text networks based on bigrams, i.e. word co-occurrences of two adjacent words, and
                     of
                     skipgrams, i.e. combinations of two non-adjancent words that are three to five words
                     apart [<a class="ref" href="#jelveh2014">Jelveh et al. 2014</a>, 1805]. The bi- and skipgrams were created for
                     words occurring within the same paragraph. Since the idea is to analyse topics across
                     countries all word pairs co-occurring in New Year’s addresses of one single country
                     only. In the last step I calculated a co-occurrence weight measure by dividing the
                     number of addresses a word pair co-occurs by the total number of addresses (64) in
                     the
                     multi-national corpus. The interpretation of this weight measure is rather
                     straightforward: the higher the value, the more significant the word pair for the
                     cross-country content.</div>

                           mapped the nodes betweenness centrality measure. In network theory centrality, in
                           general, indicates a node’s position in the network and can be calculated either
                           relative to a node’s direct neighbours or the whole network. A node’s degree is the
                           simplest centrality measure and equals to the number of connections the node has to
                           other nodes. Betweenness, as the term itself indicates, defines centrality by
                           analysing where a node is placed within the network. Consequently, a node’s
                           betweenness centrality score is computed by taking into consideration the rest of
                           the
                           network and by looking at how many times a node sits on the shortest path linking
                           two
                           other nodes together, thus helping to identify nodes having “a high probability of
                           occurring on a randomly chosen shortest path between two randomly chosen
                           vertices” [<a class="ref" href="#hsu2013">Hasu and Kao 2013</a>] [<a class="ref" href="#prell2012">Prell 2012</a>, 103–104].
                           Considering meaning circulation across the entire network, the latter capability is
                           assumed to be more relevant, since betweenness centrality “shows the variety of
                           contexts where the word appears, while high degree shows the variety of words next
                           to
                           which the word appears” [<a class="ref" href="#paranyushkin2011">Paranyushkin 2011</a>, 13]. This difference is
                           important to keep in mind and therefore I use betweenness centrality to measure a
                           concept’s general status in the text network. As both [<a class="ref" href="#paranyushkin2011">Paranyushkin 2011</a>] and [<a class="ref" href="#shim2015">Shim et al. 2015</a>]
                           point out concepts with high betweenness and degree centrality play a
                           meaning circulation role across texts in the document corpus, whereas concepts with
                           low centrality measures are peripheral concepts and, thus, typical only for a certain
                           part of documents. Between these two extremes are located concepts with high
                           betweenness but low degree centrality and concepts with low betweenness but high
                           degree centrality. The former play an important role as bridging concepts between
                           local communities, the latter, in turn, are local hubs within a cluster [<a class="ref" href="#shim2015">Shim et al. 2015</a>, 59f]. This mapping strategy allows us to easily identify the
                           most important and influential words in the graph.</li>

                           reconstructed as text networks a word’s position in the network is not random but
                           determined relative to the context it appears in. Consequently, words belonging to
                           the same (or similar) context are assumed to cluster across documents, so that we
                           could be able to identify groups of words in the network structure having dense
                           connections <em class="emph">within</em> the group, but sparse connections to other
                           parts of the text next. These groups are here interpreted as topics describing the
                           main thematic content of the document corpus. By leaning on the promising results
                           of

                           detection method called “Louvain method” based on the assumption, that nodes being
                           more densely connected together than with the rest of the network construct a network
                           community [<a class="ref" href="#blondel2008">Blondel et al. 2008</a>]. The method identified in total 13
                           clusters - in my interpretation: topics - in the bigram-based and 12 topics in the
                           skipgram-based text network.</li>

                           visualised in the network graph. Since the graph includes only word pairs shared by
                           at least two countries, edge effects help us to identify word pairs used together

                           to their weights. The underlying idea of this layout is to gather nodes belonging
                           to
                           the same cluster on the same circumference. Further, the visualisation makes also
                           connections between the clusters – i.e. word pairs, of which words belong to
                           different topic clusters – easier to identify. As regards the meaning circulation
                           across the multi-country text network word pairs connecting two topics can be
                           analysed from the perspective of structural holes. These connections bridging two

                     pandemic disease by content words like “pandemie” (pandemic), “resignation”
                     (resignation), or the word combination “schwierig” + “zeit” (hard times), but also seeks
                     to create hope through words like “erfolgreich” (successful), “familie” (family),
                     “meistern” (control), “zusammenleben” (life together). The topic “Europe”, in turn,
                     tackles both current European issues like terrorism (“terror”), European parliamentary
                     elections (“wählen” (vote),“parlament” (parliament)) and European integration as a wider
                     context (“europäisch” + “union” (EU), “erweiterung” (enlargement), “mitgliedstaat” (member
                     state)). This latter topic clearly evidences the role and status of the EU as the
                     most
                     important political, economic, and geographical context.</div>

                     the context of these three countries. The main topics discussed above not only connect
                     well to the political and economic reality in these countries or in Europe in more
                     general terms, but also evidence that TNA tools offer – as the previous studies of
                     [<a class="ref" href="#paranyushkin2011">Paranyushkin 2011</a>], [<a class="ref" href="#light2014">Light 2014</a>], or [<a class="ref" href="#shim2015">Shim et al. 2015</a>] already suggest – a reliable
                     alternative to traditional methods of text mining. Further, the differences between
                     topics identified in the bigram and the skipgram based network seem to give support
                     to
                     the study of [<a class="ref" href="#jelveh2014">Jelveh et al. 2014</a>] that the complementary use of both methods can help us
                     to reliably identify topics that use similar vocabulary but show differences in the
                     text
                     structure. And finally, it is worth being noted that the most important content words
                     of
                     each topic contain only a few words with both a high degree centrality and a high
                     betweenness centrality. This means that the most important content words are those
                     enjoying higher relevance within the topic and, thus, are descriptive for the topic.
                     A
                     closer look at words used for meaning circulation across topics and countries reveals
                     that these words include words related to peace (“frieden”, “friedlich”) and war
                     (“krieg”), security (“sicherheit”), crisis (“krise”), community (“gemeinschaft”),
                     economy (“wirtschaft”), and future (“zukunft”). All these “glueing” words are less
                     topical and more contextual, thus framing and embedding the topical issues into a
                     wider

                     powerful alternative to traditional methods of topic modelling, especially to LDA.
                     Against the background of these objectives and based on the results of the empirical

                     relevant clusters. As I have shown the applied approach can help the researcher to

                     of
                     words that are more common in a certain period I could tackle changes in the content
                     of
                     the addresses over time. On the other hand, TNA proved to be a rather simple, yet
                     powerful alternative to traditional topic modelling methods. The validation of the
                     results of the community detection against samples from the original sources showed
                     that
                     the identified clusters not only had a meaningful content relevant for all countries,
                     but they also were, according to their modularity values, valid and reliable. The
                     two
                     methods, when applied in a complementary manner, were very useful in identifying changes
                     in the content over time and across nations, but also in exploring topics binding
                     these
                     three countries together. Here we could also identify one clear difference between
                     the
                     three countries. For Germany and Austria Europe seem to play an important role and
                     many
                     addresses reflected the fundamental importance of Europe, especially the European
                     Union,
                     as <em class="emph">the</em> political, economic, and historical context for both
                     countries. Swiss New Year’s addresses remain somewhat abstract and globally oriented
                     in
                     this respect, thus reflecting the long tradition of the neutral Swiss foreign
                     policy [<a class="ref" href="#gabriel2003">Gabriel and Fischer 2003</a>] [<a class="ref" href="#goetschel2005">Goetschel and Schwarz 2005</a>]

                     the limitations of text network analysis need to be addressed. As Diesner et al. (2012)
                     points out, validation of the results can be difficult for densely connected large-scale
                     networks. Further, techniques for text preprocessing, node identification, and link
                     construction must be decided before mining network structure from text data, since
                     these
                     decisions “could strongly influence the structure of resulting networks” [<a class="ref" href="#shim2015">Shim et al. 2015</a>, 75]. As a comparison of the bigram and skipgram networks
                     evidenced, different methods of network data creation may produce different results,
                     so
                     that data preprocessing and network analysis techniques should be selected with care
                     and
                     be closely aligned with research questions and objectives.</div>

                     works and supportive for the idea that text network analysis could offer an interesting
                     alternative method for computational content analysis. Since the method seems to work
                     quite reliable also with smaller data sets I can only encourage colleagues interested
                     in
