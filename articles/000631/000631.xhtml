                  <div class="ptext" id="p2">In 2016, after four years of meeting and spending time with Caribbean women that keep
                     their Afro-Indigenous, Indigenous and Afro-descendant healing traditions alive,
                     Reyes-Santos and Lara were inspired to conceptualize a project that validates
                     healers’ knowledge in a world where Eurocentric notions of health and medicine vilify
                     and dismiss them. As healers and ceremonialists, themselves, Reyes-Santos and Lara’s
                     journeys within Caribbean communities throughout the Dominican Republic, Cuba, Puerto
                     Rico, and the U.S. Pacific Northwest region, seeks to interrogate and to interrupt
                     the colonial gaze that historically vilifies and demeans our elders as
                     “uneducated,” or “simple,” or “primitive,” and that deems their
                     knowledge simply “folklore,”
                     “popular religion,” or “supersitition.”

                     healing within a TEK context that includes preserving food and medicine forests and
                     gathering grounds, transmitting traditional food and medicine knowledge to others,
                     caring for and treating their families, and members of their communities. Healing
                     work includes attending to people who seek help with the health of their lands,
                     plants, animals and human bodies. Healing entails attending to physical, emotional,
                     psychological, social and spiritual dimensions of health and well-being. As such,
                     the

                  <div class="ptext" id="p6">Since 2010, as Afro-Indigenous ceremonialists and scholars working in the fields of
                     Black and Indigenous Studies, Reyes-Santos and Lara have collaborated in
                     Afro-Indigenous survival and revitalization projects, ethnographic research projects,
                     and on another digital project. They have spent the past eleven years travelling to
                     Indigenous, Afro-descendant, and Afro-Indigenous ritual, healing, and ceremonial
                     spaces in Mexico, the Dominican Republic, Cuba, Puerto Rico, and the United States.
                     While participating in and collaborating with these spaces, they have become
                     students, apprentices, and allies working with elders to continue disseminating and
                     valorizing their traditional knowledge through visits, fundraising, workshops,
                     ceremonies, and academic research. For instance, in 2012, Lara and Reyes-Santos
                     fundraised and planned a visit of Mexica elders to sacred sites in the Dominican
                     Republic, where they met Afro-Indigenous healers and ritual leaders; in 2012, the
                     Black Feminist Retreat in the Dominican Republic brought together U.S.-based Black
                     scholars and artists, and activists, cultural workers, and traditional ceremonialists
                     living in the Dominican Republic; in 2015, they also organized a trip of Mexica and
                     Mezcalero Apache elders to meet Cuban <cite class="title italic">regla de ocha</cite>
                     communities in Havana. Both these events are examples of the kind of exchanges they
                     have helped bring to fruition as efforts to disseminate and exchange traditional
                     healing knowledge across Indigenous, Afro-descendant, and Afro-Indigenous communities
                     in the Americas. </div>

                     information early on. In 2011 they interviewed Dominican feminist and queer activists
                     on educational justice; Reyes-Santos edited short films documenting their
                     experiences, and posted them to a YouTube channel. In 2017, Lara trained students
                     in
                     Reyes-Santos’ class in ethnographic methodologies to participate in a storytelling

                        <p class="ptext">Openness is a concept that has come to characterize knowledge and
                           communication systems, epistemologies, society and politics, institutions or
                           organizations, and individual personalities. In essence, openness in all these
                           dimensions refers to a kind of transparency which is the opposite of secrecy and
                           most often this transparency is seen in terms of access to information especially
                           within organizations, institutions or societies.

                        Afro-Indigenous traditions are being maintained and practiced. The aforementioned

                        traditional ecological and spiritual knowledges. They are also reflective of a
                        socio-political context in which Afro-Indigenous traditions and ways of knowing
                        are marginalized. As the <em class="term">campos</em>, the countryside,
                        “empty out,” traditional land bases and community spaces are increasingly
                        threatened. As economic marginalization increases, Black people, Afro-Indigenous
                        healers have to become even more creative in figuring out ways to gather the
                        medicines that they need, collect the materials for their offerings, and develop

                        methodologies sought to subvert the western-centric approach to using digital
                        tools for tools and innovations and putting something on the Internet for the sake
                        of making information publicly available. It was important for the authors to
                        always ask questions of the community regarding access, transparency,
                        collaboration, sharing, accessibility, and the choice of permanence. Ultimately,

                        Cuba and Puerto Rico. In these interviews, they focused on the world views of
                        their elders. Their research approaches were (and continue to be) grounded in a
                        critical Indigenous approach [<a class="ref" href="#smith2011">Smith 2011</a>]
                        [<a class="ref" href="#cole2001">Cole 2001</a>]whereby the elders determined the parameters of shared

                        methods by which those questions would be answered. This approach was not only
                        critical, it was absolutely required. As younger women engaged in respectful
                        relation with elders, Reyes-Santos and Lara could open the possibility of
                        conversation, but the elders were the ones who would determine what it was that

                        walking down the street in a place that was new to them. Reyes-Santos and Lara
                        were also attentive to including queer/two-spirit healers living in the Diaspora,
                        whose own geographies include healing communities in the U.S. and the Caribbean. </div>

                     <div class="ptext" id="p29">These initial methods soon transformed into a practice of deep listening. The
                        first thing Reyes-Santos and Lara were taught was deep listening. Over the last
                        decade, they have learned to understand deep listening as a practice that is
                        central to the pedagogical methods of Caribbean religious traditions. It involves
                        listening with the whole body, to what is articulated and unarticulated, and
                        paying attention to what is seen and not seen. Deep listening is about observing
                        collective ritual behaviors and the utterances that take place between people. To
                        listen deeply is to be a part of, extending beyond ethnographic participant
                        observation and into the realm of being in loving community. To listen deeply is
                        to listen to dreams, to listen to “the counsel of spirits and
                        ancestors,” to dance to music, and to be present to the ups and downs of
                        their elders’ (and their families’) lives. </div>

                     <div class="ptext" id="p30">Deep listening changed Reyes-Santos and Lara as researchers because it changed
                        their orientations to “being,” to space-time, and to their own relations. It
                        required prioritizing recording the conversation in the format most comfortable to
                        the healers; to undertake interviews healers with husbands, children, neighbors,
                        or patients around us or while on a hike through a forest in the middle of a hot
                        tropical morning. Deep listening is about being embedded in everyday living, to
                        listen to the cacophony of voices, noises, landscapes where healing takes place.
                        Beyond the initial interview, Reyes-Santos and Lara were kept accountable to this
                        practice by continued check-ins and visits with healers. Their relationships
                        transcend the timeline of the project.</div>

                     <div class="ptext" id="p31">By engaging in a practice of deep listening, Reyes-Santos and Lara first learned
                        that all of the elders have unique and powerful understandings of the divine,
                        known variously as Bondieu, Papa Dios, Olofi, Ometeotl and Gran Espíritu. They
                        learned about the unspoken understandings of elders’ relationships to ancestors
                        and to all living beings, which are the primary sites for healing. They learned
                        about the parameters of what is considered “alive” and “dead” (e.g. all of
                        existence is alive, but plastic is dead). They learned about the context in which
                        life is prolonged and death is accepted — or not. They learned about how current
                        economic, political and social conditions are understood in relationship to the
                        prolongation and/or decimation of the lives of elders, their families, their
                        communities, and the land itself. They learned that in different traditions
                        healing is directed either towards the prolongation of life or toward the aversion
                        of death. These distinct orientations translate into relationships with the plant
                        world, relationships with the spirit and ancestral worlds, and relationships to
                        living, breathing human beings.</div>

                     <div class="ptext" id="p32">In addition to deeply listening, Reyes-Santos and Lara also walked. Miriam Ricourt
                        describes walking as a practice of disruption and meaning-making that was and
                        continues to be a central praxis of maroon peoples (<em class="term">cimarrones</em>). Walking was critical to their understanding of elders’
                        worlds. They walked with them through their communities, as seen in Figure 1,
                        through their forests, within their churches, homes, and ceremonial grounds.
                        Walking together, and being together in walking, allowed all present to assert our
                        mutual humanity (everyone was hot) and limitations (when one person got tired —
                        usually Reyes-Santos or Lara, much to the amusement of those who could keep
                        going). Walking together allowed Reyes-Santos and Lara to understand how elders
                        move through space and why. Walking enabled Reyes-Santos and Lara to understand
                        the elders’ specific geographies — the trees, plants, and places where they make
                        meaning on an on-going basis, the ways they tended these spaces, and the sense of
                        loss that is an increasing part of the human experience in the face of rapid
                        climate change. In walking together, Reyes-Santos photographed plants, groups of
                        plants, and Lara asked questions that prompted stories about specific places. </div>

                        researchers, their voices, methodologies, and the values shared. We also
                        maintained a regular meeting schedule to continue to discuss all aspects of
                        site design and implementation as wireframes and interactive prototypes were
                        created. Throughout this collaborative process, issues regarding the site’s
                        overall layout, navigation, and missed pages and content were remediated
                        together.</div>

                        available for anyone to access over the Internet meant critically thinking

                        As a research team, it was always the goal to make the website available for
                        educational use and give space for sharing healer knowledge. Creative Commons
                        was discussed, but determined not to be appropriate because the researchers and
                        community only wanted information to be permitted in an educational environment
                        all the while retaining their copyright to the digital assets and project as a
                        whole. Together the team selected RightsStatements.org “In Copyright -

                        researchers’ intention and the agreement with the healers, as well as being
                        reader-friendly as opposed to intense legal-ese or complicated rights holder

                        tenant of openness. The project team worked by respecting each other's
                        expertise and centering collaboration with the community, asking many questions
                        and prioritizing culturally aware and accessible design that could only be
                        planned, built, and maintained with the support and expertise of the full
                        interdisciplinary team. In supporting the web design for cultural awareness,
                        Reyes-Santos and Lara discussed with the building team what colors, symbols,
                        and visual characteristics were appropriate and which could not be used, such
                        as the color red. Using these guidelines, Malinao-Alvarez and Thornhill worked
                        together to create an accessibility-compliant color palette and style guide, as

                        healers are monolingual Spanish speakers, and similarly, a major audience for
                        the website was the English-speaking student body of the University of Oregon
                        for whom we would need to transcribe and translate the healers’ Spanish
                        language knowledge and interviews. </div>

                     <div class="ptext" id="p53">For both groups, it is important for them to hear the words used by the
                        communities themselves to name the plants they use for healing; to have their
                        plant knowledge validated throughout the site and for others to learn such
                        names. This was a major reason why the research team declined to use the Latin
                        scientific or English terms for the plants. The sixteen interview clips on the
                        website were selected and edited from full-length interviews, first by
                        undergraduate research assistant Miguel Perez and then by Thornhill after Perez
                        needed to leave the project. When artificial intelligence captioning services
                        from Panopto and Zoom proved unable to provide Spanish transcriptions for the
                        edited clips, first Perez, then Thornhill created transcriptions, which we
                        contracted with Rev.com for English translations. After having graduate
                        assistant Lepska, Reyes-Santos, and Lara review these translations for quality
                        assurance, future transcriptions and translations were performed by
                        Transcription Outsourcing LLC. Reyes-Santos and Lara continued to review
                        translations for accuracy before anything was made available on the site.</div>

                     <div class="ptext" id="p54">The careful curation of shared knowledge was a major task for the research
                        team, selecting what was appropriate to be shared openly and online and what
                        was for the healer community alone. The choice of open or closed access remains
                        with the community; these collections did not become part of the Libraries’
                        collections, nor are the healer interviews available to be downloaded through
                        Panopto. One area that this was particularly acute was in the creation of the
                        digital map and the latitude and longitude associated with the photographs of
                        plants taken in association with a planned ethnobotanical dictionary. That
                        metadata was removed using EXIF Tool and Adobe Bridge and for the map,
                        abstracted to a more general location, with the story shared on the map talking
                        about history and methodology, rather than the specificity of the location or
                        the research site where the photograph was taken. This honored some of the
                        healers’ requests to protect them from ongoing ostracization in their
                        communities. </div>

                        audience. A running thread throughout the process was the emphasis on
                        accessibility, navigation, content display and ability to view the content
                        through multiple kinds of devices and networks. Given that the majority of
                        healers in the project live in rural communities outside the U.S., and that
                        they access the internet through phones on 3G networks, we wanted to ensure
                        that the website is equitable, flexible, and intuitive for user and
                        interactivity; have information be perceived in multiple ways regardless of
                        sensory ability; and have the site be responsive to different screen sizes
                        dependent on the types of technical devices used to access it. By applying
                        accessibility concepts throughout the digital technology selection and digital
                        content process, the builders understood requirements for a sitemap,
                        inspirations for look and feel, and different ways to represent and engage with
                        interviews. For example, transcriptions and translations were made separately
                        available to download on healer pages. These PDFs, which are speech-to-text
                        reader-friendly, are read aloud by the computer. </div> </div>

                        provide access to WordPress to all faculty, staff, and students. There is a

                        resources and capacity that the UO Libraries provided within the Caribbean is
                        difficult at best. These dynamics replicate some of the inherent issues of the
                        digital humanities, whereby the United States continues to predominate as a site
                        for the production of digital scholarship.[<a class="ref" href="#risam2016">Risam 2016</a>] It is a
                        dynamic that feels inescapable given that both researchers live and work within
                        the U.S. academy. In the meantime, we are aware that academic systems of
                        evaluation for tenure and promotion may implicitly erase the labor that healers
                        engaged in giving input, feedback, and changing and transforming knowledge within
