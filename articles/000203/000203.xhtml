                  <h2>Abstract</h2> 
                  <p>Textual bricolage, the unacknowledged re-use of chunks of existing texts
            within a new composition, spans the liminal space between authorized, publicly shared,
            and de-authorized texts. While it can result in unique literary juxtapositions,
            bricolage also challenges the boundaries of authorial ownership. Understanding the
            methods and responses to textual bricolage reflects how a culture engages with
            textuality. Yet such study is often hindered by the sheer extent of compared texts. In
            this article we explore the potential of using Factotum, text similarity recognition
            software with visual interface, for analysing textual bricolage. Using examples from
            medieval and recent texts, we discuss different compilation techniques as well as the
            interaction between the notions of authorship, plagiarism and intertextuality. </p>

               teenage angst <cite class="title italic">Axolotl Roadkill</cite>
           (2010), a "ball lightning in prose form and language" as one
               review described it, became an instant sensation in Germany.<a class="noteRef" href="#d0e217">[1]</a>
               The book’s jarring format, its multiple layers and dimensions,
               its playful juxtaposition of the staid and known to expose fresh, unknown patterns,
               struck a chord among critics: 
        <blockquote>
                        <p> ... all that which has been thought of, said, done, and
               accomplished a hundred times already she has absorbed, bundled, and transformed into
               something entirely new and unheard of, in an approach to literature that is beautiful
               not despite but because of its hardness, brutality, and vulgarity.<a class="noteRef" href="#d0e228">[2]</a>

                  <div class="ptext" id="p2">The 17-year-old author was on track to receive the prestigious
               Leipzig Book Fair Prize when accusations of plagiarism began to surface after a
               reader recognized a number of passages, some amounting to entire pages, copied
               without acknowledgment from the novel <cite class="title italic">Strobo</cite>
            by [<a class="ref" href="#airen2010">Airen 2010</a>]. Soon the list of unacknowledged sources grew
               to include a number of other novels, as well as excerpts from songs, movies, blogs,
               and interviews. What critics praised as a juxtaposition of seemingly different voices
               turned out to be precisely that: a compilation of fragments of the works of others
               enveloped by Hegemann’s own words. <cite class="title italic">Axolotl
               Roadkill</cite>
            was withdrawn from prize nomination in the middle of what
               became one of Germany’s most involved public debates on the nature of authorship and
               plagiarism in the internet age [<a class="ref" href="#stich2010">Stich 2010</a>, 7–11].</div>

                  <div class="ptext" id="p3">The critical response to <cite class="title italic">
            Axolotl Roadkill</cite> brought into prominence a tension
               inherent in artistic manipulation of existing texts. Hegemann’s opponents argued that
               the book’s large-scale borrowing did not acknowledge its sources and thus constituted
               plagiarism. By disregarding the authorial rights of others Hegemann breached a set of
               conventions between writers, publishers, and distributors that have been developing
               since the introduction of the printing press [<a class="ref" href="#thomasius1679">Thomasius 1679</a>]; [<a class="ref" href="#grafton1990">Grafton 1990</a>]; [<a class="ref" href="#mulsow2006">Mulsow 2006</a>]. Her supporters, on the other hand, could refer to a long tradition of
               unacknowledged textual borrowing: the technique of <em class="emph">cento</em>, poems composed
               entirely of appropriated lines, which predates Christianity; the ubiquitous
               unreferenced allusions to canonical texts like the Bible, Goethe’s
            <cite class="title italic">Faust</cite>, or the plays of
               Shakespeare; or the artistic practice of textual bricolage consisting of conscious
               appropriation and transformation of chunks of existing texts [<a class="ref" href="#meltzer1994">Meltzer 1994</a>]; [<a class="ref" href="#hume2001">Hume 2001</a>]. Viewed from the latter perspective
            <cite class="title italic">Axolotl Roadkill</cite>
            did not introduce something radically new, only pushed the
               boundaries of convention — something artists are expected to do, after all.</div>

                  <div class="ptext" id="p4">But the boundaries that distinguish textual appropriation,
               allusion, and plagiarism are not easily drawn with precision. In communities with
               established textual canons, the recognition by the reader of an unreferenced
               canonical allusion is a mark of belonging, even status. In a work like
               Melville’s
            <cite class="title italic">Moby Dick</cite> or Joyce’s
               <cite class="title italic">Ulysses</cite>, the
               occasional verbatim borrowing adds another layer of meaning and pleasure to those who
               can recognize the appropriation. The allowable extent of such borrowing is not
               strictly defined, though. And even the most strictly regimented intellectual
               communities, such as medieval universities, could be inconsistent in applying their
               conventions. Medieval authors did recognize a hierarchical order of texts based on
               their authoritative value and proximity to truth [<a class="ref" href="#minnis2010">Minnis 2010</a>]. By convention, the
               voice of an <em class="emph">auctor</em>
               carried what we would call authorial originality, while works of authors who did not
               yet reach <em class="emph">auctoritas</em> were often appropriated without acknowledgment. In reality,
               though, many works or their sections appeared under the names of other authors or
               were deauthorized altogether. Whether this happened by authorial choice or through
               the decision of subsequent copiers and readers, the results were not dissimilar to
               the intertextuality of Hegemann’s novel [<a class="ref" href="#calma2011">Calma 2011</a>]; [<a class="ref" href="#zahora2012b">Zahora 2012b</a>].

                  </div>
                  <div class="ptext" id="p5">Postmodern literary intertextuality has been even more playful
               and subversive of conventions. The erosion of the concept of a literary canon,
               combined with the vastness of the global cultural sphere, has brought attention to
               the extent to which artistic creation is in fact re-creation of existing models. As
               Rachel Galvin puts it, "Cast positively, cultural recycling may be viewed as homage,
               pastiche, parody, or ludic recombination; on the flip side, it engages in deception,
               forgery, theft, plagiarism, hoax, usurpation." [<a class="ref" href="#galvin2014">Galvin 2014</a>, 25]. A work that depends
               almost exclusively on other texts makes the distinction difficult, leaving the reader
               uncertain whether the extensive dependence reflects clever artistic choice or thinly
               disguised theft. The belated insertion of references into editions of 
              <cite class="title italic">Axolotl Roadkill</cite>
           suggests that Hegemann’s use of <cite class="title italic">Strobo</cite>
            may have been intentionally disguised — that the text was
               deauthorized, decontextualized, and re-used as raw material. Did Hegemann commit
               theft, or did she engage in cultural recycling along the lines of Barthes’ death of
               the author? Critics remain divided as to the appropriate moral judgment, and the text
               itself gives us little insight into her intentions. </div>
         
                  <div class="counter">
                     <a href="#p6">6</a>
                  </div>
                  <div class="ptext" id="p6">While the moral judgment of Hegemann’s textual appropriation
               remains uncertain, the novel reflects an increased interest in textual
               bricolage — composition by extracting, rearranging, modifying, and compiling large
               chunks of pre-existing texts — facilitated by instant access to a growing multitude of
               freely available online texts [<a class="ref" href="#pecorari2008">Pecorari 2008</a>]; [<a class="ref" href="#blum2009">Blum 2009</a>]; [<a class="ref" href="#fish2010">Fish 2010</a>]. To a
               medievalist, the phenomenon brings interesting parallels with intertextual practices
               of the Late Middle Ages and Early Modern Era. It reminds us that conventions
               regarding the use of sources not only differ among textual communities, but change
               over time. However, an understanding of the processes inherent in bricolage and
               compilation is often hindered by the overwhelming extent of compared material.

                  <div class="ptext" id="p7">In this paper we explore the possibilities of analyzing textual
               bricolage with text recognition software Factotum, developed by a team of researchers
               at Monash University in Melbourne, Australia. Originally conceived as a tool to study
               the early-fourteenth-century encyclopedia <cite class="title italic">Speculum morale</cite> composed almost entirely of
               unacknowledged sources, Factotum has developed into a tool for visual comparison of
               intertextual relationships between large texts. While software like Turnitin<a class="noteRef" href="#d0e324">[3]</a>
           effectively identifies the sources from which an author
               borrows, Factotum offers a platform for identification and analysis of the compiler’s
               method of arrangement, and thus for recognizing the interplay of different authorial
               and textual voices. Accomplishing in seconds what could take even a trained reader
               weeks or months of meticulous work, Factotum opens up space for critical analysis of
               ways in which texts can be manipulated to create a significantly altered or entirely
               different message. </div>

               <cite class="title">Name of the Rose</cite>,
               tends to associate the Middle Ages with a scarcity of books, jealously guarded and
               accessible to the initiated alone. There is some truth to the stereotype as far as
               the situation in much of medieval Europe is concerned. But when it comes to major
               centers of knowledge production like Paris the stereotype becomes too simplistic. In
               the thirteenth century, Vincent of Beauvais (c. 1190-c.1264), composed a three-volume
               encyclopedia, the <cite class="title italic">Speculum maius</cite>, not because of a lack but "because the multitude of books,
               brevity of time, and instability of memory do not allow the soul to take in equally
               all that is written." <a class="noteRef" href="#d0e345">[4]</a> Its three books (the <cite class="title italic">Speculum historiale</cite>, the <cite class="title italic">Speculum naturale</cite>
            and the <cite class="title italic">Speculum
               doctrinale</cite>) provide a compendium of learning, so that
               one book could stand for many. Vincent was also creating a guide to sources whose use
               among ever-multiplying treatises and commentaries was often less than reliable. His
               method, expressed in words that offer an interesting comparison to Hegemann’s novel,
               recognizes that the innovation lies not in the contents themselves but in the way
               they are presented: 
         <blockquote>
                        <p>... this work is at once both new and old, both brief and
               prolix: look, it is ancient in its contents and authority, but new in its compilation
               or arrangement of parts; it is brief inasmuch as many sayings were constrained into
               compact form, but nevertheless long due to the immense multitude of subjects.<a class="noteRef" href="#d0e364">[5]</a>

                  <div class="ptext" id="p9">The degree of self-awareness and high standards of editorial
               practice make Vincent’s work a landmark of compilation, but also a rather unique
               occurrence [<a class="ref" href="#paulmierfoucart2004">Paulmier-Foucart &amp; Duchenne 2004</a>, 23–115]. Many of his
               contemporaries, while equally dependent on the works of others, exercised a more
               liberal approach to utilizing them. After the massive influx of textual material
               produced in the thirteenth century, succeeding generations of scholars often chose to
               adjust and reuse rather than compose entirely new texts. A good example is the work
               of Pierre d’Ailly (1351-1420), which borrows without restraint or acknowledgment from
               the writings of Jean de Mirecourt, Gregory of Rimini, William of Ockham or, as in
               this instance, the prayer of Boethius asking for divine inspiration, also imitated by

               sixteenth century [<a class="ref" href="#zahora2012a">Zahora 2012a</a>]. But this would not only subject these works to
               notions of authorship postdating their composition by several centuries; it would
               also prevent us from understanding the full context of reception and actual use of

               alternating verbatim copying with paraphrase, rearrangement, and additional comments.
               Bricolage differs from allusion and direct quotation by utilizing more extensive
               verbatim chunks of the original, and by re-using texts from a wider spectrum of

               among the most dependent on other works. An excellent illustration is the extensive

            <cite class="title italic"> Speculum morale</cite> [<a class="ref" href="#beauvais1979">Vincent of Beauvais 1979</a>], 
          associated with Vincent of Beauvais but composed after 1300, at
               least a generation after his death. The work contains an extensive coverage of human
               behavior, a topic not covered by Vincent of Beauvais. Yet it has been largely ignored
               by scholars based on the assumption it has simply been "plagiarized" from six
               unacknowledged "primary" sources — with the largest borrowing from Thomas Aquinas’
               (1225-1274) <cite class="title italic">Summa theologiae</cite> — that alone deserve close study [<a class="ref" href="#echard1708">Echard 1708</a>]; [<a class="ref" href="#zahora2012a">Zahora 2012a</a>]. In
               fact the <cite class="title italic">Speculum morale</cite> demonstrates how an unknown author has participated in the
               transformation of traditional ethics by introducing a new theory of emotions
               formulated by Aquinas, in particular his important and innovative discussion of
               emotions as in themselves morally neutral.

               daunting task. The most recent definitive study was completed by Jacques Echard in
               1708 and extends to over 600 pages. No one has attempted to replicate his efforts
               since — discouraged no doubt as much by the 1558 columns of the printed edition as by
               Echard’s conclusion that the <cite class="title italic">Speculum
               morale</cite> is a more-or-less worthless farrago of a clumsy
               plagiarist [<a class="ref" href="#echard1708">Echard 1708</a>, 101]. And yet, as Echard himself admitted, the compiler was
               not entirely a mindless copier of his sources. At times he changed the order of
               Aquinas’ articles, paraphrased, eliminated, or inserted passages from other sources
               and his own observations. In other words, the <cite class="title italic">Speculum morale</cite> is more than the sum of its parts. Its
               voices bear traces of actual use of Aquinas’s works, as well as of the interplay of
               theology, philosophy, and sermon source material during a period of consolidation of
               medieval scholasticism. </div>

               comprise the <cite class="title italic">Speculum morale</cite> entails the creation of a correspondingly massive research
               apparatus. Echard’s linear expositions of textual parallels run to hundreds of pages
               of lists: our Excel spreadsheet has three tables corresponding to the three books of
               the encyclopedia and a total of 837 rows at 13 columns each, with additional tables
               for more detailed analysis. For a close reading, rather than relying like Echard on a
               superb memory and intimate familiarity with French archives, the Monash team has
               approached the task by using the experience in electronic plagiarism detection and
               the increasing availability of electronic texts [<a class="ref" href="#mews2010">Mews et al. 2010</a>]. The result of the
               efforts is text recognition software Factotum. Factotum enables us to move away from
               the plagiarism mindset by mapping the mutual relationships of the sources of <cite class="title italic">Speculum morale</cite> identified
               by Echard, and by focusing directly on places where the original material is
               transformed or rearranged, rather than on the overwhelming bulk of verbatim
               transcriptions from other sources.

               altered the meaning of the sentence. Aquinas’ statement "Primo igitur modo, res

               et tertio modo, vel diabolus, vel etiam homo, potest incitare ad peccatum" (Therefore
               in the first way, sensible things appearing on the outside move the will of man
               towards sin, but in the second and third way either the devil or even man himself can
               incite to sin) belongs to the section on sin, hence the focus on the different
               channels of temptation. But the author of the 
              <cite class="title italic">Speculum morale</cite> used Aquinas’ text in another setting:
               the principal origin of human works, both good and bad. In the compiled version, much
               of Aquinas’ wording was preserved, but also amended to point out the usefulness of
               the created world: "Therefore in the first way, sensible things appearing on the
               outside move the will of man toward the good or the bad, just as contemplation of
               created things moves and induces man to praise the wisdom, honor the omnipotence, and

                a work with its own character. Factotum allows the reader to recognize the extent
               of borrowing, observe the modes of textual rearrangement, and finally focus on
               passages where the transformation of material or addition of unidentified passages

               incorporation of exact quotations from the King James Bible along with paraphrase and
               allusions offered a great test case for Factotum. On the most basic level, the
               program identified verbatim quotations, such as the presence of the text of Jonah in
               the chapter called The Sermon. The visual presentation reveals Melville’s elaboration

               Factotum did identify an unnoticed textual coincidence. But at the same time the
               program failed to recognize the word Tophet — which the edition does comment on — because
               the smallest cluster recognizable by Factotum consists of three words [<a class="ref" href="#melville1962">Melville 1962</a>, 604].</div>

              We will leave aside the

               integrity of its own. Airen, whose novel <cite class="title italic">Strobo</cite>

               "This [<cite class="title italic">Strobo</cite>] is

               To them, words based not on actions but on other words can only result in a
               simulacrum, a vague approximation of the "real" experience whose source must be
               acknowledged and given preference. But with the abandonment of a rigid definition of
               originality by literary and cultural studies, and the recognition that permutations
               of existing discourse can create new meaning, authenticity may be too vague a factor
               in examining textual bricolage. For all intents and purposes, Hegemann’s novel
               creates not only an illusion but the reality of literary truth — a mark, at least
               according to some, of its integrity [<a class="ref" href="#woolf1989">Woolf 1989</a>, 72].

               Understanding how some discourses are endowed with the author function while others
               are deprived of it [<a class="ref" href="#foucault1998">Foucault 1998</a>, 211] can offer us a map of how a culture engages
               with textuality. In the medieval academic world, texts of scholastic authors who had
               not yet reached the rank of <em class="emph">auctoritas</em> or authority (and sometimes even afterwards) became the common
               currency of their near-contemporaries who amended and transformed their work without
               acknowledgment. A similar situation is found among today’s university students whose
               practice of weaving commonly used definitions from Wikipedia into their essays is
               often tacitly ignored by lecturers [<a class="ref" href="#pecorari2012">Pecorari &amp; Shaw 2012</a>]. On the other hand,
               unreferenced use of authorized research sources, or extensive verbatim borrowing,
               will result in penalty. Hegemann’s belated retraction can be taken as an
               acknowledgement that she has crossed the currently accepted boundaries of convention.
               However, as our example of the <cite class="title italic">Speculum morale
               </cite> has shown, the boundaries between acceptable and
               unacceptable intertextuality are not constant. In this light, the proliferation of
               re-use of readily available online texts represents another stage in an identifiable
               evolutionary process. </div>

               that Factotum offers can lead to a better understanding of how borrowed texts are
               shaped and reorganized, and how they interact with others. In that, it can provide a
               counterpoint to the observations of medievalists and literary scholars who have shown
               that a subtle authorial voice can be identified even in texts that defy conventional
               notions of authorship [<a class="ref" href="#hume2001">Hume 2001</a>]. Factotum has already contributed to the discovery

               identifying matching texts and allowing the reader to judge not only the extent of

               opens the space for a meta-analysis of textual relationships. The experience of
               making the invisible seams of intertextual composition visible, and comparing similar

               implications of allegedly timeless and universal principles, scholars like Stanley
               Fish have called for an open discussion of conventions that guide professional
               practice [<a class="ref" href="#fish2010">Fish 2010</a>]. The traditional way of dealing with textual parallels has been
               greatly improved by the searching capabilities of Google and proprietary databases

            as well as by progress in textual processing. Even so, analysis
               of textual bricolage remains time consuming, open to errors, and invites a very
               rigid, text-based approach: the memory, burdened by close study, may end up like the
               mind of Borges’ Funes who could remember every piece of text but was incapable of
               analytical thought and comparison. We are hopeful that Factotum is a step in the
