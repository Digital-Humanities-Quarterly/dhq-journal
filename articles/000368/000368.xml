                <head>1. Background</head>
                <p>Cuneiform is the earliest writing system attested in history, emerging towards
                    the end of the fourth millennium B.C. in a region of ancient Mesopotamia that
                    corresponds with the southern part of modern-day Iraq. The population first
                    associated with cuneiform spoke an isolate language called Sumerian. However,
                    Semitic-speakers who co-inhabited the same region quickly adapted the script to
                    write their own language, Akkadian. Akkadian is the earliest attested language
                    of the Semitic family, which includes better-known languages such as Arabic,
                    Hebrew, and Aramaic. </p>
                <p>The signs that made up this writing system consisted of four types: logograms
                    (sometimes called ideograms), which represented whole words or ideas;
                    syllabograms, which represented whole syllables such as <emph>tu, ta,</emph> or
                        <emph>ti</emph>; determinatives, which were a set of signs that indicated,
                    in limited circumstances, the category a word belonged to (i.e., gods, trees,
                    precious stones, personal names, etc.); and numerical signs, which belonged to
                    either a decimal or sexagesimal counting system (both systems were used
                    simultaneously in ancient Mesopotamia). Each sign in these categories was
                    crafted by impressing one or more wedge-shaped markings with the aid of a
                    stylus, usually made from a reed cut to have a triangular tip, into the still
                    soft surface of clay tablets (Figure 1). These clay tablets naturally dried and
                    hardened in the arid and hot climate, and as a result they survived in great
                    numbers. This script survived for over 3000 years from around 3300 BC to 70 AD
                    and became the hallmark of Mesopotamian history and culture.</p>
                <p>The spread of Mesopotamian culture from southern Iraq into neighboring regions,
                    including northern Iraq, Turkey, and Syria, coincided with the development of
                    the cuneiform writing system, during the late fourth millennium and first half
                    of the third millennium BC. During the next few hundred years, this writing
                    system was adopted by the populations outside of Mesopotamia that were
                    interacting regularly with Sumer and Babylonia primarily through trade. As the
                    cuneiform system developed and spread, it was adapted to express non-Sumerian
                    words, including personal names. In general, Akkadian and other languages
                    adapted the cuneiform script by means of the same rebus principle used by
                    Sumerian cuneiform to express grammatical affixes <ptr target="#cooper1996"

                <head>2. Introduction</head>
                <p>In this study<note> This article is based on certain aspects of my doctoral
                        research completed at the University of Oxford in 2016.</note>,
                    interdisciplinary techniques were used to answer questions about how the
                    cuneiform script, the earliest-attested writing system used between 3300 BCE and
                    100 CE in the ancient Near East, was adapted by Semitic-speaking peoples across
                    Mesopotamia and Syria. The earliest, but scarce, evidence of cuneiform signs
                    being used syllabically to write Semitic words and proper nouns comes from
                    around 2600-2500 BCE. Between 2350 and 1800 BCE, there is an increase in the
                    development and use of signs with syllabic values across Mesopotamia and Syria.
                    These syllabic values (together called <soCalled>syllabaries</soCalled>)
                    continue to develop until standardizations of cuneiform signs and their values
                    begin to be enforced around 1800 BCE, which essentially ends any major
                    variability in the script within specific periods. This provides us with a
                    period of almost 600 years, spanning the second half of the third millennium and
                    early second millennium BCE, during which there is a wealth of textual data
                    documenting the first full adaptation of the cuneiform script to syllabically
                    write Semitic words and proper nouns. I investigated differences in the values
                    of cuneiform signs used to write Semitic words excavated from nine sites that
                    produced cuneiform texts during the late third millennium and early second
                    millennium BCE in order to understand the extent to which any variation
                    occurred. This analysis of the variation could then inform other questions about
                    dialect differences, educational practices, and power dynamics across the
                    region.</p>
                <p>Individual studies of the signs attested with a syllabic value among the selected
                    Syrian corpora form the basis of this investigation. These studies aim to
                    provide a clear, consistent, and complete description of syllabic value
                    attestations in Syria and Mesopotamia, and the information they provide is
                    concatenated into a table of reconstructed syllabaries for each site. Together,
                    these reconstructed syllabaries form a pan-Mesopotamian dataset informed by the
                    most current knowledge of syllabic values attested at these sites during the
                    roughly 600-year period being examined. </p>
                <p>After curating a dataset of the syllabic values attested at each site, I analyzed
                    the data using three complementary computational methods: <term>phylogenetic
                        estimation</term>, <term>hierarchical clustering</term>, and <term>principal
                        component analysis</term> (PCA). These tools organized the data into visual
                    hierarchies and identified the principal drivers behind the variation observed
                    in the data. The results strongly support the conclusion that geography and time
                    are the most significant factors affecting syllabic value observations across
                    Mesopotamia, which indicated that during this period scribal communities adapted
                    the cuneiform script’s syllabic system independently and continued to use their
                    local syllabaries despite the differences that any individual scribe encountered
                    through his interactions with other communities across the region. The results
                    of the computational analyses then suggested directions of further inquiry: I
                    examined the linguistic environments of the syllabic values that most directly
                    influenced the variation found in the dataset<note> For the results of this
                        analysis, see the forthcoming publication of my doctoral thesis (Hawkins
                            <emph>in preparation</emph>).</note>. This component of the research
                    provided evidence for greater dialectical variation across the geographic region
                    than was previously assumed.</p>
                <p>In summary, this research uses a series of three interdependent techniques to
                    determine and understand the use and distribution of syllabic values within the
                    cuneiform writing system during the second half of the third millennium BC and
                    early second millennium BC. The results suggest that during this period
                    cuneiform syllabaries are variable, and that variation can further inform us
                    about the regional, temporal, and dialectical contexts in which they existed.
                    The addition of this research to the wider literature on the early adaptation of
                    cuneiform enhances the field’s understanding of how cuneiform syllabic values
                    began to develop and emerge across the ancient Near East, and demonstrates how
                    computational methods of analysis can be applied to research questions in
                    humanities subjects.</p>

                <head>3. Sites Examined</head>
                <p>The aim of this study was to examine the spread and adaptation of syllabic signs
                    used to write Semitic words and proper nouns, so the sites initially considered
                    for examination must have produced texts wholly or partially written in a
                    Semitic language or dialect. In the third millennium, there were 19 such sites,
                    and ten of these have been chosen for inclusion in this study due to the number
                    of relevant tablets attested at each site and easy access (either electronic or
                    physical) to the tablets: Ebla, Mari, Nabada, Tuttul, Adab, Kish, Tutub,
                    Eshnunna, Assur, and Gasur<note> Not included in this study are the following
                        nine sites: Nagar, Sheḫna / Shubat-Enlil, Umma, Shuruppak, Abu Salabikh,
                        Nippur, Girsu, Umm al-Jir, and Susa.</note>. Sites were excluded from this
                    study if the entire collection of tablets is housed in Syria, Iraq, or Turkey,
                    or if I was not granted access to the collections housed in museums Europe. </p>
                <p>By examining these texts, the syllabaries attested at each of these sites were
                    reconstructed (except Ebla, see below) by examining the published photos or
                    transliterations of the texts of each site, and by examining a few of the
                    tablets in person that have not yet been sufficiently published. I have
                    therefore relied on a combination of analog data, digital data,<note> This was
                        obtained from the Cuneiform Digital Library Initiative (<ref
                            target="http://www.cdli.ucla.edu">www.cdli.ucla.edu</ref>), unless
                        otherwise stated.</note> and in-person examination of texts for the
                    collation of the syllabaries of the sites included in this study.</p>
                <figure>
                    <head>The ten sites included in this study are Ebla, Mari, Nabada, Tuttul, Adab,
                        Kish, Eshnunna, Tutub, Assur, and Gasur.</head>
                    <graphic url="resources/images/figure02.png"/>
                </figure>
                <p>The reconstructed syllabaries of Adab, Kish, Assur, and Gasur were collected
                    using texts published on the Cuneiform Digital Library Initiative’s database.
                    The syllabary from Tutub was reconstructed using texts available both in the
                    Cuneiform Digital Library Initiative (CDLI) database and Sommerfeld’s (1999)
                        <title rend="quotes">Die Texte der Akkade-Zeit. 1. das Dijala-Gebiet:
                        Tutub.</title> The data from Eshnunna was collected from texts published in
                    Gelb’s (1952) <title rend="quotes">Sargonic Texts from the Diyala Region</title>
                    (MAD 1, nos. 1-195, 270-336.) and from the CDLI database. Many of these tablets
                    are fragmentary and retain few discernible lines of text.</p>
                <p>For the Tuttul and Nabada corpora, I relied on the works of Krebernik <ptr
                        target="#krebernik2001"/> and Ismail <ptr target="#ismail1996"/>

                    for both. Because of the size of the Mari and Ebla corpora, limitations had to
                    be imposed on the type of texts examined in the reconstruction of the
                    syllabaries of these two sites. For Mari, I have chosen to include only the
                    texts published by Limet <ptr target="#limet1976"/> and for Ebla I only consider
                    the already-published syllabaries of the lexical texts <ptr

                                of the analysis, the data sets were filtered to exclude any

                    <head>4.1 Computational methods of analysis: a three-step approach</head>
                    <p>Three different methods of analysis were used to visualize this dataset.
                        These three methods are phylogenetic estimation, hierarchical clustering,
                        and principal component analysis. Phylogenetic estimation was included
                        because it is a common method used in the study of language and manuscript
                        evolution <ptr target="#platnick1977"/>
                        <ptr target="#atkinson2005"/> and the results could therefore be more easily
                        compared with previous studies. However, because of the novelty of using
                        phylogenetic systematics to understand writing system evolution, and because
                        of the relative inflexibility of phylogenetic programs to filter out
                        relevant data from noise, two other computational methods, programmed in R
                        within the IDE RStudio, were used to test the results of the phylogenetic
                        estimation model. All three types of analysis were conducted on an Apple
                        laptop. The second two techniques help manipulate, filter, and visualize the
                        data in different ways; they organize the data according to similarities and
                        differences, and can isolate key data points that influence the results.
                        These three methods will be discussed further below.</p>

                    <head>4.2 Unfiltered and filtered datasets</head>
                    <p>An initial examination of the dataset reveals that there are two particular
                        aspects of the data that are skewing the preliminary results: the lack of
                        sufficient data from Assur, and the presence of a large number of signs that
                        only occur at Ebla. The insufficient data from Assur is due to my lack of
                        access to museums in which the corpus is housed. Ebla’s larger number of
                        syllabic sign values may be due to the different methods of determining
                        syllabic values used by me and by the team that published the Ebla
                        syllabary, to dialectical variation, or due to the larger number of
                        non-administrative texts. In order, therefore, to avoid these issues and to
                        avoid possible human error in the syllabaries I reconstructed, all hapax
                        values, or syllabic values at each site that are attested at only one site,
                        were removed in the filtered dataset. </p>
                    <p>Table 2 below shows the number of syllabic values at each site that occur at
                        at least two sites; Assur is a clear outlier with only 6 of these signs
                        attested. Because there is not enough data for Assur to be informative, this
                        site will be removed from further analysis.</p>

                    cuneiform to write Semitic language(s) across Mesopotamia and Syria. The primary
                    strength of phylogenetic analysis is its ability to reconstruct tree- or
                    network-like relationships across time; because the spread and adaptation of
                    cuneiform must have necessarily occurred over a period of time – even a
                    relatively short one – these methods can provide interesting insights into the
                    nature of the script’s spread and help us determine which sites cluster or
                    diverge. Phylogenetic methods are advantageous because the data input and
                    methods used are always transparent, and therefore the results should be
                        repeatable.<note> See Section 12 below for the code used for the

                <p>Phylogenetic methods, which were originally developed by evolutionary biologists
                    for the analysis of trait inheritance and gene expression in particular phyla or
                    species over time, have been used with increasing frequency in the field of
                    linguistics for at least twenty years <ptr target="#nichols2008" loc="760"/>.
                    These methods have been employed in the analysis and historical reconstruction
                    of Indo-European <ptr target="#gray2003"/>, African <ptr target="#marten2006"
                        loc="43–55"/>, and Semitic <ptr target="#kitchen2009"/> languages families;
                    in the reconstruction of language and dialect relationships <ptr
                        target="#nakhleh2005a"/>; and to reconstruct manuscript evolution <ptr
                        target="#barbrook1998"/>. Although many of these studies have produced
                    promising results, this application of phylogenetic inference techniques to
                    reconstruct writing system evolution is still relatively new and untested <ptr
                        target="#skelton2008"/>. The application of phylogenetic methods to this
                    type of data is therefore unique, and the optimal search criteria and program
                    settings have not yet been established. In this study, I used an optimization
                    criterion called maximum parsimony (described further below).</p>
                <div>
                    <head>5.1 Experimental Method</head>
                    <p>Phylogenetic analyses can employ a number of different methods of searching
                        for and evaluating phylogenetic trees <ptr target="#swofford1996"
                            loc="478–93"/>. These methods tend to be either algorithm-based or
                        optimality-criterion-based. Algorithm-based methods rely on algorithms to
                        search for trees and to determine which tree is the correct one, and have
                        the advantage of short computation time. Optimality-criterion-based methods,
                        on the other hand, use different criteria for determining which tree is the
                        best — called the optimality criterion — to find the tree in the first place
                        — or the search strategy. This method is advantageous because the use of two
                        different criteria for searching for the trees and for determining which one
                        is best makes it easier to determine the likelihood that the tree produced
                        is the correct tree <ptr target="#swofford1996" loc="408–9"/>.
                        Optimality-criterion-based methods were used for this analysis because the
                        relatively small dataset (compared to datasets of millions of data points in
                        genomic studies) does not make computation time a concern. </p>
                    <p>Based on her work on Linear B, Skelton determined that the most appropriate
                        optimality criterion for a phylogenetic analysis of a writing system is
                        maximum parsimony, and I therefore consider it here as well <ptr
                            target="#skelton2008" loc="170"/>. Maximum parsimony has been used in
                        the study of several language families, including the Bantu language family
                        on a variety of datasets, with <ptr target="#bastin1983"/>, <ptr
                            target="#holden2002"/>, and <ptr target="#holden2005"/> using only
                        lexical data, and Rexova et al. (2006) using grammatical data. Others have
                        used lexical data <ptr target="#nakhleh2005a"/>
                        <ptr target="#rexova2003"/> and a combination of types of data <ptr
                            target="#nakhleh2005b"/> to study Indo-European languages. Maximum
                        parsimony has also been used by Cysouw et al. to study Mixe-Zoquean <ptr
                            target="#cysouw2006"/>.</p>
                    <p>Maximum parsimony is an optimization problem that aims to produce a tree in
                        which the minimum number of character state changes occurs; using this
                        optimization problem follows the assumption that the path of least
                        resistance would be not to adapt or create new syllabic values. It uses a
                        simple model of character state change, which assumes that each change is
                        equally likely to occur as any other change. While this assumption may not
                        be correct for any given dataset, it is usually not possible to estimate
                        actual probabilities of character change, and so an assumption of equal
                        probabilities is necessary and appropriate; other optimality criteria, such
                        as maximum likelihood, require explicit models of evolutionary change, which
                        is not possible in this case. </p>
                    <p>Maximum parsimony analyses can allow characters with missing entries; for
                        example, maximum parsimony encounters no problem when a language under study
                        has no word for a given semantic slot. Since the data used here contains
                        characters that are not always present in each taxon, this feature of
                        maximum parsimony is necessary.</p>
                    <p>With maximum parsimony, the phylogenetic estimation program creates a series
                        of possible trees and then assigns each one a <soCalled>tree
                            length,</soCalled> which is the sum of the weights of the character
                        state changes that occurred on all branches of the tree. Maximum parsimony
                        considers the tree with the shortest tree length – or fewest character state
                        changes – to be the best solution <ptr target="#skelton2008" loc="171"
                            />.<note> See <ptr target="#swofford1996" loc="415–24"/> for a full
                            discussion of different parsimony methods.</note></p>
                    <p>It is not uncommon for a maximum parsimony method to produce a number of
                        trees with the same tree length. In this situation, it is possible to run an
                        algorithm that produces a consensus tree. The algorithm examines the trees
                        of equal tree length in order to determine which feature(s) the trees all
                        share, or which a majority of the trees share. The usual features that are
                        relevant in this determination are the splits, or bipartitions, on the leaf
                        set induced by the edges of each tree; in other words, a consensus tree can
                        be a tree that has exactly all the splits that each of the input trees have
                            <ptr target="#nichols2008" loc="770–3"/>.<note> Other types of consensus
                            trees are majority consensus and greedy consensus. According to <ptr
                                target="#nichols2008" loc="773"/>, <q>the majority consensus tree
                                contains those edges whose corresponding bipartitions appear in
                                strictly more than half of the input trees, and the greedy consensus
                                tree is formed by computing the majority consensus and then refining
                                the tree by adding bipartitions from the input trees. By
                                construction, the strict consensus tree is the least resolved, the
                                greedy consensus tree is the most resolved, and the majority
                                consensus is in between these two trees with respect to resolution.
                                Also, however, the greedy consensus tree refines the majority
                                consensus tree, and the majority consensus tree refines the strict
                                consensus.</q></note> Since the phylogenetic estimation method
                        produced only one tree in this case, this consensus method was not
                        needed.</p>
                    <p>Another technique for estimating the support values (or the likelihood
                        values) for a single tree, or for the branches of a given tree, is a
                        statistical re-sampling technique called bootstrapping. Bootstrapping
                        creates new, random datasets using characters from the original data matrix
                        and runs them through the same set of parameters. This technique can be used
                        simply to estimate support values for the edges of a tree, where the support
                        values are the fraction of times that that particular bipartition appears in
                        the random bootstrap trees; it can also be used as input data in a consensus
                        method, like those described above, which would then be annotated with the
                        support value estimates <ptr target="#nichols2008" loc="773"/>. This
                        technique dictates that a high support value for a particular bipartition
                        increases the likelihood that that bipartition is accurate. This technique
                        will be applied to the data for both the phylogenetic analysis and the
                        hierarchical clustering. </p>

                    <p>Taxa are the independent variables, or more basic entities being studied. In
                        biology, species or gene sequences are often used as taxa; this study uses
                            sites<note> Ebla, Mari, Nabada, Tuttul, Adab, Eshnunna, Kish, Tutub,
                            Assur, and Gasur.</note> as taxa. Using individual tablets as taxa is
                        not an option because there is not enough data on most tablets for this to
                        be viable. Using scribal hands as taxa (as were used in <ptr
                            target="#skelton2008"/>) is also not an option since hands have so far
                        not been established, or even suggested, for these corpora <ptr

                    <head>5.3 Characters</head>
                    <p>Characters are the dependent variables of a study. In biology, molecular or
                        phenotype data are often used as characters; this study uses syllabic values
                        of signs used in Semitic words and proper nouns as characters. The character
                        states are either 1 or 0, indicating presence or absence (respectively) of
                        that particular character in a taxon.</p>
                    <p>Using syllabic values as the characters in this study is not without its
                        problems. While in most words or personal names it is clear what the
                        syllabic value is meant to be, there are some cases where it is unclear.
                        There is also the issue of human error, either in my own transliterations or
                        on the transliterations and sign lists compiled by other scholars that have
                        been relied upon. </p>

                    <p>There are a number of programs available that perform phylogenetic analyses,
                        each of which specializes in specific methods for estimating phylogenies.
                        The program PAUP*, version 4.0a146 for Macintosh <ptr target="#swofford2001"
                        />, specializes in parsimony methods, and so was used to analyze this
                        dataset. Other programs such as TNT <ptr target="#goloboff2003"/>, Mesquite
                            <ptr target="#maddison2001"/>, or PHYLIP <ptr target="#felsenstein2005"
                        /> could also have been used to estimate the phylogeny of the data through
                        maximum parsimony. </p>
                    <p>The data matrix that was imported into PAUP* consists of 326 total characters
                        (or sign values); 116 of these are determined to be parsimony-uninformative,
                        and 200 are parsimony-informative. Because of the relatively small dataset,
                        an exhaustive search was used to generate the optimal tree (see Figure 3). A
                        bootstrapping resampling method was then run using a full heuristic search
                        strategy; the resulting consensus tree retained groups with a frequency of
                        greater than 50 percent (see Figure 4). For both trees, no outgroup was
                        defined so the trees are arbitrarily rooted at the first taxon (Ebla).<note>
                            Identifying an outgroup is desirable but not necessary. For more about
                            outgroups and ingroups, see <ptr target="#swofford1996"/>.</note></p>

                        reflect three different realities and therefore support three different
                        conclusions about the syllabaries. The possible results could be: </p>

                        <item>That the syllabaries exactly mirror the geography of the sites. This

                            purely on geographic proximity of the sites. In other words, this tree
                            would support the conclusion that there was an organic spread of the

                        <item>That the trees mirror the geography of the sites to a certain extent.

                            the syllabaries examined are. In other words, this tree would suggest
                            that sites nearer to each other were more influenced by each other’s
                            syllabaries and sites further away from each other developed

                        <item>That the trees reflect geography in no way. This would indicate that

                    <p>A few preliminary observations can be made based on these results. First, it
                        is notable that Ebla is an outlier among the taxa. The Mari and Tuttul
                        syllabaries seem to be more similar to the rest of the cohort; Nabada and
                        Assur are clustered together. Finally, the phylogenetic estimation groups
                        together the syllabaries of Eshnunna, Kish, Tutub, and Gasur. Aside from the
                        slightly closer relationship between the Mari and the Tuttul syllabaries,
                        which could theoretically be explained by the geographic proximity of these
                        two sites, these results are unexpected and not immediately explainable.
                        Upon closer examination, the grouping of Nabada and Assur together can be
                        explained by the relatively low number of syllabic values attested at each
                        site; although the reasons for this differ for each. As explained above
                        (Section 4.2), insufficient data was available from Assur which impacted the
                        number of syllabic sign values in the reconstructed syllabary. At Nabada, at
                        the other hand, the scribes writing these tablets seem to have used
                        significantly fewer syllabic signs compared to logographic signs. This is an
                        interesting and unexpected result<note> See Hawkins <emph>in
                                preparation</emph> for a further discussion of this finding <ptr

                        results are more difficult to explain.</p>

                        bootstrapping re-sampling technique on the filtered dataset. Most
                        interesting is that filtering hapax syllabic values and ubiquitous syllabic
                        values did not affect the results. The bootstrap consensus tree of the
                        filtered dataset reveals that Ebla and Nabada are most distant from the
                        other sites, and closely similar to each other, and that Mari and Tuttul are
                        similar with a p-value of 50%. According to this model, there are no strong
                        associations between the Mesopotamian sites except for Kish and Gasur, whose
                        sub-cluster has a p-value of 52% (see the section on hierarchical clustering
                        below for an explanation of the relevance of p-values)</p>
                    <p>Based on this initial examination, it appears that the geography of the sites
                        themselves is mirrored to a certain extent in the phylogenetic analysis.
                        This supports one hypothesis that, if significant variation is attested
                        within the syllabaries of these sites, that variation would be correlated
                        with the geographic situation of the sites. In other words, local variation
                        and innovation in syllabic sign values existed and permeated nearby cities.
                        These localized sign values remained the most prominent feature of each
                        site’s syllabary. In terms of practical relevance for modern scholars, this
                        indicates that the composition of the syllabary of a corpus of cuneiform
                        texts can determine where those tablets originated.</p>
                    <p>Clustering techniques such as phylogenetic analysis are useful for
                        determining general tendencies within a dataset by finding the natural
                        clusterings of that given dataset. However, since most clustering algorithms
                        create clusters regardless of any inherent cluster structure in the dataset,
                        other methods are required to externally validate the results. Hierarchical
                        clustering and principal component analysis were therefore used to verify
                        the results of the phylogenetic analysis and to determine other factors
                        contributing to the observed variation in the syllabaries.</p>

                        the hierarchical clustering of the unfiltered dataset.</head>

                    visual clustering technique that organizes data into dendrograms; in this case,
                    the technique was used to organize sites and syllabic values according to
                    similarities and differences. Because the data collected and used in this study
                    is straightforward, binary data, using different clustering algorithms does not
                    produce different results. This method is in many ways similar to phylogenetic
                    analysis, but uses different algorithms and relies on different underlying
                    assumptions about the dataset. If these two techniques produce the same results,
                    that is a good sign that the branchings and clusterings observed are present in
                    the dataset and not a coincidence of the particular algorithm used.</p>
                <p>Figures 7a and 7b show the results of the hierarchical clustering (using a
                    Manhattan distance function and a Ward clustering metric) on the filtered and
                    unfiltered datasets. The light grey indicates absence of a syllabic value at a
                    site; dark grey indicates presence. The trees along the upper x-axes of the
                    graphs shows how the sites cluster or diverge; the trees along the left-hand
                    y-axes of the graphs shows the resulting clusterings of the syllabic values. It
                    is the clusterings of the syllabic values that determine how the sites will
                    cluster; because of the focus on how the syllabaries of these sites compare and
                    relate to one another, the focus in this work is on the trees and clusterings of
                    the sites themselves.</p>
                <p>Compared to the results of the analysis on the unfiltered data, the results of
                    the filtered data (to exclude Assur, any values that occur at only one site, or
                    hapax syllabic values, and syllabic values that occur at all sites, or
                    ubiquitous syllabic values) appear different. The results of this analysis
                    indicate that Eshnunna, Adab, Gasur, Tutub and Kish are distinct from Nabada,
                    Ebla, Mari, and Tuttul, the four sites in Syria. This suggests that there is a
                    stronger geographically driven pattern in the data than the phylogenetic
                    estimation originally seemed to indicate. </p>
                <p>A bootstrap resampling technique was run on the results of the hierarchical
                    clustering on the filtered dataset (Figure 8) using the package pvclust with a
                    Manhattan distance method and a Ward D2 cluster method (the same methods used in
                    the hierarchical clustering). This package provides two types of p-values: AU
                    (Approximately Unbiased) p-value and BP (Bootstrap Probability) value. AU
                    p-value, which is computed by multiscale bootstrap resampling, is a better
                    approximation to unbiased p-value than BP value computed by normal bootstrap
                    resampling <ptr target="#suzuki2014" loc="4"/>. The clusters in the tree that
                    group the Syrian syllabaries and the Mesopotamian syllabaries together are
                    strongly supported by the data, having AU p-values of 93% and 94%,
                        respectively.<note> Clusters with a p-value of 95% or higher are considered
                        to be very strong, while p-values higher than 90% are considered strong <ptr
                            target="#suzuki2014" loc="6"/>.</note> The partitions grouping Mari and
                    Tuttul together and Ebla and Nabada are supported by the data, though less
                    strongly, with AU p-values of 83% and 86% respectively. The grouping of the
                    Mesopotamian syllabaries is less strongly supported by the data (the Kish and
                    Gasur cluster has an AU p-value of 69%; the Adab, Eshnunna, and Tutub cluster
                    has an AU p-value of 71%; and the Eshnunna and Tutub cluster has an AU p-value
                    of 73%). Overall, these support values suggest that the results of this analysis
                    are supported by the data, and suggest very close affinities between the Syrian
                    syllabaries of Ebla, Nabada, Mari, and Tuttul. The data also strongly support a
                    grouping of the Mesopotamian syllabaries.</p>

                    analyzing multivariate data <ptr target="#wold1987" loc="37"/>. It uses linear
                    algebra to take a very high-dimensional space (in this case, a 326-dimensional
                    space because of the 326 data points, or syllabic values) and projects it into a
                    two-dimensional space. An analysis using PCA always begins with a data table
                    whose rows are termed <soCalled>objects</soCalled> and whose columns are termed
                        <soCalled>variables.</soCalled> By analyzing the data points within this
                    data table, one can accomplish one or several common goals: data reduction or
                    simplification; data modeling; outlier detection; variable selection;
                    classification; prediction; or unmixing <ptr target="#wold1987" loc="38"/>. The
                    primary goals of using PCA against the dataset in this study are to determine
                    outliers and select variables. To address these goals, PCA rotates the axes of
                    the data table in order to find the two axes that represent the most variation,
                    or principal components, within the data. In other words, PCA finds the set of
                    variables that explain the most variance found in the dataset. These variables,
                    or syllabic values in this case, can then be further examined using
                    complementary techniques if desired. </p>

                            component, which can be attributed to the number of syllabic values
                            attested at each site, is driving the observed variation: the large
                            number of hapax syllabic values attested at Ebla (the first principal
                            component) and the lack of sufficient data at Assur (the second
                            principal component) are driving the observed variation.</head>

                    <p>The principal component analysis on the unfiltered dataset (Figure 9a) shows
                        that approximately 25% of the variation in this dataset can be attributed to
                        the first principal component; this component accounts for significantly
                        more variation than the subsequent principal components, which account for
                        between 15% and 5% of variation in the dataset. By plotting the first
                        principal component against the second principal component (Figure 9b), it
                        becomes clear that the first principal component can be characterised by
                        Ebla and Assur being outliers on either end of the spectrum. This suggests
                        that the primary factor driving the results of the principal component
                        analysis on the unfiltered dataset is the number of syllabic values attested
                        at each site within the dataset; further, the large number of hapax syllabic
                        values attested at Ebla and the lack of sufficient data at Assur are the
                        significant factors influencing the first principal component.</p>

                        the filtered dataset reveal that the first three components account for
                        nearly half of the total observed variance; only those three principal
                        components will be examined further. Plotting these principal components can
                        provide a clearer picture of the patterns: the first two principal
                        components can be attributed to geographic and temporal variation between

                    <p>The results of the principal component analysis on the filtered dataset

                        and Ebla (the sites in Syria, plotted in blue) cluster together on the
                        right-hand side. These results mirror the trend observed in the heatmap in
                        Figure 7b and seem to indicate that geography can explain the first
                        principal component, which accounts for almost 20% of the variation observed
                        in the filtered dataset.</p>
                    <p>The second principal component (Figure 12, plotted along the x-axis), which
                        accounts for 15% of the variation observed in the filtered dataset, shows
                        that Mari and Tuttul, and to a lesser extent Adab, are outliers, while
                        showing the other sites cluster together. This pattern can be attributed to
                        the temporal variation in the corpora examined: the syllabaries of most of
                        the sites examined (Ebla, Nabada, Kish, Eshnunna, Tutub, Assur, and Gasur)
                        are derived from texts dating from the Old Akkadian period (ca. 2350-2200
                        BC), designated with a circular plot. The texts from Adab included in this
                        study date from both the Old Akkadian period and from the Ur III period (ca.
                        2100-2000 BC), designated with a square plot; from Mari, they date to the Ur
                        III (or Shakkanakku) period, designated with a diamond-shaped plot; and from
                        Tuttul, they date from the Early Old Babylonian period (ca. 2000-1900 BC),
                        designated with a triangular plot.</p>
                    <p>The third principal component (Figure 12, plotted along the y-axis) displays
                        no apparent pattern. Nabada and Gasur lie in opposition to Tutub, while the
                        other sites are distributed evenly between them. This principal component is
                        included as a point of comparison, and demonstrates that random similarity
                        in the data can contribute to the results of this type of analysis; it is
                        only with further inspection that the significance of the results of PCA can
                        be verified and qualified.</p>

                    <p>These three analytical tools help us visualize the data in different ways.
                        They organize the data according to similarities and differences, and can
                        isolate key data points that influence the results. These techniques can
                        prompt us to think about our data in new ways, and helps us interpret the
                        results based on our knowledge of the historical and linguistic realities of
                        the period.</p>
                    <p>The results of the analyses on the unfiltered, or original, dataset suggest
                        that the driving factor behind the variation in the unfiltered dataset is
                        the number of syllabic values attested at each site. The principal component
                        analysis on this dataset reveals that Ebla and Assur are outliers on either
                        end of the spectrum within the first principal component: the large number
                        of hapax syllabic values attested at Ebla and the lack of sufficient data at
                        Assur are the significant factors influencing the first principal component.
                        A closer examination of the hapax syllabic values reveals that these
                        variables may be indicators of dialectical variation.<note> This is explored
                            further in a forthcoming publication <ptr target="#hawkinsnd"
                        />.</note></p>
                    <p>The results of these analyses on the filtered dataset suggest that
                        geographic, temporal, and random variation are driving the observed
                        variation within the filtered dataset. The relevant syllabic values from the
                        Syrian corpora identified through the principal component analysis can then
                        be examined further: the lexical items that were collected in the sign
                        studies of the Syrian corpora are used to further interpret the results of
                        the computational analyses using traditional linguistic and text-analysis
                        techniques. </p>
                    <p>The application of statistical and computational models to this dataset has
                        demonstrated that a close examination of syllabaries can reveal new insights
                        and confirm previous assumptions about the nature of the relationships
                        between sites that use this syllabic writing system. While similarities
                        between syllabaries during particular periods or within particular regions
                        may have been assumed to exist, this methodology proves that these trends
                        are both clearly present and strongly supported by the data. </p>

                <head>8. Interpretation of the results of the computational analysis </head>
                <p>The results of the computational models on the unfiltered dataset indicate that
                    the primary and secondary driving factors (the first and second principal
                    components) can be attributed to geography and time. The interpretation of the
                    third principal component is less clear, but is presented here as a point of
                    comparison with the first two principal components. The syllabic values that
                    most significantly influence the variation in the data, as identified through
                    the first three principal components, will be presented and discussed here.</p>
                <p>Tables 4-6 outline the most influential syllabic values of the top three
                    principal components and provides their respective loadings, or weights. In
                    multivariate space — or within datasets that have multiple variables — the
                    correlation between the principal components and the original variables is
                    called the component loadings. The component loadings are indicative of how much
                    of the total variation can be attributed to a given variable; in other words,
                    the higher the component loading is, the more important that variable is for
                    that component. For this reason, only syllabic values with loadings greater than
                    a particular threshold are considered further. The threshold varies for each
                    principal component, and is determined visually based on the graphs in Figures
                    14, 16, and 18 (for the first, second, and third principal components,
                    respectively). </p>

                        site) cluster together on the left-hand side, while Mari, Tuttul, Nabada,

                    <p>The second principal component (Figure 12, plotted along the x-axis), which
                        accounts for 15% of the variation observed in the filtered dataset, shows
                        that Mari and Tuttul, and to a lesser extent Adab, are outliers, while shows
                        the other sites cluster together. This pattern can be attributed to the
                        temporal variation in the corpora examined: the syllabaries of most of the
                        sites examined (Ebla, Nabada, Kish, Eshnunna, Tutub, Assur, and Gasur) are
                        derived from texts dating from the Old Akkadian period (ca. 2350-2200 BC),
                        designated with a circular plot. The texts from Adab included in this study
                        date from both the Old Akkadian period and from the Ur III period (ca.
                        2100-2000 BC), designated with a square plot; from Mari, they date to the Ur
                        III (or Shakkanakku) period, designated with a diamond-shaped plot; and from
                        Tuttul, they date from the Early Old Babylonian period (ca. 2000-1900 BC),
                        designated with a triangular plot.</p>

                <head>9. Summary of results</head>
                <p>A close study of the syllabaries used at individual sites produces an informative
                    dataset; when analyzed using a number of complementary techniques, this dataset
                    can reveal new insights and confirm previous assumptions about the nature of the
                    relationships between sites that use the syllabic sub-system within the
                    cuneiform writing system. While similarities between syllabaries during
                    particular periods or within particular regions may have been assumed to exist,
                    this methodology proves that these trends are both clearly present and strongly
                    supported by the data. </p>
                <p>The three computational techniques applied to this data set produced similar
                    general results: (1) Ebla is an outlier; (2) the Mesopotamian sites tend to
                    cluster together more closely; and (3) the Syrian sites cluster. The concurrence
                    in the results of these methods strongly suggests that there is indeed variation
                    between the syllabaries of the ten sites examined, and that that variation is
                    not simply random. </p>
                <p>The results of the principal component analysis on the unfiltered dataset suggest
                    that the driving factor behind the variation in the unfiltered dataset is the
                    number of syllabic values attested at each site. The principal component
                    analysis on this dataset reveals that Ebla and Assur are outliers on either end
                    of the spectrum within the first principal component: the large number of hapax
                    syllabic values attested at Ebla and the lack of sufficient data at Assur are
                    the significant factors influencing the first principal component. The results
                    of the principal component analysis on the filtered dataset suggest that
                    geographic, temporal, and undeterminable variation are driving the observed
                    variation within the filtered dataset. </p>
                <p>By describing and comparing the most important syllabic values behind the
                    principal components, it became apparent that dialectical variation is likely
                    another driving factor behind the variation observed<note> This is explored
                        further in the forthcoming publication of my doctoral dissertation <ptr
                            target="#hawkinsnd"/>).</note>. This factor is most significantly
                    observed in the unfiltered dataset due to the relatively large number of hapax
                    syllabic values attested at Syrian sites.</p>
                <p>No similar studies into the variation of sign values used at individual sites has
                    been conducted for any region or period in Mesopotamia, so it was not expected
                    that such significant variation could be observed among the syllabic values used
                    at these sites. However, it is not unexpected that this variation is associated
                    with geography and time period, although the strength of the association is
                    indeed unanticipated and has implications for the utility of these methods in
                    other studies of script and dialect variation in both ancient Mesopotamia and
                    other ancient and modern societies. </p>

                <div>
                    <head>10.1 Methodology</head>
                    <p>The use of complementary techniques, such as digital and computational
                        methods, to aid in the study of early scripts and cultures is a relatively
                        new enterprise. Near Eastern archaeologists have been using complementary
                        methods for some time, but most scholars of ancient texts and languages have
                        only recently begun to appreciate the utility of more advanced computational
                        modeling to help visualize and interpret data. As it stands, there are
                        several projects that aim to digitize significant numbers of cuneiform texts
                        for such analysis, and this first step of database compilation is indeed
                        necessary before further analysis can be conducted. Now that these databases
                        are in advanced stages of completion, the data can be visualized and
                        interpreted using more advanced computational modeling in order to answer
                        questions, which require data too extensive to be answered by examining
                        these texts by hand, about the language, culture, economy, and history of
                        early complex societies. Perhaps most relevantly, these methods will also be
                        readily applicable to other fields in the humanities and social
                        sciences.</p>
                    <p>In this study, computational techniques were used to understand and visualize
                        how the ancient Mesopotamian cuneiform script spread and was adapted across
                        modern-day Iraq and Syria in the late third millennium BCE. A dataset was
                        curated of cuneiform sign values used to write Semitic words written on
                        tablets excavated from key geographic sites and used computational
                        techniques, including dimensionality reduction and clustering methods, to
                        achieve a broad view analysis of the curated data. These results directed
                        further inquiry, in which philological approaches were used to examine and
                        describe the linguistic environments in which each significant value was
                        attested. </p>
                    <p>This investigation into early cuneiform syllabaries has demonstrated the
                        advantages of using computational methods of analysis on humanities data. It
                        also highlighted the relative strengths and weaknesses of different methods
                        of analysis on this type of data: the results of the hierarchical clustering
                        and PCA were able to provide a more detailed and accurate analysis of the
                        data than the phylogenetic estimation method was. The results of this study
                        help in understanding the broad view of cuneiform script spread and
                        adaptation; however, there are ways such a study could be more rigorous. For
                        example, it would be preferable to use the encoded cuneiform signs as the
                        input data instead of using reconstructed syllabic sign values, since the
                        step of interpreting each sign value may introduce additional human error.
                        Currently, however, there is not a readily usable infrastructure to do this.
                        The curation of a digital database of cuneiform signs, encoded in Unicode,
                        along with all possible sign values for each region and time period would be
                        beneficial to this and other types of studies. Ongoing efforts by the
                        Unicode consortium have so far developed fonts for the following script
                        forms: Proto-Cuneiform (late fourth millennium BC), Early Dynastic cuneiform
                        (first half of the third millennium BC), and Neo-Assyrian cuneiform (first
                        half of the first millennium BC), but regional or site-specific variations
                        are not yet included.</p>

                    <head>10.2 Assyriological Implications</head>
                    <p>The advancement of digital tools to answer questions in the humanities is
                        indeed an exciting prospect for the study of the ancient Near East, a field
                        whose progress has long been hampered by the destruction of cultural
                        heritage and political turmoil in Iraq and Syria. With the use of new
                        methods and technologies, advancement in the field is not only possible, but
                        will likely produce fruitful and interesting results that will bring
                        Assyriology into the forefront of digital humanities scholarship.</p>
                    <p>This study attempts to give a broader view of the spread and adaptation of
                        cuneiform across a large geographic area as opposed to examining each site
                        individually as an isolated case. Furthermore, a complete, comprehensive
                        syllabary allows us to determine whether an experimental phase in the
                        writing system occurred at each site. The presence of this sort of
                        experimentation helps us ascertain whether the cuneiform script was fully
                        adopted by each city in Syria, inclusive of all its orthographic tendencies,
                        or whether each city’s writing system underwent a phase of experimentation
                        to create a slightly different result. Preliminary evidence suggests that
                        there were clear deviations in the syllabaries of Syria from normative
                        Mesopotamian cuneiform, which indicates that scribes experimented with the
                        writing system more during this period than during later periods. Precisely
                        what this can tell us about the linguistic nature of third millennium Syria
                        should be examined through further study. </p>
                    <p>The adaptation and use of cuneiform in Syria provides an interesting case
                        study for examining how people interacted with logosyllabic and syllabic
                        writing systems. The preliminary evidence suggests that in the third
                        millennium, particularly at sites farther away from the control of the
                        Mesopotamian core cities, scribes were more innovative in their adaptation
                        and use of syllabic values; there are clear deviations in the Akkadian
                        syllabaries of Syria from normative Mesopotamian cuneiform, and also
                        inconsistencies in the sign values and number of signs used syllabically
                        across each of the sites investigated. This suggests that, while there must
                        have been a more prescriptive educational approach to learning the cuneiform
                        signs themselves and their Sumerian values, during this time period a
                        prescribed method of writing and adapting cuneiform to write Akkadian was
                        not included in the scribal curriculum. This lead to different adaptations
                        of the cuneiform script and to slight variations in the number, types, and
                        values of syllabic signs used in the individual syllabaries from sites in
                        Syria.</p>

                <p>This preliminary investigation into early cuneiform syllabaries has demonstrated
                    the strengths of data mining and computational methods of analysis. These
                    methodologies can be readily expanded and adapted to related and un-related
                    areas of research within the field of Assyriology; four such areas are outlined
                    below.</p>

                    <head>11.1 A more comprehensive investigation into third millennium
                        Akkadian</head>
                    <p>This project could readily be expanded to include the corpora from all sites
                        that produced cuneiform texts in the third millennium. This would have
                        comprised 19 sites in total, including the ten that compose that data
                        sources for this thesis. The additional nine sites include: Nagar, Shehna /
                        Shubat-Enlil, Umma, Shuruppak, Abu Salabikh, Nippur, Girsu, Umm al-Jir, and
                        Susa. As was explained in the introduction of this thesis, many of these
                        sites were unable to be included as a part of the current work for a number
                        of practical reasons: (1) inaccessibility to the tablets due to their
                        location in museums in Syria, Iraq, or Turkey; (2) a lack of published
                        photographs, hand drawings, or transliterations and transcriptions of the
                        inaccessible texts; and (3) irrelevance of the texts to this study of the
                        adaptation of cuneiform to write Semitic languages (in the case of Susa).
                        Going forward, it would be possible to expand and update this syllabary to
                        include the orthography of each sign, either in all cases, or, more likely
                        at first, just in the cases where they obviously appear to differ
                        drastically. In the process of its expansion, the syllabary can then be
                        digitized to create a free and easily accessible database.</p>

                    <p>Another application of this methodology would be to examine the development
                        of the East Semitic dialects across the entire history of the cuneiform
                            script<note> One of the two prominent languages recorded in these
                            documents was Akkadian – which is, in fact, not a single language but an
                            umbrella term for a series of closely related Semitic dialects that were
                            written and spoken primarily in the regions of modern-day Iraq, Syria,
                            and Turkey from around 2500 BC until 70 AD <ptr target="#cooper1996"
                                loc="37"/>. The Akkadian dialects, along with their relative
                            Eblaite, form the entirety of the eastern branch of the Semitic language
                            family.</note>. The wealth of written sources left behind by the
                        cuneiform cultures comprise a unique and comprehensive data set through
                        which we can understand the history and development of these dialects. These
                        developments and relationships have been determined largely through a
                        combination of textual analysis and the comparative method <ptr

                        data can provide new insights into the evolution and spread of these
                            dialects<note> The data of this study would consist of the Swadesh

                    <p>The methodology used in this thesis has significant potential to be
                        informative and relevant not only for this project, but for other
                        Assyriological research projects as well. A thorough grasp on phylogenetic
                        analysis programs such as MacClade, Mesquite, and PAUP* in addition to the
                        programming languages R, Python, and Perl can enable researchers to build
                        custom code and pipelines specifically for the analysis of syllabaries,
                        orthographies, or other aspects of the cuneiform script. In terms of future
                        research, this will be particularly useful in identifying the definitive
                        syllabaries and sign lists for early phases of the cuneiform script – such
                        as Uruk and Ur III sign lists – as well as for little-understood relatives
                        to the cuneiform writing system, such as Proto-Elamite.</p>

                    <p>The methodology used here has the potential to aid in providing provenance to
                        looted or misplaced tablets. To do this, a much larger dataset is required.
                        In particular, a large collection of digitized texts with adequate encoding
                        of the class of each sign (i.e., syllabic, logographic, determinative,
                        etc.). This dataset can rely largely on the texts published on the CDLI
                        database; computational methods could then be employed to identify the class
                        of the majority of signs attested in most time periods and genres. Once this
                        dataset is collected, principal component analysis can aid in the
                        identification of the distinctive signs or combinations of signs that, when
                        present, suggest a specific provenance. </p>
