                  <p>The Digital Humanities and Literary Cognition (DHLC) lab at Michigan State
                     University was founded in 2012 with the mission of bringing together scholars
                     from disciplines including literature, neuroscience, education, computer
                     science, and digital humanities to investigate the cognitive processes involved
                     in reading texts of all kinds. The real story is much more complicated: emerging
                     through a combination of institutional risk-taking and serendipitous accident,
                     the lab was — and remains — an example of how conventional definitions of a
                     “laboratory,” and particularly the rather fraught label
                     of “humanities lab,” often come short of capturing the true
                     cross-disciplinary nature of this type of work. More than any academic or
                     methodological template, the DHLC lab emerged through the curiosity and
                     enthusiasm of the students who inhabit it. For that reason, this case study — a
                     brief history of the DHLC’s development, cultural practices, and ongoing work —
                     has been written collaboratively with multiple voices, including the lab
                     director (Natalie Phillips) and the student researchers. Together, we describe
                     the challenges and opportunities created by embarking on a radically
                     interdisciplinary research effort. We report the elements that enabled the DHLC
                     lab to find success through a willingness to abandon expectations and adapt to
                     rapidly evolving research practices, while maintaining our core focus on the
                     humanities. We hope this case study proves useful for those who, like us, seek
                     to explore the vast potential of interdisciplinary lab space for DH practice,
                     the pedagogical benefits of collaborative research, and how to prioritize
                     humanities in a STEM-focused world.

                        Michigan State University (MSU) emerged not through top-down strategic
                        planning, but through a combination of university proactivity and
                        serendipitous accident, with an emphasis on the latter.<a class="noteRef" href="#d4e292">[1]</a> It emerged organically from
                        interactions between me and excited students, newly interested MSU
                        colleagues, collaborators from Duke and Stanford... and at times, people who
                        just happened to be walking by and came in. This odd beginning is precisely
                        what makes our lab such an interesting case study, similar to the
                        development of other humanities labs [<a class="ref" href="#breithaupt2017">Breithaupt 2017</a>]. One
                        common way to approach building such a lab — a trend you might say — is by
                        creating a digital scholarship or digital humanities center, a space devoted
                        to supporting as many different fields, departments, and faculty as
                        possible: building websites, “provid[ing] a support
                        mechanism for the growing areas of e-research and digital
                        scholarship,” and facilitating the use of big, expensive pieces
                        of technology (or even better, the analysis of “big
                        data”) [<a class="ref" href="#lippincott2014">Lippincott 2014</a>]. We have a version of this
                        at MSU, the <a href="http://digitalscholarshiplab.msu.edu/" onclick="window.open('http://digitalscholarshiplab.msu.edu/'); return false" class="ref">Digital
                           Scholarship Lab</a>, and it’s amazing. That’s not quite what we do. I
                        can run an MRI and conduct advanced brain imaging, but I can’t build a
                        website to save my life, so I’m glad that others aren’t relying on me or the
                        lab to do this type of DH. Instead, the DHLC began with a specific research
                        question about close reading and literary neuroscience. Now, we design and
                        run a variety of new experiments, opening up the space for ever-growing
                        grassroots engagement with others across campus and with our
                        community.</span></div>

                  <div class="ptext" id="p2"><span class="hi italic">In 2012, the lab wasn’t what most would call a
                        “lab.” One day, I was working with three students —
                        one from English, one from education, one from neuroscience — at a table
                        we’d dragged from a supply closet. Clustered over our laptops, we were so
                        focused we scarcely looked up as a team of technicians walked in and began
                        installing computers around us. For a DH lab, the moment when the technology
                        appears is normally a glorious occasion; looking back, I can see why the
                        arrival of these computers wasn’t treated with the usual tech-centric
                        revelry. The actual lab was already there — in full swing, fueled by the
                        energy being brought by everyone around the table. The lab was the students,
                        the people. And with them, we got momentum, a combination of student energy
                        and brilliance that would propel us for the next seven years.</span></div>

                  <div class="ptext" id="p3"><span class="hi italic">It’s the energy of the people in the lab that sustains me as I
                        navigate the balance of my own work and these new fields we’re engaging. I’m
                        an eighteenth centuryist who gets excited about Margaret Cavendish’s
                        seventeenth-century jokes about the brain, and I also put (willing!)
                        students in brain scanners to see if we can learn more about the cognitive
                        intricacy and uniqueness of reading literature. Fortunately, I work
                        alongside equally interdisciplinary folks. The computer scientist who helped
                        us code our sonnet study at MSU loves poetry so much he actually memorizes
                        it, down to the punctuation (you should hear him recite Whitman or Keats).
                        My co-lead on our music study was a major in violin before he switched to
                        computer science; only later did he jump to cognitive science, focusing on
                        rhythm and music. This sort of interdisciplinary work is not without its
                        limits. As Urszula Pawlicka points out with Bruno Latour, just the name
                        “humanities lab” risks assuming an ideologically
                        dangerous “scientification of the humanities.” If
                        the laboratory is “a place that has been socially
                        constructed so as to project the mythos of science onto the world
                        outside its walls,” she writes, “then
                        humanities laboratories may begin by borrowing the foreign glamour of
                        science and end by reproducing its ideological parochialisms”
                        [<a class="ref" href="#pawlicka2017">Pawlicka 2017</a>, 527]. Rather than remaining naïve to such
                        challenges, our lab — with over thirty students from across disciplines —
                        tackles them head-on in an ongoing, energetic attempt to demonstrate that
                        one can do work that cuts across both humanities and sciences without caving
                        to reductionism and instead centering our humanist commitments. We have not
                        given in to an “interdisciplinary delusion” but seek to
                        model the pluralism of true cross-disciplinary work, with all the
                        multiplicity it entails [<a class="ref" href="#kramnick2018">Kramnick                 2018</a>]. This is why we are
                        writing this case study — and why we have chosen to tell it collectively.
                        The only way to tell this story is to have students write as well, as equal
                        collaborators and researchers who have made the lab what it is
                        today.</span></div>

                  <div class="ptext" id="p4">The sounds of the lab on any given day include the clack of typing, the light
                     squeak of pen against dry-erase board, and music — live streaming everything
                     from classical to indie-rock (one undergrad lab lead’s favorite band is Rainbow
                     Kitten Surprise). Academic conversations about our latest lab project on music
                     and narrative intermix with light cursing over how to change font size in
                     E-Prime (the requisite software for taking our poetry study to fMRI). It’s a
                     space for kvetching about grad school applications. Most importantly, it’s a
                     space for laughter, be it a fierce debate on whether the lab’s next event will
                     be an escape room or laser tag, or an equally fierce argument over whose
                     favorite candy is actually disgusting. Entering the lab means joining a warm,
                     rich, chaotic space full of work, odd debates, and enjoyment. The collegial and
                     even goofy atmosphere of the lab is not a weakness — if anything, it energizes
                     our work and makes it more generative. This is our kind of
                     interdisciplinarity.

                  <div class="ptext" id="p5">One of the real strengths of an interdisciplinary and comparatively young field
                     like digital humanities is the sheer amount of experimentation and invention
                     that digital humanists engage in on a daily basis. We have to, because the work
                     we do is often the first of its kind. We can’t help but be cutting-edge, unique,
                     and integrative, because we have limited models to draw from in terms of
                     literary neuroscience. Even as digital humanities labs at prestigious
                     universities such as Stanford, MIT, and CUNY have become well established, there
                     remain many interdisciplinary areas (i.e. literary cognition) that are only just
                     starting to be explored. As the field continues to grow and mature, however, we
                     have the opportunity to build on one another’s wisdom, to create new models and
                     best practices for present and future digital humanities scholars to follow.

                     copy. There is no formula for how to create your own cutting-edge humanities lab
                     — such a thing does not exist, because the most effective labs and programs
                     build on the specific strengths of a given community. Instead, the following
                     case study it is an exploration of one lab, our Digital Humanities and Literary
                     Cognition (DHLC) lab, with a discussion of some of the approaches and strategies
                     we used to create it. In our current moment when the question is shifting from
                     whether or not to have humanities labs to how those labs should operate in more
                     inclusive, equitable, and sustainable ways, our experiences in the DHLC offer
                     some practices for those working in labs old, new, and yet to be. As you read
                     the specifics of how the DHLC works and why we set it up that way, we invite you
                     to imagine yourself and your own situation — to dream of what your own lab could
                     be.

                  <div class="ptext" id="p7">The Digital Humanities and Literary Cognition (DHLC) lab was founded in 2012. Its
                     first seven years provide a powerful and unique case study that reveals what
                     interdisciplinary work in DH can be, including points of promise and innovation,
                     points of disciplinary tension and translation, and most importantly, lessons
                     that point to the power of actively involving students in a humanities lab. At
                     its core, the DHLC’s mission is to understand how humans think in and through
                     genres of literary art. In other words, we want to understand the intertwined
                     cognitive, neurological, emotional, and cultural processes by which we engage
                     with art, relate to it, and use it to make sense of ourselves. We call our
                     research in cognitive and digital humanities “literary
                     neuroscience,” a phrase that captures how such work could never be
                     just one or the other, just humanities or just science.

                  <div class="ptext" id="p8">In 1959, C.P. Snow famously described the humanities and sciences as “two cultures” separated by a “gap” of “mutual incomprehension.” It
                     seemed the two were unable to communicate, and the increasingly siloed nature of
                     disciplinary knowledge throughout the twentieth century did little to help. The
                     present situation is a paradox. As many institutions call for interdisciplinary
                     scholarship and teaching, arts and humanities programs continue to be defunded
                     [<a class="ref" href="#wythoff2018">Wythoff 2018</a>]. In this cultural moment, interdisciplinary
                     labs like the DHLC have a vital role to play by communicating across the
                     humanities and sciences, translating the value of the humanities, and in
                     particular, championing the critical perspective that the humanities

                  <div class="ptext" id="p9">The DHLC works hard to be a truly interdisciplinary space — we actively integrate
                     methodologies, approaches, and scholars from different disciplines on equal
                     footing. As one example, we always insist on capturing both qualitative and
                     quantitative data whenever we design experiments, and we further ensure that our
                     qualitative data includes space for narrative. The stories and reflections of
                     our study participants are as important as the numbers on an aesthetic pleasure
                     scale, and our student researchers specializing in both humanistic and
                     scientific methods work directly with each other in small groups to analyze the
                     data in tandem. In this way we bring together the strengths of both sciences and
                     humanities, which gives us a richer set of data that enables us to talk to
                     people in different fields in their own languages and concepts.

                     lost in the sauce, so we try to keep our day-to-day research practices in
                     perspective. Walking into the DHLC means walking into a space enclosed by the
                     usual four walls, one of which is a window that stretches from floor to ceiling,
                     offering a gorgeous view of trees and the occasional sunset. Double layered,
                     bright green blinds — technologically advanced to move with the changing
                     daylight, yet broken beyond comprehension — seem to have a mind of their own and
                     close and open over the window randomly, making temperature regulation uniquely
                     difficult. To counteract this, we have an ancient box fan, named “Fanny” after the protagonist of <cite class="title italic">Mansfield Park</cite>. Eight state-of-the-art computers for processing MRI
                     data, DH visualizations, and project results line two walls, and tables are
                     littered with brightly colored sticky notes that range from complex mathematical
                     equations to single words like “gender?!?” There are
                     four different styles of chairs, ranging from the foldable to the “spinny” chairs that allow for a dramatic turn to listen
                     to someone talking. A portrait of Jane Austen looks over the lab, observing the
                     years of inside jokes written around the room. Most importantly, this physical
                     room we call our lab — the DHLC — not only brings together students from
                     English, Psychology, Neuroscience, Computer Science, Rhetoric, Business, and
                     Art; it creates unique points of contact between them. Neuroscience students
                     read poetry, debate Austen’s irony, and listen to excerpts of orchestral music.
                     Scholars of literature and psychology work together on interdisciplinary fMRI
                     experiment design while artists join computer scientists to develop new digital
                     tools for making art accessible across museum spaces, digital platforms, and
                     coffee shops. There are not many places where a freshman undergrad in political
                     science can talk literary cognition theory with a 5th year English PhD, or where
                     you find professors taking careful notes about sophomores and seniors’ latest
                     project insights. But this is what it means to be at the DHLC.

                  <div class="ptext" id="p11">Our lab has never adhered to traditional hierarchies, and we actively cultivate a
                     lab culture that resists the neoliberal, top-down power structures of the
                     contemporary university [<a class="ref" href="#lothian2013">Lothian 2013</a>]
                     [<a class="ref" href="#mann2019">Mann 2019</a>]. We have a PI and lab leads, but these roles are more
                     administrative than anything else. Questions, ideas, answers, and new directions
                     can, should, and do come from everyone (including new researchers bringing fresh
                     perspective to our projects), such that it can be easy to forget who is an
                     undergraduate student, who is a graduate student, and who is a faculty member.
                     Our PI specifically goes by “Natalie” in the lab as one way
                     to emphasize our non-hierarchical structure. No one asks your rank when you walk
                     into a lab meeting, nor offers their own; instead, anyone might suggest where
                     you can jump in on the latest spreadsheet or data sorting. Our
                     interdisciplinarity supports this setup, because we recognize that each of our
                     members brings a different set of skills and experiences to the lab. Strict
                     hierarchies simply do not make sense when a third-year student might be the
                     expert on a piece of software, a first-year student might be trained in fMRI, a
                     graduate student might have a music theory background, a faculty member might
                     have several successful grants under her belt, and a fourth-year student might
                     have actually run participants in a particular study. We help each other
                     communicate across these many fields and experiences by holding workshops during
                     our regular meetings where researchers will introduce each other to particular
                     concepts, theories, methods, or software and discuss how to best incorporate
                     that knowledge in our studies. In essence, we all do the work, we all have
                     different roles to play, and we could not possibly do all that the lab does if
                     we assumed that any of those roles is more prestigious or more important.

                     art is certainly a tall order. We “manage” it in the lab —
                     day by day and project by project — by relying on an open system and a
                     question-led approach, rather than an institutionally-designed order. This model
                     brings with it particular affordances and limitations. It requires maintaining
                     an open lab space in collaboration with student researchers and project leads
                     while also ensuring secure storage for study participants’ data. It relies
                     heavily on the energy and guidance of both the PI and the lab leads. It invites
                     students from all kinds of disciplines who never dreamed of being part of a lab
                     to join in the work of creating knowledge. It means that projects are abandoned
                     partway through, or unnecessarily redone, or go in three directions at once; it
                     also leads to astonishing breakthroughs. It loses some portion of institutional
                     knowledge with every student researcher’s graduation. It can also feel
                     overwhelming especially for new lab members, so we introduce new researchers to
                     the lab’s projects one at a time in order to help them learn about the projects,
                     navigate the IRB process, and let them choose where and how they want to
                     participate according to their interests and availability. It means keeping in
                     regular contact with weekly meetings for the different projects, with constant
                     reminders to take breaks and step back from the work in order to take care of
                     ourselves and each other. And, crucially, it must ensure that all researchers
                     (especially students!) are compensated and credited for their work in the forms
                     of hourly pay, presentations at conferences, and authorship on lab publications.
                     All of this continues to successfully sustain the lab after eight years with
                     minimal advertising (mostly by word of mouth in classes) because it draws people
                     in and gives them the space to explore their own research practices.

                     projects present broad semester goals. At the same time, if any group members
                     come up with a hypothesis, they are given a semester or two to play around with
                     the new approach. If the research idea seems sustainable, it becomes a long-term
                     project and is incorporated into a future beginning-of-semester goal
                     presentation. If not, we store detailed notes on the process in a “research questions” document for future reference. For
                     example, one of the undergraduate researchers got so excited about metaphors
                     that he spent a full semester mapping how often participants highlighted
                     metaphors and how tangible, familiar, or cliché the metaphors were. Although
                     this got stored away for a year, it turns out that it will be absolutely pivotal

                     tools that range from computational software for analyzing brain data and
                     patterns in neural activation (FSL), text analysis tools such as Voyant and

                     in how digital tools blend the virtual and physical. Depending on the day and
                     number of computers, we use Skype, Zoom, or Google Hangouts, we write and edit
                     on Google Drive, and we communicate in almost twenty Slack channels for
                     different projects, though most researchers are active primarily in the few
                     related to their chosen projects. In the image above, a lost-in-sauce meme

                     York University, The University of Arkansas, Princeton University, and the
                     University of Hong Kong. In these ways, our lab is quite expansive, both

                     a “hybrid space,” something Steve Harrison and Paul Dourish
                     define as a space that “comprises both physical and
                     virtual”
                     [<a class="ref" href="#harrison1996">Harrison 1996</a>, 72]. We experience this physical–digital
                     interplay in the lab daily, in embodied interactions that are “framed simultaneously by the physical space, the virtual space
                     and the relationship between the two”
                     [<a class="ref" href="#harrison1996">Harrison 1996</a>, 72]. Interdisciplinary work in the lab
                     involves bridging not only disciplines but also places and practices, and how we
                     conduct research is in many ways defined and delimited by both physical and
                     virtual spaces (see Figure 2). For instance, our lab is located at Michigan
                     State University (MSU). Most of our lab members and participants therefore
                     reflect typical university demographics and range in ages from seventeen to
                     thirty-five. Thus, we constantly remind ourselves when analyzing data that we
                     have a particular group of college students who like coffee and poetry, are
                     interested in $5 Starbucks gift cards to participate in our latest study, and
                     have many other time commitments in their studies, work, and social lives. The
                     lab’s physical space comfortably fits only approximately ten of our thirty lab
                     members at a time. Accessibility measures are also ironically difficult in a lab
                     that intentionally organizes accessible art events — Natalie uses a rolling
                     walker when needed but can’t fit it inside our small space.

                     research involves placing people in circular magnetic tubes. As Joshua Mann
                     notes of digital technologies used to represent the past, nothing about this
                     present technology is “hermeneutically neutral”

                     paperback inside a scanner, so they read a digital rendition of a
                     “page” (or sonnet) at the back of the scanner through a
                     mirror above their eyes, pushing a button or scrolling with a mouse to move
                     through the lines and pages.

                     under their knees, for their elbows, and alongside their head for comfort. In
                     this case, we accept the unique constraints on physical space inside an MRI
                     scanner (we can’t change Radiology...yet), but we use our humanist background to
                     push to the very edges of what’s traditionally allowed to be seen inside a
                     scanner. In a radical humanist departure from MRI tradition, our participants

                     Reading and Attention,” was an fMRI study of the different levels of

                     and pleasure reading [<a class="ref" href="#phillips2010">Phillips 2010</a>]. Eighteen Ph.D. students in
                     English (picked for their literary training) were asked to read the first
                     chapters of Jane Austen’s <cite class="title italic">Mansfield Park</cite> inside an
                     MRI, switching between close reading and pleasure reading at defined sections.
                     Afterward, outside the scanner, they wrote informal literary essays on the
                     sections they’d close read. To our astonishment, they ended up quoting the text
                     extensively from memory [<a class="ref" href="#phillips2015">Phillips 2015</a>]

                     we also began to map the unique patterns of quoting from Mansfield Park,
                     revealing an attraction to tangible and material words in the text and how these
                     mnemonic anchors grounded sophisticated analysis of class dynamics, stylistics,
                     gender roles, and Austen’s irony. Analysis is still ongoing, but this first
                     experiment exemplifies the spontaneity and delightful accident that marks all
                     our projects. In seeking to study the different levels of attention we bring to
                     books, we ended up being the first study of natural reading. Based on an article

                     non-hierarchical structure of our lab is valuable philosophically, politically,
                     and practically. We see the different fields represented in the lab as equally
                     important partners in our work, rather than science chasing humanities or
                     humanities chasing science. In the same vein, the members of our lab are equally
                     important partners in our work, regardless of university rank. Together, these
                     approaches shake up the relationships between fields and between people, giving
                     everyone ownership in what the lab does and reminding us that everyone can and

                        of Austen received naturally led to a second project, “Neuroaesthetics: Poetry and Aesthetic Pleasure.” We moved from
                        novels to poetry, conducting an experiment that emerged organically from a
                        research group centered at NYU on the neural and cognitive dimensions of
                        aesthetic experience. In reality, I was grading papers for a course on the
                        eighteenth-century novel with a friend when an unexpected email arrived from
                        a Dean at NYU declaring she and her colleagues had been following my
                        research and inviting me to join a global collaboration on neuroscience and
                        art. I knew if I wanted to take this on — that is, involve the lab in
                        designing three new experiments on literature, music, and art — I would need
                        to bring the lab with me. I said yes, and boarded a plane to New York… with
                        three students in tow. </span></div>

                        critiques) again and again, gaining the respect of famous scholars in the
                        neuroscience of music, vision, and art. Yet, as we all know, most of the
                        work — and many of the decisions — happens, not in the conference room, but
                        over dinner. During the wining and dining, the students mixed and mingled
                        with enviable ease, picking up comments that would prove invaluable. Had
                        they been virtually present over Skype, all that would have been lost. On
                        our final night, free from the formality of fine dining, we ordered to-go

                        overheard, we dropped all previous expectations and began to design a

                     poems as well as how their pleasure shifted as they read; thus, we asked
                     participants to highlight moments they found aesthetically pleasing and
                     displeasing while reading sonnets. First with pencil and paper, later with red
                     and green highlights on a computer screen, fifty MSU students registered their
                     aesthetic responses when reading a set of sonnets drawn from the early modern
                     period to now. After reading and highlighting, participants were asked to use a
                     provided numerical scale to rate the vividness of imagery, the poem’s positive
                     or negative overall theme, and the intensity of their own emotional response.

                     are stunning similarities in moments people collectively find moving. For
                     example, reading “Dawn in New York,” a sonnet by key
                     Harlem Renaissance writer Claude McKay, 60% of participants single out the
                     description of women and men wandering the streets of Manhattan with “wine-weakened” eyes as particularly aesthetically
                     pleasing [<a class="ref" href="#mckay2019">McKay 2019</a>]. At this point pleasure aligned across
                     readers, revealing an unexpected moment of cognitive and emotional unity.

                     students involved in the poetry study decided to pursue two distinct research

One group (nicknamed “<a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/columnist/2017/03/03/guide-all-those-weird-words-your-teen-uses/98688930/" onclick="window.open('https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/columnist/2017/03/03/guide-all-those-weird-words-your-teen-uses/98688930/'); return false" class="ref">LIT</a>”) is exploring the question of why so many people
                     “like” (or positively highlighted) obviously negative
                     words and phrases.<a class="noteRef" href="#d4e563">[2]</a> They
                     observed, with a wry joy, that participants hadn’t only positively highlighted
                     moments of aesthetic pleasure associated with positive themes (i.e. love,
                     sunrises, hope) but also took pleasure in negative themes (i.e. war and
                     sadness). For instance, participants found poetic beauty in McKay’s “cheerless domes;” similarly, in Michael Ferris’ “The Catskill Eagle,” numerous participants loved the
                     moment where the sonnet describes “rage and wonder battle
                     cruel, and strange”
                     [<a class="ref" href="#ferris2011">Ferris 2011</a>]. The other group became fascinated with the question
                     of the potential differences between how English majors and non-English majors
                     read and enjoy poetry, with a zeal that earned them the group name “Oxford Comma.” Curious about the influence of a
                     literary education on aesthetic pleasure, they decided to design and run another
                     set of experiments. Fueled by coffee and candy from our famously always-full
                     candy pitcher and recently-donated Keurig machine, they ran another
                     approximately thirty psychology majors as participants (see Figure 3).

                     where students notoriously complain that they don’t like poetry because they

                     answer that, we had to be able to see it. We tried bolding words that
                     participants had repeatedly highlighted, but this method couldn’t represent the
                     magnitude of students who loved or hated a phrase. Based on the number of likes
                     we tried changing the font size by statistical increments but the rest of the
                     poem was too small to be read. The best answer we could find was to create a
                     statistical highlighting system where words and phrases got darker and darker,
                     in green for pleasure and red for displeasure, which worked well enough until we
                     reached a point where so many people liked or disliked a word that you could no
                     longer see it. Our lab solution was to just turn that word white (see Figure 4).
                     Fortunately, MSU is invested in DH beyond the lab, and had just created a
                     Digital Scholarship Lab in the library. We reached out with a rough idea in mind
                     to solve the visualization problem and they quickly set us up with someone who
                     knew a technology for heat mapping. Together, their GIS specialist and an
                     English undergrad from the lab solved the problem that we had been staring at
                     for a year using ArcGIS, a geographical mapping software. The result was a
                     heatmap that showed where participants collectively found the most pleasure and
                     displeasure in the sonnets they read. Amusingly, we later returned to the
                     Digital Scholarship Lab as invited presenters, with our co-created poetry heat
                     map on display. The presentation received many excited questions for our
                     innovative use of ArcGIS — a testament to how interdisciplinary scholarship can
                     generate new, often unexpected engagements with digital tools that push our
                     questions and how we answer them further.

                     interactions play in advancing the work that goes on in and beyond the lab.
                     Being in the same physical space allows us to rapidly iterate on experiment
                     design, data analysis, and digital tool development in our studies, responding
                     to theoretical concerns and practical considerations as they emerge. However the
                     poetry study also demonstrates how the physical, the virtual, and the digital
                     are increasingly blurred in an interdisciplinary lab. As our most recent study
                     on music and narrative cognition reveals, online collaboration and digital tools
                     for both communication and community research are just as essential for
                     understanding how we encounter literary art in the twenty-first century.

                        collaboration, as at NYU. Others emerge by serendipitous accident. This was
                        certainly the case for our study on the stories we hear in music. I had gone
                        to Nashville with my fiancé for one of his (many) music cognition
                        conferences. I’d skipped out of most of the talks and spent much of my time
                        exploring the streets of Nashville, with its eccentric restaurants, huge
                        musical billboards, and fabulous collection of old bookstores. But one
                        poster session caught my eye, so I made my way back to the conference,
                        keeping my badge face-down to stay blissfully incognito. As I read over a
                        poster on “close listening” to music, I marveled at the
                        structural similarity to our Austen study’s exploration of close and
                        pleasure reading. All of a sudden, the presenter appeared and said: “Oh my goodness, it’s you!” I swiftly learned she
                        had designed her study at Stanford intentionally building off our previous
                        work. She had tons of questions and I was happy to help, delving into a
                        conversation that lasted far beyond the poster session and carried us down
                        the stairs toward lunch. I saw my fiancé deeply engaged in a conversation
                        about budget practicalities with the new treasurer for the society, and told
                        her we’d need to meet up later, exchanging cards. When she turned to me on
                        the last step and said, “I can’t believe we met. The
                        Brain on Jane!” the acoustics of the space magnified her voice so
                        that (it seemed) the whole room heard. Certainly, my fiance’s conversation
                        about treasury suddenly ended; his companion, Lisa, evidently familiar with
                        our study, promptly turned to me and said, “You’re a
                        cognitive narratologist? There’s something I need you to
                        see.”</span></div>

                     moving to Princeton). She ran a study where she had participants listen to music
                     without words and asked them to describe any story they heard; a surprising
                     number of people did indeed hear a story [<a class="ref" href="#margulis2017">Margulis 2017</a>]. She sat
                     Natalie down and had her read some of the narratives they wrote, many of which
                     were incredibly similar, often sharing the same topics, themes, even specific
                     words. The images she showed Natalie — expanded and extended to represent the
                     full experiment — were to become for us the crucial narrative data to explore
                     convergences (and divergences) in the stories people hear in music. When Natalie
                     got back she called the lab leads together at the DHLC and asked the unaskable
                     question: “I know we have a lot going on at the lab — too
                     much already. I’m tired, you’re tired… still, is it interesting enough for
                     us to run with it anyway?” Everyone was fascinated. And, despite the
                     amount of work we had, it was too interesting to <em class="emph">not</em> work with.

                     ever-accumulating number of collaborators, and a National Science Foundation
                     (NSF) grant, we began to explore whether — particularly how and when — we use
                     narratives to understand music. In other words, when trying to make sense of a
                     new piece of music, do we begin to “hear” stories — or,
                     certain types of stories? How much do the tendencies to construct narratives
                     when listening to music, and to have those narratives align, depend on cultural
                     background? The study itself is deceptively simple: participants listen to a
                     piece of orchestral music and are asked if they imagined a story or elements of
                     a story while listening. If they say yes, they are asked to describe the
                     imagined story in as much detail as possible. The similarities in participant
                     answers were often startling. For example, almost 74% of participants listening
                     to an excerpt of Liszt’s music at U. Arkansas described a “cat-and-mouse story” (see Figure 5).

                     ballroom. Unlike the cat-and-mouse stories, participants listening to Telemann

                     narrative listening studies at U. Arkansas and Michigan State with participants
                     from rural China. In this new cross-cultural version of the study, participants
                     from U. Arkansas, MSU, <em class="emph">and</em> regions of rural China listen to both
                     Chinese and Western music, allowing us to explore if cultural familiarity with a
                     certain musical style affects the likelihood of imagining stories, or the
                     similarity of the stories they tell. Through five iterations of this study, from
                     the original at U. Arkansas to the ongoing research in China, we have data from

                     played for participants on a computer, with participants’ responses stored
                     carefully in coded Excel files. Since our collaboration spans the globe as well
                     as the country, most of our conversations happen online, fitting the trend of
                     increasingly digital scholarly communication [<a class="ref" href="#lopez2015">Lopez 2015</a>].
                     Messages and results wing back and forth between MSU, U. Arkansas, and the U. of
                     Hong Kong. Most often, we use Zoom, Google Hangouts or Skype to create a
                     collaborative, interdisciplinary, and cross-institutional space to allow
                     ethno-musicologists, computational sound-technicians, cognitive musicologists
                     and narrative theorists to connect. Bringing a variety of DH and humanistic
                     tools to the analysis of these narratives, we are beginning to explore how much
                     these music-inspired storylines converge or diverge for each piece — with the
                     goal of testing this across cultures. This means that at any given time, walking
                     into the lab, you might find people dispersed, each working on a different
                     computer and using a different DH tool to explore similarities and points of
                     uniqueness in our now ~1,500 musical stories. At one computer, we have a student
                     (relatively new to the lab) using Voyant to offer a first-round exploration of
                     common themes in the seventy-nine stories from the students at U. Arkansas
                     listening to musical excerpt WA15. With appropriate stop words, we can begin to
                     see what stands out as a through-line for the stories linked to this particular
                     piece. Do people tend to invoke pirates? Dancing squirrels? Star Wars and/or
                     lightsabers? Out of the word-cloud, we can then return relatively quickly to the
                     specific stories and check their context for more nuance and richness, always
                     keeping a humanities eye out for themes that might go unnoticed by sheer word
                     count. Comments jotted down on a sticky note pose questions: 1) Do these
                     commonly-used words actually point us to themes? 2) Does sheer frequency of a
                     phrase reveal focus? 3) How about what’s implied or left unsaid here...which
                     often seems to carry as much meaning as the explicit and stated?!?

                     problems so obvious we couldn’t continue without digging into the algorithm. Our
                     funniest example was about ducks. As it turned out both IBM Watson and Stanford

                     gathering food as “strongly negative.” Other less

                     everyone in the room could hear (and be heard) while simultaneously being seen
                     no matter where they were. This technology helped the conversation stay vibrant
                     and productive, bringing people together over great distance [<a class="ref" href="#bly1993">Bly 1993</a>]. Modeling the spirit of the lab, Lisa and Devin (two
                     full professors) listened intently as students offered critical feedback on how
                     literary scholars would approach narrative categorization. For instance, when
                     they offered the example “I imagined animated shadows
                     creeping over the walls” as an abstract narrative without characters
                     or agents, students were able to offer feedback as equals. When our
                     undergraduate lab lead pointed out that shadows (as well as colors, objects,
                     animals, etc.) could be considered agents (i.e. characters), traditional
                     professorial power dynamics went out the window. Lisa simply said “I trust your intuition as a literary scholar.”

                        of her lab space: 
                        <blockquote>
                           <p>My laboratory is a place where the
                              lights are always on. My laboratory has no windows, but it needs none.
                              It is self-contained. It is its own world. My lab is both private and
                              familiar, populated by a small number of people who know one another
                              well. My lab is the place where I put my brain out on my fingers and I
                              do things….In my lab, whatever I need is greatly outbalanced by what I
                              have. The drawers are packed full with items that might come in handy.
                              Every object in my lab — no matter how small or misshapen — exists for a
                              reason, even if its purpose has not yet been found….The door is locked
                              and I know everyone who has a key. Because the outside world cannot come
                              into the lab, the lab has become the place where I can be the real me.

                        how I feel about the DHLC. Yet there’s a part of the lab that’s different;
                        something central to its beauty. Yes, the lab is its own world and a
                        sanctuary to me. Yes, it’s stocked with objects whose purpose may not have
                        been found (yet). But every time I go into the lab, I see both people who I
                        know well and people I’ve never met before. And it’s just as often the
                        people I’ve never seen before who have suddenly (I learn) solved an
                        experimental problem — or a problem with complex software and coding — I
                        didn’t even know existed. This shows what it means to be an
                        “open” humanities lab. We have IRB to protect the
                        confidentiality of brain data, but since the IRB training is essential and
                        free, the lab is radically and powerfully open. This means that problems are
                        solved from the ground up, not top-down. And that the students come up with
                        new questions to ask about each and every project we do, with an energy that
                        carries it far beyond the original idea.</span></div>

                        for medical leave. I’ll admit, egocentrically, I worried that the lab would
                        come to a complete and grinding halt without me. Instead, it flourished as
                        much it always has, possibly even more, since the students knew, deeply now,
                        that what I’d been telling them — that they had the leadership, they had to
                        trust their own instincts, and they could take it forward — was true. They’d
                        been trained for it. This is the ultimate proof that the lab is not
                        vertically driven, nor hierarchical by nature; it continued and prospered
                        while the director was down. Two English majors from a class I taught who
                        joined the lab while I was away ended up, in their first semester, designing
                        and running an entire new branch of the poetry study, getting scientists to
                        highlight the aspects of the poems they found most powerful (or not).
                        Another group went out into the dormitories and hallways and gathered
                        everyday students’ definitions of aesthetic pleasure. Perhaps most
                        impressively, an Accessible Art event that I’d been working on, pulled out
                        of my hands by necessity, expanded based on student innovation to include
                        not just students — as had been my original model — but local community
                        artists and a week-long public exhibition. While away, I found myself
                        missing the lab more than I can say; going in to the DHLC had always meant
                        going into a space where things were happening...where students always had
                        new projects and ideas (not that three experiments and an accessible art
                        project weren’t enough to keep us on our toes). Not that I’m back, I realize
                        what I missed most; the vibrance in the atmosphere — and the sanctuary it
                        provided, always showing, rather than telling that humanists and scientists
                        could do things together...at times, brilliantly...and in ways that expand
                        beyond experiments into the community.</span></div>

                  <div class="ptext" id="p39">One of the most powerful ways the DHLC breaks the mold of what labs usually do
                     (obscure experiments behind closed doors) is through a series of multisensory
                     and inclusive art exhibits that have come to be known as Accessible Art. In 2015
                     the student editor of <cite class="title italic">Exceptions</cite>, a journal housed
                     within the DHLC that publishes work by and for people with visual disabilities,
                     approached an English professor and an art professor with the idea for a
                     touchable art exhibit. English students would select or create a sensory-rich
                     passage of text, which students in the art class would use as inspiration for a
                     multisensory piece of art. The Accessible Art exhibit was born with the motto
                     “Touch the Art!” After that first year, <cite class="title italic">Exceptions</cite> editors continued to plan different
                     accessible artistic events, including a second Accessible Art exhibit in 2017.
                     In honor of Veteran’s day this exhibit focused on depictions of war, and <a href="https://www.exceptionsjournal.com/blog/2017/11/sense-of-self" onclick="window.open('https://www.exceptionsjournal.com/blog/2017/11/sense-of-self'); return false" class="ref">drew
                        over 200 visitors</a>. One wrote, “This changed the
                     paradigm of art for me, before this event I only thought of art as visual
                     and did not consider the fact that art can and should engage all senses and
                     be accessible for all people.” Another put it this way: “it was actually accessible to everyone. QR codes were
                     available to have the literary aspects of the art read aloud and then of
                     course we were encouraged to touch the art, which is something unheard of in
                     a museum.” Our events were never only about opening museum spaces to
                     visitors with visual disabilities, important as such work is. Instead, we sought
                     to encourage every visitor to think about engaging with art in a different way.
                     The enjoyment that comes from the multi-sensory indulgence of touching the
                     untouchable opens people’s minds to consider what a more inclusive and
                     accessible world might look like (see Figure 7).

                     brought together student and community art. The project grew to include almost a
                     dozen undergraduate and graduate students on the planning team as well as nearly
                     fifty undergraduate students and community members creating multi-sensory art,
                     designing the exhibit, documenting the exhibit’s accessibility, writing grants,
                     and organizing tours for local schools. In addition to the fidget quilt, our art
                     pieces included other textiles, like a piece of embroidery that uses both
                     Braille and the Latin alphabet. Another installation was a mirror hung at forty
                     inches from the ground, the proper level for someone in a wheelchair, surrounded
                     by selfies the artist has taken of herself in mirrors around the MSU campus; the
                     pictures are mostly the top of her head and empty space, because the mirrors are
                     too high. Visitors were encouraged to take selfies in this mirror — people who
                     don’t use wheelchairs will mostly get torso shots, demonstrating what it feels
                     like when the world is not set up for you. Numerous sculptures played with

                     moss, and a third that is a window box full of fake flowers created from

                        extend to China, but it has the same limits. The excitement isn’t all “an interdisciplinary fantasy of the moment.” It

                     literary neuroscience is that we are attempting to scientize the humanities,

                     about the validity of these fields, we want to acknowledge that there are

                     seeks to import scientific knowledge to the humanities in order to attract more

                     this trend. We believe that truly interdisciplinary work isn’t a one-way street,
                     as though the sciences have the authority on truth and reality and the
                     humanities are here merely to dress it up. Rather, we are proud of having a lab
                     space that humanitizes the sciences, seeing young neuroscientists regularly
                     reading literature and poetry, and introducing scholars in English, Education,
                     Rhetoric, and other areas to neuroscience and digital tools for analyzing
                     artistic media. Interdisciplinary digital humanities labs are uniquely
                     positioned to make these points of contact happen, and to do the critical work of
                     championing the humanities and resisting the institutional privileging of the
                     sciences.

                     far-reaching. For example, knowing how we close read and pleasure read

                     working four complete years in the lab. This creative reconfiguration has led to
                     brilliant work for DH outreach in Maine — the student assistants are taking the
                     lead on a digital archival project by scanning the historical catalogs

                     knowledges, and goals. Our research practices are always situated within various
                     types of institutions, traditions, and systems of power, but they also always
                     hold out the possibility for new and revolutionary insights to spontaneously
                     emerge. To be more specific to the digital humanities, if we are to critically
                     engage with digital technologies, then we have to be willing to let those
                     engagements evolve and emerge to address the critical question or situation at
                     hand. We also have to be open to taking risks, and even to failing. After all,
                     we can learn just as much (and sometimes more!) from the experiments that fail
                     as the ones that produce promising results. The great benefit of prioritizing
                     the humanities in this trial and error is that they can guide the process,
                     minimizing the harm and emphasizing the importance of considering the meanings
                     and ethics behind research projects. This interdisciplinary work is not the
