                  <p>In this paper, I develop an online website that assists users in answering the
                     question, “What do you need to remove in order to erase [thing] from [your life or
                     society]?” through network visualization methods. This project subverts the typical data
                     visualization strategy of working with extant data by encouraging users to produce
                     data,
                     demonstrating how data visualization techniques can constitute a way of thinking and
                     creating rather than just analyzing and representing. However, this tool and its
                     affordances are primarily a case study for a sociological approach to critical design
                     in
                     the Digital Humanities: By critically examining the tool itself (as well as the process
                     that created it), I am able to pose the broader questions of (1) how does the creation
                     of digital tools and projects reflect a theoretical interpretation of the social world
                     and its processes, and (2) how can these interpretations constitute the data of
                     sociological studies? In resolving these questions, I suggest that critical design
                     can
                     be viewed as theory, experiment, and data: designs constitute a social theory, data
                     can
                     be experimentally produced within this social theory, and encouraging reflective design
                     can turn the social theories of design themselves into data.</p>

                  <div class="ptext" id="p1">In reflecting on the fraught disciplinary boundaries of the digital humanities, Lauren
                     Klein and Matthew Gold write, “In what has been called ‘big tent’ DH, it can at times be
                     difficult to determine with any specificity what, precisely, digital humanities work
                     entails” [<a href="#gold2016">2016, intro.</a>]<a class="noteRef" href="#d4e199">[1]</a>. As with any
                     definitional ambiguity, others have sought to demarcate such boundaries, suggesting
                     models, imperatives, and ontologies for DH work. Some researchers claim that DH is
                     not
                     the “mere use of digital tools for the purpose of humanistic research” or the “study
                     of digital artifacts, new media, or contemporary culture” [<a class="ref" href="#burdick2012">Burdick et al. 2012</a>, 122].
                     Indeed, in positing a “generative humanities” [<a class="ref" href="#burdick2012">Burdick et al. 2012</a>, 5] or a “critical
                     digital humanities” [<a class="ref" href="#berry2017">Berry and Fagerford 2017</a>, chap. 8] or any number of distinctions
                     and prerogatives within DH work (while maintaining that the work should be
                     interdisciplinary, collaborative, and exploratory), the field both narrows to fit
                     framed
                     “purposes” and expands with the radical possibilities of productive practices and
                     processes. In their latest reflection on the discipline, Klein and Gold revise their
                     notion of DH as an “expanded field” — “a set of vectors of inquiry that are defined by
                     their tensions, alignments, and oppositions” — in order to argue for a DH “that
                     matters,” one which incorporates “socially oriented work” and translates the “subtleties
                     of our research to others within the expanded field” [<a class="ref" href="#gold2019">Gold and Klein 2019</a>, intro]. My own experience,
                     coming from a background in sociology yet watching the confluence of DH techniques
                     and
                     analyses with once-strictly anthropological or sociological research, is indicative
                     of
                     how fraught any attempt to coherently standardize such work is. And so, without arguing
                     for any authoritative boundaries within DH, it is important to instead characterize
                     the
                     “vector of inquiry” that I engage with, positioning my project within the field by way
                     of useful but ultimately unsustainable distinctions.</div>

                  <div class="ptext" id="p2">This project is rooted in the principles of “critical design;” that is, as a project in
                     which I am producing a digital tool, I am taking a critical, self-reflective approach
                     to
                     my design process that interrogates the theoretical underpinnings of my design
                     decisions, an approach I am terming “reflexive critical design” [<a class="ref" href="#bardzell2013">Bardzell and Bardzell 2013</a>]. This specific distinction is necessary, as born from this approach is what I
                     term “experimental critical design,” a mode of both sociological and DH research that
                     looks at the potential for interrogating digital tools as theories about the social
                     world. Experimental critical design recognizes the ability of digital tools to do
                     more
                     than just analyze data but to produce data; moreover, it sees these digital tools
                     (and
                     thus the theories underpinning them) to be data. After developing a framework for
                     critical design, firmly positioning this work within a specific vector of inquiry,
                     I
                     will describe the digital project that I have made centered around network visualization
                     and then analyze it through the lens of this critical design framework. </div>

                  <div class="ptext" id="p3">In short, my digital project “Loss” examines how increasingly popular and accessible
                     network visualizations can be used to visualize networks of loss — that is, the networks
                     of things attached to a focal object removed from a system. Leveraging the fundamentals
                     of web design and the data analysis library D3 [<a class="ref" href="#bostock2019">Bostock, Heer, and Ogievetsky 2019</a>], I
                     developed an online web interface that asks users to meditate on what loss and removal
                     can mean for their personal lives, history, or society — and then visualize these
                     effects through a series of connected nodes. From the perspective of reflexive critical
                     design, I use this project to examine the question: how does the creation of a digital
                     tool reflect a theoretical interpretation of the social world and its processes? And
                     in
                     developing experimental critical design, I seek to answer the question: how can the
                     interpretive social theories behind this digital tool themselves constitute the data
                     of
                     sociological studies? Both questions call for a sociological analysis of the tools
                     and
                     methods that DH is producing right now, but they also call for a pedagogical and ethical
                     approach to DH work: As the field grows — and interdisciplinary boundaries become
                     even
                     more fraught — DH can provide valuable insight into how digital methods can be leveraged
                     to address social, cultural, and personal issues that extend far beyond the typical
                     “big
                     data” approach to digital tools. DH can work towards an educative, public engagement to
                     collaborate with a general population increasingly engaged with digital media. Together,
                     the two critical design perspectives recognize critical design as theory, experiment,
                     and data: designs constitute a social theory, data can be experimentally produced
                     within
                     this social theory, and encouraging reflective design can turn the social theories
                     of
                     design themselves into data.</div>

                     DH, one in which researchers treat their work as more than just functional but
                     theoretical as well. As digital methods proliferate, especially in terms of their
                     accessibility, the dangers of a lack of reflexivity are evident in projects — amateurish
                     or professional — that misinterpret the output, logic, or purpose of the digital tools
                     that they wield. Indeed, the fetishization of digital methods — many of which come
                     from
                     or overlap with methods used in the social sciences and corporate sector — has allowed
                     for an overvaluation or misinterpretation of data- and computer-driven analyses
                     [<a class="ref" href="#cheneylippold2017">Cheney-Lippold 2017</a>, 80–82]. In some of the most extreme cases, these digital methods
                     have reproduced a digital phrenology, or they have been leveraged by malicious actors
                     such as conspiracy theorists to allow for the “scientization” of misinformation and hate
                     towards harmful political ends [<a class="ref" href="#cct2020">CCT 2020</a>] [<a class="ref" href="#uscinski2018">Uscinski 2018</a>, 65–66]. This is not to say there has not been reflection on these risks: a recent
                     viral project from science and technologies studies researchers Kate Crawford and
                     Trevor
                     Paglen [<a href="#crawford2019">2019</a>] blended machine learning and facial recognition software in an attempt to
                     demonstrate the inherent racial biases in datasets, machine vision, and algorithms
                     —
                     digital tools which power commercial products or even the work of police departments
                     and
                     high school administrations [<a class="ref" href="#ferguson2016">Ferguson 2016</a>] [<a class="ref" href="#oneil2016">O’Neil 2016</a>, intro]. Nevertheless, the
                     blind implementation of digital tools means that tools must be understood for their
                     potential consequences, perhaps even designed to prevent abuse by bad actors. DH as
                     a
                     whole can look to engage with and produce work that reimagines digital tools as
                     something less-than-empirical and objective — the product of human impulses and
                     understandings of the world, rooted both in individuals’ biases, motivations, and
                     ideologies. Moreover, these reimagined tools can then be turned inwards, to examine
                     the
                     self rather than the troves of ethically-dubious data now enrapturing researchers
                     and
                     celebrating the eclectic categorization and algorithmic analysis of the “other”

                     move
                     beyond producing “instrumental” tools that say something about inputted data and instead
                     produce tools that say something about the world itself as it is being transformed
                     and
                     interpreted by technology — tools that are, in their own right, theories about the
                     social world [<a class="ref" href="#berry2017">Berry and Fagerford 2017</a>, chap. 8]. Thus, I position myself in a critical
                     DH, one that investigates the theoretical underpinnings of the employed methods and
                     treats digital tools as theories themselves. In this work, the object of my criticism
                     is
                     what digital humanists term “design”:</div>
                  
                  <blockquote>
                     <p class="ptext">…design is a creative practice harnessing cultural, social, economic, and technological
                        constraints in order to bring systems and objects into the world. Design in dialogue
                        with research is simply a technique, but when used to pose and frame questions about
                        knowledge, design becomes an intellectual method. In the hundred-plus years during
                        which
                        a self-conscious practice of design has existed, the field has successfully exploited
                        technology for cultural production, either as useful design technologies in and of
                        themselves, or by shaping the culture’s technological imaginary. As Digital Humanities
                        both shapes and interprets this imaginary, its engagement with design as a method
                        of
                        thinking-through-practice is indispensable. Digital Humanities is a production-based
                        endeavor in which theoretical issues get tested in the design of implementations,
                        and
                        implementations are loci of theoretical reflection and elaboration  [<a class="ref" href="#burdick2012">Burdick et al. 2012</a>, 13].</p>

                     world. My work here is thus “critical design,” a reflexive interrogation of the theories
                     underpinning the design I am attempting to implement in addition to the design itself
                     as
                     it is used to argue for a particular representation of the world. This reflexive
                     critical design asks the designer to examine their own latent motivations, ideologies,
                     and biases; examine how these have been translated into the design; and examine design
                     itself as an act and as a principle. Reflexivity about research methods and approaches
                     is certainly nothing new in the humanities, especially as critical race theory and
                     gender theory have tasked readers with examining their implicit biases before engaging
                     with literary material [<a class="ref" href="#wernimont2010">Wernimont and Flanders 2010</a>], or decolonial theories have
                     argued for an archaeology in which researchers examine their position more deeply
                     within
                     field sites [<a class="ref" href="#stobiecka2020">Stobiecka 2020</a>]. Social science’s more explicit historical focus on
                     “methods” adds to this conversation by viewing approaches to research questions and data
                     — such as literary works or archaeological sites — as methods guided by a particular
                     point-of-view and sociological interpretation [<a class="ref" href="#weber2017">Weber 2017</a>, chap. 2]. Further, with the
                     proliferation of media studies in the social sciences, critical voices have asked
                     for a
                     deeper examination of our sudden reification of tools that many people assume to
                     function without the bias of the “old ways” <a class="noteRef" href="#d4e325">[2]</a>.</div>

                  <div class="ptext" id="p7">When working across academic registers, it’s important to establish a shared vocabulary:
                     in this instance, “design” is a capacious term, as it can refer to both the design of a
                     study — from the social scientific lexicon — or the design of a computational tool.
                     In
                     both cases, design is united by its generative <em class="term">procedures.</em> That
                     is to say, when approaching a research question with a dataset, both the research
                     design
                     and the computational design are guided by a procedural logic that makes arguments
                     about
                     how the social world functions — but in DH work, research design often <em class="emph">is</em> computational design, as the research methods are not distinct from the tool
                     itself. Thus, we can enlist “design” as the term capturing the procedural logic of
                     computational tools which themselves constitute the research design. Procedural
                     arguments, or procedural rhetoric, consist of “the art of persuasion through rule-based
                     representations and interactions, rather than the spoken word, writing, images, or
                     moving pictures” [<a class="ref" href="#bogost2007">Bogost 2007</a>, ix]. Therefore, to analyze the procedural rhetoric of DH
                     designs is to recognize that systems and processes function as a form of discursive
                     argumentation as much as traditionally understood argumentation in the form of writing
                     and imagery, with computational designs increasingly coming under scrutiny from the
                     “critical coding” perspective — what are the latent arguments built into software’s code
                     [<a class="ref" href="#burdick2012">Burdick et al. 2012</a>, 53]? Not only does software’s coded procedures make arguments
                     about the social world, they do so at the behest of programmers and with the illusion
                     of
                     objectivity. In short, this paper views design as a set of theoretically-informed,
                     argumentative procedures built into digital tools. Moreover, because these digital
                     procedures seek to generate, capture, or analyze data, their underlying theories shape

                  <div class="ptext" id="p8">An example of how some social science researchers have critically studied their tools
                     to
                     see their latent biases can help to elucidate the reflexive critical design perspective
                     I’ve outlined above: In the aforementioned facial recognition project by [<a class="ref" href="#crawford2019">Crawford and Paglen 2019</a>], the researchers began with a set of research questions, “What work do
                     images do in AI systems? What are computers meant to recognize in an image and what
                     is
                     misrecognized or even completely invisible?” In their case: what biases are baked into a
                     software’s procedures for recognizing faces? Their next step required choosing a dataset
                     to train their AI system, and, when critiquing one dataset representing human emotions,
                     they were aware of the arguments implicitly made by the dataset’s taxonomical
                     procedures, writing, “First there’s the taxonomy itself: that ‘emotions’ is a valid set
                     of visual concepts. Then there’s a string of additional assumptions: that the concepts
                     within ‘emotions’ can be applied to photographs of people’s faces” [<a class="ref" href="#crawford2019">Crawford and Paglen 2019</a>]. When they chose a different dataset for their work, the data’s taxonomical
                     procedures allowed them to “see the outlines of a worldview” as it “classifie[d] people
                     into a huge range of types including race, nationality, profession, economic status,
                     behaviour, character, and even morality” [<a class="ref" href="#crawford2019">Crawford and Paglen 2019</a>]. That they would
                     create a machine vision tool intended to classify people based on their physical
                     appearances meant that their tool advocated for the worldview tacit to the data; it
                     posited a social theory of what the categories of “people” were, that these were
                     appropriate categories to use, and that a person’s categories were latent to their
                     physical appearance — what does it mean to look like a “kleptomaniac” or a “pervert”
                     [<a class="ref" href="#crawford2019">Crawford and Paglen 2019</a>]? Crawford and Paglen’s work demonstrated that both the
                     dataset and the facial recognition software could not function without tacitly making
                     arguments about how the social world functions — how human biases about physical
                     appearances were translated into computational procedures, argued for by those
                     procedures. </div>

                     biases inherent to the computational processes that constitute DH’s research tools.
                     These computational processes work in service of a “worldview,” social theory, or, to
                     use the language of computer science, a model of the social world. The procedures
                     that
                     classify images make an argument about essential human traits whereas natural language
                     processing procedures might make an argument about prescriptive grammar or semantics,
                     and GIS procedures might make an argument about national territories or land ownership.
                     In any case, without critical examination, these digital tools simply perpetuate the
                     worldview that constructed them, and so long as they produce data that people find
                     worthwhile, their latent biases can go uninterrogated. </div>

                  <div class="ptext" id="p10">Further, reflexive critical design allows for experimentation that creates data. For
                     example, in Crawford and Paglen’s project, the researchers could leverage the outputs
                     of
                     their facial recognition software, as it was used by people online, to make an argument
                     about racism in digital technology. They made their digital tool accessible, allowing
                     users to submit their own photos and put the machine’s social theories to the test.
                     In
                     taking a critical approach to design that gave them an intimate knowledge of their
                     software — and the inherent racial biases it modeled — they were better equipped to
                     critique its output. Crucially, reflexive critical design’s capacity for experimentation
                     negotiates between historical modes of criticism and emergent forms of “critical making”
                     [<a class="ref" href="#jagoda2017">Jagoda 2017</a>] [<a class="ref" href="#ratto2011">Ratto 2011</a>]. Crawford and Paglen began with a traditional critique but
                     then put this critique into productive action. This resulted in a project that allowed
                     users to experientially engage with the critique, affectively understanding how
                     technology discriminates when pictures of themselves were labelled with racist and
                     sexist slurs. It was an experiment in digital design which merged criticism with
                     critical making, a merger that is increasingly familiar to social scientists: in
                     sociologist Chris Bail’s work on political polarization, his team created a social
                     media
                     app that put two politically-opposed members into a chatroom where they could discuss
                     a
                     given political issue anonymously [<a class="ref" href="#bail2021">Bail 2021</a>, 120–132]. In this case, a social theory
                     about anonymity, discursive identity, and political communication was proffered by
                     the
                     very processes of the app, one that could be tested by the app’s output in the form
                     of
                     textual exchanges. Social media apps are infrequently designed with such a sensitivity
                     to social theory — as anthropologist Nick Seaver [<a href="#seaver2017">2017</a>] discusses, the logic of these
                     platforms often reproduce taken-for-granted cultural norms or are uncritical about
                     the
                     ways their social engineering might affect people’s lives. </div>

                     work feels different than the social experimentation of Bail’s work — indeed, both
                     are
                     framed differently — but at the crux of their digital methods is a recognition that
                     they
                     are perpetuating a model of reality through procedural arguments that will result
                     in
                     some form of data that puts their model to the test, allowing for a deeper reflection
                     on
                     the software itself. These design procedures simultaneously function as research
                     procedures, with designers acting as researchers inviting users (or subjects) to be
                     subject to the digital design’s processes. Reflexive critical design is in direct
                     opposition to the work of the corporate sector, where digital processes are deployed
                     without reflecting on how those processes will affect human behavior, as the software’s
                     functionality and profitability are the primary motivators, forcing the software’s
                     underlying design logic to remain a trade secret [<a class="ref" href="#oneil2016">O’Neil 2016</a>, chap. 8]. What many
                     researchers of media are doing now is seeing the resulting data of the mass social
                     experiment that is the internet: the experimental critical design perspective challenges
                     researchers to directly engage and design the methods that have created that data.</div>

                  <div class="ptext" id="p12">Finally, reflexive critical design itself constitutes data. There are a number of
                     ways
                     of thinking about how design can be used as data: First, the design’s procedures
                     themselves, through a close-reading of the software’s code and processes [<a class="ref" href="#burdick2012">Burdick et al. 2012</a>, 53], allows for an examination that can reveal the researcher or developer’s
                     intentions and theoretical framing when they designed the software. This is similar
                     to
                     the work that Crawford and Paglen [<a href="#crawford2019">2019</a>] did when they critiqued the “emotions” dataset:
                     they drew out the social theories from <em class="emph">others’</em> procedural
                     arguments. Now with countless computational models available online, systematic critical
                     design is desperately needed to hold other researchers accountable [<a class="ref" href="#cct2020">CCT 2020</a>]. Second,
                     when researchers such as Crawford, Paglen, or Bail make their theoretical framing
                     explicit — a much more common practice in the social sciences, where these authors
                     come
                     from — such justifications can be put in conversation with the software itself to
                     examine how different researchers have theorized and employed models of the social
                     world, as might be done in review papers. This is a challenge, considering how
                     frequently digital tools are distributed with documentation focused solely on how
                     to use
                     the digital tool rather than how to understand the implications of its procedural
                     arguments. </div>

                  <div class="ptext" id="p13">The final way that reflexive critical design can be seen as data is one that has rarely
                     seen use in DH or the social sciences broadly. Researchers can task people with
                     developing their own designs. Researchers can pose design challenges to participants
                     in
                     an attempt to see how they might conceptualize and procedurally argue for a model
                     of the
                     social world, and their procedural arguments constitute data to be analyzed. This
                     sort
                     of thinking has gained popularity in the world of urban planning, where “design
                     challenges” centered around tackling a central problem can be revealing of how
                     participants in the design challenge think through social issues [<a class="ref" href="#munster2017">Münster et al. 2017</a>].
                     It has also been employed in relation to game design, with researchers and educators
                     collaborating to assist youth in designing games that address salient social problems
                     [<a class="ref" href="#gilliam2016">Gilliam, Hill, and Jagoda 2016</a>]. These designed games reflect both how the students
                     think about systems functioning in their lives and how the medium — in this case,
                     analog
                     board games — constrain and shape their thinking in procedural ways. How people think
                     about issues through software and digital processes, then, can be investigated, even
                     if
                     their designs are only manifest on paper or in interviews. The goal is not to design
                     software but to understand how people <em class="emph">would</em> design software — how
                     they procedurally argue for a particular representation of the world. Although, with
                     the
                     increased accessibility of digital tools and increasing digital literacy, some
                     populations might be able to design simple games or programs articulating the dynamics

                     scientists have long recognized the ways that worldviews and social theories are
                     codified into research methods, and work in the social sciences (like that of Seaver
                     or
                     Bail) demonstrates how recent studies have had to contend with the socio-political

                     use assist in the production of a political reality. Just as Google search indexes
                     perpetuate racist worldviews through their treatment of racial and gender minorities
                     [<a class="ref" href="#noble2018">Noble 2018</a>], DH researchers run the risk of creating tools — for academic or public use
                     — that actively aid in the reification of a particular (and potentially dangerous)
                     social theory. Reflexive critical design also opens up the pathway for experimental
                     critical design: once a social theory has been established in a digital tool, how
                     do the
                     users of that tool engage with it to reproduce or subvert that worldview? Users —
                     be
                     they DH researchers or the public — create data under the framework provided by these
                     tools, so their output enables the interrogation of the kinds of data the tool allows.
                     This also allows reflexive critical design to understand technology <em class="emph">in
                        its use</em> rather than just in concept. Moreover, by examining others’
                     computational models addressing shared research questions or by asking users how they
                     would design a computational model to approach a research question, the social theories
                     baked into procedures can themselves become data for comparative analysis. This final
                     form of experimentation rests on the notion that people are innately theoretical beings,
                     and they will try to translate their understanding of the world into procedures, as
                     people do when designing systems in video games [<a class="ref" href="#jagoda2020">Jagoda 2020</a>, 227–233] or HIEs.
                     Ultimately, this interdisciplinary approach recognizes that digital procedures
                     increasingly govern the way that we interface with reality, and thus we need to
                     critically design digital procedures — in DH tools, social science experiments, social
                     media, games, and even health management software — that are honest about their
                     procedures, allow their procedures to be tested, and look toward others to build better

                     develop their own network visualization through a hierarchical visualization of HTML

                     create their own networks, a task which, while increasingly accessible, is still mostly
                     limited to those who have some knowledge of computer programming and who have access
                     to

                     “Loss” encourages users of the website not to just think with data or to think about

                     the site’s functionality. The tutorial begins with an interactive statement seen in
                     Figure 1: “Today, I want to remove a thing from society.” In the tool, the terms “thing”
                     and “society” are actually dropdown menus which allow the user to produce different
                     statements, such as “Today I want to remove a person from my life” or “a concept from
                     history.” Based on the user’s selections, the program asks follow-up questions which lay
                     the foundation for their network. Thus, someone who decides to remove another person
                     from their life will be asked about what the two people share together, which will
                     later
                     be turned into a node. Once the questions have been answered, the user is presented
                     with
                     the full tool and a preliminary version of their network of loss. An example of what
                     this looks like is seen in Figure 2: On the left-hand side, there is a hierarchical
                     interface akin to an ontology or file management system where users can add nodes
                     to the
                     network and give them names, sizes, and colors. This hierarchical structure can be
                     manipulated, with nodes rearranged or deleted. On the right-hand side, we see the
                     results of this hierarchy: when the “generate” button is pressed, the network is
                     constructed and visualized for the user as a series of connected nodes which can then
                     be
                     dragged around. If the user wanted to save their network to be used in a different
                     visualization software, that option is made available to them with the “export”
                     button.</div>

                  <div class="ptext" id="p22">The example shown in the Figure 2 is taken from prototyping the tool with colleagues
                     and
                     friends who eat meat. They were prompted with the statement, “Today, I want to remove
                     meat from my life.” The networks developed by users in response included everything from
                     restaurants to holiday traditions. This use case resonated differently for different
                     people: for some the tool provided a visualization of just how much they would lose
                     by
                     going vegetarian, while for others it enabled the construction of a thorough and
                     strategic plan for going meatless. In testing, people were asked to design networks
                     that
                     touched upon deeply personal systems — such as removing a loved one from one’s life
                     — or
                     systems that, while personally resonant, aren’t always easy to fully imagine — such
                     as
                     removing the institution of policing from society. Even in these use cases, the tool
                     doesn’t make any assertion about whether loss is a good thing or a bad thing, nor
                     does
                     it set parameters for what should or should not be included in the network. It simply
                     allows for these networks to be built and visualized. This is a decision that I made
                     as
                     the administrator of these use cases: it would be entirely possible for the tool to
                     be
                     used to ask the same questions, with different framing, in order to produce networks
                     that were critical of meat consumption or policing and posed questions to guide network
                     construction and interrogate people’s relationships to these systems. Such uses are
                     discussed more in the later section “Critical Design as Experiment.”</div>

                     explicit about its pedagogical design and how the project is intended to be used.
                     The
                     landing page text reads, “…there is no amount of ‘big data’ that can be visualized to
                     explain the very personal, individual experiences we have with systems and ideas.
                     So
                     instead of using data visualizations for rigorous science, we’ll leverage these tools
                     to
                     think through how we are implicated in systems.” The aforementioned guided tutorial
                     facilitates the “thinking through” that the landing page requests. The tutorial is not
                     an explanation of the tool itself but a line of questioning that is supposed to be
                     evocative of different forms of thinking. These questions ask users to think more
                     deeply
                     about their engagement with systems and contingencies, and in this way, the website
                     continues to make clear the designer’s motivations for its creation and the worldview
                     it
                     seeks to present. Should users skip the tutorial, the main tool still contains a
                     rotating series of prompts that reiterate systems-level thinking, with pointed questions
                     that provide pathways for expanding the network they’re creating to include things
                     like
                     historical structures or emotions. There is also a brief explanation of the tool’s
                     features, but once again, users aren’t instructed to visualize certain topics or assume
                     certain political positions. All of this is done to intentionally be content-neutral:
                     the tool prepares them for <em class="emph">how </em>to think about any topic of their
                     choosing, not what to think about it. </div>

                  <div class="ptext" id="p24">On the technical side, the program’s functionality is fairly straightforward: users
                     are
                     essentially adding, deleting, and rearranging HTML elements using the hierarchy. These
                     div — or content division — elements are comprised of two main components: their
                     location and their customization. Each div — which we can understand as a node in
                     the
                     network — is placed within an HTML hierarchy, wrapped within other divs. A child div
                     is
                     located inside of a parent div. The child div knows the name of its parent based on
                     its
                     location, and this HTML information is converted into network data — the links between
                     nodes — using JavaScript. The parent div knows how many children it has, which is
                     only
                     used to make sure users do not accidentally delete the entire graph. Each div also
                     has
                     customizable features — name, size, and color — that make it unique. These features
                     are
                     also translated into network data using JavaScript and used to style the nodes in
                     the
                     graph. It might be helpful to imagine the computational logic as akin to a giant
                     matryoshka doll: each interior doll knows which doll it is inside, and each doll has
                     unique features. Each div knows which div it is inside, and each div has unique
                     features. Because the network is generated on the basis of unique names for divs,
                     users
                     can enter the same name multiple times to give a div multiple connections. D3, a data
                     analysis library for JavaScript that can turn JavaScript data into charts and graphs,
                     is
                     used to convert the network data produced by the collaborating HTML and JavaScript
                     in
                     order to visualize the nodes.<a class="noteRef" href="#d4e644">[4]</a>

                  <div class="ptext" id="p25">Before moving to the theoretical reasons for the project’s design, I want to explain
                     why
                     the tool’s UI and code are the way they are. First, the user interface was designed
                     to
                     be simplistic and approachable, with only a few variables (size, color, name, and
                     position) that allowed for maximum creativity. In the design phase, there were other
                     ideas for how the UI could look: for example, it was considered that the tool could
                     begin with a monochrome screen, and as objects were removed (by being added to the
                     network), the color, too, would be removed. This prototype would have more closely
                     mirrored the actual process of loss, of things being taken away, but it wouldn’t have
                     produced network visualizations that are familiar and easily introduced into other
                     contexts. The design process included toying with other interfaces and features through
                     an iterative engagement (initial designs were shared with colleagues and friends for
                     feedback), but it ultimately settled on the one here for its ease of use, resemblance
                     to
                     other network visualization software, and technical simplicity — some features, like
                     adding nodes via interaction with the generated network, were technically resource
                     consumptive or
                     difficult to use. </div>
                  
                  <div class="counter"><a href="#p26">26</a></div>
                  <div class="ptext" id="p26">It should be noted that the code itself is not well-optimized, nor does it leverage
                     advanced JavaScript libraries (aside from D3) to perform computations. There are a
                     number of reasons for this: First, the goal was to program something with few
                     dependences so that people with only an intermediate knowledge of the main web languages
                     would be able to read its code. Second, as a fairly lightweight application, there
                     was
                     no need to optimize performance as ultimately, the code works. Finally, aspects of
                     the
                     code that are repetitive or mathematically simple better articulate the theory behind
                     the code. For example, there are plenty of other ways to create a web app in which
                     the
                     hierarchy which generates the network leverages math to build out the network, but
                     in
                     this version, what happens computationally is what is envisioned theoretically: a
                     parent
                     node is known to be a parent because it quite literally contains its child node. They
                     have a direct, computational relationship such that the computer “thinks” about the
                     relationship the way we think about the relationship. Moreover, the computer “thinks”
                     about the relationship the way network data represents those relationships, which
                     is why
                     the user can export the graph to a network data format. There’s a one-to-one
                     relationship between computational representation, network theoretical representation,
                     and the actual network relationships being represented. Thus, this software privileges
                     simple, theoretically-driven computation to assist users in thinking through data,
                     so
                     the theory driving its design is what I’ll discuss next.</div>

                  <div class="ptext" id="p27"> The data visualizations that led to the creation of this project are largely rooted
                     in
                     the theories of network analysis. Network analysis has enjoyed widespread adoption
                     in
                     the social sciences as a way of structurally examining the relationships between
                     different entities [<a class="ref" href="#wasserman1994">Wasserman and Faust 1994</a>, 4]. In contemporary uses of network
                     analysis, it can be employed to better understand patterns of viral spread, social
                     networks of support, or online networks of political actors <a class="noteRef" href="#d4e667">[5]</a>. Beyond statistical and theoretical
                     implementations, network analysis has been translated into a robust form of data
                     visualization that — for all of its popular uses — remains less employed if only because
                     the data for network visualization is not always easy to attain and is rarely bundled
                     together with other data. Due to the diversity of network visualization’s applications,
                     it is at times difficult to know what precisely is being represented with a given
                     network. The “nodes” of the network are often straightforward — representing human
                     agents, organizations, or creatures — but the links between each of these nodes can
                     represent a variety of relationships. Some links are clearly defined: they might show
                     the transmission of diseases or check to see if two nodes are “friends” on a social
                     media platform. Other network visualizations strategies actively delineate the changing
                     definitions of links and nodes in the visualization, such as in the project “Anatomy of
                     an AI System” which sketches out the various international relationships required for
                     the production of an Amazon Echo [<a class="ref" href="#crawford2018">Crawford and Joler 2018</a>]. This non-computational
                     network visualization ambivalently defines the relationships between a variety of
                     types
                     of nodes which range from actors such as “companies” to concepts such as “geological
                     processes.” These two drastically different approaches to network visualization — one
                     with very clearly defined sets of nodes and links, computationally generated, and
                     one
                     with ambiguous categories of nodes and links, qualitatively designed — demonstrate
                     the
                     potential for network visualizations to be used for projects that go beyond limited
                     datasets and ask us more broadly to interpret the relationships presented in
                     visualizations. Indeed, many visualizations fall somewhere in the middle, simply showing
                     “relationships” between nodes, a term which can take on a multiplicity of meanings.</div>

                     Echo
                     approach, which engages with networks in all of their shifting complexity. “Loss”
                     embraces this ambiguity of links, nodes, and networks to take a figurational sociology
                     approach to network visualization which recognizes that attempts at structured analysis
                     might fall short of capturing the complexities of networks by focusing on a more limited
                     notion of what belongs in the network. Figurational sociology, developed by Norbert
                     Elias, recognizes the risks of empiricism in representing complex human behaviors:
                     In
                     response, the figurational approach criticizes the move towards social scientific
                     essentialism that “…blurs the procedural character of social
                     phenomena by presupposing the existence of permanent structures subjacent to change”
                     [<a class="ref" href="#quintaneiro2006">Quintaneiro 2006</a>, 55]. Adopting a perspective that recognizes historical contexts,
                     power, and the need for multi-level analysis, figurational sociology benefits from
                     its
                     focus, “…on the understanding of the structures that mutually dependent human beings
                     establish, and the transformations they suffer, both individually and in groups, due
                     to
                     the increase or reduction of their interdependencies and gradients of power” [<a class="ref" href="#quintaneiro2006">Quintaneiro 2006</a>, 56]. Elias’s framework was mostly concerned with how to negotiate the
                     chasm between analysis of individuals as people subordinate to a large social system
                     and
                     as the very agents who worked to construct those social systems, superordinate to
                     their
                     forces. While it too has a penchant for structuralism, in modern applications,
                     figurational sociology wraps in a constellatory logic that attempts to capture a more
                     robust picture of systems by drawing out the idiosyncrasies of social dynamics that
                     pure
                     structuralism would flaunt. This negotiation between structure and adaptation, between
                     individual experiences and social systems, between history and anachronism, makes
                     figurational sociology a more appealing approach. At its core, it is about the
                     configuration of individuals and structures as they collectively produce the social
                     world in dialogue rather than as one determines the other. </div>

                     their role in our daily lives and applying structure and systematic analysis where
                     there
                     once was story, but Tsing’s work is evidence for how we tend to mask these analyses
                     with
                     a deeply individual narrativization of complex systems. Reflexive critical design,
                     especially for a DH “that matters,” tasks designers with self-reflection not just
                     because reflexivity helps explain the analytical framing of their work, but also because
                     it elucidates the political procedures of their work — as evidenced by the ways that
                     authors have demonstrated their desire to alter social behavior or critique racist
                     technology. Certainly, this project’s procedures are grounded in assisting users to
                     unpack their tendency towards individual narratives and think in terms of configurations
                     and systems, networks of related and contingent subjects who might sometimes be
                     invisible to individuals. The theoretical framing of figurational sociology is employed
                     procedurally, in the design of the website, to accomplish a goal that has political
                     implications. Imagine that this tool was employed not in its currently content-neutral
                     format but instead in a format that asked users to imagine a world without policing,
                     Amazon, or sexism: what would we need to remove to take down these institutions,
                     corporations, and prejudices? A simple alteration of the website’s language, with
                     a
                     little more background provided on each subject, can quickly turn “Loss” into an
                     explicitly political project. Indeed, the project was designed to be employed in such
                     a
                     way, so this is no stretch of the imagination.</div>

                     to
                     produce more content, thus become an ethical and pedagogical practice. Historian Joan
                     Wallach Scott characterizes ethical practices as those in which people strive to reduce
                     the gap between reality as it is and reality as it ought to be [<a class="ref" href="#scott2019">Scott 2019</a>, 15–20]. “Loss”
                     asks people to imagine a world of social consequences and contingencies, thinking
                     through the responsibilities of an interconnected world in which the loss of something
                     —
                     such as a person, institution, or idea — has effects that ripple out. In other words,
                     it
                     aims to instill an ethical practice, asking users to think about the world <em class="emph">as it is</em> and then how it <em class="emph">might or ought to
                        be</em> following a change in its configuration. This is inherently pedagogical,
                     especially considering the way that the tutorial and guiding questions are framed.
                     Not
                     all digital tools take a pedagogical or ethical approach: they present the world as
                     it
                     is, or they experiment on people without revealing the purpose for the experimentation,
                     but in order to establish a DH that matters, we need to recognize that procedures,
                     in
                     representing a worldview, can also represent an imaginary that is to be resolved with
                     a
                     new way of thinking — one that the tools can hope to instill. If John Culkin’s summation
                     of Marshall McLuhan’s work is correct — “We shape our tools and thereafter they shape
                     us” [<a class="ref" href="#culkin1967">Culkin 1967</a>, 70] — then we need to recognize how these tools can be used to educate for

                  <div class="ptext" id="p32">In the current design of the website, a small “About” page invites users who have made
                     a network that they enjoy to submit it. One can imagine how a tool like this can be
                     used
                     to produce data that can be recirculated and analyzed, recognizing the data for how
                     it
                     was produced. If the tool was to be introduced in a classroom environment with a
                     specific prompt, such as “What does it take to remove policing from society?”, then
                     students could think through the various ways that policing is implicated in their
                     lives, and each student’s developed network would represent a valuable data point
                     in a
                     larger narrative about policing. Computationally, the tool is simple enough to edit
                     that
                     one could port it to their own website and alter the tutorial such that the tutorial
                     prompts become a research question: one could code the prompt to state “Today, I want to
                     remove social media from my life,” edit the follow-up questions, and distribute the
                     website to people as part of a research study on social media use. As experiment —
                     and
                     perhaps as experimental pedagogy — “Loss” allows for the production of more data that
                     can be used to interrogate such questions across different topics. This speaks directly
                     to the fact that network data is often difficult to come by — but that is a
                     fundamentally different type of network data. The data used in large scale analysis
                     seeks statistical rigor through uniform structure. This data would reflect very
                     different types of networks that can be leveraged in different ways, analyzed
                     qualitatively in addition to quantitatively: why did people choose to include certain
                     items in their network, why were certain items connected, what do these connections
                     represent, has the use of this tool changed the way that they were thinking about
                     a
                     given issue? Each of these questions becomes another entry point for data analysis
                     when
                     examined through this lens.</div>

                  <div class="ptext" id="p33">This pathway might seem circuitous — arriving at qualitative data analysis through
                     the
                     techniques of quantitative, “big data” approaches — and that’s because it is. Approaches
                     designed for large scale analysis can be applied to other settings, and the development
                     of these quantitative techniques can make qualitative analysis more robust. If a large
                     enough group of people use this tool to respond to the same prompt, then it is entirely
                     possible that that data could be collected and analyzed. Through data cleaning and
                     natural language processing techniques, the various individual networks could be
                     concatenated to make one larger network, and it would be possible to ask new questions:
                     what nodes appear across participants, what nodes receive the largest size, are nodes
                     consistently connected to the same central node across participants, and were most
                     participants thinking more about their own lives or about wider society? Of course,
                     such
                     analysis needs perpetually to return to the data’s source and thus the theoretical
                     framework of the tool: it was a tool designed to produce data under a specific framing,
                     and so all data should be treated in relation to that framing. Here, a convergence
                     of
                     research techniques seeks to break interdisciplinary boundaries: with qualitatively
                     generated data designed in such a way as to be able to be analyzed quantitatively,
                     we
                     can further dismantle the distinction between these techniques and see the possibilities
                     for arguments that leverage multiple forms of analysis to demonstrate their claims.
                     Further, by anticipating “big data” through a qualitative design, this skirts the
                     ethical dilemmas that accompany “data-mining.” If data is to become more restricted to
                     protect privacy, then now is the time to start imagining alternative — perhaps more
                     traditionally experimental — ways to ethically source data. As an experiment, “Loss”
                     allows for the customizable generation of network data that can be employed in research
                     settings to produce quantitative and qualitative analyses that speak to one another.</div>

                     different types of data. First, “Loss” itself is data. As a freely available, publicly
                     hosted platform accessible on GitHub and with annotated code, researchers who are
                     reviewing network visualization strategies can do critical readings of the code that
                     comprises “Loss.” In the same way that mathematicians have scrutinized digital tools to
                     see how they run statistical analyses or computer scientists have critiqued different
                     programs to see which ones most effectively complete a given task, DH researchers
                     can
                     critically compare the code of a program like “Loss” to see how it posits and
                     procedurally argues for a social theory [<a class="ref" href="#burdick2012">Burdick et al. 2012</a>, 53]. Comparative critical
                     coding is not only valuable to researchers seeking to understand the social
                     ramifications of code, but it can assist designers in producing better coded tools.
                     And
                     analysis of “Loss” as a digital tool doesn’t have to be confined to its code: a vital
                     component of software is its other aesthetics, such as data visualization’s visual
                     repertoires, which work in tandem with procedural arguments to facilitate argumentation
                     through multiple rhetorical vectors [<a class="ref" href="#burdick2012">Burdick et al. 2012</a>, 42–43].</div>

                  <div class="ptext" id="p35">Second, this paper is in itself a datapoint in a larger conversation about network
                     analysis and another conversation about the use of digital tools for ethical and
                     pedagogical practices. Most network analysis tools are developed from purely
                     mathematical perspectives, and theory is then applied to the results of that math
                     by
                     outside researchers who had no hand in shaping how the tool functions. This paper
                     is
                     different in that the data — “Loss” itself — comes from a theoretical interpretation of
                     what networks mean. As a case study in the design of digital tools, this is something
                     of
                     an auto-ethnographic understanding of how it is that I, as a designer of network
                     software, translated my social theories into a tool designed for network analysis.
                     This
                     is different from saying that this is a theory paper: this is a design paper, a design
                     document the likes of which are rarely circulated because most digital tools are not
                     developed under specific, self-critical theoretical frameworks. Perhaps it is reductive
                     to call this “data,” but in the under-utilized world of critical design, researchers are
                     often looking for interlocutors whose work they can examine for its handling of biases
                     and latent assumptions [<a class="ref" href="#bardzell2013">Bardzell and Bardzell 2013</a>]. Quite literally, the process of
                     design becomes data for investigation.</div>
                  
                  <div class="counter"><a href="#p36">36</a></div>
                  <div class="ptext" id="p36">Finally, “Loss” offers one way of employing data visualization techniques to grapple
                     with the questions of loss, removal, and figurational thinking. It is a specific
                     strategy for both analyzing and communicating people’s experiences of loss and removal,
                     but it is certainly one of many ways to procedurally address systems. The website
                     recognizes this, writing, “We are increasingly able to recognize systems for what they
                     are, but they remain difficult to capture in their entirety. Moreover, each person
                     experiences these systems differently. This is an open question: how would you think
                     through loss and removal? How would you visualize it, communicate it to others?” It then
                     gives users the space to express their strategies for visualizing loss, though this
                     information is not collected, merely used as a primer for the tool to come. Under
                     the
                     framework of experimental critical design, one could imagine asking participants to
                     design an online tool that imagines loss — while I was building this tool, people
                     who I
                     shared my prototypes with had their own ideas for how one could go about visualizing
                     and
                     playing with the concept of removal. The divergent perspectives on how to procedurally
                     represent loss are a final way in which critical design can constitute data; the process
                     of design, opened up to many interlocutors, becomes a way of getting at people’s social
                     theories of the world.</div>

                  <div class="ptext" id="p37">It’s important to reiterate that under the “critical design as data” perspective, it is
                     the design itself that is data: the design of “Loss,” the design-document and theory
                     behind “Loss,” and the ways that “Loss” could be leveraged to access other people’s
                     design ideas, which then become data. In recognizing that designs are social theories,
                     we can use “designs” to access theoretical dialogues — among designers or any group of
                     people. This is inherently sociological: by using the design frameworks offered by
                     digital humanities, researchers can obtain data about people’s understanding of the
                     social world. </div>

                  <div class="ptext" id="p39">“Loss” is an articulation of how a sociological theory can be implemented in a digital
                     tool. The joint resources of digital humanities’ emphasis on design and the social
                     science’s emphasis on theoretical frameworks allowed for a self-critical examination
                     of
                     how “Loss” attempts to implement its social theory through procedural argumentation. And
                     as a tool for experimentation, “Loss” could be leveraged to produce new data that would
                     challenge the theory presented in its original design. Critical design allows for
                     a
                     deeper interrogation of the theories that structure our digital designs, the data
                     they
                     produce, and how both the designs and their theories become data for investigation
                     as we
                     strive to develop better tools — in viewing “Loss” through this lens, its design must
                     become defensible so as to justify the arguments it procedurally makes and the data
                     it
                     procedurally produces. Where this paper diverges from other perspectives is in its
                     leveraging of digital humanities design ideas — like procedural rhetoric — to approach
                     sociological questions. As a sociologist, I’ve often compared the work of interviewing
                     and content analysis to the work of a critical close-reader — in each case, the
                     sociologist extracts social meaning by examining the rhetorical strategies of language
                     or visualization found in interview transcripts or online posts. Now, it is the same
                     —
                     social meaning is extracted from a close-reading of procedure and procedural rhetoric
                     to
                     understand how social understandings are systematized. </div>

                  <div class="ptext" id="p40">While there are prominent examples of digital tools that are designed with a critical
                     reflexivity, standard practice in the digital humanities, as well as data science
                     and
                     the social sciences, is to employ tools that go uninterrogated. Further, DH has stayed
                     closer to “critique” than to design, typically employing tools designed for other fields
                     or general use. This has limited how DH is able to be productive: both how it is able
                     to
                     produce theoretically-rigorous, content-specific tools and how it is able to produce
                     its
                     own data for investigation. “Loss” is certainly not pathbreaking in its design nor its
                     theory, but it is a proposition for both DH and sociology, a proposition for
                     productively designing tools that are made to generate data not available elsewhere,
                     data that springs from a robust design intentions.</div>

                  <div class="ptext" id="p41">Corporate tools face the scrutiny of the market to establish themselves, but academia
                     is not gifted with a talent for creating viral, widely-used digital platforms. Tools
                     are
                     used for hyper-specific purposes, they become obsolete or unsupported, or they’re
                     designed without a strong enough team from different fields. For a DH that matters,
                     academia must recognize the necessity of interdisciplinary collaboration as opposed
                     to
                     market competition, the collective power of designing socially-empowering and productive
                     digital tools. And academia shouldn’t forget its place in education: As the digital
                     divide in businesses and schools grow, DH can more concretely position itself as public
                     discipline engaged in digital pedagogy and committed to digital literacy that can
                     overcome the tendency of technology to further segregate people based on class, race,
                     and education [<a class="ref" href="#henderson2011">Henderson 2011</a>]. DH can seek a mutually-beneficial relationship with the
                     public: designing tools for public use that can be leveraged by researchers to collect
                     ethical and unique data while also remaining engaging and educative, tools that people
                     would enjoy using and might even find useful and instructive.</div>

                     If
                     digital tools are reshaping society, we need to be critical in our design of tools.
                     If
                     data is the new oil, then we shouldn’t become the new oil barons, chasing data at
                     any
                     cost. This is not to limit the work of researchers but to suggest that there are
                     productive affordances of digital design that can open up new methods and strategies
