                     dependencies. We now know a great deal, mostly from our own mistakes, about how
                     not to build robust, long-lasting digital resources, and we have developed a set

                  <div class="ptext" id="p2">What is now the Humanities Computing and Media Centre (HCMC) at the University of
                     Victoria was once simply the Language Centre, a unit whose role was to maintain
                     language laboratories and computer workstations and to write software
                     applications used for language teaching courses. We had both Macintosh and
                     Windows workstations, and would typically write custom software for either
                     platform but not both, since writing cross-platform software applications was
                     quite difficult in the days before the World Wide Web (WWW) and Java. When the
                     Web first appeared, we seized on it enthusiastically as a practical way to
                     provide language-teaching resources which could be delivered not only on both
                     kinds of workstation in our labs but also to other locations. When JavaScript
                     emerged around 1996, we were blessed with the capability to create truly
                     interactive programmed teaching exercises, and by the turn of the millenium we
                     had built language-teaching exercise collections for many languages, as well as
                     desktop authoring tools to make the creation of such pages easy for non-coders
                     (<a href="#arneilHolmes1998">Arneil and Holmes 1998</a>, <a href="#arneilHolmes1999">1999</a>, and <a href="#arneilHolmes2001">2001</a>).</div>

                  <div class="ptext" id="p3">The materials we created during this period still exist, and they still work
                     perfectly. Examples can be seen in the Indonesian course materials created in
                     1999 (<a class="ref" href="https://web.uvic.ca/hrd/indonesian/">https://web.uvic.ca/hrd/indonesian/</a>) and the
                     endearingly-dated “Web Language” online presentation
                     ([<a class="ref" href="#holmes1997">Holmes 1997</a>]), originally created in 1997 and last updated
                     in 1999. The latter includes a feedback form which is still regularly used, so
                     it still clearly has some relevance despite its appearance. The HTML and
                     JavaScript is still fully functional, although non-standards-based cutting-edge
                     technologies of the time, such as RealAudio, no longer work of course.</div>

                  <div class="ptext" id="p4">In the early 2000s, the Language Centre was transformed into the Humanities
                     Computing and Media Centre, and given a wider mandate to support what was then
                     commonly termed Humanities Computing, now Digital Humanities. Better-funded
                     projects came along, and more ambitious coding was undertaken, supporting not
                     only language-teaching resources but also digital edition projects, historical
                     datasets, mapping initiatives, and many other research and teaching activities.
                     In particular, we developed some expertise in TEI and the XML-related languages,
                     and began to create large online document collections such as the <cite class="title italic">Colonial Despatches</cite> project (<a class="ref" href="https://bcgenesis.uvic.ca/">https://bcgenesis.uvic.ca/</a>) and <cite class="title italic">Le Mariage
                        sous l’Ancien Régime</cite> (<a class="ref" href="https://mariage.uvic.ca/">https://mariage.uvic.ca/</a>). In
                     place of static (albeit interactive) web pages, we started to build more
                     sophisticated web applications based on PHP/MySQL database stacks and the eXist
                     XML database.<a class="noteRef" href="#d3e268">[1]</a> Now blessed with our own server infrastructure thanks to the
                     ground-breaking Canadian TaPOR (Text-Analysis Portal) initiative, we were able
                     to run Tomcat, Cocoon, Postgresql, and a host of other backends to support the
                     growing variety of DH projects under way at our institution.</div>
                  
                  
                  <div class="counter"><a href="#p5">5</a></div>
                  <div class="ptext" id="p5">These server-side systems enabled us (along with the rest of the DH community) to
                     build resources which were more coherent and easier to maintain; information
                     about a single entity, individual, or place could be encoded or stored in a
                     single record, but retrieved and displayed in a multitude of contexts wherever
                     it was needed. Documents could be transcribed and encoded once, but decorated
                     and rendered in many different ways based on the needs of the user or the
                     application context. Sophisticated searching, grouping, and presentation options
                     were easy to implement. Beginning in 2003 we generated a large number of these
                     projects; our servers were well-populated and their CPUs were busy running
                     XQuery, XSLT, PHP, SQL, and even ASP code.</div>
                  
                  
                  <div class="counter"><a href="#p6">6</a></div>
                  <div class="ptext" id="p6">As Lou Burnard (<a href="#burnard2016">2016</a>) remarks, “nothing in digital form is ever really
                     finished.” DH projects may languish untended and unloved for periods
                     of time, but their progenitors typically intend to continue working on them
                     periodically or when funding allows. Setting up such projects implies a
                     commitment to maintaining them, and as our project portfolio burgeoned, so did
                     our maintenance burden. As we moved into the 2010s and onwards, a clear pattern
                     began to emerge: projects created in the 1990s continued to work as intended
                     with virtually no maintenance at all, but the projects we had built on
                     sophisticated backend systems such as MySQL and eXist required frequent and
                     time-consuming maintenance work. As an example, the <cite class="title italic">Robert
                        Graves Diary</cite> (<a class="ref" href="https://graves.uvic.ca/">https://graves.uvic.ca/</a>), one of our
                     earliest digital edition projects, was originally written based on eXist version
                     0.9 in 2003–2004; it had to be steadily revised throughout 2005–2007, and then
                     completely rewritten for eXist 1.4 in 2012, because the original
                     Tomcat/Cocoon/eXist 0.9 stack became obsolete. Then in 2014 it had to be updated
                     again. This was a project on which the core academic work had been completed in
                     the first phase of the project, but due to infrastructure churn it regularly
                     returned to haunt us. Over the years, we amassed a maintenance burden which
                     threatened to overwhelm our ability to support new projects coming through our
                     doors.</div>

                  <div class="ptext" id="p7">This problem was the impetus for Project Endings. The Web had solved for us the
                     challenge to “write once,
                     run anywhere”;<a class="noteRef" href="#d3e296">[2]</a> the issue we were now addressing was how to “write once, run forever.” Project Endings brought together a team
                     consisting of academic digital humanists, programmers, and librarians, along
                     with a selection of active, complex digital edition projects, to determine how
                     we could best plan, execute, and archive our projects in such a way that they
                     would live on indefinitely without further maintenance.</div>

                  <div class="counter"><a href="#p8">8</a></div>
                  <div class="ptext" id="p8">In the early days of the Endings project, we began to examine in detail how our
                     older digital editions and sites had progressively broken down. Some problems
                     were obvious: obsolete versions of server-side applications and services
                     (MapServer, MySQL, PHP) had been retired or replaced, and old code would not run
                     on new versions, even if new versions existed. Other failures were more subtle.
                     We investigated, for example, how successfully our applications had been
                     archived by The Internet Archive (<a class="ref" href="https://archive.org/">https://archive.org/</a>) and
                     reproduced on the Wayback Machine (<a class="ref" href="https://archive.org/web/">https://archive.org/web/</a>). It
                     was immediately obvious that sites built on backend databases, where
                     “pages” were in fact queries to the database, were very problematic.
                     The project <cite class="title italic">Le Mariage sous l’Ancien Régime</cite>, which
                     linked to its anthology documents using URLs that queried the server (e.g.
                     	<span class="monospace">http://mariage.uvic.ca/xhtml.xq?id=le_bourgeoise_desprit</span>), was
                     scarcely archived at all, presumably because the archive crawler was unable to
                     follow or parse the query-based links successfully, so for the most part, the
                     archived versions of the site consist mainly of notices that “The Wayback Machine has not archived that URL.”</div>

                     that functionality relied entirely on JavaScript, the required CSS files had
                     been retrieved and stored as though they were HTML pages, and no styling
                     appeared on the site pages at all. Site search engines failed completely, as did
                     any annotation popups linked from texts which relied on retrieving data by
                     querying the backend database, and JavaScript-based interactivity was generally
                     broken. In fact, the majority of our large-scale, high-profile digital edition
                     projects were scarcely functional at all in the Wayback Machine, and most of

                     was disappointing to discover how unsuccessful it had been in its attempts to
                     crawl and reproduce our sites. Although some of these failures could perhaps be
                     laid at the door of the Internet Archive crawler, Heritrix, which had some
                     limitations, most of them were clearly our fault, and resulted from our crude
                     approach to URL construction. One site, the <cite class="title italic">Robert Graves
                        Diary</cite>, was represented by only a handful of static pages, since the
                     majority of its content was designed to be accessed through explicit searches
                     from the home page, with the search parameters encoded in URL query strings; the
                     crawler would have had no way to know what pages existed on the site other than
                     the few information and background pages linked directly from the home page. On
                     the live versions of these sites, any pages accessed by a user were typically
                     constructed on the fly by XQuery and XSLT, so they did not exist in any form
                     which could be backed up even locally by any normal method.</div>

                     our own institution revealed other problems. Some sites and applications
                     included hard-coded links to local resources using absolute URLs rather than
                     relative ones, so if the site were replicated in a different location, it would
                     still be dependent on, and prone to send the user over to, the original
                     site.</div>

                  <div class="ptext" id="p12">Another problem faced by projects backed by online databases was a lack of
                     consistency in versioning of content. Typically, multiple project members had
                     rights to upload new material directly into the live database, thus
                     “publishing” it, but there was no attempt to ensure that the current
                     state of the live site was — in Endings parlance — coherent, consistent, and
                     complete (see [<a class="ref" href="#holmesTakeda2019b">Holmes and Takeda 2019b</a>]). Someone editing a primary
                     source text might upload a new chapter to the site, forgetting that it contained
                     links to newly-added people in the personography or locations in the
                     placeography which also needed to be uploaded, so those links would fail. Every
                     “page” might have a different publication date, and the site overall
                     had no version or edition information, so anyone citing it would be forced to
                     fall back on the rather unfortunate “last accessed” date to anchor their
                     citation, knowing that the specific version of the document they were citing
                     might change tomorrow with no warning and no way to retrieve the previous
                     version. This was a problem of project organization rather than a technical
                     issue, and it arose largely out of the working methods emerging in the early
                     2000s. In the excitement provoked by the new affordances and publication
                     possibilities inherent in digital projects, there was a tendency to publish
                     anything and everything as quickly as possible. A measured and thoughtful
                     approach to “rolling publication” is of course possible, but, as we discuss
                     in section 5.5, our work on Endings has convinced us that for most projects, a
                     more traditional edition-based methodology is better.</div>

                     projects either rebuild their applications in repeated cycles of funding, or see
                     them languish and ultimately disappear. Our situation was perhaps more pointed
                     and critical because we are a base-funded unit with a long lifetime, committed
                     to maintaining our projects even after their initial funding is exhausted. Units

                     electronic device that was designed to mimic a pet animal by requiring regular
                     attention — feeding, education, play — from its owner in order to keep it
                     healthy. Our digital edition projects had become rather like Tamagotchis in
                     requiring constant tending simply to keep them functional. Slightly older
                     readers, however, may remember a similar, pre-digital fad from the 1980s. The
                     Pet Rock was exactly what it purported to be: a piece of rock, which required
                     nothing whatsoever from its owner. “A rock would not need to be
                     fed, walked, bathed, or groomed, and it would not die, become sick, or be

                        that documentation is frequently the last task on the agenda and therefore
                        likely to be curtailed or neglected when funding runs out or deadlines
                        approach ([<a class="ref" href="#morgan2021">Morgan 2021</a>]). The Endings survey found that

                           advantages over keeping documentation segregated and private. First,
                           since the documentation is published with the edition, it will always
                           travel with the published product, increasing the likelihood that future
                           researchers will be able to make sense of our materials and adopt or
                           repurpose them easily. Second, the visibility of our documentation helps
                           to keep us honest. Documentation is less prone to be aspirational and
                           more likely to reflect the reality of our praxis if users of our
                           editions can read it alongside the editions themselves, and point out
                           any failures or discrepancies.</div>

                           making it as amenable as possible to copying and repurposing. While this
                           article is mainly concerned with overcoming the technical barriers to
                           digital longevity, it must also be noted that any materials or data
                           accompanied by any sort of restrictive covenant or license will
                           inevitably be less appealing to a future researcher considering making
                           use of it. In the same way, the LOCKSS preservation strategy requires
                           the collaboration of multiple institutions willing to host project
                           products over the long term, and this is much less likely to happen if
                           licensing issues make it more difficult to deliver the materials to the
                           institution’s end-users in a convenient way. Therefore we strongly
                           recommend that projects, where possible, make all their materials
                           available under generous Creative Commons licenses, open-source all
                           their code, and avoid depending on any proprietary data, programming,
                           libraries, or other resources. For example, it is far better to try to
                           acquire your own copy of a historical text and scan the pages yourself
                           than to build a digital edition around page-images supplied under
                           license by a corporation or other rights-holder who may restrict access

                        framework, or tool that will work for every case. So the principles below
                        are necessarily technology-agnostic and, while our own personal preferences
                        may become apparent from the examples, we do not advocate for one “stack”
                        over another. But there is certainly no shortage of processing pipelines for
                        creating static sites. The uptake of the “JAMstack” (Javascript, API,
                        and Markup) — a movement that grew out of the popularity of Node.js and NPM
                        and is now closely allied with static asset providers like GitHub, Netlify,
                        and Amazon S3 — has lead to both the popularization and proliferation of
                        static site generators, such as Next.js, Hugo, and Jekyll.<a class="noteRef" href="#d3e552">[8]</a> Within the digital humanities, proponents
                        of “minimal computing” have mobilized these tools to create frameworks
                        that significantly minimize the barriers to access in creating static
                        digital editions and digital exhibits.<a class="noteRef" href="#d3e556">[9]</a></div>

                        processing produces a site that is archivable and sustainable in the long
                        term. The Endings team was made painfully aware of this in the creation of
                        our own Endings website, which was built initially using GitHub Pages and a
                        pre-built Jekyll template. Though completely static, the site violated many
                        core Endings principles: it was comprised of malformed, invalid HTML that
                        relied on Bootstrap 4 and a set of JQuery-based JavaScript to handle various
                        UI components. The site has since been developed into valid XHTML5 with all
                        JQuery dependencies replaced by CSS3 and all updates handled by XSL
                        transformations managed by an Ant build script. The problem with the old
                        Endings site was not that it was built with Jekyll and that, had we just
                        used Ant and XSL in the first place, all of our problems would have been
                        solved; rather, the main issue was that the processing was meant only to
                        create a static site, and not one that was coherent, consistent, complete,

                           project build process. TEI XML files are always accompanied by a schema,
                           and validation of those files is always the first step in the build;
                           encoders should not normally commit invalid files to the repository, but
                           this does happen from time to time. In the same way, the various other
                           versions of XML that may be generated as part of the build process
                           should also be validated to ensure they are functional and therefore
                           useful to other projects. Naturally, output HTML also requires
                           validation, and the W3C’s validator, which is available as a Java JAR
                           file (vnu.jar), is simple to use for this purpose. We use CSS code not
                           only in HTML output but also within TEI XML as a convenient formal
                           language to describe the layout and appearance of primary source texts;
                           this CSS can be extracted and validated using the same W3C validator,
                           ensuring that our descriptions are logical and processable by any CSS

                        <div class="ptext" id="p34">At its most basic, the processing for an Endings-compliant site could
                           simply be a single individual who lovingly encodes an HTML document by
                           hand and, after validating it against the W3C’s HTML validator, uploads
                           it to their server. Most projects, however, require a more robust
                           technical pipeline that can rearrange, transform, and aggregate their
                           source materials into a fully functioning web application. While these
                           builds should be able to be run locally, the project team seldom
                           requires a local version as the project building is managed by a
                           Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment server (CI/CD). Our
                           Jenkins server polls each repository and whenever it detects any change,
                           it re-runs the entire build process, deleting all of the old artifacts
                           and creating them anew.</div>

                           milliseconds, our build processes can seem painfully slow and massively
                           inefficient: changing a single character in a single file initiates an
                           entire re-build of the site, which, depending on the size of the
                           project, can take anywhere from a few minutes to two hours. Much of that
                           time is spent not on building the HTML products that comprise the final
                           site, but on relentlessly validating any and all inputs and outputs.
                           However, this processing is mechanical and generally requires no

                           entire project rebuild. But any given change may have significant
                           repercussions throughout a document collection. A change to someone’s
                           biography may affect every page which mentions that person; a change in
                           a gazetteer may propagate through dozens of maps. In practice, it is
                           often very complicated to pin down exactly which components of a site
                           must be rebuilt following a change, and it is far more straightforward
                           just to rebuild everything. This also ensures that site-wide
                           edition/version information (which in the case of our sites usually
                           includes the source code repository revision number from which the site

                           version control and should ideally reside in the same repository as the
                           source data, which ensures that the data and the code are always in sync
                           and thus makes rebuilding a project at a particular version trivial.
                           This also means that all dependencies, including external JAR files and
                           binaries, should be stored in the repository when the terms of the
                           software permit (open-source software here is, of course, preferred).
                           While it is a good idea to build routines into your processing that
                           check for updates, upgrading a dependency should always be the
                           developer’s responsibility and not something performed silently in the
                           background by a package manager; the repository should always contain
                           the last version of the dependency that works with the rest of the code,
                           such that the processing can work even when that version, the

                              the most successful and prolific invention in the history of human
                              communication. Its current scale dwarfs the entire prior history of
                              text, and it continues to expand at an astonishing rate. Underlying its
                              functionality are three core languages: the markup language HTML, the
                              style language CSS, and the scripting language JavaScript (ECMAScript),
                              all of which are well-managed by standards bodies. This trio of

                              applications, EPUB documents, and many other forms of communication are
                              also built on the base technologies of the Web, all of which are
                              relatively simple and easy even for beginners to understand and

                              simple; rarely do developers sit down and code HTML documents and write
                              plain CSS. Instead, they tend to import large packaged libraries of
                              existing code to generate the end-user Web pages we consume. Large
                              coding frameworks for creating web-based resources come and go at a
                              remarkable speed. At the time of writing, Angular, React, Vue,
                              Express.js, Meteor, and Node are all popular JavaScript frameworks,
                              while JQuery, Dojo, MooTools, and others have fallen out of favour; by
                              the time you read this, the situation will certainly have changed again.
                              The same is true of database-dependent content-creation and delivery
                              tools such as WordPress, Ruby on Rails, Drupal, Joomla, and others, as
                              well as all of the tempting “free” services that have enabled DH
                              practitioners to create intriguing mash-ups and to decorate their work
                              with data from other sources. All of these efforts promise rapid site
                              development at the cost of long-term maintenance issues. As Jim Nielsen
                              (<a href="#nielsenJim2021">2021</a>) and others have pointed
                              out, this creates an ecosystem in which “all web languages — HTML, CSS, and JS — are
                              compile targets.” Programmers, in other words, no longer need
                              to code directly in the target languages and instead become specialists
                              in a few fashionable frameworks, chasing the changing fashions year by
                              year.</div>

                           <div class="ptext" id="p44">And yet, the trifecta of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript is remarkably
                              powerful. We know that because ultimately, all of those other languages,
                              frameworks, and tools — from MySQL+PHP to PostGresql+Python to
                              RethinkDB+Node.js — basically do one thing: they produce
                              HTML/CSS/JavaScript Web pages, and those Web pages do all the things we
                              need them to do. And while each of those technologies or frameworks or
                              back-end services will eventually stop working, it is extremely unlikely
                              that Web pages themselves will cease to function. One of the most
                              remarkable things about HTML, CSS, and JavaScript is that over 20+ years
                              of development, they have retained impressive levels of backward
                              compatibility. The first Web pages ever created still work perfectly

                              and, as noted above, the first projects we created at HCMC in the 1990s
                              and early 2000s are also still perfectly functional. Given the
                              astonishing quantity of resources built and delivered through HTML, CSS,
                              and JavaScript, there is a strong chance that they will continue to
                              function over the long term; and when they do, perhaps, alter in ways
                              that make older forms of text less usable, there will be
                              readily-available migration pathways and tools that can bring along
                              everything that survives and is worth preserving. The same will not be

                           may be copied, quoted, reused or resold without the originator’s

                           practical, stand alone, and therefore we usually generate our HTML
                           outputs from the standalone versions of our XML source. Rather than
                           having a document link to thirty external prosopography entries that
                           live in other documents on the site, why not simply incorporate copies
                           of all those entries inside the document itself? Text is typically small
                           and compressible compared with some other digital resources. If we make
                           a point of replicating all required linked records such as bibliographic
                           citations, toponymic variants, and personography entries inside each
                           individual document, any user can take a single HTML page and use it
                           elsewhere without having to resolve a large number of pointers and
                           retrieve a set of external resources to make the document functional.
                           This of course means that the same individual personography entries may
                           be replicated hundreds of times across a collection. This seems

                           it is rarely implemented in a practical way. Many modern websites depend

                           (imagine Google Docs or Office 365 without scripting), which makes it
                           impractical for ordinary users to turn off JavaScript in their web
                           browsers; consequently, no-one ever does, and graceful degradation is

                           bibliographical data, and so on, as we recommend above, then it can

                           earliest web pages of the 1990s. Through progressive enhancement,
                           JavaScript may turn links to footnotes into buttons that generate
                           convenient popups, but the underlying page structure can be plain and
                           functional even in the absence of CSS and JavaScript. This makes
                           “relentless” validation and link-checking trivial to implement

                        <div class="ptext" id="p56">Although it is perfectly practical to create an entirely static
                           client-side JavaScript search engine for digital edition sites (see
                           below, where we discuss the staticSearch engine we have created and use
                           on all our static sites), it may be more convenient or practical to take
                           advantage of search functionality available from a third-party provider
                           such as Google, or an institutional host running a central search engine
                           such as Solr. Indeed, it might be argued that search functionality is
                           not a fundamental component of a digital edition, but rather a feature
                           of the broader context of the Internet itself. However, if you take this
                           view, and create an external dependency, it is vital to realize that the
                           dependency is likely to fail at some point, and to consider that this
                           feature of your digital edition is nonpermanent. External systems alter
                           their APIs as well as their terms and conditions frequently, and if
                           no-one is around to maintain the articulation of such dependencies, the
                           functionality will not persist. This may be an acceptable compromise;
                           for example, in the case of a small site with limited programming
                           resources, it may be reasonable to assume that some kind of generalized
                           search engine such as Bing or Google will always be available, and that
                           such tools will automatically index a site and provide sophisticated
                           users with methods of searching within that specific site, and in such a
                           case, a dedicated search engine is not required. On the other hand, most
                           digital editions have rich metadata that lends itself well to customized
                           search pages with search filters based on date, document type, language,
                           and many other idiosyncratic features of their specific dataset which
                           will never be supported by a generic search engine.</div>

                           as React or Angular, there are cases where using an external library is the only sensible
                           option. One example is cryptography: as <a href="#jakobsenOrlandi2016">Jakobsen and Orlandi 2016</a> note, “well-studied, provably secure encryption schemes that achieve strong definitions of
                           security (e.g., authenticated-encryption) are to be preferred to home-brewed encryption
                           schemes”  [<a class="ref" href="#jakobsenOrlandi2016">Jakobsen and Orlandi 2016</a>, 113]. Similarly, while it is possible to write your own mapping tools, the cost in time
                           and money to do so for a single project is most likely prohibitive; it is much more
                           practical to import and use an existing library such as Leaflet or OpenLayers. The
                           important factor when integrating external libraries into a codebase is to choose
                           them wisely. A relatively small library which is designed to do one specific job (such
                           as mapping or cryptography) very well, and itself has no external dependencies, is
                           a much better prospect than a general-purpose collection of functions and APIs trying
                           to do a thousand things and pulling in hundreds of secondary dependencies to support
                           them.</div>

                           service of some kind. Mapping is another obvious example here; very few projects are
                           going to be in a position to run their own map tile servers, so they will rely on
                           publicly-available services such as Open Street Maps or Bing Maps. These services
                           will eventually cease operation, change their APIs, or change their terms of use,
                           and the maps will stop working, but as long as they are not crucial to the main purpose
                           of the site, this is not a disaster. The important thing is to build this expectation
                           into the project plan.</div>

                           the future. For this reason, it is important to ensure that such external dependencies
                           are not providing functionality which is completely crucial to your digital edition.
                           You can also mitigate the possibility of such failures by ensuring that (for example)
                           your site has rich and exhaustive pre-compiled index pages so that users can find
                           their way to desired documents without using a search engine, and that key components
                           such as the names of people and places help to provide a network of linking throughout
                           the edition, offering the user many paths through the data.</div>

                        <div class="ptext" id="p62">In the world of traditional print scholarship, a publication is a coherent singular
                           object, released on a particular day in a particular place, and provided with a convenient
                           edition number which enabled scholars to cite it without ambiguity.<a class="noteRef" href="#d3e843">[12]</a> However, many digital edition projects have adopted a “rolling release” approach modelled on the predominant approach to software publication, where corrections
                           and new features are steadily made to a mutable product. Typos and errors on a single
                           page are quickly fixed and the site can be endlessly tweaked as new problems are inevitably
                           discovered.</div>

                        <div class="ptext" id="p63">This “rolling release” model, however, makes it difficult to maintain consistency, coherence, and completeness
                           as the site is in a perpetual state of flux; pages are constantly subject to change,
                           and thus the project as a whole is always shifting. Not only does this make stable
                           citation problematic, but it makes archiving difficult. Most large projects go through
                           moribund phases in which work largely stops, and will most likely end in a similar
                           way, and so it is essential that whatever is the current released state (edition)
                           of a project constitutes an acceptable version for the long term. The edition model
                           of digital publication ensures the stability and coherence of the project; much like
                           a print publication, each edition of a digital publication should be planned carefully,
                           with deadlines and milestones governing its release.<a class="noteRef" href="#d3e852">[13]</a></div>

                        <div class="ptext" id="p64">The irreversible nature of print publication means that an edition is often scrutinized
                           and carefully proofed prior to publication. In the “rolling release” model, since digital material is much easier to correct and changes can be applied
                           soon after they are found, it is far less common for this level of diligent inspection
                           to be applied to digital editions. Since each release is organized around a set of
                           milestones and goals, much of this scrutiny can be automated (see 5.3.2). In [<a class="ref" href="#holmesTakeda2019b">Holmes and Takeda 2019b</a>], we describe three distinct levels of diagnostic checks which can be incorporated
                           into a project build process to provide mechanical proof that no links are broken,
                           no content is missing, and all planned content and features are complete. This approach,
                           combined with the detailed proofreading we would expect to apply to any scholarly
                           publication prior to release, not only minimizes flaws in the released edition, but
                           also ensures that each edition is archivable.<a class="noteRef" href="#d3e865">[14]</a></div>

                  <div class="ptext" id="p68">With these Principles in place, we were able to convert the dormant projects, such
                     as <cite class="title italic">The Robert Graves Diary</cite>, and the on-going projects, like <cite class="title italic">The Map of Early Modern London</cite>, from unwieldy eXist applications into a large bundle of static HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
                     Our intention was that these static incarnations look and function identically to
                     the previous live application and, as these sites were steadily released and tested,
                     we were happy to find that this process was not only feasible, but significantly improved
                     the projects. Our staticization of <cite class="title italic">Graves</cite>, for instance, surfaced various encoding errors that had gone unnoticed for many
                     years, which we could now easily diagnose and fix. And in moving from a dynamic application
                     to the static site, we had the opportunity to re-write the codebase from scratch,
                     removing the layers of obsolete code that had sedimented within the codebase over
                     its long history of updates, maintenance and modernization of the CSS and JavaScript.
                     Projects in active development benefitted similarly; these re-writes provided a good
                     opportunity to scrutinize the project, lopping off irrelevant or deprecated code.
                     Thanks to our Jenkins Continuous Integration server, following any change to the source
                     data or the processing, we no longer needed to click anxiously around the site to
                     confirm that we hadn’t broken the anything: any encoder could simply commit, wait
                     a few minutes, and then, so long as the Jenkins server didn’t send its “BUILD FAILED” message, proof their changes in the context of the site.</div>

                  <div class="ptext" id="p69">But these sites all lacked a significant and crucial part of their functionality:
                     search. Most digital editions require some form of text-based searching and, in many
                     cases, the ability to search across a large and disparate document collection and
                     aggregate documents based on multiple metrics is the project’s raison d’être. Search
                     was, in other words, non-negotiable — we could not sacrifice the robust search mechanisms
                     on the existing site. We could quietly ignore search for the time being in some projects,
                     like <cite class="title italic">The Map Of Early Modern London</cite>, where search was peripheral to the main functionality, but <cite class="title italic">The Robert Graves Diary</cite> forced us to come up with a real solution: the homepage for the project was essentially
                     one large, faceted search page, which we were able to replicate perfectly, but since
                     search itself was handled entirely by eXist, the static version was rendered completely
                     inert.</div>

                     static. While some client-side search solutions were available, they were ill-equipped
                     to handle the thousands of documents, millions of words, and complex metadata structures

                     into a XAR bundle and spin up a simple eXist instance whose only job would be to index,
                     query, and retrieve the search results from the static HTML pages. Of course, this
                     worked perfectly and we released the first version of a number of our static sites
                     following this approach. But it was a disappointing compromise. We had gone through
                     the trouble of re-writing these sites in their entirety to remove the fragility inherent
                     in their dependency on eXist, and had celebrated our success in building completely
                     static, serverless websites, and now here we were, returning to eXist, hat in hand.</div>

                     the situation; in the spirit of LOCKSS and following our principle for “Graceful Failure” (5.4.7),  we decided to take a decidedly maximalist approach. Using <cite class="title italic">Graves</cite> as our case-study, we supplemented eXist with three distinct approaches, which all
                     had their own limitations with respect to functionality, archiving, and sustainability,
                     but could provide something of a safety net for the project. We discuss these approach
                     in greater detail in [<a class="ref" href="#holmesTakeda2018">Holmes and Takeda 2018</a>], but, in brief, those three approaches were: 1) a Google search widget, which would
                     not offer anything beyond what Google already provides, but at least gave users a
                     shortcut for a site-specific search; 2) an experimental interface for querying a Solr
                     index provided by the UVic Library (the eventual archival home for all of these projects),
                     which could provide many of the faceting and filtering structures required by the
                     project; and 3) a “standalone search,” a Javascript-only client-side text search interface that would stem user input and
                     match it against an pre-built inverted index generated during the build process. In
                     this process, a list of distinct words was created for each document; the words were
                     then run through the Python implementation of the Porter Stemmer, and then documents
                     were grouped by stem, so that JavaScript could return a simple list of the documents
                     in which that stem appeared. This solution, as we noted then, worked well for small
                     document collections, but lacked the necessary features — keyword-in-context, search
                     faceting, and filtering — and thus should be considered the “ultimate fallback when all else fails”  [<a class="ref" href="#holmesTakeda2018">Holmes and Takeda 2018</a>, 59].</div>

                     side dependencies. Now implemented by nearly a dozen projects, staticSearch has not
                     only allowed us to replicate server-side search functionality, but has significantly
                     expanded what these searches can do. So to revise our answer to the question from

                        file, which is then downloaded to the client, and queried by JavaScript in the search.
                        Obviously, the larger a document collection, the larger the index, and any site consisting
                        of more than a few dozen pages will rapidly outgrow this approach. The key insight
                        which enabled us to create staticSearch was the idea that the search page need only
                        download those components of the index it actually requires to respond to a specific
                        query. Instead of a single large index, we create thousands of individual JSON files,
                        one for each stemmed term, and the text search component of the search page simply
                        stems all the search terms and retrieves only the specific JSON files for each of
                        those terms. This enables rapid query response even for large sites.</div>

                     <div class="ptext" id="p75">Of course, text search alone is not enough; search facets such as topic, document
                        type, date range, and other metadata-based filters are a fundamental requirement for
                        searching digital editions and other rich document collections. One by one, we have
                        added support for a range of these features, which can be configured by the addition
                        of HTML <span class="monospace">&lt;meta&gt;</span> elements with specific patterns to site pages. The staticSearch indexing process
                        works its way through the HTML pages of a site indexing the text but also searching
                        for these <span class="monospace">&lt;meta&gt;</span> elements, building a collection of distinct JSON files which the search page can
                        retrieve as needed to respond to queries and filter results.</div>

                     storage, digital archiving initiatives have largely focused on data storage and management
                     (see [<a class="ref" href="#molloy2011">Molloy 2011</a>] or [<a class="ref" href="#interpares2013">InterPARES 2013</a>] for examples). Back in 2002, for instance, <a href="#gelawEtAl2002">Gelaw et al.</a> noted that “It is now common knowledge that digital information is fragile in ways that differ
                     from traditional technologies, such as paper or microfilm. The fact that information
                     is increasingly stored in digital form,[sic] has led to an accelerated search for
                     effective methods of managing electronic information resources.” However, the very title of that article, “A Metadata Approach to Preservation of Digital Resources,” underscores that, in many cases, archiving is primarily a matter of metadata; as
                     they note, the “creation of preservation metadata for electronic files and digital collections are
                     [sic] among the most important steps.” This approach treats understanding digital resources as discrete blobs to be stored
                     in large repositories with their accessibility and findability contingent on the provision
                     of effective descriptive metadata. As Goddard and Seeman write, “in order to ensure longevity, the library will make multiple copies of our digital
                     collections, aggregate them into Archival Information Packages (AIPs), and distribute
                     these archival copies in offsite locations”  [<a class="ref" href="#goddardSeeman2020">Goddard and Seeman 2020</a>].</div>

                  <div class="ptext" id="p79">For end-users not able to access archiving services from libraries or similar institutions,
                     there are also archiving services available on the Web, such as Zenodo (offered by
                     CERN, <a class="ref" href="https://zenodo.org/">https://zenodo.org/</a>), Preprints.org, or HAL (<a class="ref" href="https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/">https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/</a>). All of these, however, follow a similar model: a single binary object such as an
                     article is uploaded and associated with metadata. Datasets may also be attached, but
                     these are viewed as objects to download. This kind of archiving, while it may be a
                     useful backup strategy (and we can never have enough of those), will not make a digital
                     edition project (i.e. a complex website) available in the way a user would want to
                     access it: as a functioning website. The Text Encoding Initiative, for example, archives
                     each version of its standards package, consisting of schemas, exemplars and other
                     documentation, on Zenodo, but the end user can only download a zipped package of materials;
                     they cannot browse and read the TEI Guidelines itself, as they can on the TEI’s own
                     website. As we have suggested above, if a digital edition is to remain relevant, to
                     continue to be read, cited, and hold its place in scholarly dialogue, it must be fully
                     functional, available, and usable; after all, as Morreale reminds us, “Humanities scholars have been taught that what they produce should be, first and foremost,
                     consumed and understood by other scholars. Once this is accomplished, they want those
                     who have received their work to reuse or build upon it, so that their contributions
                     become part of a larger conversation, one that may stretch out for years, decades,
                     or even centuries”  [<a class="ref" href="#morreale2019">Morreale 2019</a>, 4]. However, a shelved DVD copy with metadata in a catalogue or a zip archive in a distributed
                     repository does not facilitate the kinds of experience that are at the heart of a
                     digital project; only a functional website does. Saachi (<a href="#saachi2015">2015</a>), based on a now-inaccessible technical report from the National Archives of Australia,
                     offers a useful distinction between “stable artefacts” — resources preserved as blobs — and “performance”  [<a class="ref" href="#saachi2015">Saachi 2015</a>, 51ff]. “Performance” here means the direct, live access to digital objects, which, like any live performance,
                     is a unique experience bound to a specific occasion and is contingent on the availability
                     of hardware and software components.<a class="noteRef" href="#d3e1126">[19]</a> Understanding digital archives as not just “stable artefacts” but also as “performance,” as Saachi writes, “explicitly addresses the need for something concrete that needs to [be] experienced
                     by a researcher in order [to] access the essence of a record”  [<a class="ref" href="#saachi2015">Saachi 2015</a>, 53]. In other words, while it is essential that digital resources are archived as “stable artefacts,” preserving the “essence” of a digital edition requires maintaining its functionality and allowing users to
                     experience it as “performance.”</div>

                  <div class="ptext" id="p80">Librarians and archivists are now beginning to focus on this important distinction.
                     The University of Victoria Library is currently developing a “Donation policy for legacy websites,” which outlines the conditions under which an individual or a project group may transfer
                     an entire website to the library for long-term storage, with the expectation that
                     it will actually remain accessible as a website on the Internet for public access.
                     Offering such a service is not simple, though. A library presented with a Tamagotchi-style
                     web application, with dependencies on back-end databases and server-side scripting,
                     will (and should, quite rightly) reject the “donation” as it would, as we have argued, amount to the passing on of technical debt and the
                     obligation for incessant maintenance. But the static site model we have proposed and
                     implemented is not subject to these considerations. Assuming any functional webserver
                     is available, a static site can be served for the foreseeable future with no maintenance
                     burden whatsoever; only bandwidth and disk storage are required, just as is the case
                     for binary-blob digital assets in the traditional archive model. With a static site
                     approach, any given edition of a digital collection could be available in multiple
                     “locations” (i.e. at multiple URLs), hosted by different institutions, providing resilient and
                     reliable access to the resource even in the face of occasional failures or closures
                     at specific institutions.</div>
                  
                  
                  <div class="counter"><a href="#p81">81</a></div>
                  <div class="ptext" id="p81">Such a scenario presents its own challenges, though. If a site was originally offered
                     at a custom domain (www.ourfabulousproject.net), should the archiving institution
                     agree to take on the ongoing cost of preserving that domain? If there are multiple
                     incarnations of a site, how is it to be cited, and how is a reader to know that they
                     are viewing the “same” site as that cited in a publication, albeit perhaps on a different URL? This is one
                     reason that the edition management and release model proposed in section 5.5 is so
                     crucial. Each coherent, consistent, and complete edition of a digital project may
                     be archived and served from many locations, so it must be reliably and obviously consistent
                     and show clear dating and versioning information, just like an edition of a printed
                     book.</div>

                     interactive digital editions without back-end services, but our initial work was very
                     encouraging, and in fact it proved relatively straightforward to rewrite even very
                     large and complex sites such as <cite class="title italic">The Colonial Despatches</cite> (over 7,000 TEI-encoded documents) and <cite class="title italic">The Map of Early Modern London</cite> (over 12,000 pages) into simple, fast, responsive, and easily searchable static sites.
                     Other sites from our growing collection have taught us to handle a variety of different
                     types of data such as video (<cite class="title italic">Francotoile</cite>) and image collections (<cite class="title italic">MyNDIR</cite>), while the largest dataset, the <cite class="title italic">Landscapes of Injustice Archive</cite>, presents a searchable collection of over 150,000 pages representing diverse data
                     including maps, oral histories, land title records, street directories (in Japanese
                     and English), correspondence, and legal casefiles.</div>

                     would to roll out a Tamagotchi of frameworks, libraries, software, and infrastructure.
                     Once it’s done, it takes no maintenance at all, and you’re free to move on to the

                     this model provides some significant benefits in terms of digital project management.
                     For instance, milestones help prevent feature creep as each release requires careful
                     and considered planning regarding project priorities; by the same token, it allows
                     some space — when combined with Continuous Integration processing mentioned in 5.3
                     — for experimentation since there is no connection between the deployed site and the
