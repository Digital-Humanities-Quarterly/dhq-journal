                  <p>This essay discusses agent-based modeling (ABM) and its
                    potential as a technique for studying history, including
                    literary history. How can a computer simulation tell us
                    anything about the past? This essay has three distinct
                    goals. The first is simply to introduce agent-based modeling
                    as a computational practice to an audience of digital
                    humanists, for whom it remains largely unfamiliar despite
                    signs of increasing interest. Second, to introduce one
                    possible application for social simulation by comparing it
                    to conventional, print-based models of the history of book
                    publishing. Third, and most importantly, I’ll sketch out a
                    theory and preliminary method for incorporating social
                    simulation into an on-going program of humanities
                    research.</p>

                  <div class="ptext" id="p1"> This essay will discuss agent-based modeling (ABM) and its
                    potential as a technique for studying history, including
                    literary history. When confronted by historical simulations,
                    scholars first notice their unusual ontological commitments:
                    a computer model of social life creates a simulated world
                    and then subjects that world to analysis. On the surface,
                    computational modeling has many of the trappings of science,
                    but at their core simulations seem like elaborate fictions:
                    the epistemological opposite of science or history.
                    Historical simulation thus straddles two very different
                    scholarly practices. On the one hand are the generally
                    accepted practices of empirical research, which look to the
                    archive for evidence and then generalize based on that
                    evidence. On the other hand is the new and in many ways
                    idiosyncratic practice of simulation, which thinks in the
                    opposite direction. ABM begins with a theory about a real
                    system and then creates a functional replica of that system.
                    When confronted with agent-based models, historians often
                    respond with a knee-jerk (and in many ways, justified)
                    skepticism about the applicability and usefulness of
                    artificial worlds. How can a computer simulation tell us
                    anything about the past? The difficulty of this question
                    should not be understated. Nonetheless, I will propose that
                    these forms of intellectual inquiry can productively
                    coincide, and I’ll map out a research program for historians
                    curious about the possibilities opened by this new
                    technique.</div>

                  <div class="ptext" id="p3"> Agent-based modeling, sometimes called individual-based
                    modeling, is a comparatively new method of computational
                        analysis.<a class="noteRef" href="#d3e172">[1]</a> Unlike equilibrium-based
                    modeling, which uses differential equations to track
                    relationships among statistically generated aggregate
                    phenomena — like the effect of interest rates on GDP, for
                    example — ABM simulates a field of interacting entities
                    (agents) whose simple individual behaviors collectively
                    cause larger emergent phenomena. In the same regard, ABM
                    differs significantly from other kinds of computational
                    analysis prevalent in the digital humanities. Unlike text
                    mining, topic modeling, and social-network analysis, which
                    apply quantitative analysis to already existing text corpora
                    or databases, ABM creates a simulated environment and
                    measures the interactions of individual agents within that
                    environment. According to Steven F. Railsback and Volker
                    Grimm, ABMs are "models where
                        individuals or agents are described as unique and
                        autonomous entities that usually interact with each
                        other and their environment locally"
                    [<a class="ref" href="#railsback2012">Railsback 2012</a>, 10]. These local
                    interactions generate collective patterns, and the
                    intellectual work of ABM centers on identifying the
                    relationships among individual rules of behavior and the
                    larger cultural trends they might cause.</div>

                  </div>
                  <div class="ptext" id="p4"> In this way, agent-based modeling is closely associated with
                    complex-systems theory, and models are designed to simulate
                    adaptation and emergence. In the fields of ecology,
                    economics, and political science, ABM has been used to show
                    how the behaviors of individual entities — microbes,
                    consumers, and voters — emerge into new collective
                        wholes.<a class="noteRef" href="#d3e198">[2]</a>
                    John Miller and Scott Page describe complex systems: "The remarkable thing about social
                            worlds is how quickly [individual] connections and
                            change can lead to complexity. Social agents must
                            predict and react to the actions and predictions of
                            other agents. The various connections inherent in
                            social systems exacerbate these actions as agents
                            become closely coupled to one another. The result of
                            such a system is that agent interactions become
                            highly nonlinear, the system becomes difficult to
                            decompose, and complexity ensues"
                         [<a class="ref" href="#miller2007">Miller 2007</a>, 10]. At the center of complexity thus rests an underlying
                    simplicity: the great heterogeneous mass of culture in which
                    we live becomes reconfigured as an emergent effect of the
                    smaller, describable choices individuals tend to make. The
                    intellectual pay-off of social simulation comes when
                    scholars identify and replicate this surprising disjunction.
                    As Joshua Epstein and Robert Axtell argue, "it is not the emergent macroscopic
                            object per se that is surprising, but the generative
                            sufficiency of the simple local rules"
                         [<a class="ref" href="#epstein1996">Epstein 1996</a>, 52]. In this formulation, to study complex systems is to
                    wield the procedural operation of computers like Occam’s
                    Razor — by showing that simple procedures are sufficient to
                    cause complex phenomena within artificial societies, one
                    raises at least the possibility that such procedures are
                        "all that is really
                        happening" in actual systems [<a class="ref" href="#epstein1996">Epstein 1996</a>, 52].</div>

                  <div class="ptext" id="p5"> Humanists will be hesitant to accept the value of this (and
                    should be, I think), and I will return to the notion of
                        "generative sufficiency"
                    later. For now I mean only to point out the way
                    complex-systems theory elevates the local and the simple at
                    the level of interpretation: to know about the world under
                    this paradigm is to generate computer simulations that look
                    in their larger patterns more or less like reality but which
                    at the level of code are dictated by artificially simple
                    underlying processes.</div>
                  <div class="counter">
                     <a href="#p6">6</a>
                  </div>
                  <div class="ptext" id="p6"> The basic work of agent-based modeling involves writing the
                    algorithms that dictate these processes. Agent-oriented
                    programs can be written and executed from scratch in any
                    object-oriented programming language, including Python and
                    R. However, scholars looking to incorporate agent-based
                    simulations into their research often rely on out-of-the-box
                    software packages. Some, like AnyLogic, are proprietary
                    toolkits designed for commercial applications, but many are
                    open source. In their comprehensive survey of available
                    packages, Cynthia Nikolai and Gregory Madey point out that
                        "different groups of users prefer
                        different and sometimes conflicting aspects of a
                        toolkit"
                    [<a class="ref" href="#nikolai2009">Nikolai 2009</a>, 1.1]. Social scientists
                    and humanities-based researchers, they argue, tend to favor
                    easy-to-learn interfaces that require fewer programming
                    skills, while computer scientists prefer packages that can
                    be modified and repurposed. <a class="noteRef" href="#d3e242">[3]</a>

                    applicable across platforms, I will focus on examples drawn
                    from NetLogo. NetLogo is a descendent of the Logo
                    programming language, which was first designed in the 1960s
                    and became popular in primary and secondary education [<a class="ref" href="#harvey1997">Harvey 1997</a>]. Like its ancestor, NetLogo
                    creates sprites called "turtles" and moves them
                    according to unit operations called "procedures". The
                    turtles circulate in an open field of "patches," small
                    squares which can be assigned variables that change over
                    time. Like Logo, NetLogo can generate beautiful and
                    intricate visual displays from comparatively simple
                    commands. (See Figure 1.) <div id="figure01" class="figure">

                    what makes the Logo family of programming languages
                    particularly suited for agent-based simulations. (RePast
                    Simphony has adopted a similar vocabulary, called ReLogo,
                    for novice users.) Researchers Juan-Luis Suárez and Fernando
                    Sancho, inspired by their primary research on the Spanish
                    baroque as a transatlantic intellectual phenomenon, created
                    the <cite class="title italic">Virtual Culture Laboratory
                    </cite>(VCL) to model international cultural transmission.
                    The VCL (<a href="#figure02a">Figure 2</a>) creates a
                    field of individual agents that circulate among each other
                    as they cross artificially abstract cultural boundaries. The
                    world Suárez and Sancho envision is divided geographically
                    and demographically: a green nation is separated from a blue
                    nation, and both are home to agents with a mix of dominant
                    (red) and creative or passive (yellow) personalities. As the
                    agents circulate in these regions, they trade messages and
                    learn from each other. Measuring the agents’ performance
                    under different conditions allows the researchers to test
                    theories of intercultural exchange. Suárez and Sancho write,
                        "Taking the baroque as a cultural
                        system enables us to observe individual works and their
                        interactions with the human beings who create,
                        contemplate and use them, to examine the emergence of
                            'cultural' patterns from these interactions,
                        and to determine the diverse states of the resulting

                    common with games, in particular what are called
                        "serious games." Like games, models
                    simulate rule-bound behaviors and generate outcomes based on
                    those rules. Ian Bogost has described games’ intellectual
                    function: "Games represent how real and
                        imagined systems work, and they invite players to
                        interact with those systems and form judgments about
                        them"
                    [<a class="ref" href="#bogost2007">Bogost 2007</a>, vii]. In this sense, games
                    involve what Noah Wardrip-Fruin has called
                        "expressive processing." He explains:
                        "When I play a simulation game,
                        author-crafted processes determine the operations of the
                        virtual economy. There is authorial expression in what
                        these rules make possible"

                    serious games, modeling is a form of authorial expression
                    that uses procedural code to confront complex social and

                    First, it does not usually depend on direct human
                    interaction, at least not in the same sense of games in
                    which players move through a navigable space toward a
                    definite goal [<a class="ref" href="#manovich2001">Manovich 2001</a>]. There is no
                    boss to fight at the end of a social simulation. You do not
                        <em class="emph">play</em> an agent-based model. Instead, you
                        <em class="emph">play with</em> a model, tinkering with its
                    procedures and changing its variables to test how the code
                    influences agent behavior. <a class="noteRef" href="#d3e349">[5]</a> I sometimes
                    describe social simulation this way: Imagine a <cite class="title italic">Sims</cite> game in which the player
                    writes all the behaviors, controls all the variables, and
                    then sets the system to run on autopilot thousands of times,
                    keeping statistics of everything it does. This suggests the
                    second key difference between ABMs and games. With
                    researcher-generated simulations, the researcher is in
                    control of the processes and can adjust their constraints
                    according to her or his interests. <a class="noteRef" href="#d3e363">[6]</a> A
                    fundamental characteristic of social simulations is that
                    designers can alter the parameters of the model’s function
                    and thereby generate different, often unexpected patterns of
                    emergence. <a class="noteRef" href="#d3e374">[7]</a>
                    "While, of course, a model can never go
                        beyond the bounds of its initial framework,"
                    Miller and Page write, "this does not imply that it cannot
                            go beyond the bounds of our initial
                            understanding"
                         [<a class="ref" href="#miller2007">Miller 2007</a>, 69]. By pushing against their designers’ expectations,
                    simulated environments are analogous to experimental
                    laboratories where hypotheses are tested, confirmed, and
                    rejected. They join an ongoing process of intellectual
                    inquiry. "Simulation practices have
                        their own lives," philosopher Eric Winsberg
                    explains. "They evolve and mature over the
                            course of a long period of use, and they are
                                'retooled' as new applications demand more
                            and more reliable and precise techniques and
                            algorithms"
                         [<a class="ref" href="#winsberg2010">Winsberg 2010</a>, 45]. Here, then, is the third and most important
                    difference that separates simulations from games: they
                    participate in disciplined traditions of scholarly inquiry,
                    and their results are meant to contribute to research
                    agendas that exist outside themselves.</div>

                    These issues can be stated as a pair of questions: What is a

                    this large and still-growing body of scholarship, it may
                    seem presumptuous or tedious to offer yet another discussion
                    of the philosophy of modeling, but I’ve found that a very
                    particular understanding of the term is useful when thinking
                    about how computational models can be incorporated into
                    historical research. The thesis I’ll argue for, in a

                    Nelson Goodman describes models in a usefully comprehensive
                    way: "Few terms are used in popular and
                        scientific discourse more promiscuously than
                            'model.' A model is something to be admired or
                        emulated, a pattern, a case in point, a type, a
                        prototype, a specimen, a mock-up, a mathematical
                        description — almost anything from a naked blonde to a
                        quadratic equation — and may bear to what it models

                    is skeptical that a general theory of modeling is possible,

                    how the human body should look, as well as, perhaps, ideas
                    about sexuality and capitalism. Compare fashion models with
                    model organisms, like fruit flies and lab rats, used by
                    geneticists and biologists to study living systems. Mice

                    use to categorize bodies. Theoretical models of the kind
                    used in microphysics represent particles, true, but those
                    particles are usually not directly observable, and in some

                    began in the late nineteenth-century by building an actual

                    hydraulic presses drove water in and out of the machine

                    economic territory whose currency was still tied to the gold
                    standard. Fisher had composed a handful of equations that,
                    he believed, described the flow of currency through an
                    economy, and he built the hydraulic machine to represent

                    modeling strips away the empirical apparatus of
                    document-based research and creates new facts. It flips and
                    mirrors the hermeneutic circle such that the whole thing
                    looks like a figure-8. (See <a href="#figure03">Figure
                        3</a>). In the traditional hermeneutic circle the
                    researcher starts with a theory or model, sometimes
                    specified to the point of being a hypothesis, and from there
                    makes observations and experiments out in the real world.
                    The model is then revised to account for those new
                    observations. A researcher who builds simulations begins in
                    more or less the same place, but instead of digging into the
                    archives or querying Google n-grams, builds a simulated
                    world that works or doesn’t work according to expectations.
                    The patterns of behavior within the simulation either match
                    or fail to match what the designer predicts, and the model
                    is adjusted accordingly. As a guide to intellectual labor,
                    the hermeneutic figure-8 presupposes a researcher willing to

                  <div class="ptext" id="p20"> Literary historians use many kinds of models to support many
                    different kinds of claims. The simplest are classification
                    concepts like genre, nation, and period, which provide an
                    interpretive framework against which individual cases are
                    tested. Other models in literary history are more
                    complicated. Biographical contextualization creates a model
                    of some past "context," usually in the form of
                    narrative description. Contexts are executed when scholars
                    use them to speculate about how people in the past might
                    have interpreted some text or event. <a class="noteRef" href="#d3e677">[19]</a> These complex models often
                    deploy simpler submodels. For example, Michel Foucault
                    pointed out long ago that "the author" functions as an
                    interpretive model, and much the same could be said about
                        "the reader" as imagined in reader-response theory
                    and book history. The literary canon is itself a great,
                    capacious representative model. Though often compared to the
                    canons of scripture, in practice canonical literature has
                    more in common with the canonical organisms of biomedical
                    research. Rarely is the literary canon read with
                    prescriptive veneration, and never with the authority of
                    law. Instead of "great works" we have a
                    testing ground where new theories are subject to
                    examination. Though journalists and graduate students often
                    wonder what more there is to say about William Shakespeare,
                    that’s like asking what more there is to know about mice or
                    fruit flies. <cite class="title italic">Robinson Crusoe</cite> is
                    canonical in the same way that slime mold is canonical.</div>

                    agent-based computation than others. Perhaps most promising
                    are those used to describe patterns of social formation,
                    processes of change, and systems of causation. Such models
                    usually appear as two-dimensional diagrams. Pierre
                    Bourdieu’s idea of "the field of
                        cultural production" advanced a highly abstract,
                    schematic picture of art, commerce, and politics. (See <span class="error">

                    participants. Similarly, Robert Darnton’s model of the
                    communications circuit identified structural relationships
                    within the book trade. Ideas and books move throughout nodes

                    because of inconsistencies and gaps, but some system-level
                    statistics are available. For example, scholars have

                    a fairly stable arc of growth. However, this equilibrium was
                    shattered during the civil wars of the 1640s, when the print
                    marketplace exploded with political and religious debates.
                    Historian Nigel Smith has described the event as a "media revolution," and scholars
                    often point to the English Civil War as a key early moment
                    in the development of the free, democratic press [<a class="ref" href="#smith1994">Smith 1994</a>, 24]. On the one hand, the
                    scandal of war and regicide led to a heightened interest
                    among readers and seems to have increased demand for printed
                    books. On the other hand, political instability loosened the
                    stranglehold that state and commercial monopolies had long
                    exerted over the book trade.</div>

                    Bourdieu’s and Darnton’s and aggregate statistics like
                    these? It turns out, very little. Although economic and
                    political factors appear as forces in both diagrams, the
                    models don’t attempt to specify them. Darnton is a prominent
                    practitioner of "microhistory," a technique of
                    historical explanation that performs close analysis of
                    individuals and "everyday life"; in Darnton’s case,
                    this means close study of individual members of the book
                    trade [<a class="ref" href="#brewer2010">Brewer 2010</a>]; [<a class="ref" href="#darnton1984">Darnton 1984</a>]. In microhistory, these often
                    overlooked figures are chosen to exemplify how the print
                    marketplace worked at the local level. Darnton’s model is
                    thus designed, not to explain large macrolevel patterns, but
                    instead to provide a heuristic tool for interpreting
                    particular historical events and persons, who then stand in
                    as model exemplars for those larger patterns. The
                    diagrammatic model operates in the service of a bias toward
                    the individual, particular, and contingent event. A model
                    like Darnton’s is validated — if "validated" is even
                    the right word — insofar as it helps scholars describe
                    particular pieces of evidence found in the archive.</div>

                    historians are validated very differently than simulations
                    like those popular among complex-systems theorists. Within
                    the field of complexity science, explanation is
                        "validated" by the model’s ability to replicate
                    large system-level patterns within simulated worlds.<a class="noteRef" href="#d3e779">[20]</a>
                    If the model can produce visual patterns similar to patterns
                    produced by the observed record, the possibility is raised
                    that the moving parts of the model bear some meaningful
                    analogical relationship to the moving parts of real
                    processes. Epstein and Axtell argue that "the ability to grow [artificial societies]

                        programming … holds out the prospect of a new,
                        generative, kind of social science"
                    [<a class="ref" href="#epstein1996">Epstein 1996</a>, 20]. This newness takes
                    form, not merely as a novel genre of cultural
                    representation, but as a mode of inquiry that fundamentally
                    transforms what we think of as historical explanation.
                    Epstein and Axtell ask, "What
                        constitutes an explanation of an observed social
                        phenomenon? Perhaps one day people will interpret the
                        question, 'Can you explain it?' as asking 'Can
                            you grow it?'"</div>

                  <div class="ptext" id="p25"> I will qualify Epstein’s and Axtell’s dictum below, and I
                    find the notion that agent-based models can be
                        "validated" to be highly dubious, but it’s worth
                    pausing over the radicalism of their anti-historical vision.
                    The intellectual mandate to "grow" artificial societies
                    places a wildly different set of demands on models like
                    Bourdieu’s and Darnton’s. Whereas static models are used as
                    heuristics for interpreting historical records, simulations
                    are designed to mimic macroscopic patterns. A generative
                    model becomes explanatory, they argue, when the simple,
                    local rules that dictate agent behavior can be shown to
                    result in complex patterns: to know something as a
                    complex-systems theorist is to identify this meaningful
                    disjunction. However, such simple rules can never mimic real
                    behavior at the microlevel. Converting static models to
                    dynamic simulations seems to shift the target of explanation
                    away from particular examples and towards system-level
                    statistics. Models are useful, according to complexity
                    theory, not for interpreting particular events but for
                    generating patterns that look like aggregations of things
                    that really happened; modeling complexity thus obviates the
                    need for attention to particulars. Simulations allow us to
                    see through the mystifying complications of historical
                    evidence and see in their place the simple processes that
                    underpin complex systems. Simplicity and complexity are
                    real, and simulations allow us to see them clearly by
                    stripping away the illusory contingencies of actuality. Such
                    is, at least, how I interpret the challenge complex-systems
                    theory poses to historical explanation.</div>

                    practice of historical explanation, scholars will need to
                    reject this theory, I think. The value of modeling will need
                    to be placed elsewhere. As a group, historians will never
                    concede that simplicity and complexity are more interesting
                    than nuance, complication, and ambiguity. Nor should they.
                    I’ll conclude this essay by arguing that dynamic simulations
                    work much like heuristic models at the level of historical
                    interpretation (but better). We can use agent-based models
                    without taking on board all of complexity theory’s
                    ontological commitments. For now though, I want to leave
                    Epstein’s and Axtell’s challenge suspended in the air, like
                    an unexpected admonition, or like an interdisciplinary dare:
                    Can we take our ideas, written out in regular academic prose
                    or drawn as diagrams, and paraphrase them into functional
                    computer code? Can we generate simulations that behave how
                    the historical record <em class="emph">we created</em> predicts? If
                    not, maybe we don’t know what we think we know.<a class="noteRef" href="#d3e851">[21]</a>

                    agent-based simulation has already been started by literary
                    scholar Jeremy Throne, who breaks the model down to six
                    turtle-types (called "breeds" in NetLogo parlance):
                    authors, publishers, printers, shippers, sellers, and
                    readers. Throne created variables to control how many of
                    each breed are included, and at initialization these turtles
                    are distributed randomly across a standard-sized field of
                    patches. At each tick, the turtles move about randomly, and
                    whenever they bump into each other they perform
                    transactions: authors present publishers with manuscripts,
                    who give them to printers as "jobs," from whom they’re
                    picked up by shippers and deposited to sellers. Readers
                    purchase the books and complete the circuit by giving
                    authors encouragement to create more manuscripts. Like
                    clockwork automata, the now-moving parts of Darnton’s model
                    create a uniformly bustling field of exchange. (See <a href="#figure07">Figure 7</a>.) <div id="figure07" class="figure">

                    that historians often have when first exposed to agent-based
                    models is to be taken aback by their obvious, even comical
                    artificiality [<a class="ref" href="#throne2011">Throne 2011</a>]. In part this is
                    simply because of the crudity of NetLogo’s animations: the
                    figures bounce around the field like chunks of exploded

                    deeply, though, the artificiality of the simulation can be
                    traced in the code itself; the procedures that dictate
                    turtle behaviors are radically simplified. For example, here
                    is Throne’s code that simulates the activity of book-buying:

                    randomly, they’re constantly called upon to
                        "buy-books." Book buying in this context means
                    checking to see if a "seller" turtle happens to sit on
                    the same patch, verifying that the seller has inventory, and
                    then taking that inventory.<a class="noteRef" href="#d3e914">[22]</a> Already my prose description is more
                    complicated than the procedure itself. In fact, books as
                    such don’t exist in the simulation at all. Rather, they
                    appear only as numerical variables owned by turtles. In the

                    describes the procedure as an activity "that may be thought of as reading, purchasing, or
                        borrowing" — a telling phrase that captures well
                    his model’s breadth of imaginative application [<a class="ref" href="#throne2011">Throne 2011</a>]. I say "imaginative" because
                    there isn’t anything that existed in history that his
                    readers do, really. They don’t read or purchase or borrow:
                    their activities <em class="emph">may be thought of as</em> those
                    things because they are analogues for those things. Throne’s
                    model is less interested in accounting for the
                    particularities of the behaviors imagined here than in
                    demonstrating their function within a larger system of
                    exchange and circulation. That function can be summed up
                    like this: Purchasing, sharing, and reading happen when
                    people encounter media providers, and those activities move
                    content from providers to the reading populace, and these
                    transfers, broadly and abstractly construed, bind consumers
                    to producers in a chain of cultural production.<a class="noteRef" href="#d3e955">[24]</a> Such
                    abstract ideas require a comparably abstract form of
                    representation. While Darnton’s diagram simplifies this
                    process down to an arrow, the NetLogo model represents it as
                    an algorithmic procedure. So, while both models seem
                    unrealistic and over-simplified when compared to actual
                    behavior, if we take the idea to be the models’ real
                    subject, rather than the past <em class="emph">per se</em>, then
                    neither is reductive at all. The code and the diagram are
                    neither less realistic nor less valid than generalizations
                    in prose. Agent-based models don’t reduce life to
                    abstractions; they bring abstractions to life.</div>

                    and more traditional forms of historical modeling is not,
                    then, that simulations are peculiarly abstract, artificial,
                    or otherwise disconnected from the past. Rather,
                    conventional forms of historical explanation depend on the
                    spatialized logic of print, whether in the form of diagrams,
                    graphs, charts, or simply sequential prose. In such models,
                    sequence and spatial juxtaposition carry much of the
                    explanatory load. Agent-based models use algorithmic
                    processes instead. Alexander Galloway’s comment about video
                    games applies to ABM as well: like games, simulations are an
                        "action-based medium"
                    [<a class="ref" href="#galloway2006">Galloway 2006</a>]. This means that simulations
                    like Throne’s are able to point in both directions of what
                    I’ve called the hermeneutic figure-8. They retain the
                    capacity to facilitate historical research and explanation,
                    like any static model, but they also can be activated to
                    generate behaviors in simulated worlds — behaviors that may
                    or may not replicate patterns observed in the historical
                    record or predicted by the underlying assumptions. As
                    Willard McCarty has argued, models "comprise a practical means of playing out the
                        consequences of an idea"
                    [<a class="ref" href="#mccarty2008">McCarty 2008</a>]. In his initial experiments
                    Throne found, for example, that printers and shippers were
                    the surprising bottleneck and that the function of his world
                    is more sensitive to disruptions in production and shipment
                    than he’d anticipated.<a class="noteRef" href="#d3e980">[25]</a>

                    statistics begin to play a valuable role. Statistics do not
                        “"validate"” the model, if by validate one means
                    “prove,” but they facilitate interpretation by identifying
                    where the model does and does not replicate observed

                    original, what’s striking is the lack of change over time:
                    once the turtles are apportioned at initialization, the
                    system runs without constraint or growth. Without feedback

                  <div class="ptext" id="p34"> Happily, agent-based models are easy to modify and extend
                    (surprisingly easy, in fact, to any digital humanist
                    comfortable with basic coding), and gaps in a model can be
                    addressed to facilitate new experiments that ask new
                    questions. In my revision of Throne’s original, I wondered
                    how economic growth, state suppression, and the exertion of
                    commercial monopolies might impact book production. My
                    version argues that growth in demand instigates pressure
                    from the state and from commercial interests to restrict
                    production, but that if such restrictions result in too much
                    pent-up demand, constraints break down in moments of crises.
                    The result is a pattern of book production that largely
                    follows economic growth but much more closely matches the
                    punctuated equilibrium observed across the hand-press era.
                    Compare, for example, the pattern of book production
                    observed over a 225-year period in my version (See <a href="#figure08">Figure 8</a>.) with annual book
                    production in England from 1475 to 1700. (See <a href="#figure06">Figure 6</a>.) “Playing with the
                    model” is another term for “sensitivity analysis,” and it
                    means adjusting the settings to find out which replicate
                    observed cultural patterns, which cause the system
                    effectively to crash, and to try to figure out why. However,
                    the output of a model never will match the historical data
                    exactly, nor should it. The purpose of historical simulation
                    is not to recreate the past but to subject our general ideas
                    about historical causation to scrutiny and
                        experimentation.<a class="noteRef" href="#d3e1012">[27]</a>

                    As with any new genre of writing, the best way to learn
                    about it is to compare and contrast texts that tackle
                    similar questions and problems. Readers are also encouraged
                    to examine two other models of the historical book trade
                    that I’ve created. "Bookshops" focuses closely on the
                    finance of seventeenth- and eighteenth-century book-selling
                    businesses to explore how changes in demand and costs might
                    have affected publishers’ decisions about price,
                    republication, and edition size (<a class="ref"

                        "The Paranoid Imaginarium of Roger
                        L’Estrange" is more subjective and speculative:
                    it attempts to create a working model of how
                    seventeenth-century state censors imagined a print
                    marketplace of scurrilous and seditious publication, where
                    voraciously scandal-mongering readers threaten to disrupt
                    the populace and therefore require strict policing to
                    prevent social breakdown (<a class="ref"

                    NetLogo models can also be used to address questions of
                    literary form. For example, Graham Sack has created two
                    models of interest: one that simulates the fictional social
                    networks of nineteenth-century novels and another that
                    adapts models of biological evolution to simulate the
                    evolution of literary genres [<a class="ref" href="#sack2013">Sack 2013</a>]; [<a class="ref" href="#sack2013">Sack 2013</a>]. Surveying these examples, as well

                    Indeed, the most important commercial applications of ABM

                  <div class="ptext" id="p41"> In conclusion, three points are worth emphasizing. First,
                    simulation does not and will never replace document-based
                    research as the historian’s primary activity. As hermeneutic
                    tools, agent-based models work much like traditional
                    diagrams: they articulate a cluster of general assumptions
                    and make those assumptions available as a guide to
                        interpretation.<a class="noteRef" href="#d3e1092">[28]</a> However, second,
                    simulation is an action-based medium that makes those
                    assumptions more explicit and enables experiments to test
                    their internal consistency. When agents don’t behave how the
                    designer expects them to, debugging, expanding, or otherwise
                    modifying the model becomes a process of intellectual
                    inquiry that subjects the designer’s ideas to a frustrating
                    but invigorating process of reformulation. Third,
                    statistical comparison is an important tool for testing that
                    consistency, but such comparisons don’t suggest (pace
                    complex-system theory) that simple processes are "all that is really happening."”
                    Instead, statistical confirmation and its breakdown identify
                    moments of analogy between the model and the past, as well
                    as (just as usefully) moments of dissimilarity between
                    them.</div>

                  </div>
                  <div class="ptext" id="p42">This last point suggests that any historical simulation’s
                    success will not be determined by its verisimilitude. Any
                    model that was sophisticated and complicated enough to
                    represent faithfully the multitudinous totality of the past
                    would be every bit as inscrutable as that past. Rather,
                    models should be judged by their capacity to facilitate
                    interpretation and explanation. In practical terms, this
                    means that ABMs targeted toward an audience of historians
                    will need to be thesis-driven and richly documented with
                    primary and secondary sources, demonstrating both the
                    model’s macrolevel similarity with historical patterns and
                    its value as a heuristic device for explaining particular
                    events or interpreting historical texts. Ultimately,
                    agent-based models don’t need to tell us something new, but
                    they should help us say something new.</div>

                        economics, which emphasize the effects of individual
                        behaviors on collective patterns. For example, Craig
                        Reynold’s classic "boids" simulation, developed in
                        the 1980s at the Santa Fe Institute, replicates complex
                        flocking behavior in birds and fish with a very short
                        code that executes only three simple procedures. Such
                        simulations were an important part of the "artificial
                            life" movement among computer scientists in the
                        1980s and 1990s, spear-headed by computer scientists
                        Chris Langton, who believed that programs like these
                        (or, like computer viruses) actually constituted a new

                        divorced from their real basis, but nonetheless valuable
                        to real physical study: "We start

                        highlights the artificiality of the simulation’s
                        underlying theory and may thus circumvent a lazy
                        essentialism about models. As McCarty has argued, "Theoretical modeling,
                                constrained only by language, is apt to slip

                        do not mean to suggest here that validation of
                        agent-based models is taken to be a straightforward
                        process in the sciences. Indeed, as Kevin Korb, Nicholas
                        Geard, and Alan Dorin have recently commented, "the theory of how to validate
                                ABMs is vastly underdeveloped compared to its
                                practice"
                             [<a class="ref" href="#korb2013">Korb 2013</a>, 255]. Their Bayesian approach is very similar to the
                            "hermeneutic figure-8" I
                        describe. They write: "The Bayesian
                            approach to philosophy of science explicitly
                            recognizes the distinction between the current
                            understanding of the behavior of a system (prior
                            belief) and the data (likelihood), which provides us
                            with a framework for integrating both qualitative
                            and quantitative approaches to validation. In
                            essence, our prior belief about the model is updated
                            in light of experimental data gathered from our
                            simulations" (256). Whether such an approach
                        could ever achieve "validation" in
                        the colloquial sense of "confirm to be true"
                        remains unlikely. In fact, Joshua Epstein has exhibited
                        considerable defensiveness on this point: "I am always amused when …
                                people challenge me with the question, 'Can
                                    you validate your model?' The appropriate
                                retort, of course, is, 'Can you validate
                                    yours?'"
                             [<a class="ref" href="#epstein2008">Epstein 2008</a>]. As one of the authors of the "Artificial Anasazi" project,
                        which was built on decades of careful archeological and
                        environmental research, his frustration is
                        understandable. Their simulation of an early American
                        Indian civilization showed how its population might rise
                        and fall in relation to the area’s changing water
                        levels, and they were able to show that their artificial
                        society closely replicated the archeological evidence
                            [<a class="ref" href="#dean2000">Dean 2000</a>]. However, the problem they
                        run into is that no amount of data-based confirmation
                        can prove that the procedures written into the model
                        accurately represent what actually happened at the local
                        level. Agent-based simulations represent our ideas about
                        causation, and, as we have known since David Hume,
                        causation cannot be observed. Nothing about agent-based
                        modeling will solve this dilemma. Nor should it be
                        expected to, and this, perhaps, is Epstein’s point.
                        Critics of modeling betray considerable naiveté when
                        they brandish the incommensurability of ideation and
                        mind-independent reality as a criticism of any
                        particular genre. I share Epstein’s frustration insofar
                        as this naiveté manifests as a double standard: when
                        written out in sequential prose or drawn in diagrams,
                        models generally do not face the same kind of skepticism
                        similar models receive when executed computationally,
                        and there is no philosophical justification for this
                        difference. In any case, like Epstein, I am wary of the
                        term "validation" and prefer not to use it.</div>
