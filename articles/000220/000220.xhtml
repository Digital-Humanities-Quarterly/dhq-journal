                  <p>TypeWright (housed on the website 18thConnect) is an experiment in participatory
                     curation; it asks volunteers to make texts more findable, useable, and
                     trustable. These contributions are not without rewards to the volunteer.
                     TypeWright is part of some important trends in digitization, addressing two
                     problems of digital texts: flawed optical character recognition (OCR) and the
                     complicated terrain of intellectual property.

               <div class="ptext" id="p1">The eighteenth century was a golden age when print first came to the crowd, and
                  TypeWright brings crowdsourcing to the texts of that century. An experiment in
                  participatory curation, it asks volunteers to make texts more findable, useable, and
                  trustable. These contributions are not without rewards to the volunteer. TypeWright
                  is part of some important trends in digitization, and we might say it is part of a
                  growing movement, addressing two problems of digital texts: flawed optical character
                  recognition (OCR) and the complicated terrain of intellectual property.

               <div class="counter"><a href="#p2">2</a></div>
               <div class="ptext" id="p2">TypeWright is housed on 18thConnect, one of four sister sites, all coordinated
                  through a group called the Advanced Research Consortium (ARC). Since 18thConnect
                  launched in 2010 its director, Laura Mandell, and editorial boards are actively
                  reviewing projects and collecting metadata to make online objects discoverable and
                  collectable through their site. The other three sites are NINES (Networked
                  Infrastructure for Nineteenth-Century Electronic Scholarship, both an organization
                  and Website), the Renaissance English Knowledgebase (REKn), and the Medieval
                  Electronic Scholarly Alliance (MESA). The first of these, launched in 2005, is
                  NINES. NINES allows federated searching of 124 online scholarly projects, such as
                  the Whitman Archive and the Rossetti Archive. Its editorial boards review these
                  projects and then the site ingests the metadata. Scholars logging into NINES can
                  search all these resources at once, and collect results into "exhibits" that can be
                  used in teaching and scholarship. In doing so, scholars are volunteering their labor
                  to a good cause. Collex, an open-source collections-and-exhibits builder, was
                  originally designed to store the data from the searches and the exhibits created and
                  to use it to improve search results. For an excellent review of the search and exhibit
                  functions of Collex, turn to Amy Earhart’s reflections on using NINES in a college
                  course [<a class="ref" href="#earhart2010">Earhart 2010</a>].

               <div class="ptext" id="p5">Understanding TypeWright requires a brief detour through the history of Eighteenth
                  Century Collections Online (ECCO). It was created by Gale Cengage, scanning
                  microfilm images of texts published in Great Britain between 1701 and 1800. Although
                  comprehensiveness is not possible, ECCO has a substantial collection of 155,000
                  texts from that century printed in Great Britain and America. I know researchers who
                  have begged, borrowed, and occasionally stolen access to it if they weren’t lucky
                  enough to work for a school that subscribes to it. In the world of large collections
                  of primary texts, ECCO is dwarfed by behemoths like Google Book Search, but it makes
                  up for size with its relative accuracy in metadata such as author and date of
                  publication. At the same time, two other publishers created similar collections:
                  Chadwyck-Healey (later ProQuest) created Early English Books Online (EEBO),
                  collecting images of British texts published before 1800; and Readex created Early
                  American Imprints (Evans for short), a digital collection of American texts before
                  1819. All of these collections consisted of high-quality scans of microform (not
                  always of high quality to begin with).

               <div class="counter"><a href="#p6">6</a></div>
               <div class="ptext" id="p6">Transcriptions of these images were created by optical character recognition (OCR),
                  mainly for the purpose of searching to locate images of the pages. OCR is prone to
                  errors, particularly with structural information (title pages, chapter headings,
                  etc.) and notoriously with features of eighteenth-century printing like the long S.

                  locate texts to read, and the more we can trust algorithmic approaches to a body of
                  texts.

               <div class="ptext" id="p8">The Text Creation Partnership is a consortium of more than 150 academic libraries
                  that started at the University of Michigan and Oxford University, with the mission
                  of producing human-keyed, accurate transcriptions of texts digitized in EEBO, Evans,
                  and ECCO. Work continues on EEBO texts, but has ceased after transcribing 4,977
                  texts from Early American Imprints and 2,331 ECCO texts. The page images from
                  microform remain the property of the publisher, but the transcriptions belong to the
                  institutional members of the TCP, and after five years they pass into the public
                  domain.

               <div class="ptext" id="p9">TypeWright aims to continue this effort by using scholarly volunteers to check and
                  correct the OCR transcriptions. Scholars can work through the OCR transcripts of
                  ECCO texts that the TCP could not get to, making the texts more useable and more
                  available. A similar project, to correct OCR transcripts of the EEBO texts, is to
                  be
                  launched on REKn.

                  so she needs to reread the book anyway. So she logs in to 18thConnect, goes to

                  tools are conducting distinct curatorial tasks. In the case of Transcribe Bentham,
                  there are no transcriptions yet and we humans are called upon to create them.
                  TypeWright texts are beginning with transcriptions produced by a machine, in need
                  of
                  human attention to correct them. TypeWright editors generally won’t be starting with

                  current line. The user can edit the text, approve the current transcription or
                  delete it entirely. One can also move around the page or around the document. The

                  easy it is to accidently delete a line from the transcript (an undo button silently
                  appears, but it’s easy to miss). Generally, there is an assumption that users of

                  The organization will also provide a letter and a certificate of completion.

               <div class="ptext" id="p16">There’s more. When an editor completes a text, she owns it. 18thConnect will send
                  the
                  editor either of two versions of the text, one plain text, and one minimally marked
                  up in TEI. The Text Encoding Initiative’s XML standard is the basis of most
                  contemporary textual curation efforts. The TEI version of the text is intended to
                  serve as the foundation for a scholarly edition. Someone interested enough to
                  correct the transcription of a text might also be moved to publish an edition. (An
                  example of a scholarly edition that started as a Typewrite text is Jess McCarthy’s
                  edition of Daniel Defoe’s "Hymn to the Pillory":

                  carrying out text mining approaches to the text, as in this case TEI tags would just
                  get in the way.

                  the
                  assumption that all editors will discharge their duties with the same care.
                  18thConnect’s preference is for an editor to take ownership in a text and edit it
                  from beginning to end, and there are good reasons good scholars would want to.

               <div class="ptext" id="p19">A few technical improvements would enhance this tool's usability. (1) It could be
                  useful to allow scholars to formally adopt texts (e.g., a message like "User
                  Professor X is actively working to correct this text" would display in the
                  interface). (2) It would be very useful to bookmark a text where you left off. Or
                  perhaps a user could automatically go to the first uncorrected page in a text,
                  instead of always starting on the first page. (3) And as was mentioned, it seems too
                  easy to delete a line from the transcript. (4) It would also be useful to include
                  information on eighteenth-century printing. The typical graduate student might not
                  be certain of how to handle features like the long S or graphemes. As a benchmark,
                  Transcribe Bentham includes basic information on paleography.

               <div class="ptext" id="p20">What I would most like to see is incorporation of the texts of Early American
                  Imprints. ECCO contains some American texts but nowhere near a comprehensive
                  collection, and 18thConnect includes Americanists of course. My other suggestions
                  all require mere technical effort. Adding texts from Evans would require a whole new
                  set of negotiations with a different publisher. Just the same, we are waiting for
                  someone to come forward and take on the challenge of making the TCP-Evans texts
                  easily available for text mining or the uncorrected OCR available for correction in
                  the way that TypeWright does for the ECCO texts.

                  very near future, users of 18thConnect will be able to run the corrected ECCO texts
                  through Voyant directly. Voyant is an easy-to-use text-mining tool that makes it
                  easy to find trends in a text or body of texts.

                  fund a pilot than a sustained effort, a question we have to ask about any online
                  resource is how long can we count on using it. The fact that 18thConnect is part of
                  a larger organization and has seen past and planned advances serve as reasons to
                  expect it to stick around.

                  would serve a valuable function in a seminar in digital humanities, text modeling,
                  digital curation, literature, history, or scholarly editing. Students of literature
                  and history and related fields should volunteer to learn about eighteenth-century
                  printing, digitization, and editing. Even more important, those who study this
                  century should volunteer for the cause of making these texts more accessible.
