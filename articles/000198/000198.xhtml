                  <p>As humanities scholars increasingly recognize the value of public engagement, and
                    as the proportion of tenure-track faculty positions available to new graduates
                    continues to decline, many humanities programs are focusing renewed attention on
                    equipping graduate students for careers as scholars both within and beyond
                    academe. To support those efforts, the Scholarly Communication Institute has
                    carried out a study investigating perceptions about career preparation provided
                    by humanities graduate programs. The survey results help to create a more solid
                    foundation on which to base curricular reform and new initiatives by moving the
                    conversation about varied career paths from anecdote to data. The findings make
                    it clear that there are a number of effective interventions that programs can
                    undertake. Many of the skills that people working beyond the tenure track
                    identify as crucial to their positions — things like project management,
                    collaboration, and communication — are also highly beneficial to those working
                    within the professoriate. Structuring courses and projects in a way that
                    emphasizes the acquisition of these skills not only contributes to the success
                    of students who pursue employment outside the tenure track, but also to the
                    vibrant research, teaching, and service of those who pursue academic roles. With
                    the availability of new data to work from and the recommendations above as
                    possible guiding principles, graduate programs have a robust set of tools
                    available that can help facilitate curricular assessment and new initiatives. As
                    the importance of assessing the effectiveness of existing structures and
                    considering potential benefits of reform continues to grow, humanities programs
                    have a strong incentive to demonstrate the ways that their graduate programs
                    contribute to the vitality of the university and the broader public sphere.
                    Equipping graduate students with the skills and literacies needed for 21st
                    century scholarly work — from technical fluency to an understanding of
                    organizational structures — is critical to ensuring continued rigorous and
                    creative research, scholarship, and teaching.</p>

                  <div class="ptext" id="p1">Graduate students in the humanities thinking about their future careers face a
                    fundamental incongruity: though humanities scholars thrive in a wide range of
                    positions, few graduate programs systematically equip their students for varied
                    post-graduate opportunities. And yet, academic employment is an increasingly
                    distant prospect for many doctoral recipients, with a dwindling proportion of
                    tenure-track jobs available to an ever-growing pool of graduates. While the
                    disconnect between the availability of tenure-track jobs and the single-minded
                    focus with which graduate programs prepare students for that specific career
                    path is not at all new, the problem is becoming ever more urgent due to the
                    increasing casualization of academic labor — the shift from full-time positions
                    to piecemeal adjunct positions, most of which offer menial salaries, no
                    benefits, and no job security — as well as the high levels of debt that many
                    students bear once they complete their degrees. At the same time, people with
                    advanced humanities degrees who find stimulating careers in and around the
                    academy but outside the tenure track are becoming increasingly open about their
                    experiences, as is clear from the vibrant activity on websites such as <cite class="title italic">#Alt-Academy</cite>, Versatile PhD, and more [<a class="ref" href="#altacademy2011">“#Alt-Academy” 2011</a>]
                    [<a class="ref" href="#versatile2010">“VersatilePhD” 2010</a>].</div>
                  <div class="counter">
                     <a href="#p2">2</a>
                  </div>
                  <div class="ptext" id="p2">Despite the fact that many graduates continue to identify as part of the
                    scholarly world while pursuing satisfying careers beyond the professoriate, to
                    date there has been very little data available about this body of
                        "alternative academic" scholars — people with advanced
                    training in the humanities who do not pursue careers as tenure-track faculty
                    members, but instead work in and around academic structures in arenas like
                    libraries, museums, archives, humanities centers and labs, presses, and more.
                    While graduate programs can help prepare junior scholars for a much broader
                    professional world than simply the professoriate, without robust data it can be
                    extremely difficult to make a case for changes, or even to know what kinds of
                    changes would be effective. To that end, the Scholarly Communication Institute
                    (SCI) has completed a study investigating perceptions about career preparation
                    provided by humanities graduate programs. The survey results help to create a
                    more solid foundation on which to base curricular reform and new
                    initiatives.</div>

                  </div>
                  <div class="ptext" id="p3">Given the limitations of previously collected data, SCI’s study is an effort to
                    provide faculty and administrators with the data they need to assess and
                    strengthen existing programs, to implement changes where appropriate, and to
                    support efforts to increase transparency regarding career preparation and
                    post-graduate outcomes of emerging scholars. It should be considered in
                    conjunction with two complementary elements of SCI’s most recent phase of work:
                    meeting reports from a series of workshops on reforming humanities graduate
                    education [<a class="ref" href="#rumsey2013a">Rumsey 2013a</a>]
                    [<a class="ref" href="#rumsey2012">Rumsey 2012</a>], and the exemplary models of innovative scholarly
                    training showcased in the Praxis Network [<a class="ref" href="#praxis2013">“Praxis Network” 2013</a>]. With the
                    ongoing employment challenges for humanities PhDs in mind, and with an eye
                    toward the wide-ranging conversations related to careers beyond the tenure
                    track, SCI’s study uncovered patterns in the perceptions among humanities
                    scholars and their employers on topics such as career preparedness, skills and
                    competencies, motivations, performance, and more. </div>

                  <div class="ptext" id="p4">While tenure-track faculty positions remain the primary career goal of a large
                    majority of humanities doctoral students<a class="noteRef" href="#d3e195">[1]</a>, the percentage of graduates
                    that obtain tenure-track positions is becoming ever smaller. The 2011 report on
                    the Survey of Earned Doctorates indicates that 43% of humanities PhD recipients
                    have no commitment for either employment or postdoctoral study at the time of
                    degree completion [<a class="ref" href="#survey2012">“Survey of Earned Doctorates, 2011” 2012</a>]. As the American Association of
                    University Professors (AAUP) notes in their annual report on the state of the
                    profession, academic employment is increasingly shifting to part-time and
                    contingent positions, with 76% of all teaching positions being filled by
                    instructors in contingent roles as of 2011 [<a class="ref" href="#AAUP2013">AAUP 2013</a>]. This trend
                    means that proportionally fewer tenure-track lines are available to new
                    graduates, compounding the problem. Notably, a 2013 <cite class="title italic">Inside
                        Higher Ed </cite>survey of chief academic officers reveals that provosts
                    expect equal or greater reliance on adjunct labor in coming years, and
                    demonstrated little faith in a continued tenure system [<a class="ref" href="#jaschik2013">Jaschik 2013</a>]. Given these realities, continuing to view
                    tenure-track employment as the sole expected professional outcome for humanities
                    doctoral recipients is untenable.</div>
                  <div class="counter">
                     <a href="#p5">5</a>
                  </div>
                  <div class="ptext" id="p5">Reforming doctoral education requires a multi-pronged approach. We must at once
                    advocate for and work towards fair labor practices for contingent faculty
                    members; lobby against the trend toward casualization; and support graduate
                    students in the pursuit of more varied careers. Support entails not only
                    opportunities for skill development, but also greater recognition of what
                    constitutes post-graduate success. While earlier initiatives, most notably the
                    2000-2006 <cite class="title italic">Responsive PhD</cite> project, have also worked
                    to shift university paradigms and encourage better career preparation for
                    graduate students [<a class="ref" href="#responsive2005">“Responsive PhD” 2005</a>], their resulting methods and
                    recommendations have not been widely adopted. More recently, the report of the
                    Modern Language Association’s Task Force on Doctoral Education offered a suite
                    of strong recommendations on reforming the humanities Ph.D. [<a class="ref" href="#taskforce2014">“Report of the Task Force on Doctoral Study” 2014</a>]. The report is too new to assess uptake and
                    outcomes, but it signals the importance of the issue to the discipline as a
                    whole, and provides a useful starting point for discussions that can lead to
                    real action.</div>

                  <div class="ptext" id="p6">The fact that tenure-track employment opportunities are becoming scarcer relative
                    to the number of graduates does not necessarily imply that too many people earn
                    PhDs, or that graduate programs should reduce their admissions. Most humanities
                    programs do not need to be stripped down, but on the contrary, made more robust.
                    Departments need sufficient resources to allow them to invest in full-time
                    employment lines and to provide funding and support for graduate students.
                    Reducing a program’s size can lead to decreased funding, which may prompt
                    programs to meet teaching needs by hiring adjunct faculty on an as-needed basis
                    as undergraduate enrollments continue to rise ([<a class="ref" href="#IPEDS2009">IPEDS 2009</a>]; see

                    analysis). The casualization of academic employment in the U.S. exemplifies a
                    shortsighted view of the ways that labor conditions affect student learning
                    outcomes. The poor working conditions for many adjunct instructors — who are
                    stretched among multiple part-time contracts, with low pay, no benefits, and few
                    institutional resources — are directly and indirectly passed on to students.
                    Worse, in some universities, courses are so oversubscribed that some
                    universities, including the University of California system, are entertaining
                    proposals to shift many introductory courses to online environments run by third
                    parties — specifically, Massive Open Online Courses, or MOOCs — leaving students
                    without the direct guidance, mentorship, or expertise of any instructor at all

                    deeply trained humanists can offer. As Abby Smith Rumsey has argued, a broad
                    range of opportunities are available to graduates who look beyond the
                    university, where many organizations have a significant need for the skills and

                    programs should not be sacrificed in deference to problematic labor trends;
                    rather, the moment is right to consider the value that humanities education can
                    provide in a broader range of roles that are more deeply engaged with the
                    public, and to encourage students to focus on new ways to engage in public

                    librarianship, high-level administrative responsibilities, and more. These roles
                    are not new, but until recently the scholarly community has lacked a satisfying
                    way to refer to such careers; they are now commonly discussed as #alt-ac roles.
                    Many of the skills implicit in digital humanities scholarship and work products
                    — including collaboration, project management, and technological fluency — are
                    becoming increasingly important in new models of graduate training, even among
                    programs not specifically allied with the digital humanities. The spheres of
                    alternative academic careers and the digital humanities can be best understood
                    as a Venn diagram, with significant areas of overlap as well as distinctive
                    qualities. Many fruitful conversations and initiatives related to broadening
                    career paths have emerged from the digital humanities community, and there are
                    important reasons why this is the case. At the same time, the two areas are not
                    identical; many digital humanists work as tenured and tenure-track professors,
                    while many who identify as working in alternative academic roles do not engage
                    in the kinds of scholarship or practice associated with the digital humanities. </div>

                    of conversation and some contention, it is also possible — and perhaps more
                    productive — to take a broad view that is defined not so much by the specific
                    job or career, but rather by a kind of approach. People that identify with the
                    term tend to see their work through the lens of academic training, and
                    incorporate scholarly methods into the way that work is done. They engage in
                    work with the same intellectual curiosity that fueled the desire to go to
                    graduate school in the first place, and applying the same kinds of skills — such
                    as close reading, historical inquiry, or written argumentation — to the tasks at
                    hand. This kind of fluid definition encourages us to seek out the unexpected
                    places where people are finding their intellectual curiosity piqued and their
                    research skills tested and sharpened.</div>

                    recent work. In particular, the 2012 report by the Council of Graduate Schools
                    (CGS) and the Educational Testing Service (ETS) titled "Pathways Through Graduate School and Into Careers" provides a wealth
                    of valuable information [<a class="ref" href="#CGS2012">Council of Graduate Schools 2012</a>]. As the CGS/ETS report notes,
                        "the issue of career transparency presented the biggest
                        gap in data" from previous studies [<a class="ref" href="#CGS2012">Council of Graduate Schools 2012</a>, 2];
                    the report sought to correct that gap. An earlier study, "Ph.D.’s — Ten Years Later"
                    [<a class="ref" href="#nerad1999">Nerad and Cerny 1999</a>], explores the experiences of Ph.D. holders working in
                    business, government, and non-profits. It provides an incredibly useful
                    baseline, but data was gathered from 1982 to 1995, and no longer accurately
                    reflects the current academic or employment environments. Census data, such as
                    the annual Survey of Earned Doctorates, provides invaluable data on doctoral
                    recipients and their work commitments on graduation, but does not investigate
                    the nature of that work, nor does it track graduates’ careers beyond initial
                    positions. While all of these studies provide useful foundational information
                    and analysis, they do not assess finer-grained issues particular to the
                    humanities.</div>

                    have been conducted in partnership with specific departments and graduate
                    programs. These include the Carnegie Initiative on the Doctorate (2001-2005) and
                    the Woodrow Wilson Foundation’s Humanities at Work (1999-2006) and Responsive
                    PhD (2000-2006) programs. The Carnegie Initiative on the Doctorate partnered
                    with English departments at four universities and history departments at six,
                    each of which engaged in specific interventions to their doctoral programs, such
                    as revising curriculum, increasing mentorship opportunities, rethinking the
                    comprehensive exam, and more [<a class="ref" href="#carnegie">“Carnegie Initiative on the Doctorate” n.d.</a>]. Humanities at Work
                    provided practicum grants to doctoral candidates, funded postdoctoral
                    fellowships, and also established WRK4US, later to become Versatile PhD. The
                    Responsive PhD program partnered with 20 universities and helped document best
                    practices related to professional development [<a class="ref" href="#responsive2005">“Responsive PhD” 2005</a>].
                    While all of these programs likely proved useful to the specific departments and
                    individuals involved, and perhaps more broadly through retrospective reports and
                    recommendations, their success is difficult to quantify and therefore
                    challenging to scale and replicate. Few of the programs involve even track the
                    career outcomes of their graduates, for instance, making it exceedingly
                    difficult to gauge whether the projects have had a lasting benefit. Further, the
                    career-related focus tends to be on PhDs working in
                        "non-academic" jobs, a problematic label that excludes or
                    mischaracterizes the roles of people working in hybrid roles within and around
                    university structures. Finally, these programs, as well as the studies mentioned
                    above, have tended to focus on a narrow subset of disciplines (often only
                    English) as stand-ins for the full range of the humanities, which gives an
                    incomplete picture. </div>

                    scholars working outside the tenure track — SCI’s study can probe more deeply
                    into issues that concern that group. The study consisted of two main phases: one
                    public, one confidential. The first phase involved creating an exploratory
                    public database of self-identified alternative academic practitioners. The
                    database was built within the framework of the <cite class="title italic">#Alt-Academy</cite> project in order to leverage the energy of existing
                    conversations. The second phase comprised two confidential surveys. The primary
                    survey targeted people with advanced humanities degrees who self-identify as
                    working in alternative academic careers, while a second targeted employers that
                    oversee employees with advanced humanities degrees. Because we were working with
                    a somewhat nebulous population, our subsequent distribution focused on
                        "opt-in" strategies — especially social media, listservs,
                    and traditional media coverage. While this method has limitations, we hoped to
                    learn something not only from the content of the responses, but from the number
                    and type of respondents.</div>

                    and vocal population of humanities graduates in alternative academic careers.
                    While we believe this data will help advance the conversation related to
                    graduate training in the humanities, we also recognize the limitations of this
                    study, which include the following: <ul class="list">

                            difficult to define. Boundaries are porous, especially considering that
                            so many scholars are employed in hybrid roles, perhaps teaching a class
                            or two in addition to running a humanities center. Our priority was not
                            to set boundaries, but rather to identify and examine patterns.</li>

                            cannot be considered a representative sample, in part because of the
                            difficulties of defining the population. Aside from promoting the
                            placements of those graduates who find tenure-track faculty positions,
                            most departments do not track the career outcomes of their graduates, so
                            we had no database or core population to target. Instead, our work
                            simultaneously helps to explore the range of careers that people
                            identify as alternative academic, while also surveying the career
                            preparation of individuals working in those positions. </li>

                            study, we relied on social media, crowdsourcing, and listervs to
                            disseminate the study. We cannot determine response rate, because we did
                            not distribute the survey to a known number of people.</li>

                            self-reported answers by approaching the questions from two angles,

                    careers, it was important to us not to be too prescriptive in determining who
                    was and was not eligible to participate. By allowing some flexibility, we hoped
                    that in addition to the data obtained from the responses themselves, we might
                    also learn more about how the broader community thinks about career paths beyond
                    the tenure track. For this reason, we left the parameters loose. The public
                    database of people who self-identified as working in alternative academic
                    careers, which we developed in the first phase of the study, provided an initial

                    circumstances lead them into other paths. Examining the specific data more

                    received approximately ten times more responses than the employer survey. There
                    are a number of possible reasons that this would occur; employers have multiple
                    demands on their time, for instance, and unless they routinely hire people with
                    advanced humanities degrees, they may not perceive enough potential return on
                    the time they would invest in completing the survey. Beyond practical reasons
                    for the difference, the fact that such a broad gap exists between the numbers of
                    respondents to the two surveys also suggests mismatched incentives between the
                    two groups. The motivation for an employer to complete the survey, compared to
                    that of a former graduate student in an alternative academic position, is very
                    different. While employed scholars are invested in the outcome of the study
                    because it promises to affect the paths of people who take similar paths,
                    employers do not have such a clear reason for investment in the study. If
                    humanities PhDs have inadequate training for a position, an employer will simply
                    hire someone better suited to the job. Those embedded in humanities programs may
                    see the value of hiring humanities PhDs in varied lines of work, but this value
                    is often not well articulated, either because stakeholders do not perceive this
                    to be a critical aspect of their roles, or because they face too many competing
                    demands to devote the time necessary to make the case. Leaders in the humanities
                    community face increasingly heavy burdens related to funding, staffing, and
                    other resource-related questions. Further, departments and centers embedded
                    within university structures are slow to change, making it difficult for
                    otherwise interested individuals and groups to embrace recommendations.</div>

                  <div class="ptext" id="p22">The low response rate from employers forces us to think even more deliberately
                    about the points of leverage not just in graduate preparation, but also in the
                    employment opportunities available to graduates. Certain areas have a
                    well-established track record of employing humanities grads, while others do
                    not. Funders (especially the Mellon Foundation) and para-academic organizations
                    (such as the Council on Library and Information Resources, and the American
                    Council of Learned Societies) have worked to incentivize employers to hire PhDs,
                    often through the creation of short-term fellowships and post-docs. In theory,
                    post-doctoral programs that place graduates in public humanities positions could
                    enable employers to realize the value of making this type of hire, making it
                    more likely that they would continue to seek out similar candidates for
                    long-term employment after the conclusion of the funding period. In practice,
                    however, there is not yet data to support this desired outcome. Further,
                    post-doctoral roles may put graduates in difficult situations due to their
                    duration, funding structure, and often insufficient mentorship [<a class="ref" href="#brown2011">Brown 2011</a>]
                    [<a class="ref" href="#posner2012">Posner 2012</a>]. While post-doctoral positions have long been a
                    standard component of career paths in many STEM fields, they have not
                    traditionally been required for humanists; their growing prominence creates the
                    risk of "credential creep" as hiring committees seek
                    candidates with an increasing range of degrees and skills [<a class="ref" href="#gailey2011">Gailey and Porter 2011</a>]. Nonetheless, despite the legitimate concern that
                    encouraging graduate students to pursue more varied lines of employment pushes
                    them into short-term positions with unstable funding, in fact relatively few
                    respondents to the primary (employee) survey report this as their situation,
                    with only 18% in positions funded wholly or partially by grants (see <a href="#figure01">Figure 1</a>). Even fewer are in positions with
                    specified end dates (see <a href="#figure02">Figure 2</a>).</div>

                    respondents indicated that they expected to obtain positions as tenure-track
                    professors (see <a href="#figure03">Figure 3</a>). That response far
                    outpaces any others, even though respondents could select multiple options (note
                    that this is why the results add up to more than 100%). Instead of working as
                    faculty members as they had anticipated doing, respondents reported working in a
                    number of different types of workplaces, with a large majority working within

                    the 74% anticipating a faculty career, 80% report feeling fairly certain or
                    completely certain about that future path (see <a href="#figure05">Figure
                        5</a>). These numbers are particularly striking given that because the
                    survey targeted alternative academic practitioners, virtually none of the survey
                    respondents are tenured or tenure-track professors; they are all working in
                    other roles or domains. It is worth recalling that respondents were reflecting
                    on and reporting impressions they had prior to beginning their graduate study.
                    The time span is broad, with entrance years for those who completed the PhD
                    ranging from 1962 to 2008. While this range means that the results do not show a
                    contemporary snapshot, they do give us a clear sense of the landscape over time.
                    As such, it is clear that even among the body of people who are working in other
                    roles, the dominant expectation at the outset of graduate school was for a
                    future career as a professor. </div>

                    academic job market, and they haven’t been for some time. The labor equation for
                    university teaching has shifted dramatically in recent years, with
                    non-tenure-track and part-time labor constituting a strong majority of
                    instructional roles [<a class="ref" href="#AAUP2013">AAUP 2013</a>]. The data shows that historically,
                    many graduate students have begun their studies without a clear understanding of
                    their future employment prospects. While the degree of transparency about the
                    likelihood of obtaining a tenure-track position may have improved in recent
                    years, overall the responses signal that we are failing to bring informed
                    students into the graduate education system. </div>

                  <div class="ptext" id="p26">Deepening the problem, students report receiving little or no preparation for
                    careers outside the professoriate during the course of their studies, even
                    though the need for information about a variety of careers is acute. Only 18%
                    reported feeling satisfied or very satisfied with the preparation they received
                    for alternative academic careers (see <a href="#figure06">Figure 6</a>).
                    The responses are rooted in perception, so there may be resources available that
                    students are not taking advantage of — but whatever the reason, they do not feel
                    that they are being adequately prepared. That perception reveals significant
                    room for improvement throughout the higher education system. Further, if
                    programs devote time and funding to resources for career preparation, it is
                    essential to offer and promote them from the very beginning of graduate
                    students’ careers. Failing to do so may limit the effectiveness of such

                    which makes sense as a contrast to the near total lack of geographic choice
                    afforded by academic job searches. Beyond that, people report pursuing
                    non-faculty jobs for reasons ranging from the practical and immediate — salary,
                    benefits, family considerations — to more future- and goal-oriented reasons,
                    such as the desire to gain new skills, contribute to society, and advance in
                    one’s career. The open text responses reflect a wide variety of reasons for
                    taking a position. The desire for greater freedom than they perceived a faculty
                    position might offer, or simply a different environment than a university
                    department, appealed to many. One respondent cited the prospect of "An interesting job in a field where wide-ranging intellectual
                        curiosity is an asset" to be a very important reason for pursuing the
                    career that he or she chose. Another mentioned the "tremendous autonomy" their chosen position offered. Much more
                    simply, though, a large number of respondents cited the need to find a stable
                    job as their primary motivation. Some respondents considered themselves "overwhelmed,"
                    "burned out," or "frustrated"
                    [<a class="ref" href="#rogers2013a">Rogers 2013a</a>]. A note of urgency and, sometimes, desperation came

                    require a broad range of skills, some of which vary by position, while others
                    are common across multiple sectors (see <a href="#figure08">Figure 8</a>).
                    Some of the skills listed are core elements of graduate work, such as writing,
                    research skills, and analytical skills. Keeping in mind that the employer sample
                    was quite small compared to the main sample, it is worth noting that both groups
                    value many of the skills at similar levels; however, there are a couple of
                    discrepancies. First, employees tended to undervalue their research skills
                    relative to employers. There are several possible reasons for this: first, there
                    may be some activities that employees do not recognize as research because it
                    leads to a different end result than they might expect, such as a decision being
                    made, rather than a journal article being published. Second, research may be a
                    skill that has become so natural that former grad students fail to recognize it
                    as something that sets them apart in their jobs. </div>

                    management among the competencies that their jobs required. That said, project
                    management actually tops the list of areas where humanities-trained employees
                    needed training, according to employers (see <a href="#figure09">Figure
                        9</a>). This suggests that employees overvalued the skill because they
                    found it to be a challenging skill that they needed to learn on the job.
                    Employers also cited technical and managerial skills as areas that needed
                    training. While the importance of those two skills would certainly depend on the
                    type of position, others, such as collaboration, are useful in almost any work
                    environment. Even simple things, like adapting to office culture, can also prove
                    to be surprisingly challenging if graduates have not had much work experience

                    be greatly beneficial for those grads that do go on to become professors. By
                    rethinking core curricula in such a way that students gain experience in things
                    like collaborative project development and public engagement, departments would
                    be strengthening their students’ future prospects regardless of the paths they
                    choose to take. While students are generally well prepared for research and
                    teaching, they aren’t necessarily ready for the service aspect of a
                    professorship, which incorporates many of the same skills that other employers
                    seek. Collaboration and an understanding of group dynamics, for instance, would
                    help committee members to work more effectively together. Many of the skills
                    also contribute to more creative teaching and research. Better project
                    management skills would help faculty to make good use of sabbatical years and to
                    balance the anticipated fluctuations in workload, while technological skills
                    would lead to new kinds of assignments in the classroom and new research
                    insights. And yet, these skills are not typically taught as part of the graduate
                    curriculum. Methods courses, which could be used as an opportunity to introduce
                    students not only to the critical skills and approaches they will need, but also
                    to key issues of professionalization and post-graduate realities, are
                    inconsistent and sometimes completely absent, with 28.6% of respondents
                    reporting that their programs offered no methods courses whatsoever.</div>

                  <div class="ptext" id="p31">It is not surprising that employers find that humanities-trained employees need
                    to develop in new skills like project management and collaboration. Employees
                    themselves also recognize that these are by and large not skills that they
                    acquire in graduate school (see <a href="#figure10">Figure 10</a>). Skills
                    like collaboration, project management, interpersonal skills, and technical
                    skills are all valuable in a range of career paths that attract humanities
                    scholars, but graduate programs do not typically prepare their students in these
                    areas. Even among those who felt that their skills in these areas were strong,
                    they noted that they gained them outside of their graduate program — for
                    instance, through jobs or internships. Graduate programs could include
                    opportunities to learn and apply these kinds of skills by partnering with
                    organizations willing to host interns, or by simulating a work environment
                    through collaborative projects with public outcomes (see the Recommendations
                    section for more concrete ideas).</div>

                  <div class="ptext" id="p32">At the same time, graduate students may describe their skills using vocabulary
                    that does not resonate outside of academic circles, making it challenging for
                    graduates to translate their abilities into aptitudes employers seek. One aspect
                    of career training that would be beneficial to graduates is learning how to
                    recast their skills. For instance, a dissertation may be more interesting to a
                    potential employer if it is framed as a complex, long-term project involving
                    research, written and oral communication, and a series of deadlines completed on
                    time. Further, the core skills of graduate training — especially research,
                    writing, and analytical skills — are highly valuable to employers, and often
                    enable employees to learn new skills quickly. Notably, regardless of
                    respondents’ primary responsibilities, many reported that they still engaged in
                    some type of research or teaching. Just over half of respondents (51%) continue
                    to teach in some way, while an even greater proportion, 68%, perform research as
                    a part of their job. Many (61%) also pursue these activities outside their
                    position. </div>

                     <a href="#p33">33</a>
                  </div>
                  <div class="ptext" id="p33">Respondents noted that in their roles, teaching and research often differ
                    significantly from the usual forms they take in academic settings, and are
                    frequently much less formal. Activities that feel much like teaching may be
                    described as presentations, mentorship, and even management. Research may be
                    fast-paced, requiring that one seek out and synthesize information quickly in
                    order to facilitate decision-making. By understanding these differences,
                    graduates can better prepare themselves not only to be competitive candidates,
                    but also to succeed in varied workplaces. Because the processes and products of
                    skills like teaching and research can seem foreign in new employment
                    environments, it is critical that students don’t undervalue (or insufficiently
                    articulate) the ways that graduate study equips them for other roles,
                    particularly in the methods and generalized skills that can be broadly
                    applied.</div>

                    Many programs face severe budgetary limitations, and simply do not have the
                    funding needed to explore new projects. Faculty members may lack the time or
                    incentives to take on leadership roles or develop new curricula, or may not have
                    expertise in the areas where a department wishes to grow. Similarly, graduate
                    students may know of opportunities that they’d like to pursue, but may lack
                    funding for them, or may be unable to add additional commitments to an already
                    overextended schedule. Both students and faculty members may perceive a risk in
                    exploring opportunities outside the department’s standard fare. The structures
                    of hiring, promotion, and tenure often do not reward risk-taking of this nature,
                    and students or faculty who do pursue nonstandard opportunities may be called

                    and illustration to the survey data, SCI has recently launched another project
                    that we hope will be a useful complement to the study: the Praxis Network [<a class="ref" href="#praxis2013">“Praxis Network” 2013</a>].<a class="noteRef" href="#d3e647">[2]</a> The Praxis Network is a new
                    showcase of a small collection of programs that offer new approaches to
                    methodological training. Each of these programs can be thought of as one
                    possible response to the question of how to equip emerging scholars for a range
                    of career outcomes without sacrificing the core values or methodologies of the
                    humanities, and without increasing time-to-degree. The goals of each are
                    student-focused, digitally-inflected, interdisciplinary, and frequently oriented
                    around collaborative projects and public engagement. They share similar goals
                    but different structures. Because most of the programs are relatively new, it is
                    too early to provide data on graduate outcomes. So far, however, students who
                    complete the programs do appear to be highly competitive for the roles that they

                    the digital humanities [<a class="ref" href="#dhsi2014">“Digital Humanities Summer Institute” 2014</a>]. The DHSI model, which has

                    public sphere. Humanists should be making a case for effective modes of engaging

                    committed to humanities education, whether they work in universities, cultural
                    heritage organizations, or elsewhere. Further, as modes of scholarly production
                    and authoring continue to shift, the standards for evaluating scholarship for
                    purposes like hiring and promotion must be reassessed. The health of humanities
                    education affects the preparedness of future faculty and staff; the perceived
                    public value of the discipline; the quality of humanities research and other

                    continued rigorous and creative research and other work products. Remaining
                    wedded to outmoded systems, including a model of apprenticeship in higher
                    education that reinforces the false assumption that professorship is the only

                    disservice to all individuals and organizations that benefit from humanistic

                  <span class="noteRef">[1]</span> Findings from SCI’s study
                        indicate that upon starting graduate school, 74% of respondents expected to
                        pursue a career in the professoriate. For more details, see <a href="#figure03">Figure 3</a>.</div>

                  <span class="noteRef">[3]</span> Unfortunately, I cannot compare the employment
                        rates of different types of graduate programs. Most graduate programs do not
                        track their graduates’ employment paths. Those that do some form of tracking
                        often include information about the graduates who go on to tenure-track
                        faculty careers. With funding from the Alfred P. Sloan Foundation and the
                        Andrew W. Mellon Foundation, the Council of Graduate Schools recently
                        conducted a study to determine the feasibility of tracking career pathways
                        across multiple disciplines. The project report from that study was released
                        in December 2014 <span class="error">
