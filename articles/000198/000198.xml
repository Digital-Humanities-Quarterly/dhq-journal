            <p>As humanities scholars increasingly recognize the value of public engagement, and as
               the proportion of tenure-track faculty positions available to new graduates continues
               to decline, many humanities programs are focusing renewed attention on equipping
               graduate students for careers as scholars both within and beyond academe. To support
               those efforts, the Scholarly Communication Institute has carried out a study
               investigating perceptions about career preparation provided by humanities graduate
               programs. The survey results help to create a more solid foundation on which to base
               curricular reform and new initiatives by moving the conversation about varied career
               paths from anecdote to data. The findings make it clear that there are a number of
               effective interventions that programs can undertake. Many of the skills that people
               working beyond the tenure track identify as crucial to their positions — things like
               project management, collaboration, and communication — are also highly beneficial to
               those working within the professoriate. Structuring courses and projects in a way
               that emphasizes the acquisition of these skills not only contributes to the success
               of students who pursue employment outside the tenure track, but also to the vibrant
               research, teaching, and service of those who pursue academic roles. With the
               availability of new data to work from and the recommendations above as possible
               guiding principles, graduate programs have a robust set of tools available that can
               help facilitate curricular assessment and new initiatives. As the importance of
               assessing the effectiveness of existing structures and considering potential benefits
               of reform continues to grow, humanities programs have a strong incentive to
               demonstrate the ways that their graduate programs contribute to the vitality of the
               university and the broader public sphere. Equipping graduate students with the skills
               and literacies needed for 21st century scholarly work — from technical fluency to an
               understanding of organizational structures — is critical to ensuring continued
               rigorous and creative research, scholarship, and teaching.</p>

            <head>INTRODUCTION</head>
            <p>Graduate students in the humanities thinking about their future careers face a
               fundamental incongruity: though humanities scholars thrive in a wide range of
               positions, few graduate programs systematically equip their students for varied
               post-graduate opportunities. And yet, academic employment is an increasingly distant
               prospect for many doctoral recipients, with a dwindling proportion of tenure-track
               jobs available to an ever-growing pool of graduates. While the disconnect between the
               availability of tenure-track jobs and the single-minded focus with which graduate
               programs prepare students for that specific career path is not at all new, the
               problem is becoming ever more urgent due to the increasing casualization of academic
               labor — the shift from full-time positions to piecemeal adjunct positions, most of
               which offer menial salaries, no benefits, and no job security — as well as the high
               levels of debt that many students bear once they complete their degrees. At the same
               time, people with advanced humanities degrees who find stimulating careers in and
               around the academy but outside the tenure track are becoming increasingly open about
               their experiences, as is clear from the vibrant activity on websites such as <title rend="italic">#Alt-Academy</title>, Versatile PhD, and more <ptr target="#altacademy2011"/>
               <ptr target="#versatile2010"/>.</p>
            <p>Despite the fact that many graduates continue to identify as part of the scholarly
               world while pursuing satisfying careers beyond the professoriate, to date there has
               been very little data available about this body of <soCalled>alternative
                  academic</soCalled> scholars — people with advanced training in the humanities who
               do not pursue careers as tenure-track faculty members, but instead work in and around
               academic structures in arenas like libraries, museums, archives, humanities centers
               and labs, presses, and more. While graduate programs can help prepare junior scholars
               for a much broader professional world than simply the professoriate, without robust
               data it can be extremely difficult to make a case for changes, or even to know what
               kinds of changes would be effective. To that end, the Scholarly Communication
               Institute (SCI) has completed a study investigating perceptions about career
               preparation provided by humanities graduate programs. The survey results help to
               create a more solid foundation on which to base curricular reform and new
               initiatives.</p>
            <p>Given the limitations of previously collected data, SCI’s study is an effort to
               provide faculty and administrators with the data they need to assess and strengthen
               existing programs, to implement changes where appropriate, and to support efforts to
               increase transparency regarding career preparation and post-graduate outcomes of
               emerging scholars. It should be considered in conjunction with two complementary
               elements of SCI’s most recent phase of work: meeting reports from a series of
               workshops on reforming humanities graduate education <ptr target="#rumsey2013a"/>
               <ptr target="#rumsey2012"/>, and the exemplary models of innovative scholarly
               training showcased in the Praxis Network <ptr target="#praxis2013"/>. With the
               ongoing employment challenges for humanities PhDs in mind, and with an eye toward the
               wide-ranging conversations related to careers beyond the tenure track, SCI’s study
               uncovered patterns in the perceptions among humanities scholars and their employers
               on topics such as career preparedness, skills and competencies, motivations,
               performance, and more. </p>

         <div>
            <head>BACKGROUND</head>
            <p>While tenure-track faculty positions remain the primary career goal of a large
               majority of humanities doctoral students<note> Findings from SCI’s study indicate
                  that upon starting graduate school, 74% of respondents expected to pursue a career
                  in the professoriate. For more details, see <ref target="#figure03">Figure
                  3</ref>.</note>, the percentage of graduates that obtain tenure-track positions is
               becoming ever smaller. The 2011 report on the Survey of Earned Doctorates indicates
               that 43% of humanities PhD recipients have no commitment for either employment or
               postdoctoral study at the time of degree completion <ptr target="#survey2012"/>. As
               the American Association of University Professors (AAUP) notes in their annual report
               on the state of the profession, academic employment is increasingly shifting to
               part-time and contingent positions, with 76% of all teaching positions being filled
               by instructors in contingent roles as of 2011 <ptr target="#AAUP2013"/>. This trend
               means that proportionally fewer tenure-track lines are available to new graduates,
               compounding the problem. Notably, a 2013 <title rend="italic">Inside Higher Ed
               </title>survey of chief academic officers reveals that provosts expect equal or
               greater reliance on adjunct labor in coming years, and demonstrated little faith in a
               continued tenure system <ptr target="#jaschik2013"/>. Given these realities,
               continuing to view tenure-track employment as the sole expected professional outcome
               for humanities doctoral recipients is untenable.</p>
            <p>Reforming doctoral education requires a multi-pronged approach. We must at once
               advocate for and work towards fair labor practices for contingent faculty members;
               lobby against the trend toward casualization; and support graduate students in the
               pursuit of more varied careers. Support entails not only opportunities for skill
               development, but also greater recognition of what constitutes post-graduate success.
               While earlier initiatives, most notably the 2000-2006 <title rend="italic">Responsive
                  PhD</title> project, have also worked to shift university paradigms and encourage
               better career preparation for graduate students <ptr target="#responsive2005"/>,
               their resulting methods and recommendations have not been widely adopted. More
               recently, the report of the Modern Language Association’s Task Force on Doctoral
               Education offered a suite of strong recommendations on reforming the humanities Ph.D.
                  <ptr target="#taskforce2014"/>. The report is too new to assess uptake and
               outcomes, but it signals the importance of the issue to the discipline as a whole,
               and provides a useful starting point for discussions that can lead to real
               action.</p>
            <p>The fact that tenure-track employment opportunities are becoming scarcer relative to
               the number of graduates does not necessarily imply that too many people earn PhDs, or
               that graduate programs should reduce their admissions. Most humanities programs do
               not need to be stripped down, but on the contrary, made more robust. Departments need
               sufficient resources to allow them to invest in full-time employment lines and to
               provide funding and support for graduate students. Reducing a program’s size can lead
               to decreased funding, which may prompt programs to meet teaching needs by hiring
               adjunct faculty on an as-needed basis as undergraduate enrollments continue to rise
                  (<ptr target="#IPEDS2009"/>; see <ptr target="#laurence2014a"/> and <ptr target="#laurence2014b"/> for data analysis). The casualization of academic
               employment in the U.S. exemplifies a shortsighted view of the ways that labor
               conditions affect student learning outcomes. The poor working conditions for many
               adjunct instructors — who are stretched among multiple part-time contracts, with low
               pay, no benefits, and few institutional resources — are directly and indirectly
               passed on to students. Worse, in some universities, courses are so oversubscribed
               that some universities, including the University of California system, are
               entertaining proposals to shift many introductory courses to online environments run
               by third parties — specifically, Massive Open Online Courses, or MOOCs — leaving
               students without the direct guidance, mentorship, or expertise of any instructor at
               all <ptr target="#fain2013"/>.</p>
            <p>Further, reducing doctoral programs in response to low tenure-track employment rates
               strips other employment environments — whether scholarly, cultural, governmental,
               non-profit, or something else entirely — of the advantages that deeply trained
               humanists can offer. As Abby Smith Rumsey has argued, a broad range of opportunities
               are available to graduates who look beyond the university, where many organizations
               have a significant need for the skills and approaches that humanists could offer <ptr target="#rumsey2013b"/>. Humanities programs should not be sacrificed in deference
               to problematic labor trends; rather, the moment is right to consider the value that
               humanities education can provide in a broader range of roles that are more deeply
               engaged with the public, and to encourage students to focus on new ways to engage in
               public discourse.</p>
            <p>Many positions that help to translate humanities study into a broader public good are
               a part of the growing discourse of <soCalled>alternative academic</soCalled> careers,
               often referenced by the Twitter hashtag, #altac (or #alt-ac). Coined in a 2009
               Twitter conversation between Bethany Nowviskie and Jason Rhody, the phrase refers to
               individuals with graduate training in the humanities who are off the tenure track,
               while still working in and around academic and scholarly systems <ptr target="#nowviskie2012a"/>. Nowviskie went on to create <title rend="italic">#Alt-Academy</title>, an online volume of essays treating a range of topics
               related to the pursuit and development of these various careers <ptr target="#altacademy2011"/>.</p>
            <p>The changing nature of career paths for humanities scholars is an issue of particular
               concern to digital humanities practitioners, who have long been working in hybrid
               roles that combine elements of traditional scholarship, like research and teaching,
               with other elements, such as software development, librarianship, high-level
               administrative responsibilities, and more. These roles are not new, but until
               recently the scholarly community has lacked a satisfying way to refer to such
               careers; they are now commonly discussed as #alt-ac roles. Many of the skills
               implicit in digital humanities scholarship and work products — including
               collaboration, project management, and technological fluency — are becoming
               increasingly important in new models of graduate training, even among programs not
               specifically allied with the digital humanities. The spheres of alternative academic
               careers and the digital humanities can be best understood as a Venn diagram, with
               significant areas of overlap as well as distinctive qualities. Many fruitful
               conversations and initiatives related to broadening career paths have emerged from
               the digital humanities community, and there are important reasons why this is the
               case. At the same time, the two areas are not identical; many digital humanists work
               as tenured and tenure-track professors, while many who identify as working in
               alternative academic roles do not engage in the kinds of scholarship or practice
               associated with the digital humanities. </p>
            <p>While the scope of the alternative academic umbrella is the topic of a great deal of
               conversation and some contention, it is also possible — and perhaps more productive —
               to take a broad view that is defined not so much by the specific job or career, but
               rather by a kind of approach. People that identify with the term tend to see their
               work through the lens of academic training, and incorporate scholarly methods into
               the way that work is done. They engage in work with the same intellectual curiosity
               that fueled the desire to go to graduate school in the first place, and applying the
               same kinds of skills — such as close reading, historical inquiry, or written
               argumentation — to the tasks at hand. This kind of fluid definition encourages us to
               seek out the unexpected places where people are finding their intellectual curiosity
               piqued and their research skills tested and sharpened.</p>

            <head>METHODOLOGY: GOALS AND LIMITATIONS</head>
            <p>In addition to the rich narrative material gathered at <title rend="italic">#Alt-Academy</title>, several previous studies provide groundwork for SCI’s
               recent work. In particular, the 2012 report by the Council of Graduate Schools (CGS)
               and the Educational Testing Service (ETS) titled <title rend="quotes">Pathways
                  Through Graduate School and Into Careers</title> provides a wealth of valuable
               information <ptr target="#CGS2012"/>. As the CGS/ETS report notes, <quote rend="inline" source="#CGS2012">the issue of career transparency presented the biggest gap in
                  data</quote> from previous studies <ptr target="#CGS2012" loc="2"/>; the report
               sought to correct that gap. An earlier study, <title rend="quotes">Ph.D.’s — Ten
                  Years Later</title>
               <ptr target="#nerad1999"/>, explores the experiences of Ph.D. holders working in
               business, government, and non-profits. It provides an incredibly useful baseline, but
               data was gathered from 1982 to 1995, and no longer accurately reflects the current
               academic or employment environments. Census data, such as the annual Survey of Earned
               Doctorates, provides invaluable data on doctoral recipients and their work
               commitments on graduation, but does not investigate the nature of that work, nor does
               it track graduates’ careers beyond initial positions. While all of these studies
               provide useful foundational information and analysis, they do not assess
               finer-grained issues particular to the humanities.</p>
            <p>A number of other projects related to the career prospects of humanities scholars
               have been conducted in partnership with specific departments and graduate programs.
               These include the Carnegie Initiative on the Doctorate (2001-2005) and the Woodrow
               Wilson Foundation’s Humanities at Work (1999-2006) and Responsive PhD (2000-2006)
               programs. The Carnegie Initiative on the Doctorate partnered with English departments
               at four universities and history departments at six, each of which engaged in
               specific interventions to their doctoral programs, such as revising curriculum,
               increasing mentorship opportunities, rethinking the comprehensive exam, and more <ptr target="#carnegie"/>. Humanities at Work provided practicum grants to doctoral
               candidates, funded postdoctoral fellowships, and also established WRK4US, later to
               become Versatile PhD. The Responsive PhD program partnered with 20 universities and
               helped document best practices related to professional development <ptr target="#responsive2005"/>. While all of these programs likely proved useful to
               the specific departments and individuals involved, and perhaps more broadly through
               retrospective reports and recommendations, their success is difficult to quantify and
               therefore challenging to scale and replicate. Few of the programs involve even track
               the career outcomes of their graduates, for instance, making it exceedingly difficult
               to gauge whether the projects have had a lasting benefit. Further, the career-related
               focus tends to be on PhDs working in <soCalled>non-academic</soCalled> jobs, a
               problematic label that excludes or mischaracterizes the roles of people working in
               hybrid roles within and around university structures. Finally, these programs, as
               well as the studies mentioned above, have tended to focus on a narrow subset of
               disciplines (often only English) as stand-ins for the full range of the humanities,
               which gives an incomplete picture. </p>
            <p>By focusing on a narrower segment of the academic population — humanities scholars
               working outside the tenure track — SCI’s study can probe more deeply into issues that
               concern that group. The study consisted of two main phases: one public, one
               confidential. The first phase involved creating an exploratory public database of
               self-identified alternative academic practitioners. The database was built within the
               framework of the <title rend="italic">#Alt-Academy</title> project in order to
               leverage the energy of existing conversations. The second phase comprised two
               confidential surveys. The primary survey targeted people with advanced humanities
               degrees who self-identify as working in alternative academic careers, while a second
               targeted employers that oversee employees with advanced humanities degrees. Because
               we were working with a somewhat nebulous population, our subsequent distribution
               focused on <soCalled>opt-in</soCalled> strategies — especially social media,
               listservs, and traditional media coverage. While this method has limitations, we
               hoped to learn something not only from the content of the responses, but from the
               number and type of respondents.</p>
            <p>The data obtained through this study represents an important step towards identifying
               and understanding the career preparation needs of humanities graduate students by
               examining particular issues facing the increasingly visible and vocal population of
               humanities graduates in alternative academic careers. While we believe this data will
               help advance the conversation related to graduate training in the humanities, we also
               recognize the limitations of this study, which include the following: <list type="unordered">
                  <item>An unknown population with undefined boundaries. The community of people
                     that self-identify as working in alternative academic careers is difficult to
                     define. Boundaries are porous, especially considering that so many scholars are
                     employed in hybrid roles, perhaps teaching a class or two in addition to
                     running a humanities center. Our priority was not to set boundaries, but rather
                     to identify and examine patterns.</item>
                  <item>Impossibility of achieving a representative sample. Our respondents cannot
                     be considered a representative sample, in part because of the difficulties of
                     defining the population. Aside from promoting the placements of those graduates
                     who find tenure-track faculty positions, most departments do not track the
                     career outcomes of their graduates, so we had no database or core population to
                     target. Instead, our work simultaneously helps to explore the range of careers
                     that people identify as alternative academic, while also surveying the career
                     preparation of individuals working in those positions. </item>
                  <item>Methodological constraints. Because of the difficulties related to the
                     population, as well as constraints on the timing and personnel for the study,
                     we relied on social media, crowdsourcing, and listervs to disseminate the
                     study. We cannot determine response rate, because we did not distribute the
                     survey to a known number of people.</item>
                  <item>Self-reporting. By design, the study examines the <emph>perceptions</emph>
                     of employees and employers regarding employees’ career preparation.
                     Self-reported results cannot be verified for accuracy. However, we hoped to
                     limit some of the bias inherent in self-reported answers by approaching the
                     questions from two angles, through the perceptions of both employees and
                     employers.</item>
               </list></p>
            <p>Despite these challenges, the data reveals interesting patterns that can help inform
               the conversation. While the results cannot be generalized to the entire population of
               alternative academics (in part because it is a fluid, loosely-defined community),
               they can contribute to a more informed discussion and sound recommendations. They can
               also provide a foundation on which to base future research.</p>

            <head>METHODOLOGY: TEAM AND INSTRUMENTS</head>
            <p>Dr. Katina Rogers, Senior Research Specialist at the Scholarly Communication
               Institute, was lead researcher on the project. Oversight was provided by Dr. Bethany
               Nowviskie, Associate Director, and Dr. Abby Smith Rumsey, Director of the Scholarly
               Communication Institute. In consultation with Dr. Nancy Kechner, ITC Research
               Computing Consultant at the Scholars’ Lab, Rogers developed an 89-question instrument
               for employees, and a 24-question instrument for employers. The instruments include
               multiple choice, Likert scale, and open-ended questions, and include branching
               structures. The instruments underwent several rounds of testing in order to
               strengthen and optimize them.</p>
            <p>The surveys were opened to the public on July 10, 2012, and were closed on October 1,
               2012. In total, we obtained 773 responses to the main survey, of a total of 938
               surveys started, for a drop-out rate of 17.6%. The most common disciplinary fields
               were English (19.6%) and history (18.51%), with a wide range of other disciplines
               represented in small numbers. On the employer survey, 73 responses were obtained, of
               a total of 103 surveys started, for a drop-out rate of 29.1%. Respondents were
               permitted to skip any questions that they did not wish to answer. The high number of
               responses enables us to determine meaningful trends within the data, in order to make
               recommendations to humanities programs and centers wishing to modify their curricular
               offerings. </p>
            <p>Because we were working with a category of employment that is defined only loosely,
               and because we hoped that the survey results would help to clarify what people mean
               when they talk about <soCalled>alternative academic</soCalled> careers, it was
               important to us not to be too prescriptive in determining who was and was not
               eligible to participate. By allowing some flexibility, we hoped that in addition to
               the data obtained from the responses themselves, we might also learn more about how
               the broader community thinks about career paths beyond the tenure track. For this
               reason, we left the parameters loose. The public database of people who
               self-identified as working in alternative academic careers, which we developed in the
               first phase of the study, provided an initial pool of approximately 250 potential
               respondents. We then disseminated information about the survey through social media,
               professional societies, relevant email distribution lists, an independent write-up in
               the <title rend="italic">Chronicle of Higher Education</title>
               <ptr target="#cassuto2012"/>, and discussion at pertinent meetings and
               conferences.</p>
            <p>The study is neither longitudinal nor a comprehensive look at a single cohort;
               rather, it provides a starting point for understanding the current state of affairs.
               As such, the data it provides is fundamentally different from long-running annual
               studies like the Survey of Earned Doctorates. We hope that other studies will build
               on the work we're doing now; to that end, the datasets are publicly available for
               further analysis and extension <ptr target="#rogers2013a"/>
               <ptr target="#rogers2013b"/>.</p>
         </div>
         <div>
            <head>FINDINGS</head>
            <p>The general contours of the findings make it clear that people tend to enter
               humanities graduate programs expecting to become professors; they receive very little
               advice or training for any other career; and yet many different circumstances lead
               them into other paths. Examining the specific data more closely helps to ground
               general or anecdotal impressions in a more substantial foundation. </p>
            <p>One salient fact can be seen in the response rates themselves. The main survey
               received approximately ten times more responses than the employer survey. There are a
               number of possible reasons that this would occur; employers have multiple demands on
               their time, for instance, and unless they routinely hire people with advanced
               humanities degrees, they may not perceive enough potential return on the time they
               would invest in completing the survey. Beyond practical reasons for the difference,
               the fact that such a broad gap exists between the numbers of respondents to the two
               surveys also suggests mismatched incentives between the two groups. The motivation
               for an employer to complete the survey, compared to that of a former graduate student
               in an alternative academic position, is very different. While employed scholars are
               invested in the outcome of the study because it promises to affect the paths of
               people who take similar paths, employers do not have such a clear reason for
               investment in the study. If humanities PhDs have inadequate training for a position,
               an employer will simply hire someone better suited to the job. Those embedded in
               humanities programs may see the value of hiring humanities PhDs in varied lines of
               work, but this value is often not well articulated, either because stakeholders do
               not perceive this to be a critical aspect of their roles, or because they face too
               many competing demands to devote the time necessary to make the case. Leaders in the
               humanities community face increasingly heavy burdens related to funding, staffing,
               and other resource-related questions. Further, departments and centers embedded
               within university structures are slow to change, making it difficult for otherwise
               interested individuals and groups to embrace recommendations.</p>
            <p>The low response rate from employers forces us to think even more deliberately about
               the points of leverage not just in graduate preparation, but also in the employment
               opportunities available to graduates. Certain areas have a well-established track
               record of employing humanities grads, while others do not. Funders (especially the
               Mellon Foundation) and para-academic organizations (such as the Council on Library
               and Information Resources, and the American Council of Learned Societies) have worked
               to incentivize employers to hire PhDs, often through the creation of short-term
               fellowships and post-docs. In theory, post-doctoral programs that place graduates in
               public humanities positions could enable employers to realize the value of making
               this type of hire, making it more likely that they would continue to seek out similar
               candidates for long-term employment after the conclusion of the funding period. In
               practice, however, there is not yet data to support this desired outcome. Further,
               post-doctoral roles may put graduates in difficult situations due to their duration,
               funding structure, and often insufficient mentorship <ptr target="#brown2011"/>
               <ptr target="#posner2012"/>. While post-doctoral positions have long been a standard
               component of career paths in many STEM fields, they have not traditionally been
               required for humanists; their growing prominence creates the risk of
                  <soCalled>credential creep</soCalled> as hiring committees seek candidates with an
               increasing range of degrees and skills <ptr target="#gailey2011"/>. Nonetheless,
               despite the legitimate concern that encouraging graduate students to pursue more
               varied lines of employment pushes them into short-term positions with unstable
               funding, in fact relatively few respondents to the primary (employee) survey report
               this as their situation, with only 18% in positions funded wholly or partially by
               grants (see <ref target="#figure01">Figure 1</ref>). Even fewer are in positions with
               specified end dates (see <ref target="#figure02">Figure 2</ref>).</p>
            <figure xml:id="figure01">
               <graphic url="resources/images/figure01.jpg"/>
            </figure>
            <figure xml:id="figure02">

            </figure>
            <p>When graduate students begin their studies, their career expectations remain strongly
               aligned with the goal of becoming faculty. Asked to identify the career(s) they
               expected to pursue when they started graduate school, 74% of respondents indicated
               that they expected to obtain positions as tenure-track professors (see <ref target="#figure03">Figure 3</ref>). That response far outpaces any others, even
               though respondents could select multiple options (note that this is why the results
               add up to more than 100%). Instead of working as faculty members as they had
               anticipated doing, respondents reported working in a number of different types of
               workplaces, with a large majority working within universities, libraries, and other
               cultural heritage organizations (see <ref target="#figure04">Figure 4</ref>).</p>
            <figure xml:id="figure03">
               <graphic url="resources/images/figure03.jpg"/>
            </figure>
            <figure xml:id="figure04">
               <graphic url="resources/images/figure04.jpg"/>
            </figure>
            <p>What is perhaps more interesting is these respondents’ level of confidence: of the
               74% anticipating a faculty career, 80% report feeling fairly certain or completely
               certain about that future path (see <ref target="#figure05">Figure 5</ref>). These
               numbers are particularly striking given that because the survey targeted alternative
               academic practitioners, virtually none of the survey respondents are tenured or
               tenure-track professors; they are all working in other roles or domains. It is worth
               recalling that respondents were reflecting on and reporting impressions they had
               prior to beginning their graduate study. The time span is broad, with entrance years
               for those who completed the PhD ranging from 1962 to 2008. While this range means
               that the results do not show a contemporary snapshot, they do give us a clear sense
               of the landscape over time. As such, it is clear that even among the body of people
               who are working in other roles, the dominant expectation at the outset of graduate
               school was for a future career as a professor. </p>
            <figure xml:id="figure05">
               <graphic url="resources/images/figure05.jpg"/>
            </figure>
            <p>These expectations are not at all aligned with the realities of the current academic
               job market, and they haven’t been for some time. The labor equation for university
               teaching has shifted dramatically in recent years, with non-tenure-track and
               part-time labor constituting a strong majority of instructional roles <ptr target="#AAUP2013"/>. The data shows that historically, many graduate students
               have begun their studies without a clear understanding of their future employment
               prospects. While the degree of transparency about the likelihood of obtaining a
               tenure-track position may have improved in recent years, overall the responses signal
               that we are failing to bring informed students into the graduate education system. </p>
            <p>Deepening the problem, students report receiving little or no preparation for careers
               outside the professoriate during the course of their studies, even though the need
               for information about a variety of careers is acute. Only 18% reported feeling
               satisfied or very satisfied with the preparation they received for alternative
               academic careers (see <ref target="#figure06">Figure 6</ref>). The responses are
               rooted in perception, so there may be resources available that students are not
               taking advantage of — but whatever the reason, they do not feel that they are being
               adequately prepared. That perception reveals significant room for improvement
               throughout the higher education system. Further, if programs devote time and funding
               to resources for career preparation, it is essential to offer and promote them from
               the very beginning of graduate students’ careers. Failing to do so may limit the
               effectiveness of such interventions. </p>
            <figure xml:id="figure06">
               <graphic url="resources/images/figure06.jpg"/>
            </figure>
            <p>The reasons that people pursue careers beyond the tenure track are varied and complex
               (see <ref target="#figure07">Figure 7</ref>). Location tops the list, which makes
               sense as a contrast to the near total lack of geographic choice afforded by academic
               job searches. Beyond that, people report pursuing non-faculty jobs for reasons
               ranging from the practical and immediate — salary, benefits, family considerations —
               to more future- and goal-oriented reasons, such as the desire to gain new skills,
               contribute to society, and advance in one’s career. The open text responses reflect a
               wide variety of reasons for taking a position. The desire for greater freedom than
               they perceived a faculty position might offer, or simply a different environment than
               a university department, appealed to many. One respondent cited the prospect of
                  <q>An interesting job in a field where wide-ranging intellectual
                  curiosity is an asset</q> to be a very important reason for pursuing the
               career that he or she chose. Another mentioned the <q>tremendous
                  autonomy</q> their chosen position offered. Much more simply, though, a large
               number of respondents cited the need to find a stable job as their primary
               motivation. Some respondents considered themselves <q>overwhelmed,</q>
               <q>burned out,</q> or <q>frustrated</q>
               <ptr target="#rogers2013a"/>. A note of urgency and, sometimes, desperation came
               through in a number of these responses.</p>

            </figure>
            <p>The survey results make it clear that the varied careers of humanities scholars
               require a broad range of skills, some of which vary by position, while others are
               common across multiple sectors (see <ref target="#figure08">Figure 8</ref>). Some of
               the skills listed are core elements of graduate work, such as writing, research
               skills, and analytical skills. Keeping in mind that the employer sample was quite
               small compared to the main sample, it is worth noting that both groups value many of
               the skills at similar levels; however, there are a couple of discrepancies. First,
               employees tended to undervalue their research skills relative to employers. There are
               several possible reasons for this: first, there may be some activities that employees
               do not recognize as research because it leads to a different end result than they
               might expect, such as a decision being made, rather than a journal article being
               published. Second, research may be a skill that has become so natural that former
               grad students fail to recognize it as something that sets them apart in their jobs. </p>
            <figure xml:id="figure08">
               <graphic url="resources/images/figure08.jpg"/>
            </figure>
            <p>On the other hand, employees tended to overvalue the importance of project management
               among the competencies that their jobs required. That said, project management
               actually tops the list of areas where humanities-trained employees needed training,
               according to employers (see <ref target="#figure09">Figure 9</ref>). This suggests
               that employees overvalued the skill because they found it to be a challenging skill
               that they needed to learn on the job. Employers also cited technical and managerial
               skills as areas that needed training. While the importance of those two skills would
               certainly depend on the type of position, others, such as collaboration, are useful
               in almost any work environment. Even simple things, like adapting to office culture,
               can also prove to be surprisingly challenging if graduates have not had much work
               experience outside of universities.</p>
            <figure xml:id="figure09">
               <graphic url="resources/images/figure09.jpg"/>
            </figure>
            <p>The good news is that all of the elements that make stronger employees would also be
               greatly beneficial for those grads that do go on to become professors. By rethinking
               core curricula in such a way that students gain experience in things like
               collaborative project development and public engagement, departments would be
               strengthening their students’ future prospects regardless of the paths they choose to
               take. While students are generally well prepared for research and teaching, they
               aren’t necessarily ready for the service aspect of a professorship, which
               incorporates many of the same skills that other employers seek. Collaboration and an
               understanding of group dynamics, for instance, would help committee members to work
               more effectively together. Many of the skills also contribute to more creative
               teaching and research. Better project management skills would help faculty to make
               good use of sabbatical years and to balance the anticipated fluctuations in workload,
               while technological skills would lead to new kinds of assignments in the classroom
               and new research insights. And yet, these skills are not typically taught as part of
               the graduate curriculum. Methods courses, which could be used as an opportunity to
               introduce students not only to the critical skills and approaches they will need, but
               also to key issues of professionalization and post-graduate realities, are
               inconsistent and sometimes completely absent, with 28.6% of respondents reporting
               that their programs offered no methods courses whatsoever.</p>
            <p>It is not surprising that employers find that humanities-trained employees need to
               develop in new skills like project management and collaboration. Employees themselves
               also recognize that these are by and large not skills that they acquire in graduate
               school (see <ref target="#figure10">Figure 10</ref>). Skills like collaboration,
               project management, interpersonal skills, and technical skills are all valuable in a
               range of career paths that attract humanities scholars, but graduate programs do not
               typically prepare their students in these areas. Even among those who felt that their
               skills in these areas were strong, they noted that they gained them outside of their
               graduate program — for instance, through jobs or internships. Graduate programs could
               include opportunities to learn and apply these kinds of skills by partnering with
               organizations willing to host interns, or by simulating a work environment through
               collaborative projects with public outcomes (see the Recommendations section for more
               concrete ideas).</p>
            <p>At the same time, graduate students may describe their skills using vocabulary that
               does not resonate outside of academic circles, making it challenging for graduates to
               translate their abilities into aptitudes employers seek. One aspect of career
               training that would be beneficial to graduates is learning how to recast their
               skills. For instance, a dissertation may be more interesting to a potential employer
               if it is framed as a complex, long-term project involving research, written and oral
               communication, and a series of deadlines completed on time. Further, the core skills
               of graduate training — especially research, writing, and analytical skills — are
               highly valuable to employers, and often enable employees to learn new skills quickly.
               Notably, regardless of respondents’ primary responsibilities, many reported that they
               still engaged in some type of research or teaching. Just over half of respondents
               (51%) continue to teach in some way, while an even greater proportion, 68%, perform
               research as a part of their job. Many (61%) also pursue these activities outside
               their position. </p>
            <p>Respondents noted that in their roles, teaching and research often differ
               significantly from the usual forms they take in academic settings, and are frequently
               much less formal. Activities that feel much like teaching may be described as
               presentations, mentorship, and even management. Research may be fast-paced, requiring
               that one seek out and synthesize information quickly in order to facilitate
               decision-making. By understanding these differences, graduates can better prepare
               themselves not only to be competitive candidates, but also to succeed in varied
               workplaces. Because the processes and products of skills like teaching and research
               can seem foreign in new employment environments, it is critical that students don’t
               undervalue (or insufficiently articulate) the ways that graduate study equips them
               for other roles, particularly in the methods and generalized skills that can be
               broadly applied.</p>
            <figure xml:id="figure10">

            <p>It seems clear from the findings that the persistent myth that there is only a single
               academic job market available to graduates is damaging, and extricating graduate
               education from the expectation of tenure-track employment has the potential to
               benefit students, institutions, and the health of the humanities more broadly.
               However, as long as norms are reinforced within departments — by faculty and students
               both — it will be difficult for any change to be effective. </p>
            <p>Despite that challenge, there are a number of effective interventions that programs
               can undertake. There is significant room for improvement in career preparation
               strategies within humanities curricula that will not sacrifice disciplinary rigor or
               depth. Many of the skills that alternative academics identify as crucial to their
               positions — things like project management, collaboration, and communication — are
               also highly beneficial to those working within the professoriate. Structuring courses
               and projects in a way that emphasizes the acquisition of these skills contributes not
               only to the success of students who pursue employment outside the tenure track, but
               also to the vibrant research, teaching, and service of those who pursue academic
               roles.</p>
            <p>To that end, we encourage humanities departments to do the following: <list type="unordered">
                  <item><p><hi rend="bold">Consider evaluating and modifying required aspects of
                           master's- and doctoral-level curricula in favor of including courses that

                           pursue upon completion.</hi></p>
                     <p>This is not to say that graduate programs should become vocational training
                        grounds; rather, this recommendation encourages programs to reconsider the
                        ways in which they currently train graduate students for a single career
                        path — that of the professoriate — and instead broaden the scope of training
                        in order to reflect more accurately the post-graduate realities of their
                        students. Incorporating such training will better equip students for any
                        career — including the professoriate — without detracting from more
                        traditional methodological training. In fact, done well, helping students to
                        learn some of the critical skills highlighted by the survey can actually
                        deepen their grasp of standard disciplinary methods.</p></item>

                     <p>Such a project would not only guide students towards the disciplinary
                        framework that they will need throughout their degree program, but would

                        skills and future employment prospects. Bethany Nowviskie has written
                        compellingly on the topic of rethinking methods courses, and the Praxis

                        benefit with a greater understanding of the research and publication

                     <p>Humanities centers have jump-started excellent training programs, research

                        of Washington offers a cross-disciplinary Certificate in Public Scholarship,
                        numerous fellowships, and a slate of public programing; the center has also
                        cultivated numerous campus-community partnerships <ptr target="#simpson2013"/>. The reports from SCI’s meetings on graduate education reform highlight a

                        <ptr target="#rumsey2012"/>. Departments that would like to move in similar
                        directions can model the kinds of programs being offered by these centers,
                        and might also consider pursuing inter-institutional collaborations as
                        appropriate. There may be valuable opportunities to share infrastructure

                        could build alliances with local cultural heritage organizations in their

                        to engage with those partners either through their research, or through

                        a way that makes sense for their future goals, and for the nature of their

               Many programs face severe budgetary limitations, and simply do not have the funding

               unable to add additional commitments to an already overextended schedule. Both
               students and faculty members may perceive a risk in exploring opportunities outside
               the department’s standard fare. The structures of hiring, promotion, and tenure often
               do not reward risk-taking of this nature, and students or faculty who do pursue
               nonstandard opportunities may be called upon to do additional labor to make their
               work legible to colleagues and evaluators.</p>
            <p>Even though these difficulties are very real, a number of programs have taken
               positive steps toward change and can be looked to as models. As a counterpoint and
               illustration to the survey data, SCI has recently launched another project that we
               hope will be a useful complement to the study: the Praxis Network <ptr target="#praxis2013"/>.<note> I contributed to the development of the Praxis
                  Network as part of my role with SCI.</note> The Praxis Network is a new showcase
               of a small collection of programs that offer new approaches to methodological
               training. Each of these programs can be thought of as one possible response to the
               question of how to equip emerging scholars for a range of career outcomes without
               sacrificing the core values or methodologies of the humanities, and without
               increasing time-to-degree. The goals of each are student-focused,
               digitally-inflected, interdisciplinary, and frequently oriented around collaborative
               projects and public engagement. They share similar goals but different structures.
               Because most of the programs are relatively new, it is too early to provide data on
               graduate outcomes. So far, however, students who complete the programs do appear to
               be highly competitive for the roles that they pursue, with some graduates working in
               university libraries, software companies, and as faculty members.<note>
                  Unfortunately, I cannot compare the employment rates of different types of
                  graduate programs. Most graduate programs do not track their graduates’ employment
                  paths. Those that do some form of tracking often include information about the
                  graduates who go on to tenure-track faculty careers. With funding from the Alfred
                  P. Sloan Foundation and the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation, the Council of Graduate
                  Schools recently conducted a study to determine the feasibility of tracking career
                  pathways across multiple disciplines. The project report from that study was
                  released in December 2014 <ptr target="#CGS2014"/>.</note></p>
            <p>Other innovative programs are emerging and growing at a wide range of institutions.
               For instance, the Digital Humanities Summer Institutes, started in 2001 at the
               University of Victoria, offer weeklong courses in topics related to the digital
               humanities <ptr target="#dhsi2014"/>. The DHSI model, which has recently expanded to
               other institutions around the world (currently in Halifax, Nova Scotia, Canada;
               Leipzig and Paderborn, Germany; Beirut, Lebanon; Bern, Switzerland; Oxford, UK; and
               Indianapolis, Indiana, U.S.), offers those within the communities of humanities
               scholars an opportunity to develop new skills as peers. A number of consortia are
               developing as well, such as Humanities Without Walls, which will connect scholars at
               fifteen research institutions in the Midwest to facilitate collaborative research and
               offer career-related workshops to pre-doctoral students interested in careers beyond
               the professoriate <ptr target="#illinois2014"/>. The appendix of the Report of the
               MLA Task Force on Doctoral Study in Modern Language and Literature <ptr target="#taskforce2014"/> profiles a number of other innovative doctoral programs,
               all of which offer compelling models.</p>
            <p>Some of these programs are fairly small and competitive, which has several
               advantages: students benefit from strong mentorship and close collaborations with one
               another when working in small cohorts. Some are extracurricular, and are housed
               outside of departments (for instance, in libraries or humanities centers), which can
               allow for greater flexibility and interdisciplinarity. Now that we have the benefit
               of more data, however, we believe that incorporating elements of this type of
               training into the structure of departments themselves is an important move,
               especially in terms of sustainability (gaining a hard budget line, rather than
               operating solely or primarily on grant funding) and in terms of access (ensuring that
               all graduate students benefit from the training opportunities).</p>

            <head>CONCLUSION</head>
            <p>With the availability of new data to work from, the Praxis Network programs to use as
               inspiration or models, and the recommendations above as possible guiding principles,
               graduate programs now have a robust set of tools available that can help facilitate
               curricular assessment and new initiatives. With increasing pressures from many
               university administrations to evaluate effectiveness and to consider what new models
               might be in the long-term interest of an institution, humanities programs have a
               strong incentive to demonstrate the ways that their graduate programs contribute to
               the vitality of the university and the broader public sphere. Humanists should be
               making a case for effective modes of engaging with new technologies and new skills,
               or that role may be entrusted to private corporations that lack a clear interest in
               the sustained vitality of higher education.</p>
            <p>While the recommendations outlined in this report represent important steps to take,
               they represent only a small element of a much broader picture of higher education, in
               which a great many issues must be addressed simultaneously, as Michael Bérubé has
               convincingly argued <ptr target="#bérubé2013"/>. Poor labor conditions for many
               part-time and contingent faculty members, an average time to degree of nearly a
               decade <ptr target="#survey2012"/>, and increasingly burdensome levels of student
               debt are problems that should concern people committed to humanities education,
               whether they work in universities, cultural heritage organizations, or elsewhere.
               Further, as modes of scholarly production and authoring continue to shift, the
               standards for evaluating scholarship for purposes like hiring and promotion must be
               reassessed. The health of humanities education affects the preparedness of future
               faculty and staff; the perceived public value of the discipline; the quality of
               humanities research and other work products; and much more.</p>
            <p>Equipping graduate students with the skills and literacies needed for 21<hi rend="superscript">st</hi> century scholarly work — from technical fluency to an
               understanding of organizational structures — is critical to ensuring continued
               rigorous and creative research and other work products. Remaining wedded to outmoded
               systems, including a model of apprenticeship in higher education that reinforces the
               false assumption that professorship is the only meaningful career for humanities
               doctoral recipients, does a tremendous disservice to all individuals and
               organizations that benefit from humanistic perspectives. It is essential that
               humanities programs begin to equip graduate students for varied career paths and deep
               public engagement, while also emphasizing the value of working in a range of sectors
               beyond the tenure track. Professorships should not be seen as the sole prestigious
               career for humanists; instead, any intellectually rewarding role that contributes to
               society should be seen as a tremendously successful outcome. The time is ripe for
               prestige to be measured not only by tenure track placement rates, but also through
               the many other careers that graduates choose to pursue, and ways that those paths
               positively benefit the broader ecosystem of our shared cultural heritage.<lb/></p>
