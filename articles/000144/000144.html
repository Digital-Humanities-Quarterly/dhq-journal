         <div class="p">In 1847, editor Rufus Griswold published an extensive anthology of American prose, <span class="titlem">The Prose Writers of America</span>, a follow-up to his popular 1842 anthology of American poetry, <span class="titlem">The Poets and Poetry of America</span>. In both of these works, Griswold collects and introduces the works of more than seventy authors he believes will define <span class="quote_inline">a National Literature that shall fulfil (sic) our  [the United States’] promise to mankind</span> [[undefined griswold1847]]. In <span class="titlem">Prose Writers</span> Griswold calls Nathaniel Hawthorne’s writing <span class="quote_inline">superior to all else of a similar description in the English language,</span> while in a shorter preface to Hawthorne’s contributions Griswold ranks him <span class="quote_inline">among the first of the first order of our writers…not excelled in the literature of the present day or of the English language</span> [[undefined griswold1847]]. Given the ambitious aims of his anthology, this is high praise indeed. However, Meredith McGill calls Griswold’s praise of Hawthorne <span class="quote_inline">striking</span> because <span class="quote_inline">Griswold’s selections are all what we would consider minor fiction</span> <a href="#mcgill2003" class="link_ptr">[50]</a>. Griswold ignores the stories that modern readers favor, such as <span class="titlem">Young Goodman Brown</span> <a class="link_ptr" href="hawthorne1835"><span>hawthorne1835</span></a>, <span class="titlem">The Minister’s Black Veil</span> <a href="#hawthorne1836" class="link_ptr">[43]</a>, or <span class="titlem">Rappaccini’s Daughter</span> <a href="#hawthorne1844b" class="link_ptr">[44]</a>. Though these stories were available to him, Griswold instead reprints four Hawthorne stories that modern literary critics, teachers, and anthology editors mostly ignore: <span class="titlem">A Rill from the Town Pump,</span> <span class="titlem">David Swan — A Fantasy,</span> <span class="titlem">Spring,</span> and <span class="titlem">The Celestial Railroad.</span> </div>
         <div class="p">The mystery of Griswold’s selections, however, can now be at least partially explained due to the extensive record of texts and paratexts available in digital archives of nineteenth-century newspapers, periodicals, and books. Working with such archives — either through basic search or more complex text-mining techniques — can enable scholars to assemble textual histories more quickly and comprehensively than traditional archival research allows. More importantly, these textual histories can differ in character from traditional bibliographies by including primary literary texts, reprints, and also the paratexts that introduced, extended, amended, or critiqued them. In search results from digital archives, paratexts cluster with their parent texts, foregrounding the cultural conversations that shaped how readers encountered and interpreted literary works. <span class="note" id="Note1"> [Simply <em>finding</em> paratexts not directly appended to primary texts within print archives can be a matter of luck. Brief references or allusions to other works within the tight columns of a nineteenth-century newspaper are often not apparent to even the well-trained scholarly eye. If those references or allusions include key terms from the original text, however, the digital archive may well surface them, enriching our understanding of both the original text and its cultural history.]</span> In his work on twentieth- and twenty-first-century fiction, Ed Finn calls these conversations <span class="quote_inline">the social lives of books.</span> Finn mines online reviews and recommendations of David Foster Wallace from sites such as Amazon to find <span class="quote_inline">traces of popular reading choices</span> which can <blockquote class="quote inline"><p>constitute a fresh perspective on elusive audience reactions to literature, one that reveals distinct networks of conversation that are transforming the relationships between writers and their readers</p></blockquote> <a href="#finn2011" class="link_ptr">[21]</a>. Digital archives of nineteenth-century texts expose similar ‘literary networks’ <div class="note" id="Note2"><span class="noteLabel">Note: </span>Tanya Clement also suggests the term ‘social text networks’ in the <span class="titlem">Journal of the Text Encoding Initiative</span> <a href="#clement2011" class="link_ptr">[13]</a>. In this article, I will use ‘literary networks,’ ‘textual networks,’ and ‘social textual networks’ as rough synonyms to name these sets of interconnected texts and paratexts.</div> around short stories, poems, essays, and books, foregrounding questions of reception and cultural impact that traditional bibliographies can obscure.</div>
         <p>Digging for one of Griswold’s <span class="titlem">Prose Writers</span> selections, Hawthorne’s <span class="titlem">The Celestial Railroad,</span> in a range of digital archives,<span class="note" id="Note3"> [For a list of digital archives that have been invaluable to this study, see Appendix 1]</span> I have uncovered an extensive network of reprinting, reauthorship, and reference that can help explain Griswold’s selection of <span class="titlem">The Celestial Railroad</span> for <span class="titlem">Prose Writers</span> in 1847 and illuminates the importance of digital methodologies for literary study. By the time of Griswold’s publication, <span class="titlem">The Celestial Railroad</span> had appeared in newspapers and magazines across the country and made Hawthorne’s reputation for many readers. Griswold’s was only one in a series of reprintings that began days after the tale first appeared in the May 1843 issue of the <span class="titlem">United States Magazine and Democratic Review</span>. <span class="titlem">The Celestial Railroad</span> was not a minor work, but rather a central text in the nineteenth-century evangelical canon, popular for its doctrinal orthodoxy and pithy moral instruction — both characteristics modern scholars rarely associate with Hawthorne, but which were central to his early reception in contemporary religious circles.<span class="note" id="Note4"> [ While <span class="titlem">The Celestial Railroad</span> was published in non-evangelical religious periodicals, the vast majority of reprintings appeared in newspapers and magazines run by evangelical denominations: e.g. Baptist, Methodist, Adventist. My discussion in this article, then, will focus on evangelical responses to the story, though there will be points of intersection between evangelical print culture, the larger world of religious print culture, and the even larger world of popular print culture that was, in the early nineteenth century, often tacitly evangelical in outlook.]</span> Indeed, the religious editors and readers — a particular social literary network — that embraced and shared Hawthorne’s early work helped shape readers’ reception of his later novels. </p>
         <div class="p"><span class="titlem">The Celestial Railroad</span> is a satirical re-imagination of John Bunyan’s <span class="titlem">Pilgrim’s Progress </span>in light of technological and theological ‘progress.’ The tale satirizes the easy, modern Christianity of the nineteenth century. Modern critics have mostly ignored this allegory as a quirky story unrepresentative of Hawthorne’s oeuvre. However, the larger cultural history of <span class="titlem">The Celestial Railroad</span> — the social life of the tale — has been obscured to scholars until recently. The most thorough Hawthorne bibliography, C. E. Frazer Clark’s <span class="titlem">Nathaniel Hawthorne: A Descriptive Bibliography</span>, lists 22 reprintings of the story in pamphlets, magazines, and newspapers through the nineteenth century <a href="#clark1978" class="link_ptr">[12]</a>. Referencing Clark, Meredith McGill notes that <span class="quote_inline">a comprehensive list of the reprinting of Hawthorne’s tales,</span> would require <span class="quote_inline">a bibliographic feat which is as yet impossible due to the inadequately indexed state of nineteenth-century periodicals</span> <a href="#mcgill2003" class="link_ptr">[50]</a>. While a <em>complete</em> bibliography of any story remains out of reach for the reason McGill names, recent projects to digitize nineteenth-century periodicals provide scholars with tools unavailable when Clark compiled his work. </div>
         <p>By mining a range of digital archives and non-digitized newspapers that digital editions referenced, I’ve uncovered more than 47 reprints of <span class="titlem">The Celestial Railroad</span> during the nineteenth century, and several in the early decades of the twentieth — more than double the printings Clark lists in his bibliography.<span class="note" id="Note5"> [ I’m currently working on a digital edition of  <span class="titlem">The Celestial Railroad</span> that will allow scholars to compare versions of the text and see the editorial changes I discuss here. My current bibliography for periodical reprintings of <span class="titlem">The Celestial Railroad</span> is available online [[undefined cordell2012a]] and in Appendix 1. A basic, TEI-encoded version of the original, <span class="titlem">Democratic Review</span> edition of the story can be found online at Juxta Commons. See <a href="#hawthorne1843a" class="link_ptr">[29]</a>.]</span> I’ve also found several books and stories inspired by <span class="titlem">The Celestial Railroad</span> and nearly 100 direct references to the characters, settings, and themes of Hawthorne’s tale in contemporary articles and books. These paratexts have proved particularly valuable, revealing a number of new insights about Hawthorne’s early career and his relationship to the popular press. In particular, this research has pointed toward a new understanding of Hawthorne’s reception by contemporary religious readers. </p>
         <div class="p">In this article I will examine the editorial changes, introductions, and glosses that recast the message of <span class="titlem">The Celestial Railroad</span> for different denominational audiences. I will argue that the religious press valued the story for its antisectarian moral and, simultaneously, as a shot across the bow of competing sects. Finally, by examining <span class="titlem">The Celestial Railroad’s</span> history of reprinting and revision in the religious press, I hope to briefly suggest a new reading of Hawthorne’s famous frustration with <span class="quote_inline">the pamphlet and piratical system</span> that he worried, in a letter to Horatio Bridge, forced him <span class="quote_inline">to work hard for small gains</span> as a short story writer <a href="#hawthorne1987" class="link_ptr">[26]</a>.  I hope to show that his feeling of being <span class="quote_inline">taken possession of so unceremoniously,</span> as his wife Sophia claimed in a letter to Louisa Hawthorne <a href="#hawthorne1987" class="link_ptr">[26]</a>, may have been grounded in disaffection with the sectarian squabbling that both motivated and sustained the tale’s life in the religious print market. Indeed, this disaffection may have prompted the one substantial edit Hawthorne made to the story between its initial magazine publication (1843) and its appearance in Hawthorne’s short-story collection, <span class="titlem">Mosses from an Old Manse </span>(1846)<span class="titlem">.</span>

         <p>Alongside my arguments locating Hawthorne in the evangelical canon, I will discuss how digital archives of nineteenth-century texts enabled my discoveries about <span class="titlem">The Celestial Railroad</span> and how digital interpretive tools helped me make better sense of the story’s enlarged bibliography. I hope by this discussion to suggest how these new technologies can inform future work in bibliography, periodical studies, and American literary history. As more of our cultural legacy is digitized, through thematic research collections and larger archives such as Google Books or HathiTrust, newly apparent historical and textual narratives promise to multiply exponentially. Not only will new witnesses of stories, poems, and essays surface, but so to will literary networks of reference, critique, and allusion that previously could have only been discovered through chance encounter or laborious scrutiny. The rewards of intensive, traditional bibliographic research may have seemed distant and speculative — a minute return for much labor. Mass digitization promises to reduce the time required for such research while allowing scholars to move between different scales of analysis, weighing the conclusions suggested by individual texts against those drawn through quantitative analysis of larger collections and archives — and, conversely, weighing conclusions drawn through distant analysis of archives against the telling details of individual texts. Rather than ‘close’ or ‘distant’ reading, we might call this ‘zoomable reading,’ in which one moves between levels of perspective to build a robust argument.<span class="note" id="Note6"> [
               <span class="p"> Martin Mueller has coined the similar term ‘scalable reading’ for methodologies in which researchers <blockquote class="quote inline"><p>use methods developed in Natural Language Processing to perform rough mapping operations that are then followed by a targeted examination of selected examples</p></blockquote> <a href="#mueller2012" class="link_ptr">[52]</a>. While I prefer the ocular metaphor of ‘zoomable’ I am not committed to the terminology so much as the hybrid methodologies both terms represent.</span>
            ]</span> Zoomable reading is particularly suited for uncovering and making sense of the social textual networks that <span class="titlem">The Celestial Railroad</span> exemplifies — both the nodes of individual texts (close) and the edges of intertextual conversations (distant).</p>
         <div class="p">Of course, claims of ‘more, better, faster’ are unlikely to convince entrenched traditional literary scholars to experiment with digital modes of scholarship, which is why I devote the majority of this article to the humanistic payoffs of my digital research. The discoveries I enumerate here are theoretically quite traditional. Were I to remove references to my methodologies, this essay would outline a new historical account of Hawthorne’s early career drawn from a range of primary sources: contemporary books and periodicals. The witnesses and paratexts I have accumulated <em>could</em> have been amassed through trips to archives and interlibrary loan. In practice, however, this study emphasizes the great benefits of working in a digital scholarly mode. To build a bibliography like mine for <span class="titlem">The Celestial Railroad</span> without digital book and periodical archives would require what McGann deems <span class="quote_inline">unacceptable expenditures of time and labor</span> <a class="link_ptr" href="mcgann2001"><span>mcgann2001</span></a>. Finding such a range of sources — including many obscure regional or denominational periodicals and many reprints uncited in any other publication — would have been the work of years rather than months.</div>
         <div class="p">Of course, the greater expansiveness of digital archives should not be confused with completeness. If anything, the paratexts one can uncover digitally can emphasize the partialness of enumerative bibliographies. As Susan Belasco points out, <blockquote class="quote inline"><p>anyone who thinks that most historical periodicals are available online would be surprised to learn how many periodicals — especially newspapers — have not been recovered in electronic papers</p></blockquote>  <a href="#belasco2011" class="link_ptr">[9]</a>. I’m certain that many more reprintings of <span class="titlem">The Celestial Railroad</span> exist. Antebellum southern periodicals, for instance, are less thoroughly represented in online archives than northern and midwestern papers. Consequently, I’ve been unable to substantiate Moncure D. Conway’s 1882 claim that <span class="quote_inline"><span class="titlem">The Celestial Railway</span> (sic) was the first piece by Hawthorne that penetrated our Southern Region</span> when it was <span class="quote_inline">copied in the newspapers of that region, and much enjoyed as a satire upon the rationalistic tendencies of the North</span> <a href="#conway1882" class="link_ptr">[15]</a>. Conway specifies elsewhere that <span class="quote_inline">[i]n 1848 the Richmond <span class="titlem">Examiner</span> brought into our house <span class="titlem">The Celestial Railroad,</span> by Nathaniel Hawthorne</span> — a claim I’ve been unable to verify due to sparse library holdings, digital or otherwise, of that newspaper for the 1840s <a href="#conway1902" class="link_ptr">[14]</a>.<span class="note" id="Note7"> [ It’s also quite possible that Conway, writing 56 years after the fact, misremembered or misrepresented the specifics of this early encounter with the story.]</span> I’ve so far confirmed only one southern reprinting, in Louisville, Kentucky’s <span class="titlem">Baptist Banner and Western Pioneer</span>, who printed the tale in two parts on October 19 and 26, 1843 <a href="#hawthorne1843i" class="link_ptr">[37]</a>.<div class="note" id="Note8"><span class="noteLabel">Note: </span> Louisville’s situation on the Indiana border, combined with Kentucky’s neutrality and then Union allegiance during the Civil War, make this a marginally ‘southern’ reprinting. The <span class="titlem">Banner</span> also makes no claims to the piece’s satirical object being ‘the North,’ as Conway claims the story was interpreted in many southern reprintings.</div> 
         </div>
         <div class="p">Moreover, the digital archival resources we have are far from perfect.  I could point, for instance, to Geoffrey Nunberg’s concerns about Google Books; to answer scholarly questions, Nunberg argues, scholars <span class="quote_inline">need reliable metadata about dates and categories,</span> but Google’s <span class="quote_inline">metadata are a train wreck: a mish-mash wrapped in a muddle wrapped in a mess</span> <a href="#nunberg2009" class="link_ptr">[56]</a>. Metadata isn’t the only problem. The quality of OCR across the range of nineteenth-century textual archives is uneven, resulting in widely variable search results. ‘Dirty’ OCR forces more creative search techniques from scholars mining archives for specific treasure, and scholars must be content knowing their results will be incomplete. Finally, scholars worry that so much of our cultural heritage sits restricted behind pay-walls, as are many of the most thorough archives of nineteenth-century periodicals <a href="#belasco2011" class="link_ptr">[9]</a>.	</div>
         <div class="p">These are all concerns that digital humanities scholars must continue to voice. As Wesley Raabe contends, however, <span class="quote_inline">an attitude of suspicion toward digital resources</span> can be as harmful as an attitude of blithe advocacy: <span class="quote_inline">[a] digital text prepared by OCR means, which is inadequate for many purposes, is uniquely able to complement other methods of text acquisition</span> <a href="#raabe2011" class="link_ptr">[57]</a>. In the case of <span class="titlem">The Celestial Railroad,</span> OCR texts of widely variant quality have yielded significant treasure, especially when complemented by discoveries made through traditional archival research. It is worth noting, for instance, that I discovered those two Conway references to southern reprintings of <span class="titlem">The Celestial Railroad</span> in Google Books. In other words, I wouldn’t know to be frustrated at the limited holdings of southern texts within digital archives had a digital archive not alerted me to the likelihood of southern printings of <span class="titlem">The Celestial Railroad.</span> That limited digital resources helped uncover such a rich story of our literary history should lead us to advocate for increased digitization of newspapers and magazines. As Belasco argues of Whitman, engaging with periodicals <span class="quote_inline">provides fresh ways of understanding</span> antebellum authors’ <span class="quote_inline">publication practices and enhances our understanding of nineteenth-century practices of reading and writing more generally</span> <a href="#belasco2011" class="link_ptr">[9]</a>.</div>
         <div class="p">It is especially fitting that digital technologies help uncover the life of a text in the mass media of the nineteenth century. As John A. Walsh points out in his contribution to <span class="titlem">A Companion to Digital Literary Studies</span>, the nineteenth century <span class="quote_inline">holds a special attraction for digital literary scholarship</span> because its technical revolutions immediately generated our own, while the effects of those revolutions paralleled the effects of the digital age on society today. <span class="quote_inline">Many features of the nineteenth century,</span> he claims, <blockquote class="quote inline"><p>increased literacy rates, the beginnings of mass media, the decreasing costs of publishing — led to ever-increasing volumes of information and the need for ever more sophisticated and flexible technologies for representing and managing that information</p></blockquote> <a href="#walsh2008" class="link_ptr">[62]</a>. Indeed, the life of <span class="titlem">The Celestial Railroad</span> in the antebellum press, as it was passed from publication to publication across the country, closely resembles the lives of modern texts that move freely among traditional periodicals, blogs, tweets, and Facebook posts.</div>
         </div>
         <div class="teidiv0" id="index.xml-body.1_div.3"><h2><span class="headingNumber">3. </span><span class="head">The Re-authorship of Hawthorne’s <span class="titlem">The Celestial Railroad</span></span></h2>
            
         <div class="p">In <span class="titlem">American Literature and the Culture of Reprinting</span>, Meredith McGill argues that the antebellum American experience of texts was shaped by the widespread, normative practice of reprinting stories and poems, without authorial permission, in newspapers, literary magazines, and other media. ‘Reprinting,’ she argues, <blockquote class="quote inline"><p> is a form of textual production that is inseparable from distribution and reception…reprinted texts call attention to the repeated acts of articulation by which culture and its audiences are constituted</p></blockquote> <a href="#mcgill2003" class="link_ptr">[50]</a>. <span class="titlem">The Celestial Railroad</span> exemplifies the culture McGill describes. The tale was explicitly rearticulated by editors, who often prefaced their reprintings with laudatory introductions that contextualized Hawthorne’s story for their readers. Not unlike a popular link on the internet, the impact of Hawthorne’s story on culture can largely be judged by how often the work was reappropriated and recontextualized. </div>
         <div class="p">In the United States before the Civil War, a significant proportion of any author’s audience was deeply religious. It is this religious audience that Candy Gunther Brown locates in <span class="titlem">The Word in the World</span>, where she argues that American <blockquote class="quote inline"><p>evangelicals viewed participation in a textual community defined by an informal canon of texts…using the Word and their own words to influence the world’s redemption</p></blockquote> <a href="#brown2004" class="link_ptr">[10]</a>. <span class="titlem">The Celestial Railroad</span> did appear in secular papers like the <span class="titlem">Salem Gazette</span> <a href="#hawthorne1843k" class="link_ptr">[39]</a>, <span class="titlem">Republican Compiler</span> <a href="#hawthorne1843l" class="link_ptr">[40]</a>, and the <span class="titlem">National Anti-Slavery Standard</span> <a href="#hawthorne1843m" class="link_ptr">[41]</a> but the story moved quickly to the religious press. The Freewill Baptist’s <span class="titlem">Morning Star</span> reprinted the story first, less than a month after its <span class="titlem">Democratic Review</span> debut, and the <span class="titlem">Star’s</span> editors noted it <span class="quote_inline">is from the Democratic Review</span> while claiming it <span class="quote_inline">is worth the price of the Star for a year</span> <a href="#hawthorne1843b" class="link_ptr">[30]</a>. Denominational periodicals reprinted the tale first and most frequently, including the Adventists’ <span class="titlem">Midnight Cry!</span> <a href="#hawthorne1843e" class="link_ptr">[33]</a> and <span class="titlem">Signs of the Times</span> <a href="#hawthorne1843c" class="link_ptr">[31]</a>;<div class="note" id="Note9"><span class="noteLabel">Note: </span> Commonly known as ‘Millerites’ after the Baptist pastor William Miller, whose predictions of the end of the world organized this diverse group of primarily evangelical Christians — mostly Baptists, Methodists, and Presbyterians.

Between 1843 and the release of <span class="titlem">Mosses</span> in 1846, the story was reprinted in many more religious than secular newspapers. </div>
         <div class="p">Religious newspapers were widespread and influential in the 1840s. David Paul Nord identifies early nineteenth-century publishers of tracts and religious newspapers as producers of America’s first mass medium <a href="#nord2004" class="link_ptr">[54]</a>. <span class="quote_inline">By the end of the 1840s,</span> Brown tells us, <blockquote class="quote inline"><p>most religious denominations endorsed at least one periodical per state, many of them privately owned but issued in the name of the editor’s denomination.</p></blockquote> Brown provides useful figures for the larger periodicals market at well: <blockquote class="quote inline"><p>there were perhaps 5,000–6,000 periodicals founded during the first quarter of the nineteenth century, 4,000–5,000 in the second quarter, 2,500 from 1850 to 1865, and 4,300 in the 1870s, with a total circulation of 10.5 million, or enough to reach one in three Americans</p></blockquote> <a href="#brown2004" class="link_ptr">[10]</a>. </div>
         <div class="p">In the 1840s and 50s those religious readers encountered <span class="titlem">The Celestial Railroad</span> in their denomination’s newspapers, magazines, and tracts, and Hawthorne’s fame grew in the religious press even as Hawthorne complained about his stories’ obscurity. McGill argues that <span class="quote_inline">the presumption of Hawthorne’s rejection by the public has enabled critics to regard his early fiction through a highly selective lens,</span> a claim the <span class="titlem">Church Review and Ecclesiastical Register</span> echoed directly in an 1851 review of <span class="titlem">The Scarlet Letter</span>. Noting Hawthorne’s own public complaints about his popularity, the <span class="titlem">Review</span> claims, <blockquote class="quote inline"><p>We think far more highly of Hawthorne than he does of himself, judging by the reflection which we find in his own mirror…you know that Hawthorne’s books are fairly thumbed to pieces by the readers of all circulating libraries</p></blockquote> <a class="link_ptr" href="anonymous1851"><span>anonymous1851</span></a>.<span class="note" id="Note10"> [I cannot explore the geography of <span class="titlem">The Celestial Railroad</span> in this article, though I am developing a follow-up article that will do so.

The <span class="titlem">Review</span> notes, <span class="quote_inline">we were ignorant of the existence of so clever a writer, until we came across his <span class="titlem">Celestial Railroad,</span> in the columns of a newspaper</span> and deems <span class="titlem">The Celestial Railroad</span> <blockquote class="quote inline"><p>the most natural production of our author’s genius, which his books contain…It is one of the cleverest, most sustained, and most ingenious specimens of quiet satire to be found in our language.</p></blockquote>  This tale brought Hawthorne’s name into the consciousnesses of readers — evangelical, pious, geographically dispersed — who otherwise might not have known or cared to know it, so that in April of 1850 the <span class="titlem">Christian Secretary</span>, while listing contributors to <span class="titlem">Graham’s Magazine</span>, would refer to <span class="quote_inline">Hawthorne, of Celestial Railroad memory</span> <a href="#anonymous1850" class="link_ptr">[5]</a>.</div>
         <div class="p">The digital record of this story’s reprinting includes many similar plaudits, which are difficult to reconcile with most modern assessments of Hawthorne. Alfred Kazin speaks for many scholars when he claims that Hawthorne should be read purely as a religious outsider, for whom <blockquote class="quote inline"><p>[n]o orthodoxy, ever, permits the irony, skepticism, personal despair — above all else the sense of contradiction and unreality in human affairs that makes up the true storyteller</p></blockquote> <a href="#kazin1997" class="link_ptr">[47]</a>. Religious readers of <span class="titlem">The Celestial Railroad,</span> however, valued Hawthorne’s story in large part because of its satirical bite. Writing about the American Sunday School Union’s (ASSU) popular tract version of <span class="titlem">The Celestial Railroad</span> in 1874,<span class="note" id="Note11"> [ The Sunday School Union reprinted Hawthorne’s tale under the title <span class="titlem">A Visit to the Celestial City</span>. These tracts are not attributed to Hawthorne; in lieu of a byline, there is a note that the story had been <span class="quote_inline">Revised by the Committee of Publication of the American Sunday School Union.</span> The tract version was very successful, and was reprinted, essentially unchanged from the original plates, in 1847, 1852, 1871, 1897, and 1928. Most of these versions can be found in the <span class="titlem">Google Books</span> corpus. Though these tracts don’t attribute the story to Hawthorne, Fisher’s remarks here indicate that the provenance of the story was well known to at least some of the Sunday School Union’s readers.]</span> the Rev. George P. Fisher calls it <span class="quote_inline">a curious fact that the Sunday-School Society should be the publisher of Hawthorne. But,</span> he continues, <blockquote class="quote inline"><p>whoever has read <span class="titlem">the Celestial Railroad</span> will admit that this exquisite satire is well entitled to its place on the catalogue of books relating to religion, to be disseminated broadcast over the land</p></blockquote> <a href="#fisher1874" class="link_ptr">[22]</a>. In other words, while religious readers did note with some curiousness their admiration for <span class="titlem">The Celestial Railroad,</span> they nonetheless defended its religious value. Its irony was not seen as antithetical to orthodoxy, but even instructional. </div>
         <div class="p">Denominational papers lauded the story’s <span class="quote_inline">rich stores of instruction</span> [<span class="titlem">Midnight Cry </span>1843], <span class="quote_inline">the <span class="titlem">moral</span> it teaches</span> [<span class="titlem">Signs of the Times</span> 1843], and its ‘admirable commentary’ [<span class="titlem">Visit to the Celestial City</span> 1843], while being <span class="quote_inline">repeatedly solicited to republish it</span> by their readers [<span class="titlem">Christian Secretary</span> 1848]. It was <span class="quote_inline">a startling, impressive little work, worthy to be a sequel to Bunyan’s Pilgrim’s Progress</span> [<span class="titlem">New York Evangelist</span> 1852] and a <span class="quote_inline">remarkable satire on worldly religion</span> [[undefined advocate1869]]. In 1847 the evangelical <span class="titlem">New Englander</span> journal wrote that <blockquote class="quote inline"><p>Mr. Hawthorne has a very pleasant and good natured, yet successful and effective way of hitting off, or satirizing the faults and foibles and errors of individuals and cliques, of schools, and communities, and ages</p></blockquote> <a href="#d1847" class="link_ptr">[19]</a>. For the <span class="titlem">New Englander</span>, <span class="titlem">The Celestial Railroad</span> was <span class="quote_inline">that which, in this respect, surpasses all his other writings, and we were about to say the writings of all but John Bunyan</span> <a href="#d1847" class="link_ptr">[19]</a>, while in 1869 the <span class="titlem">Freewill Baptist Quarterly</span> grouped <span class="titlem">The Celestial Railroad</span> with <span class="titlem">The Scarlet Letter</span> and <span class="titlem">The Marble Faun</span> as the three works of Hawthorne that were ‘sure of long life.’ <a href="#anonymous1869" class="link_ptr">[1]</a>. In fact, <span class="titlem">The Celestial Railroad</span> seems to have joined <span class="quote_inline">the informal, open-ended ‘canon’ of texts</span> that Brown claims shaped <span class="quote_inline">an evangelical textual community</span> in the nineteenth century <a href="#brown2004" class="link_ptr">[10]</a>. It was frequently reprinted in denominational newspapers and anthologized in books for Sunday Schools and pastoral training. Perhaps more tellingly, its scenes and characters became so familiar for readers that writers frequently referred to them without providing any explanatory context; religious writers in the nineteenth century assumed that their readers knew <span class="titlem">The Celestial Railroad.</span></div>
         <div class="p">This popular history disappeared, however, into the mass of textual information that accumulated throughout the nineteenth century, <span class="quote_inline">when the amount of recorded information produced…becomes overwhelming and nearly impossible to process through traditional means, such as reading</span> <a href="#walsh2008" class="link_ptr">[62]</a>. Searchable digital archives allowed me to recover the social text of <span class="titlem">The Celestial Railroad,</span> while textual analysis software helped me make sense of its fluidity. John Bryant writes that <blockquote class="quote inline"><p>[d]igital scholarship offers alternatives that can raise the consciousness of readers about the inherent fluidity of texts and the modes of revision that cause textual fluidity</p></blockquote> <a href="#bryant2011" class="link_ptr">[11]</a>. Bryant’s notion of ‘fluidity’ refers primarily to authorial or authorized editorial revisions of literary texts; readers should <span class="quote_inline">witness the different sequential versions of a work together as a representation of the invisible process of writing</span> <a href="#bryant2011" class="link_ptr">[11]</a>. However, Bryant’s insights can be extended also to texts like <span class="titlem">The Celestial Railroad,</span> which were revised by both authorized and unauthorized editors. Witnessing the ‘different sequential versions’ of <span class="titlem">The Celestial Railroad</span> offers insight into ‘the invisible process’ of editing undertaken by nineteenth-century newspaper and magazine editors.</div>
         <div class="p">When Hawthorne’s original text didn’t exactly fit the purposes of a given publication, it was freely emended, and even in rare cases expanded, to better fit the mission or message it was intended to convey. Leslee Thorne-Murphy calls this phenomenon <span class="quote_inline">reauthorship: a combination of successive individuals writing, editing, and rewriting in a way that shapes anew the image of a single author</span> [[undefined thorne-murphy2010]]. For Thorne-Murphy reauthorship is <blockquote class="quote inline"><p>a type of editing that appropriates and refashions a text — a hybrid notion of authorship, one in which both editors and authors are creative and original rewriters</p></blockquote> [[undefined thorne-murphy2010]]. Hawthorne’s <span class="titlem">The Celestial Railroad</span> was frequently reauthored as it spread across the United States in the 1840s and 50s. Such editions of the story demonstrate not only Hawthorne’s influence on evangelical culture in 1843, but also the influence of contemporary evangelical culture on Hawthorne’s burgeoning national reputation, and perhaps its influence on Hawthorne himself. </div>
            <p>To discover these moments of reauthorship, I compared reprintings of <span class="titlem">The Celestial Railroad</span> using the Juxta collation tool (<a class="link_ref" href="juxtasoftware.org">juxtasoftware.org</a>),<span class="note" id="Note12"> [ Thanks to the recent release of Juxta Commons, a new web service from NINES that allows online sharing of Juxta-created comparison sets, I can provide links directly to side-by-side comparison sets of the texts I discuss through the rest of this essay.

         <div class="p">By comparing transcriptions of different <span class="titlem">Celestial Railroad</span> witnesses in Juxta, I was able to easily discover the changes that editors made to Hawthorne’s tale. Juxta was particularly useful in highlighting comparatively minor changes: those likely to slip my unmediated notice. I found that nearly every periodical reprinting of <span class="titlem">The Celestial Railroad</span> modifies Hawthorne’s text somehow, though it is often difficult to gauge the intent behind particular changes. Some cuts seem space-saving, others aesthetic: many publications, for instance, edited Hawthorne’s purposefully archaic ‘burthens’ to ‘burdens.’ The ASSU’s <span class="titlem">Visit to the Celestial City</span> anglicized the spellings of words, excised all references to body parts (‘stomach’ and ‘belly’, in various places, became ‘front’), and cut Prince Beelzebub’s appearance during the narrator’s stay in Vanity.<span class="note" id="Note13"> [ A side-by-side comparison of the original <span class="titlem">Democratic Review </span>printing and the ASSU’s <span class="titlem">Visit to the Celestial City</span> can be found at http://juxtacommons.org/shares/7fRVkn.]</span> The ASSU sought to combat spiritual ignorance by building libraries of religious instruction for children <a href="#nord2004" class="link_ptr">[54]</a>, and so we might speculate that these latter changes to <span class="titlem">The Celestial Railroad</span> were designed to protect those children from tantalizing or frightening images. The two most frequently cut passages come from the narrator’s journey thorough Vanity Fair’s marketplace. Approximately one third of the witnesses excised the narrator’s description of ‘a very pretty girl’ who <span class="quote_inline">bartered a heart as clear as crystal</span> for a <span class="quote_inline">worn and defaced…jewel of the same kind,</span> as well as a passage detailing how <span class="quote_inline">a member of Congress recruited his pocket by the sale of his constituents.</span> </div>

               The original change highlighted from the <span class="titlem">Midnight Cry</span>s reprinting.
            </div>
         <p>It is possible that later witnesses copied the story, with the cut scenes, from earlier publications. After comparing in Juxta all of the witnesses that omit these scenes, the original edit seems to have been made by the <span class="titlem">Midnight Cry!</span> and passed on as the story was recopied.<span class="note" id="Note14"> [ A side-by-side comparison of the original <span class="titlem">Democratic Review </span>printing and the <span class="titlem">Midnight Cry</span>s reprinting can be found at http://juxtacommons.org/shares/4uKm3R.]</span> Perhaps for the apocalyptic <span class="titlem">Cry,</span> love and politics seemed less urgent than the more spiritual descriptions it retained about Vanity Fair. Because reprints circulated through complex textual networks, however, editorial decisions made by one editor rippled into other publications that did not necessarily share the priorities that drove the initial decision. Textual analysis tools such as Juxta draw particular attention to these editorial artifacts, which illuminate not, strictly, the text itself, but its social life within its culture.</p>

         <div class="p">That Hawthorne himself revised Bunyan likely contributed to the story’s success with contemporary religious readers. Brown argues that, while evangelicals <span class="quote_inline">generally respected Bunyan’s original as one of the best books of all time,</span> they also <span class="quote_inline">felt no qualms about altering the book to suit</span> specific ecclesiastical or political needs <a href="#brown2004" class="link_ptr">[10]</a>. Children’s versions were prepared for Sunday Schools, and several authors rewrote the tale with more pointed goals, such as William R. Weeks’s reformist <span class="titlem">Pilgrim’s Progress in the Nineteenth Century</span> [1826, 1849]  and Sophia Louisa Little’s abolitionist <span class="titlem">Pilgrim’s Progress in the Last Days</span> [1843].<span class="note" id="Note15"> [ Little’s <span class="titlem">Pilgrim’s Progress in the Last Days</span> holds particular interest because it was published later in the same year as <span class="titlem">The Celestial Railroad</span>. Little’s hero Christian, like Hawthorne’s unnamed narrator, finds that <span class="quote_inline">a bridge was built</span> over the Slough of Despond, which appears <span class="quote_inline">of such frail construction</span> that he refuses to cross it. Little was aware of the similarities between her scene and Hawthorne’s. A footnote to her novel, inserted one line below the final paragraph, reads, <blockquote class="quote inline"><p>NOTE. — <span class="titlem">The Celestial Rail-Road</span> was not in print at the time this was written. The mention of the Bridge at the Slough of Despond, is an accidental coincidence</p></blockquote> <a href="#little1843" class="link_ptr">[48]</a>. That Little was aware of <span class="titlem">The Celestial Railroad,</span> and assumes her readers will be aware enough of it to spot the similarities between it and her book, again testifies to the story’s wide influence in 1843.]</span> Hawthorne entered a market, then, that welcomed innovations from its established texts, and especially loved <span class="titlem">Pilgrim’s Progress</span>. </div>
         <p>In the story, Hawthorne’s narrator relates a dream in which he visits Bunyan’s City of Destruction to find that a railroad had been constructed to the Celestial City. Proponents of the railroad tout its leisure, the way it clears difficulties — quite literally, as the railroad company tunneled through the Hill Difficulty that pilgrims once struggled over — from pilgrims’ paths. Like Bunyan’s Christian, Hawthorne’s narrator encounters other travelers along his route, not all of them pilgrims, including Mr. Smooth-it-away, who serves as his guide and the conductor of the new railroad. Like Christian, he encounters monsters, such as the Giant Transcendentalist, who has replaced the Giants Pagan and Pope, and shouts at passing travelers ‘in so strange a phraseology, that we knew not what he meant’ [[undefined hawthorne1843]]. Waypoints along the route, which the narrator searches out in ‘Mr. Bunyan’s road-book’ <a href="#hawthorne1843a" class="link_ptr">[29]</a>, are seen from the train window as the engine rushes by: the one exception being the city of Vanity Fair, where the train makes a long stop.</p>
         <div class="p">Hawthorne’s narrator naively believes that the world progresses steadily through technology and social improvement.<span class="note" id="Note16"> [ He in many ways embodies a perverse version of the religious progressivism best described by Ernest Tuveson in his important study of antebellum American millennialism, <span class="titlem">Redeemer Nation</span> <a href="#tuveson1968" class="link_ptr">[61]</a>.]</span> He is impressed to learn of the demon Apollyon’s new employment as the train’s engine driver. He thrills at <span class="quote_inline">the liberality of the age</span> in which <span class="quote_inline">all musty prejudices are in a fair way to be obliterated</span> <a href="#hawthorne1843a" class="link_ptr">[29]</a>. He likewise rhapsodizes over the ease of train travel over the harsh experiences of ‘past pilgrims,’ and is enthralled by Vanity Fair’s <span class="quote_inline">societies for all manner of virtuous purposes,</span> into which <span class="quote_inline">a man has merely to connect himself, throwing…his quota of virtue into the common stock</span> from which <span class="quote_inline">the president and directors will take care that the aggregate amount be well applied</span> <a href="#hawthorne1843a" class="link_ptr">[29]</a>. The narrator’s faith in progress is so complete that even after he encounters two ‘worthy simpletons’ making their pilgrimage by foot and whose <span class="quote_inline">sturdy repudiation of all part in [Vanity Fair’s] business or pleasures</span> convince him to leave, he still claims, <span class="quote_inline">I was not simple enough to give up my original plan of gliding along easily and commodiously by rail-road</span> <a href="#hawthorne1843a" class="link_ptr">[29]</a>. In fact, the narrator and his fellow passengers marvel at the ‘preposterous obstinacy’ of these <span class="quote_inline">two dusty foot-travellers in the old pilgrim guise</span> who keep <span class="quote_inline">their intolerable burthens on their backs</span> and refuse <span class="quote_inline">to take advantage of modern improvements.</span> The modern pilgrims mock them, while Apollyon blows smoke and steam into their faces for the amusement of his passengers <a href="#hawthorne1843a" class="link_ptr">[29]</a>. </div>
         <div class="p">The old-fashioned pilgrims follow a parallel path to the narrator’s throughout the story. They appear alongside the train several times, and then again as prophets in Vanity Fair, warning Hawthorne’s narrator that the railroad ‘concern is a bubble,’ and ‘a miserable delusion’ <a href="#hawthorne1843a" class="link_ptr">[29]</a>. The story ends within sight of the Celestial City, where Mr. Stick-to-the-right and Mr. Go-the-old-way are seen entering the city’s gates amid <span class="quote_inline">an exulting strain…of music, with height, and depth, and sweetness…at once tender and triumphant</span> <a href="#hawthorne1843a" class="link_ptr">[29]</a>. Hawthorne’s old-fashioned pilgrims endure the trials the narrator avoids — Hill Difficulty, the Slough of Despond — and in the end these evils, described by the narrator in thoroughly modern terms as ‘inconveniences,’ are reconciled by their triumphant entrance into eternity. </div>
         <div class="p">The narrator’s story, by contrast, ends at the terminus of the railroad line, as its passengers are shuttled out of the cars and into <span class="quote_inline">[a] steam ferry boat, the last improvement on this important route.</span> Mr. Smooth-it-away declines to cross with them, <span class="quote_inline">a twinkle of livid flame</span> springing <span class="quote_inline">out of either eye, proving indubitably</span> his fiendish nature, heretofore hidden to the modern pilgrims. As Mr. Smooth-it-away promises the narrator <span class="quote_inline">We shall meet again,</span> he implies that the boat is headed not to the Celestial City at all, but to Hell <a href="#hawthorne1843a" class="link_ptr">[29]</a>. The narrator’s allegorical Christian life is revealed as a series of failures to encounter spiritual trials or to make difficult, or even uncomfortable, spiritual decisions. Instead he glides along the tracks to damnation, passing by and interpreting the signs of his times badly.</div>
         <p>Contemporary religious readers read Hawthorne’s train as a symbol of the compromises required to be both Christian and thoroughly modern. The paratexts that constitute the textual network of <span class="titlem">The Celestial Railroad</span> — e.g. introductions to the story, articles using the story as illustration, sermons based on the story — often read Hawthorne’s narrator as representative of a false faith in progress for progress’s sake. The Giant Transcendentalist, the misguided divines of Vanity Fair, and the other figures of the tale were seen as the debased products of such compromises. What consistently changed, however, as the story passed between newspapers, magazines, and anthologies, were the real-world antecedents to Hawthorne’s allegorical figures: the people or groups that each paper identified as dangerous religious innovators.</p>
         <div class="p">For the Adventist readers of the <span class="titlem">Signs of the Times</span>, deeply invested in a vision of Jesus Christ’s imminent Second Coming, Hawthorne’s story <blockquote class="quote inline"><p>admirably illustrates the progress made in <span class="titlem">popular</span> religion since the days of John Bunyan, and shows the improvements made by the Transcendentalists and Neologists, to be found in our modern popular churches. We commend it to those among the sects who are the most bitter against the coming of Christ, as a looking glass in which themselves are strikingly reflected</p></blockquote> <a href="#hawthorne1843c" class="link_ptr">[31]</a>. The <span class="titlem">Signs</span> implies that those <span class="quote_inline">who are the most bitter against the coming of Christ</span> — in other words, those who are most critical of the Adventists’ central doctrine — are the improvers of religion Hawthorne satirizes — the Directors or passengers of the Celestial Railroad. By contrast, the <span class="titlem">Signs</span> implies that Adventist believers, anxiously watching the signs of the times, are the <span class="quote_inline">dusty foot travelers,</span> Mr. Stick-to-the-right and Mr. Go-the-old-way, evangelizing to their misguided brethren.</div>
         <div class="p">However, ten days later a neighboring publication would suggest an opposite interpretation of the story. The <span class="titlem">Cambridge Palladium</span> introduces their reprinting similarly to the <span class="titlem">Signs</span>, noting that <span class="quote_inline">THAT RAILROAD — shown up on our first page…admirably sets off some of the religious features of the present day</span> <a href="#anonymous1843b" class="link_ptr">[8]</a>. Both papers use ‘admirably’ to assess the story’s depiction of failures in contemporary religious practice. The <span class="titlem">Palladium</span> next refers to the <span class="titlem">Signs</span>s publication of the story, noting that <span class="quote_inline">[t]he article was originally published in the Democratic Review, and has since been copied by brother Himes</span> (the <span class="titlem">Signs</span>s editor). This arch, familiar ‘brother Himes’ hints at the paragraph’s ultimate turn, as the <span class="titlem">Palladium</span> wonders <span class="quote_inline">if this last-mentioned brother, if he should look carefully, could not see his own face reflected in the looking-glass somewhere</span> <a href="#anonymous1843b" class="link_ptr">[8]</a>. In other words, the <span class="titlem">Palladium </span>asserts that <span class="titlem">The Celestial Railroad,</span> which Himes confidently printed as an indictment of non-Adventist Christians, instead indicts Adventists — implying that Adventism is not a return to authentic, biblical Christianity, but a neologism to be condemned. </div>
         <div class="p">Such vehement sectarian rhetoric was, in the 1840s, a relatively new phenomenon in the United States. We can track its rise using Google’s recently released Ngram Viewer,<span class="note" id="Note17"> [ The Google Books Ngram Viewer can be found at <a class="link_ref" href="http://ngrams.googlelabs.com/">http://ngrams.googlelabs.com</a>.

In this case, we can correlate the sectarian strife evidenced in the history of this one text with a much broader concern about sectarianism in contemporaneous literature.</div>

         <p>See Figure 3 (caption: Ngram graph for the words ‘sectarian’ and ‘sectarianism’ between 1800–1900)</p>
         <div class="p">Looking at the American English corpus between 1800 and 1900, for instance, we can see that use of the word ‘sectarian’ spiked in use during the decades just before the Civil War. ‘Sectarian’ appears in approximately 0.000025% of the books and periodicals in the corpora that were published in the United States in 1800. Over the next decades, however, use of ‘sectarian’ steadily increases. By 1850, ‘sectarian’ appears in 0.000375% of the books in the corpora published in the U.S. In other words, books and periodicals in 1850 used ‘sectarian’ more than ten times more frequently than books in 1800: an increase of an order of magnitude.<div class="note" id="Note18"><span class="noteLabel">Note: </span> The word ‘sectarianism’ follows a similar trajectory. To see the data for both ‘sectarian’ and ‘sectarianism,’ see <a href="#ngram2012" class="link_ptr">[53]</a>. </div> 
         </div>
         <div class="p">To make sense of this data, of course, we must <span class="quote_inline">abandon the quantitative universe</span> and situate the use of ‘sectarian’ within literary and historical contexts <a href="#moretti2011" class="link_ptr">[51]</a>. We must zoom in. In this case, the dramatic increase in use of ‘sectarian’ comes during a period of rapid denominational schism in the United States. By the 1840s and 50s, the nation’s largest denominations — Methodist, Baptist, etc. — comprised a quickly-multiplying host of sub-groups, sects within sects, each insisting on the sanctity of particular social, political, or theological distinctions. Perhaps most importantly, in 1845 — two years after the initial printing of <span class="titlem">The Celestial Railroad,</span> and in the middle of its run through the evangelical press — the Baptist and Methodist denominations in the United States both split into northern and southern conventions over slavery. This rapid denominational centrifugation bred anxiety about how thoroughly churches could disagree and disperse while remaining members of one mystical body. </div>
         <div class="p">Brown sees this tension as latent in the mission and purpose of the antebellum religious press. On the one hand, the religious press fostered the ‘informal canon’ of evangelical texts to which <span class="titlem">The Celestial Railroad</span> belonged. This set of documents, both secular and sacred, and shared across many sects, fortified a sense of <span class="quote_inline">an invisible…pilgrim community</span> of believers united by their common evangelical Christianity <a href="#brown2004" class="link_ptr">[10]</a>. But such ecumenical efforts were often undermined by zealous denominational editors and publishers, who <span class="quote_inline">saw themselves countering the errors of the secular press and rival religious denominations by proclaiming pure gospel truth</span> <a href="#brown2004" class="link_ptr">[10]</a>. A crowded religious periodicals market necessitated that publications distinguish themselves in order to attract and retain subscribers. Searching nineteenth-century newspaper archives for key theological terms bears this argument out. One finds vehement articles defending large and small gradations of doctrine and practice: articles for and against infant baptism, predestination, the reality or unreality of hell, and even the morality or immorality of children’s Sunday Schools.</div>
         <div class="p">Distinctly denominational critiques are hard to identify in Hawthorne’s original text of <span class="titlem">The Celestial Railroad</span>. There are the Giant Transcendentalist and Pope, but the divines of Vanity Fair are never identified precisely. Looking at the wide social textual network this study has unearthed, we can see that whomever Hawthorne meant to parody, his readers redirected the story’s satire toward their own targets. For antebellum believers, <span class="titlem">The Celestial Railroad</span> resonated because it spoke to the general problem of denominationalism — satirizing the religious ‘neologists’ who have innovated the Christian message until unrecognizable — while simultaneously provoking print wars that entrenched denominational battle lines. While the satire of <span class="titlem">The Celestial Railroad</span> was read as an attack on sectarianism, the history of its reprinting paradoxically reinforced denominational disagreements. <span class="quote_inline">Rail roads to ‘the Celestial City,’</span> the <span class="titlem">Wisconsin Argus</span> complained in 1845, <span class="quote_inline">cross each other in every direction</span> <a href="#anonymous1845" class="link_ptr">[6]</a>.</div>
         <div class="p">In introductions to the story and editorials referencing it, religious editors and readers consistently identified their sectarian rivals with Hawthorne’s Mr. Smooth-it-away, the Rev. Wind-of-Doctrine, or the Giant Transcendentalist. In 1855, the Washington, D.C. newspaper <span class="titlem">National Intelligencer</span> lamented the trend of rewriting <span class="titlem">Pilgrim’s Progress</span>,<span class="note" id="Note19"> [ This lament comes from a review of George Wood’s very long two-volume novel <span class="titlem">Modern Pilgrims</span>, a distinctly denominationalist work Wood claims <span class="quote_inline">was suggested to me by Hawthorne’s inimitable allegory, <span class="titlem">The Celestial Railroad</span>.’</span> Wood structures his novel around his pilgrims’ visits to a series of towns, houses, institutes, and communes, each meant to satirize a particular denomination or social movement. For example, in place of the Interpreter’s House in Buynan’s <span class="titlem">Pilgrim’s Progress</span> stand three interpreters’ houses, the Wesleyan (Methodism), Andover (Congregationalism), and Roger Williams (Baptist) <a href="#wood1855" class="link_ptr">[64]</a>. Wood’s denominationalist retelling makes explicit what was implicit in most readings of Hawthorne’s original among religious readers.]</span> noting that <blockquote class="quote inline"><p>[n]early every interested observer of the religious spirit of the age has thought, spoken, or written his own story of the modern pilgrims. It has become the common courtesy ecclesiastic,</p></blockquote> the article continues, <blockquote class="quote inline"><p>for us to ascribe to each church other than our own some innovation on the old line of travel; the old line being of course <em>ours</em> — Bunyan being, like Paul, always the Coryphæus of the creed of the household wherein he is read</p></blockquote> <a href="#anonymous1855" class="link_ptr">[3]</a>. <span class="note" id="Note20"> [The coryphæus was the leader of a Greek chorus, and can refer to <span class="quote_inline">the chief or leader of a party, sect, school, etc</span> [[undefined oed]]. The <span class="titlem">Intelligencer</span> means, then, that religious readers all identify Bunyan, and thus the old-fashioned pilgrims of <span class="titlem">The Celestial Railroad,</span> as in agreement with their own doctrine and denomination.]</span> Writing about <span class="titlem">The Celestial Railroad,</span> the <span class="titlem">Intelligencer</span> claims its ‘wide popularity’ was due to the fact that its <span class="quote_inline">idea corresponded to the prevalent suggestions in many minds,</span> while <blockquote class="quote inline"><p>it was so general that it did not take sides for or against any sect; so it could be freely used by every sect against the rest, and was therefore eagerly printed in all church newspapers…and each family read it on Sunday evening in its own weekly, with sly whispers of a Minie rifle-shot into the ranks of ‘some so-called Christians they knew of’</p></blockquote> <a href="#anonymous1855" class="link_ptr">[3]</a>. Readers claimed affinity with the ‘old-fashioned pilgrims’ and contrasted themselves with the This-todays and That-tomorrows of the other churches in town. As the <span class="titlem">Intelligencer</span> points out, this identification was simplified by the broad allegorical strokes of Hawthorne’s original. The reader knows only the Rev. Dr. Wind-of-Doctrine’s name. Hawthorne never specifies precisely which doctrinal winds blow him about: what denomination he represents, where he stands on predestination, or his opinion about the scriptural warrant for slavery. </div>
         <div class="p">Readers projected themselves into the roles of Mr. Stick-to-the-right and Mr. Go-the-old-way, the two pilgrims who stick to ‘Mr. Bunyan’s road-book’ despite the difficulties of the road. In the first edition of the Sunday School Union’s <span class="titlem">Visit to the Celestial City</span>, Hawthorne’s ‘two dusty foot-travellers’ feature prominently in two of the edition’s four illustrations — once in the foreground, watching the train pass in the distance, and again urging the narrator to repent in the bustle of Vanity Fair <a href="#hawthorne1843d" class="link_ptr">[32]</a>. Articles frequently echoed Hawthorne’s language about these two pilgrims. The <span class="titlem">Christian Watchman</span>, published by the Baptist Missionary Society of Massachusetts, published <span class="titlem">The Celestial Railroad</span> in the same issue as an editorial on <span class="titlem">Holy Living.</span> By this phrase, the <span class="titlem">Watchman</span> assures its readers, <blockquote class="quote inline"><p>We do not mean any newly discovered track that shall lead to such results, but <span class="titlem">the old and safe road</span> that has been travelled by all Christians for the last eighteen hundred years</p></blockquote> <a href="#anonymous1843a" class="link_ptr">[7]</a> (my emphasis).</div>
         <div class="p">Likewise the Congregationalist <span class="titlem">Boston Review</span> used <span class="titlem">The Celestial Railroad</span> to illustrate the differences between <span class="quote_inline">two theologies, the Old and the New,</span> that were dividing Congregationalism. <span class="quote_inline">The Old theology,</span> the <span class="titlem">Review</span> claims, <span class="quote_inline">is God-given, apostolic, and ever the same,</span> while <span class="quote_inline">the New is always changing,</span> its adherents <span class="quote_inline">carried about by every <span class="titlem">wind of doctrine</span>.</span> <a href="#anonymous1861" class="link_ptr">[2]</a> (my emphasis). The Rev. Dr. Wind-of-doctrine is the most prominent divine in Hawthorne’s revision of Vanity Fair. The <span class="titlem">Review</span> echoes his name to describe the debased New theology and that of Mr. Go-the-old-way to describe its own, ‘God-given’ and ‘apostolic’ theology. Moreover, the <span class="titlem">Review</span> notes, <span class="quote_inline">Nobody studies the Catechism now,</span> because there’s <span class="quote_inline">a railroad</span> by which <span class="quote_inline">cheerful crowds</span> head to heaven <span class="quote_inline">by steam, and have a good social time of it, too.</span> The <span class="titlem">Review</span>s article abridges <span class="titlem">The Celestial Railroad</span> into three paragraphs, borrowing liberally from Hawthorne’s language without citing him or his original story directly, in order to lampoon the ‘New’ theology ruining Congregationalism <a href="#anonymous1861" class="link_ptr">[2]</a>.<span class="note" id="Note21"> [This uncited, paraphrasical use seems to indicate that by 1861, when this <span class="titlem">Review</span> article so liberally cribbed from it, <span class="titlem">The Celestial Railroad</span> had become commonplace enough that direct citation was unnecessary; the story was a canonical indictment of spiritually dangerous denominational innovations, from which characters and images could be freely drawn for spiritual illustration.]</span>

            <p>The most dramatically edited — or perhaps the most thoroughly re-authored — version of the tale is easier to understand. Editorial tinkering with <span class="titlem">The Celestial Railroad</span> culminated in the Adventist reissue of the story in February 1844, as a tract in the <span class="titlem">Bible Examiner</span> series. According to Juxta, eighty-nine percent of the story’s text is changed between the <span class="titlem">Democratic Review</span> and <span class="titlem">Bible Examiner</span> versions.<span class="note" id="Note22"> [A side-by-side comparison of the original <span class="titlem">Democratic Review </span>printing and the <span class="titlem">Bible Examiner</span> reauthorship can be found at <a class="link_ref" href="http://juxtacommons.org/shares/7Vzym2">http://juxtacommons.org/shares/7Vzym2</a>.]</span>

            </div>
         <div class="p">The <span class="titlem">Bible Examiner</span> version carries an extended title — <span class="titlem">The Celestial Rail-road; or, Modern Pilgrim’s Progress: After the Manner of Bunyan, Vividly Representative of the </span>Present-Day<span class="titlem"> Professors of Religion</span> — and an extended attribution: <span class="quote_inline">From the original, by Nathaniel Hawthorne.

It seems likely, then, that the editors and co-authors of this version worked from previous Adventist printings of the story.<span class="note" id="Note23"> [ Scholars, including Clark, have long been aware of this reprinting of <span class="titlem">The Celestial Railroad,</span> but no one seems to have investigated it in any detail. Despite the fact that this witness completely overhauls Hawthorne, no note of this appears in any bibliography of the tale. I’m hesitant to list this version of the story as Hawthorne’s at all, given how few of the words in the tract are his.]</span></div>
         <p>The anonymous Adventist editor, or co-author, of this version scrupulously details those ‘additions and alterations’ in a paragraph-long introduction:</p>
         <div class="p">We are indebted to Mr. Hawthorne for the idea itself of a Celestial Rail-road; also for all on page 5, after <span class="quote_inline">It was my good fortune,</span> &amp;c.; pages 6 and 7; page 8, excepting the first two sentences, and <span class="quote_inline">We patronise — Creed-ality;</span> page 9, except <span class="quote_inline">I should not omit — from the sight;</span> pages 10, 11, and 12, but only down to ‘of slaughtered pilgrims;’ pages 13, 14, and 15, but only down to ‘an auburn wig;’ the last half of page 17, commencing, ‘Day after day;’ page 18, except the sentences, <span class="quote_inline">Are we not told,</span> &amp;c., to <span class="quote_inline">cannot be the right way</span>," also excepting the words <span class="quote_inline">are Millerites and,</span> in the middle of the page, and except the last paragraph, commencing, <span class="quote_inline">One day, moreover;</span> page 21, from <span class="quote_inline">At a short distance,</span> &amp;c., down to <span class="quote_inline">a disposition to sleep,</span> on page 22. A few verbal alterations have been made in these parts, but not affecting the sense or style. The rest is not from Mr. Hawthorne's pen, and may contain sentiments he would not be willing to endorse <a href="#hawthorne1844a" class="link_ptr">[28]</a>.</div>
         <div class="p">This writer carefully distinguishes between the <span class="titlem">Bible Examiner</span>s<span class="titlem"> </span>words and Hawthorne’s, acknowledging <span class="quote_inline">sentiments he would not be willing to endorse</span> in the new tale, but still retaining Hawthorne’s title,<span class="note" id="Note24"> [ On the first page of the story itself, the title is simply <span class="titlem">The Celestial Rail-road;</span> the extended title is only on the title page.]</span> and, ostensibly, Hawthorne’s ‘sense’ and ‘style.’ While acknowledging their divergences from Hawthorne’s original, in other words, the <span class="titlem">Bible Examiner</span>s editors nonetheless <span class="quote_inline">support a fiction of single authorship</span> that would have shaped their readers’ perceptions of Hawthorne [[undefined thorne-murphy2010]]. </div>
         <div class="p">The final line of the <span class="titlem">Bible Examiner</span>s extended title, <span class="titlem">Vividly Representative of the <span class="titlem">Present-Day </span>Professors of Religion,</span> hints strongly at the denominational mission of this rewriting, and the text aims throughout to clarify the points of satire and praise in Hawthorne’s original, and to bring an explicitly apocalyptic tenor to the piece.<div class="note" id="Note25"><span class="noteLabel">Note: </span> February 1844 falls during the height of speculation, anxiety, and anticipation surrounding the predictions of Baptist pastor William Miller, who spawned the Adventist or ‘Millerite’ movement by predicting the end of the world first in 1843, and then again in 1844.</div> As such, just after the narrator speaks — in Hawthorne’s words — of <span class="quote_inline">the public spirit of some of the inhabitants</span> who built a railroad to the Celestial City, he notes — in new words — that <span class="quote_inline">for a long time I had regarded the stories about an impending destruction as the mere dreams of some silly persons</span> <a href="#hawthorne1844a" class="link_ptr">[28]</a>. He then encounters the two old-fashioned pilgrims much earlier than did Hawthorne’s narrator, describing how they <span class="quote_inline">looked to me exactly like the picture which my fancy had formed of Bunyan’s pilgrim.</span> The pair proceed to warn the narrator that they <span class="quote_inline">are fleeing from the wrath to come</span> because <span class="quote_inline">the Judgment which for a long time has lingered, is just about to be executed, and all these things shall be dissolved</span> <a href="#hawthorne1844a" class="link_ptr">[28]</a>.</div>
         <div class="p">Nearly every page of the <span class="titlem">Bible Examiner</span>s <span class="titlem">Celestial Railroad</span> revises Hawthorne’s original. New fellow pilgrims join the narrator in this version of the story: <span class="quote_inline">Messrs. Pliable, Worldly-wise-man, Presumption, Love-lust, By-ends and Hold-to-the-world</span> as well as <span class="quote_inline">Miss Ornament, Miss Thoughtless, and Miss Novelize</span> <a href="#hawthorne1844a" class="link_ptr">[28]</a>. These passengers point to many distinctly Adventist concerns about their religious contemporaries: that they clung too fiercely to temporal things (Messr. Love-lust, Messr. Hold-to-the-world, Miss Ornament), that they too flippantly dismissed their Adventist brethren (Messr. Worldly-wise-man, Messr. Presumption, Miss Thoughtless), or that they too readily and thoughtlessly modernized faith (Miss Novelize). Accordingly, the <span class="titlem">Bible Examiner</span>s train passes new sites, <span class="quote_inline">the town of Morality, which has grown very much since Bunyan’s day</span> and <span class="quote_inline">the newly settled but thriving towns of Deism, Universalism, and Restoration</span> <a href="#hawthorne1844a" class="link_ptr">[28]</a>. <div class="note" id="Note26"><span class="noteLabel">Note: </span>The town of ‘Restoration’ might be less obvious to modern readers; it refers to Alexander Campbell’s Restoration movement, which attempted to reconcile denominational differences — which makes their pillory here as a denominationalist town more biting — through a millennial vision of a united evangelical Christianity. Ultimately, the Restoration movement spawned several evangelical denominations, such as the Disciples of Christ.</div> Later in the <span class="titlem">Bible Examiner</span>s version the narrator will add the newly chartered <blockquote class="quote inline"><p>provinces of Carnality and Formality, in which we observed the flourishing towns of Mormonism, Love-gain, Community, Puseyism, Self-righteousness, and Falsepeace,</p></blockquote> and ‘Scoffers-town’ <a href="#hawthorne1844a" class="link_ptr">[28]</a>. These new towns share the map with places from Hawthorne’s and Bunyan’s originals, such as the City of Destruction, where the narrator’s pilgrimage begins, ‘the town of Shun-repentance,’ and Vanity. By federating new theologies, such as Mormonism, with such disreputable neighbors, the <span class="titlem">Bible Examiner</span> emphasizes its disdain for them, and clarifies for the reader precisely who they should read as ‘modern professors of religion’ or ‘neologists.’<span class="note" id="Note27"> [ This trope of naming towns after specific denominations is echoed in George Wood’s <span class="titlem">Modern Pilgrims</span> <a href="#wood1855" class="link_ptr">[64]</a>.]</span>
         </div>
         <div class="p">The <span class="titlem">Bible Examiner</span> emphasizes this threat in its detailed description of the preachers of Vanity. Hawthorne provides only the names of Vanity’s divines, giving readers leeway to <span class="quote_inline">identify…Rev. Mr. Clog-the-Spirit and Rev. Dr. Wind-of-Doctrine with preachers in each other’s churches,</span> as Moncure Conway later recounted doing after reading Hawthorne’s tale <a href="#conway1902" class="link_ptr">[14]</a>. The <span class="titlem">Bible Examiner</span>, by contrast, links each figure to a specific contemporary doctrine, pinning down the allegorical connection, and stemming potential alternative readings of each figure. In the <span class="titlem">Examiner</span> the Rev. Mr. Bewilderment proves <span class="quote_inline">that the Bible, although truly called a Revelation, is nevertheless an unrevealed revelation to man,</span> a doctrine opposed to William Miller’s assertion that <span class="quote_inline">the Bible is its own interpreter.</span> Several more lectures follow, each by divines whose allegorical names point to Adventist disdain for their ideas <a href="#hawthorne1844a" class="link_ptr">[28]</a>.</div>
         <div class="p">In its final passages, the <span class="titlem">Bible Examiner</span>s reinterpretation of Hawthorne veers well off the original story’s track. The narrator begins to see outside his window prophetic natural signs: <span class="quote_inline">the stars falling from heaven,</span> <span class="quote_inline">an angel…flying through heaven,</span> <span class="quote_inline">blood and fire and pillars of smoke</span> seen <span class="quote_inline">in the heavens and in the earth.</span> The passengers pass one man <span class="quote_inline">expound[ing] the Book of Daniel,</span> warning them to <span class="quote_inline">Consider the vision, consider the vision!</span> and another expounding Revelation, warning, <span class="quote_inline">Behold, I come quickly</span> <a href="#hawthorne1844a" class="link_ptr">[28]</a>. Finally, the <span class="titlem">Bible Examiner</span>s version ends not within sight of the Celestial City, or with the steam ferry boat of Hawthorne’s original, but with the narrator’s realization that the train has circled fully around, <span class="quote_inline">back almost to the City of Destruction.</span> There waits Evangelist, who continues to warn the erstwhile pilgrims of the impending apocalypse.</div>
         <div class="p">The <span class="titlem">Bible Examiner</span> rewrites the ending of <span class="titlem">The Celestial Railroad</span> into an explicitly apocalyptic message — a warning that the end of time is near. The final paragraph warns readers who might <span class="quote_inline">consider the forgoing a ‘dream’</span> — as Hawthorne ended his <span class="titlem">Celestial Railroad</span> — that <blockquote class="quote inline"><p>I will assure them it is a most perfect <span class="titlem">reality</span>, saving merely the <span class="titlem">anticipation</span> of the second personal coming of Christ, which there is reason to believe is just at hand</p></blockquote> <a href="#hawthorne1844a" class="link_ptr">[28]</a>.  The <span class="titlem">Bible Examiner</span> then hopes that <span class="quote_inline">the brief, cutting, but truly faithful description here given of the journey to the heavenly city by this most deceitful route,</span> which the story has identified with specific contemporary theologies and eschatologies, <span class="quote_inline">prove the saving of the soul to some who are about to take their seats in the car of <span class="titlem">Popular Profession</span>.</span> Instead, the final lines urge, they should choose <span class="quote_inline">the good old path</span> which, again, this revision has explicitly identified with the ‘Millerites’ castigated by Mr. Smooth-it-away in Vanity Fair <a href="#hawthorne1844a" class="link_ptr">[28]</a>.</div>
         <div class="p">This most drastic revision of <span class="titlem">The Celestial Railroad</span> exemplifies the antebellum religious press’s relationship with Hawthorne’s text. The Adventist pamphlet certainly ran <span class="quote_inline">counter to the avowed intentions</span> of Hawthorne — as evidenced by his expressed distaste for the <span class="quote_inline">pamphlet and piratical system</span> — and <span class="quote_inline">makes publication distinctly legible as an independently signifying act,</span> calling <span class="quote_inline">attention to the repeated acts of articulation by which culture and audiences are constituted</span> <a href="#mcgill2003" class="link_ptr">[50]</a>. The <span class="titlem">Bible Examiner</span> tract re-authored Hawthorne’s tale, writing a particular denominational interpretation into the text.<span class="note" id="Note28"> [ The <span class="titlem">Bible Examiner</span> version of <span class="titlem">The Celestial Railroad</span> was popular, and continued in print until at least the 1880s. Clark traces versions of this tract through 1867, and I’ve found advertisements for it in the back of editions of Mary Baker Eddy’s books into the 1880s.]</span></div>

         <div class="p">When, at the end of its introduction to the story, the <span class="titlem">Bible Examiner</span> notes, <span class="quote_inline">The rest is not from Mr. Hawthorne's pen, and may contain sentiments he would not be willing to endorse,</span> it points Hawthorne’s response to his tale’s life in the religious press <a href="#hawthorne1844a" class="link_ptr">[28]</a>. Garvey notes that <blockquote class="quote inline"><p>[b]eing reprinted was sometimes welcomed as a sign of an author's popularity; at other times authors resented their work being taken without pay or saw it as an even more hostile act</p></blockquote> <a href="#garvey2006" class="link_ptr">[24]</a>. The latter describes Hawthorne, who famously complained in an April 1844 letter to Horatio Bridge, <blockquote class="quote inline"><p>I continue to scribble tales, with good success so far as regards empty praise…But the pamphlet and piratical system has so broken up regular literature, that I am forced to work hard for small gains</p></blockquote> <a href="#hawthorne1987" class="link_ptr">[26]</a>. Scholars of Hawthorne tend to suppose that this complaint alludes <span class="quote_inline">to pamphlet forms of <span class="titlem">The Celestial Rail-road</span> that sprang up <span class="quote_inline">after its appearance in the <span class="titlem">Democratic Review</span></span></span> <a href="#hawthorne1987" class="link_ptr">[26]</a>. These known ‘pamphlet forms’ include the ASSU’s <span class="titlem">Visit to the Celestial City</span> and other pamphlet versions that were printed as close to Hawthorne as Boston and far away as London.</div>
         <div class="p">In an October 1843 letter to Nathaniel Hawthorne’s sister, his wife Sophia notes that the Sunday School Union had <span class="quote_inline">no authority from the power that is for publishing the ‘Celestial Railroad,’</span> and that her husband <span class="quote_inline">was quite surprised to be taken possession of so unceremoniously</span> <a href="#hawthorne1987" class="link_ptr">[26]</a>. Those three words, ‘taken possession of,’ can be read as legal or textual, though it may not have occurred to editors within the antebellum climate of reprinting to worry about Hawthorne’s pecuniary or legal interests. The <span class="titlem">Bible Examiner</span>s caveat to its reprinting highlights different anxieties. Garvey argues that <span class="quote_inline">The phenomenon of reprinting allowed different meanings to become attached</span> to a work <a href="#garvey2006" class="link_ptr">[24]</a>. When the <span class="titlem">Bible Examiner</span> admits that Hawthorne’s ‘sentiments’ may not align with the revised story or that he would not ‘endorse’ its message, it admits that the <span class="titlem">meaning</span> of Hawthorne’s story had been ‘taken possession of’ as much as the words themselves. </div>
         <div class="p">If Hawthorne was aware of pamphlet versions of <span class="titlem">The Celestial Railroad</span> published in Boston and Philadelphia, it seems likely that he was aware of some of the many newspaper, magazine, and tract reprintings, several of which were published close to him in Salem, Boston, and Cambridgeport. It seems not unlikely that he worried over both the material repossession of his words — the unauthorized and unpaid reprintings of <span class="titlem">The Celestial Railroad</span> — and the metaphorical repossession of his name and of his story’s meaning and message. <span class="titlem">The Celestial Railroad,</span> as we’ve seen, was co-opted by such ideologically and theologically distinct groups as Congregationalists, Methodists, Baptists, Adventists, Quakers, Perfectionists, Abolitionists, and others, and said each time to speak for them against all comers. Though Hawthorne certainly wanted legal protection and monetary compensation for his work, his frustration at being <span class="quote_inline">taken possession of</span> was likely more than simply pecuniary. In 1843 Hawthorne was still largely unknown. If <span class="quote_inline">the tradition that grows around a work's authorship can have an intense effect on how the work is read and understood</span> <a href="#garvey2006" class="link_ptr">[24]</a>, then denominational re-authorizations of <span class="titlem">The Celestial Railroad</span> threatened to brand Hawthorne in ways he may have found distasteful. </div>
         <p>There is some textual evidence — small, but telling — that argues this more nuanced understanding of Hawthorne’s reaction to <span class="titlem">The Celestial Railroad</span> in the religious press. Hawthorne made few important changes between the story’s original <span class="titlem">Democratic Review</span> printing and the version that appeared three years later in <span class="titlem">Mosses from an Old Manse</span>. Most of the changes Juxta highlights between the two versions are minor. However, when Hawthorne’s narrator meets the two-old fashioned pilgrims in Vanity Fair, they introduce themselves in <span class="titlem">Mosses</span> as Mr. Stick-to-the-right and Mr. <span class="titlem">Foot-it-to-heaven</span> [[undefined hawthorne1986]] (my emphasis).<span class="note" id="Note29"> [ J. Donald Crowley notes this change, but doesn’t remark on it, in the Centenary edition of <span class="titlem">Mosses</span> [[undefined crowley1974]].]</span> Mr. Go-the-old-way, whose name was echoed in so many paratexts that drew from <span class="titlem">The Celestial Railroad,</span> is no more. </p>
            <div class="figure">
               <img src="resources/images/figure05.png" alt="" class="graphic" />
               Here we can see the subtle, but important, change that Hawthorne made to the tale as he edited it for <span class="titlem">Mosses from an Old Manse</span> in 1846. Note that Mr. Go-the-old-way has been replaced in this variant with Mr. Foot-it-to-heaven.
            </div>
         <p>Mr. Foot-it-to-heaven’s name contrasts sharply with his predecessor’s: it’s lighter, almost jocular, and not as distinct from the ironical names of Mr. Smooth-it-away or Mr. Bewilderment. </p>
         <p>That is, the one significant editorial change Hawthorne made to <span class="titlem">The Celestial Railroad</span> between 1843 and 1846 unwrote the focal point of denominational readings of his story. This changed name perhaps signals Hawthorne’s unease with his tale’s career in the religious press. Whatever Hawthorne’s own religious opinions, they couldn’t possibly have aligned with all those who claimed <span class="titlem">The Celestial Railroad</span> for themselves. After the publication of <span class="titlem">Mosses</span>, Mr. Foot-it-to-heaven journeys through the pages of secular reprintings, in papers such as <span class="titlem">Littell’s Living Age</span> <a href="#hawthorne1860" class="link_ptr">[45]</a>. Significantly, however, Mr. Go-the-old-way remains in many subsequent religious reprintings, in papers like the <span class="titlem">Christian Secretary</span> (3 Mar. 1848) <a href="#hawthorne1843h" class="link_ptr">[36]</a>, <span class="titlem">Vermont Christian Messenger</span> <a href="#hawthorne1850" class="link_ptr">[46]</a>, and in reprintings of the Sunday School Union’s <span class="titlem">Visit to the Celestial City</span> through at least 1897 <a href="#hawthorne1843d" class="link_ptr">[32]</a>. In fact, the majority of <span class="titlem">Celestial Railroad</span> witnesses from the nineteenth century, including those published after <span class="titlem">Mosses</span>, feature <span class="titlem">Mr. Go-the-old-way</span> rather than his replacement.</p>
            <div class="p">Few scholars have mentioned or commented on this name change. As part of a large comparison set in Juxta, however, <span class="quote_inline">Mr. Foot-it-to-heaven</span> stands out not as an incidental change between Hawthorne’s two versions of the story, but as an anomaly among the twenty-four witnesses between Hawthorne’s versions.<span class="note" id="Note30"> [ A side-by-side comparison of the original <span class="titlem">Democratic Review </span>printing and his 1846 edition in <span class="titlem">Mosses from an Old Manse</span> can be found at <a class="link_ref" href="http://juxtacommons.org/shares/Jbe2JU">http://juxtacommons.org/shares/Jbe2JU</a>.]</span> To truly signify, however, the name change needed to be considered alongside the many editorial introductions and references to the story, the paratexts that constituted the textual network of <span class="titlem">The Celestial Railroad</span>. Many of these supplemental texts echo the language of <span class="quote_inline">going the old way,</span> showing the attachment that religious reprinters and commenters had to the religious conservatism of Hawthorne’s message in <span class="titlem">The Celestial Railroad</span>. The more robust textual history provided by online archives recontextualizes Hawthorne’s change from <span class="quote_inline">Mr. Go-the-old-way</span> to <span class="quote_inline">Mr. Foot-it-to-Heaven,</span> foregrounding the cultural and social motivations that may have guided his editorial pen. </div>
         <div class="p">The reprinting history of <span class="titlem">The Celestial Railroad</span> demonstrates a complex relationship between Hawthorne and contemporary print and religious cultures. The enthusiastic reception of this story by religious readers inducted Hawthorne, perhaps unwillingly, into the canon of texts that defined religious communities in the nineteenth century. The <span class="quote_inline">keen satire</span> of <span class="titlem">The Celestial Railroad</span> was not anathema to the religious press or religious readers: quite the opposite, in fact, as Hawthorne’s satire against the ‘modern’ and ‘easy’ Christianity is precisely what drew religious readers to the text. Hawthorne’s early reputation, at least with certain readers, seems to have been founded on a work that modern readers often overlook. Moreover, the history of this short story helps clarify our understanding of the antebellum religious press as a tool of both ecumenical outreach and fervent denominational debate. <span class="titlem">The Celestial Railroad</span> was popular for its perceived anti-denominational message, but also for its usefulness in denominational debates. The essentially undefined antecedents for Hawthorne’s allegorical figures permitted a breadth of interpretation across the spectrum of belief, allowing readers, editors, and preachers to create sectarian readings with relative ease, and to deploy the story against those doctrinal innovators they saw as dangerous to their own, ‘authentic’ Christian faith.</div>

         <p>Ironies abound in this history of Hawthorne’s <span class="titlem">Celestial Railroad.</span> The tale satirized theological and technological triumphalism, yet it circulated via a thoroughly modern mass media. Editors affirmed the eternal and universal moral of <span class="titlem">The Celestial Railroad</span> even as they reauthored the story to serve their particular readers. Though the tale’s central, ironized symbol of uncritical modernization is the railroad, the story’s social textual network likely expanded through the railroad network.<span class="note" id="Note31"> [ When reprintings of <span class="titlem">The Celestial Railroad</span> are plotted onto Henry S. Tanner’s 1846 <span class="titlem">Traveller’s Guide or Map of the Roads, Canals, and Rail Roads of the United States</span> <a href="#tanner1846" class="link_ptr">[58]</a> the vast majority follow Tanner’s railroad lines, while few appear in those sections of the country without railroads. I have completed some preliminary geospatial work on <span class="titlem">The Celestial Railroad</span> using ArcGIS to correlate Tanner’s map, nineteenth-century county boundaries, and census reports from 1840 and 1850. This GIS work is not ready for publication, but you can read more about these GIS experiments in the paper I delivered at the 2012 Modern Language Association Convention in Seattle [[undefined cordell2012b]]. ]</span>

         <p>In other words, nineteenth-century technologies enabled this satire of nineteenth-century technology to reach its audiences, even as twentieth- and twenty-first century technologies allow modern scholars to rediscover its history of reprinting and reauthorship.</p>
         <div class="p">The history of <span class="titlem">The Celestial Railroad,</span> not unlike the history of the digital humanities, is a tale both of technological innovation and resistance. Julia Flanders notes similar tensions at the heart of digital humanities work: 
            <blockquote class="quote block"><p>If the rhetoric at the heart of the ‘digital’ side of ‘digital humanities’ is strongly informed by a narrative of technological progress, the "humanities" side has equally strong roots in a humanities sensibility which both resists a cumulative idea of progress (one new thing building on another) and yearns for a progressive agenda (doing better all the time). The theoretical and methodological shifts that constitute disciplinary change in the humanities, when viewed in retrospect, do not appear clearly progressive in the way that sequences of scientific discoveries do, though they do appear developmental: they are an ongoing attempt to understand human culture, from the changing perspective of the culture itself. <a href="#flanders2009" class="link_ptr">[23]</a></p></blockquote></div>
         <p>Modern scholarly readers of <span class="titlem">The Celestial Railroad</span> perhaps share its original readers’ ambivalence. We note the irony of digitizing a work that satirizes progressivism while recognizing that digitization allows us to recover and share a lost narrative of American literary culture. </p>
         <div class="p">When <span class="quote_inline">storage is cheaper than decision making,</span> Flanders argues, <blockquote class="quote inline"><p>the rare, the lesser-known, the overlooked, the neglected, and the downright excluded are now likely to make their way into digital library collections, even if only by accident</p></blockquote> <a href="#flanders2009" class="link_ptr">[23]</a>. Hawthorne is, of course, a hypercanonical writer, but <span class="titlem">The Celestial Railroad</span> has been for a century one of his least read and least studied works. Through digital archives and textual analysis tools, we have learned that <span class="titlem">The Celestial Railroad</span> should be understood as a central text of Hawthorne’s early career. These new tools also shift our understanding of Hawthorne’s religious readers, who were far more open to his satirical edge than scholars have imagined. If digital scholarship can shift our view of Hawthorne, his readers, and the values those readers associated with his stories, more discoveries no doubt await scholars of other authors, both canonical and non-canonical. As we continue to dig into digital archives in search of bibliographic treasure, exciting revisions to our literary history promise to multiply — an outcome that should thrill digital humanists and traditional literary scholars alike.</div>
