                  <p>“Beyond the Word” explores the entanglements of
                     Digital and Environmental Humanities (D&amp;EH) with the word and textuality —
                     but also <em class="emph">beyond</em> the word and text — with bodies, art, and digital
                     apparati at its center as narrative, speculative, performative, and immersive
                     instruments. Specifically, this article details efforts to incorporate mixmedia
                     immersive literate, sonic, and visual art as a vehicle for teaching critical,
                     speculative D&amp;EH at a time of global ecological and digital transformations.
                     Using two transdisciplinary humanities initiatives developed at the Norwegian
                     University of Science and Technology as test cases, this text focuses on
                     pedagogical prototyping experiments that encourage nondeterministic uses of, and
                     thinking about, digital tools as vehicles for poetry, transmedia environmental
                     storytelling, critical theory, ethics, and immersive archival reimagining. The
                     article covers the design process and sample activities incorporated to
                     transform the multimodal literature and theory classroom into inclusive,
                     immersive commons, and it concludes with a reflection on the ethical
                     ramifications of such D&amp;EH work.

                     only, human.” Unlike Digital Humanities (DH) theorists who mainly
                     explore the entanglement of human and computer languages, Ackerman and her
                     collaborator, Dan Richert, the American transmedia poets and artists behind the
                     2017 <cite class="title italic">Unknown Giants</cite> poetry installation, produce
                     poems together with algorithms, humans, and nonhuman <em class="emph">living</em>
                     organisms such as plants (Figure 1). Ackerman and Richert, the poetic duo, have
                     long experimented with electronic, biosensing poetry, exploring, for instance,
                     words as well as the ability of plants, measured through technological
                     mediation, to respond to poems being read to them by humans. Thanks to their
                     unique sensitivity, called “capacitance,” plants interact
                     with electric impulses that human bodies, and sound, specifically, generate
                     (Richert in Ackerman 2014). In their poetry installation exhibited as part of

                     magnolia, picae, and eucalyptus (Figure 1). In this installation, the plants’
                     response to human proximity was recorded using volatile organic compound (VOC)
                     sensors measuring terpenes levels. The exploratory, creative, and protective
                     response of plants<a class="noteRef" href="#d4e242">[2]</a> — terpenes shield plants from insects — was translated into
                     textual-poetic phrases in English, displayed on a TV, and timestamped and saved
                     for future use. The result of this machine–human–plant encounter was a
                     situational poetic immersive text,<a class="noteRef" href="#d4e245">[3]</a> a techno-somatic archive of intimacy, fragility,

                     between 2017 and 2018. The article details our efforts to prototype immersive

                     and reflective approaches to digital tools, which involved designing new syllabi

                     networks that support such work. The first elective course, “Literature, EH, and <cite class="title italic">The Arts of Living on a Damaged

                     from the Laboratory for Aesthetics and Ecology (2019), the NTNU ARTEC, the NTNU
                     Academic Guest Network / NTNU for Refugees, and the resettlement/integration
                     unit of TK (the Trondheim Municipality). Our advanced theory course, “Theoretical Approaches to Literary Studies: A Toolbox for
                     Literary Analysis (TALS),” also relied on these partnerships, if only
                     for shorter D&amp;EH modules (in 2017 and 2018). Both initiatives promoted
                     inclusive teaching and transmodal D&amp;EH scholarship, with a focus on
                     environmental digital literature and art practices, and performative, creative,
                     and reflective uses of digital tools. Since both courses were imagined as
                     university D&amp;EH initiatives as well as community-engagement resources, they
                     required a rethinking of what and where the classroom is and what it does — and,
                     also, who is included and welcomed to be part of it. Creating an inclusive
                     commons, then, as an immersive space for observation, performance, storytelling,
                     experimentation, and reflection, was a practical and ethical precondition, one
                     requiring intense preparation and multiple stakeholders.<a class="noteRef" href="#d4e665">[18]</a> The extensive urban digital art infrastructure helped us
                     grapple with this conundrum. Although the NTNU literature program (ISL/HF) was
                     an official pedagogical base, with its traditional classroom, the library, and
                     reading lists, most of our work happened at and with KT<a class="noteRef" href="#d4e672">[19]</a> rather than in the university
                     classrooms and its digital or media labs. KT, which transformed into a

                     Norway, reinforces the digital divide, as it is restricted to registered

                     and observe nonconventional use of digital technology in its environmental art
                     installations. Finally, the immersive exhibition setup encouraged the use of
                     multiple senses and did not privilege ocular, or monolingual or textual
                     proficiency. This was important for some community members whose mother tongue
                     was neither English nor Norwegian, and to neurodiverse participants with
                     different narrative preferences, and digital, or physical access needs.

                     words-off, other-senses-on, with a focus on reflection and immersion, an
                     approach that warrants its own entry. Against better advice, we centered on
                     continuous meta-reflections on the learning processes and specific encounters
                     with texts, artifacts, and living organisms, foregrounding epistemological
                     ruminations on analog and digital technology and D&amp;EH art and literature in
                     each class, exhibit visit, or workshop activity. In that sense, we reversed the
                     order of Hayles and Pressman’s (<a href="#hayles2013">2013</a>) dictum
                     “making, critique,” by beginning,
                     counterintuitively, with theory and critical reflection. Ryan Cordell (<a href="#cordell2016">2016, 460</a>) warns against such “meta-discussions . . . [that] too often preclude engagement
                     with its projects and theoretical engagements.” He suggests that
                     students, unlike administrators and professionals, are not invested in the
                     debates about the field or the disciplines (460–61) and implies that these
                     conversations should follow, not preempt, the examination of case studies. We
                     had heeded his advice in earlier practical workshops, and it had served us well.
                     That time, however, we wanted to experiment with foregrounding theory, ethics,
                     and reflection as missing “foundations of [D&amp;EH]
                     design”

                     unique immersive environment to generate instantaneous “critical

                     well as to <em class="emph">think</em> critically. To this end, we used immersive
                     multisensory environments at KT to engage with biodigital, physical, and

                     multisensory, machine-mediated somatic interactions and “unleashing

                     expectations [<a class="ref" href="#holmes2018">Holmes 2018</a>, n.pag.]. It resonated strongly
                     with participants, challenging many assumptions about what students/participants
                     want, know, or prefer. “[C]omputational technologies do not
                     only reveal new insights about postdigital culture,” observes Nancy
                     Mauro-Flude (<a href="#mauroflude2019">2019, 219</a>), they “also transform propensities for <em class="emph">embodied</em>
                     contemplation, a subject at the heart of humanities scholarship [emphasis
                     mine],” and, in our experiences, immersive art installations
                     facilitated precisely such corporal humanistic reflections. Initially, our
                     literature and humanities students, mostly newcomers to EH and DH, and to
                     contemporary art, were more comfortable with the dominant role that ocular
                     sensations, words and reading specifically, play in the process of learning and
                     interpretation. As Cordell (<a href="#cordell2016">2016</a>) predicts,
                     they were not troubled by disciplinary limits that a literature class may
                     impose. However, as they encountered environmental print theory and fiction,
                     alongside experiencing postprint work and immersive ecological art praxes
                     spatially and in other, nontextual, somatic ways, their very understanding of
                     possible modes of embodied storytelling and knowledge-making expanded, too.
                     Temporarily taken aback by the force of sensory affects and disciplinary
                     bordercrossings, participants soon found the techno-biologist poetic exchanges

                     2017<a class="noteRef" href="#d4e863">[26]</a>). Some also noted, with
                     fascination, that digital technology became a literary prosthetic and
                     translation platform, which, for instance, “<em class="emph">serve[d]
                        as a voice</em> for the plants, and g[ave plants] the ability to tell

                     Haugen, October 31, 2017). Moreover, participants often focused on how digital
                     tools enabled the “co-authoring” and co-archiving role of the
                     audience, spurring further reflection. “The way the artists
                     used the natural scent emitted by flowers in conjunction with technology in
                     order to (re-)create poetry is in itself amazing,” wrote one
                     participant of <cite class="title italic">Unknown Giants</cite> (2017), “but the fact that the spectators also contribute to the

                     character of <cite class="title italic">Unknown Giants</cite> (2017), which “always show[s] unique and personalized output based on the
                     observer(s) present,” demonstrates that “each

                     installation used visual projections and an ambisonic speaker setup to
                     spatialize extinct and nonextinct bird sounds (Figure 3) which enveloped
                     visitors in an imagined, impossible sonic landscape of zebra finches — common
                     lab birds of our era — and of the extinct Hawaiian Kauaʻi ʻōʻō honeyeater birds.
                     The installation also activated multiple senses — sight, touch, hearing —
                     immersing visitors in historical and speculative sounds within this archive and
                     a transmedia elegy for the biodiversity, soundscape, and cultural lore lost. For
                     instance, participants watched oversized, looped footage of distraught finches
                     handled with lab instruments in an ornithological laboratory (Figures 3–4) while
                     immersed in the archival and speculative soundscape. But while the video
                     projection was consumed more passively, visitors also played with vintage
                     stereoscopes, examining Krista Caballero’s composite cards and their different

                           technology itself. If the speakers and video were . . . placed in a dark
                           room where one could have focused solely on the sound and picture (or only
                           sound), and tried to imagine the significance of why they [birds and their
                           sounds] are gone, and not get distracted (by the first pair of stereoscopes
                           I have touched since my childhood), I think the experience would have been
                           even more powerful. But then, the artwork would have been much darker,
                           without much hope, and the story would have been completely different. The
                           digital sound and video of the birds show how digital technology may be the
                           only possible way to archive some types [of] <em class="emph">historical moments</em>
                           [my emphasis]. One could probably argue that it would be possible to paint a
                           lifelike picture of the birds and maybe even describe a sound by the use of
                           words and musical “notations,” but I would argue that, at
                           least for the sound, it would not be possible to <em class="emph">do the imagination
                              without the technology</em> . . . (Eirik Klakegg Thorsen, November 1,

                     (<a href="#mauroflude2017">2017</a>), is a
                     “dynamic” and “performative” practice
                     that sits “at the intersection of hands-on practice and
                     critical making” (<a href="#mauroflude2017">167</a>). It is a
                     creative community-building practice, and it allows us to examine the material,
                     futuristic, and ethical consequences of technological design. During the
                     concluding sections of our courses, we re-turned to reflection in participatory
                     prototyping workshops, following models by Ackerman and Richert (<a href="#ackerman2017">2017</a>) in their biosensing poetry and art,
                     Caballero and Ekeberg’s (<a href="#caballero2017">2017</a>) audiovisual
                     speculative archive, and biotechnological blurring in Lee (<a href="#lee2017">2017</a>). Led by Henry Mainsah, we experimented with
                     critical design prototyping to speculate about ideas and things “which do not yet exist”

                     of design studio pedagogy, especially the format of “design

                     instance, speculative Twitterbots, which aimed to disrupt debates about the
                     environment and climate change denial on Twitter. He also incorporated WATCHA, a

                     man-made construct, but as a feeling,” introduced students to
                     speculative methods of research, helping them investigate “the relations between humans and technological products [in] their everyday
                     use,” and reflect on different understandings <em class="emph">and</em>

                     Similarly, his prototyping D&amp;EH workshops at NTNU aimed to explore the
                     reflective and the speculative capacity, as well as the community-building
                     potential of the prototyping process. Mainsah drew specifically from the work on
                     “provotypes,” that is, prototypes that aim to make
                     cultural claims, “interrupt people’s thinking,” and
                     “astonish” or “disturb” them [<a class="ref" href="#ruecker2015">Ruecker 2015</a>, 9].

                     extraction, etc.). First, we gathered textual and physical materials on the
                     subject. Its delightful list of D&amp;EH ephemera included a humanoid robot’s

                     short curatorial statements about them and sketched “rapid
                     prototypes” of our inventions that “could
                     raise awareness, stimulate discussion, or provoke debate about an important
                     ecological issue.”<a class="noteRef" href="#d4e1220">[35]</a> Finally, we presented them to a wider audience and reflected

                     “Its main function,” the design group representative
                     explained, was “to trawl the net for fake news to recite to

                     short-term funding models, or to lack of scrutiny of DH projects’
                     inaccessible architecture and research outcomes, but the absence of
                     mandatory training in critical theory, media literacy, and digital

                     collaboration in Norway with computer science in DH training and project
                     maintenance is also reflection-worthy. Those who teach Python or GIS to
                     humanists (mainly linguists and literary scholars) do not share the same
                     commitment to or interest in cultural critique on which electronic arts,
                     critical internet studies, or critical design practice are built, and their
                     role in collaborative projects is often reduced to out- or insourcing of
                     computational skills on a contingent, nonreciprocal basis. Moreover, at
                     NTNU, purchases of hardware and software are always prioritized over

                     of collaborative practice, and promoting faith in the transparent and
                     innately positive agency of technology. This, in turn, transforms the
