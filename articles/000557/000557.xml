                <p><title rend="quotes">Beyond the Word</title> explores the entanglements of
                    Digital and Environmental Humanities (D&amp;EH) with the word and textuality —
                    but also <emph>beyond</emph> the word and text — with bodies, art, and digital
                    apparati at its center as narrative, speculative, performative, and immersive
                    instruments. Specifically, this article details efforts to incorporate mixmedia
                    immersive literate, sonic, and visual art as a vehicle for teaching critical,
                    speculative D&amp;EH at a time of global ecological and digital transformations.
                    Using two transdisciplinary humanities initiatives developed at the Norwegian
                    University of Science and Technology as test cases, this text focuses on
                    pedagogical prototyping experiments that encourage nondeterministic uses of, and
                    thinking about, digital tools as vehicles for poetry, transmedia environmental
                    storytelling, critical theory, ethics, and immersive archival reimagining. The
                    article covers the design process and sample activities incorporated to
                    transform the multimodal literature and theory classroom into inclusive,
                    immersive commons, and it concludes with a reflection on the ethical
                    ramifications of such D&amp;EH work.</p>

                    explore the entanglement of human and computer languages, Ackerman and her
                    collaborator, Dan Richert, the American transmedia poets and artists behind the
                    2017 <title rend="italic">Unknown Giants</title> poetry installation, produce
                    poems together with algorithms, humans, and nonhuman <emph>living</emph>
                    organisms such as plants (Figure 1). Ackerman and Richert, the poetic duo, have
                    long experimented with electronic, biosensing poetry, exploring, for instance,
                    words as well as the ability of plants, measured through technological
                    mediation, to respond to poems being read to them by humans. Thanks to their
                    unique sensitivity, called <soCalled>capacitance,</soCalled> plants interact
                    with electric impulses that human bodies, and sound, specifically, generate
                    (Richert in Ackerman 2014). In their poetry installation exhibited as part of
                        <title rend="italic">Et Nytt Vi / A New We</title><note>Hereafter cited as
                            <title rend="italic">A New We</title>. </note> (2017) at Kunsthall
                    Trondheim (KT) in Norway, Ackerman and Richter (2017) reintroduced these
                    unlikely collaborators and poetry co-designers, fellow human primates as well as
                    magnolia, picae, and eucalyptus (Figure 1). In this installation, the plants’
                    response to human proximity was recorded using volatile organic compound (VOC)
                    sensors measuring terpenes levels. The exploratory, creative, and protective
                    response of plants<note>Ackerman argues that the threat-linked interaction was
                        not intended as a focus on the work (personal communication, May 15, 2018).
                        A plant’s protective response is nonetheless, at least partially, wired into
                        its biophysical reactions (D. Richert, personal communication, June 20,
                        2018).</note> — terpenes shield plants from insects — was translated into
                    textual-poetic phrases in English, displayed on a TV, and timestamped and saved
                    for future use. The result of this machine–human–plant encounter was a
                    situational poetic immersive text,<note>Ackerman (2014) observed in her previous
                        work with various plants and poetry that plants’ poetic responses are not
                        dictated simply by biological determinism, as <quote rend="inline">each
                            plant seemed to have</quote> exhibited poetic preferences and

                    and danger.<note>Ackerman deemphasizes the fear factor, yet it is nonetheless

                        >Unknown Giants</title> poetry has yet to be routinely taught in American
                    literature or DH studies survey courses, but such multimodal, interactive
                    digital-sensorial literature will certainly arrive there eventually. At the
                    moment, however, few literary studies and theory classes engage in training in
                    and interrogation of critical, poetic, and speculative affordances and uses of
                    digital technology as a vehicle for non- or postprint, new media literature and
                    critical theory — paradoxically so, since multimodal cli-fi or electronic,
                    biosensing, or electronic theatre, and AI-generated literature are not new, and
                    calls for critical and comparative media interrogations of their different

                <p><title rend="quotes">Beyond the Word</title> is an empirical and experimental
                    case study, exploring such practices and pedagogies in the work undertaken by
                    the author, her collaborators, student participants, and partner institutions
                    between 2017 and 2018. The article details our efforts to prototype immersive
                    art-centered D&amp;EH instruction that emphasizes nondeterministic, creative,
                    and reflective approaches to digital tools, which involved designing new syllabi
                    and coordinating and teaching courses at Norwegian University of Science
                    Technology (NTNU); developing public programming curricula — public talks,
                    screenings, workshops, and co-curated immersive exhibits events — for
                    undergraduate students in the Literature, Cultural Studies, and Teacher Training
                    programs at NTNU, Trondheim-based migrant community members, and the general
                    public; and, collaborating closely with several city and university partners:
                    KT, Trondheim Kommune / The Trondheim Municipality (TK), and NTNU ARTEC.
                    Redesigned literature courses discussed below engage thematic and practical
                    considerations in DH &amp; EH — transmodal creative forms, preservation,
                    archives, speculation, and collaboration and ethics. This article traces their
                    entanglements with the word and textuality — but also moves <emph>beyond</emph>
                    the word and its <quote rend="inline">capture and measurement</quote>

                    Ultimately, <title rend="quotes">Beyond the Word</title> reflects on what can

                        concentration of DH centers in former colonial metropoles. Some of the most
                        obvious discriminatory aspects of DH projects and digital environments,
                        their inaccessibility for users with the most common physical impairments,
                        are pervasive. At a November 2019 NTNU DH event, <emph>none</emph> of the
                        tested public university websites were designed with basic digital
                        accessibility in mind. Other well-documented cases of racial,
                        gender/sexuality-, linguistic-, and class-based exclusion derive from this
                        geopolitical distribution of, and limited access to, DH laboratories,
                        software, expertise, and funding <ptr target="#fiormonte2016"/>. The reasons
                        for such a retreat from concerns about equity and accessibility in digital
                        design, especially in Norway, are hard to ascribe. They may be tied to
                        short-term funding models, or to lack of scrutiny of DH projects’
                        inaccessible architecture and research outcomes, but the absence of
                        mandatory training in critical theory, media literacy, and digital
                        accessibility across disciplines is also a contributing factor.</note>
                    Importantly, EH, like critical media studies committed to the entangled

                    DH, or digital/media literacy instructional tradition as of 2019. Moreover, and
                    paradoxically, NTNU offers minimal DH infrastructural and practical tech and
                    humanities project-development support.<note>The particular type of humanities
                        collaboration in Norway with computer science in DH training and project

                        humanists (mainly linguists and literary scholars) do not share the same
                        commitment to or interest in cultural critique on which electronic arts,
                        critical internet studies, or critical design practice are built, and their
                        role in collaborative projects is often reduced to out- or insourcing of
                        computational skills on a contingent, nonreciprocal basis. Moreover, at
                        NTNU, purchases of hardware and software are always prioritized over

                        of collaborative practice, and promoting faith in the transparent and
                        innately positive agency of technology. This, in turn, transforms the
                        humanities toolbox but also displaces its few ethical methods practices in
                        place that were laboriously fought for by artists, humanists, theorists, and
                        designers since the middle of the previous century.</note> Thus, when Safiya

                        Literary Analysis (TALS),</title> also relied on these partnerships, if only
                    for shorter D&amp;EH modules (in 2017 and 2018). Both initiatives promoted
                    inclusive teaching and transmodal D&amp;EH scholarship, with a focus on
                    environmental digital literature and art practices, and performative, creative,
                    and reflective uses of digital tools. Since both courses were imagined as
                    university D&amp;EH initiatives as well as community-engagement resources, they
                    required a rethinking of what and where the classroom is and what it does — and,
                    also, who is included and welcomed to be part of it. Creating an inclusive
                    commons, then, as an immersive space for observation, performance, storytelling,
                    experimentation, and reflection, was a practical and ethical precondition, one
                    requiring intense preparation and multiple stakeholders.<note>For a detailed

                    grapple with this conundrum. Although the NTNU literature program (ISL/HF) was
                    an official pedagogical base, with its traditional classroom, the library, and
                    reading lists, most of our work happened at and with KT<note>Kunsthalls (art
                        halls) are contemporary art institutions in Europe with an explicit

                    classrooms and its digital or media labs. KT, which transformed into a

                    installations co-curated by Ida Bencke and Dea Antonsen from the Laboratory for
                    Aesthetics and Ecology (<ref target="#laboratory2019">2019</ref>), was
                    integrated into our weekly assignments, gallery visits, public writing and
                    creative digital storytelling and DH workshops, as a context for and
                        <emph>objects</emph> of our work (Figures 1–4).</p>
                <p>There were also several other reasons, beside those outlined above, for a close
                    collaboration with KT. All classes at NTNU and all external programing (at KT or
                    other partner institutions, such as the Falstad Human Rights Center) were open
                    to students and to Trondheim’s permanent and temporary or transient residents,
                    free of charge and without bureaucratic barriers.<note>Access barriers,
                        especially for students with physical impairments, are always there.
                        However, the fact that we could invite nondegree, unenrolled migrant
                        participants to the initiative and reward them with an official NTNU
                        certificate of attendance without fees or legal and bureaucratic barriers
                        was a major achievement.</note> However, access to NTNU’s digital
                    environments (hardware and software, DH training, tech support, library
                    services, and even basic university student discussion platforms), while free in
                    Norway, reinforces the digital divide, as it is restricted to registered
                    students in ways that purely physical access to the classrooms and libraries in
                    Norway and most of Europe never is.<note>Limits placed on who can participate in
                        digital environments at an otherwise very <emph>public</emph> public
                        university confirms what DH scholars and digital rights activists have been
                        saying for a long time: new technology distributions and copyright law
                        reinscribe, not fix, social inequality.</note> KT, on the other hand,
                    literally allowed <emph>all</emph> interested participants — registered
                    students, invited guests, residents, (im)migrants, asylum seekers, one-time
                    lurkers, and other participants of various abilities — to play with, perform,
                    and observe nonconventional use of digital technology in its environmental art
                    installations. Finally, the immersive exhibition setup encouraged the use of
                    multiple senses and did not privilege ocular, or monolingual or textual
                    proficiency. This was important for some community members whose mother tongue
                    was neither English nor Norwegian, and to neurodiverse participants with
                    different narrative preferences, and digital, or physical access needs.</p>

                        critical reflection and creative work using transmodal art. Some of our
                        collaborators — Krista Caballero, a US-based mixmedia artist, exhibiting at
                        the time at KT; Sissel Bergh, a Trondheim-based mixmedia artist mapping the

                        and the founder of the Toxic Bios digital archive at the Swedish Royal

                        scholar, designer, and speculative prototyper; Lisa Dush, a US-based new

                        co-designed or guest-taught portions of our courses. Drawing on Brennan’s
                        (2016) public DH work, together with the KT team, Carl Faurby and Helena
                        Holmberg, we also collaborated on linking our literary and theory studies
                        curriculum to public digital environmental art programming and film
                        screenings. Crucial for the inclusive format of the courses was the
                        practical support of Adria Sharman, the official of TK, who successfully
                        advocated for a 75% reduction in textbook pricing for refugee academics; the
                        NTNU Humanities Faculty’s small pedagogical grant, which covered
                        transportation and D&amp;EH workshop costs; and the decision of KT’s then
                        director, Helena Holmberg, to ensure fee-free entrance to KT on all days to

                    <p>Aside from required literary studies skill, we wanted to foreground the
                        aesthetic and reflective potential of digital tools. Each week, we paired
                        print literary and theoretical texts and specific interactive installations
                        at KT with EH and DH keywords (symbiosis, collaboration, and postprint
                        immersive literature; species extinction and conservation and digital
                        preservation and archives; biosocial toxicity, digital waste, and ethics,
                        etc.) and experimented with performative, immersion, prototyping, and
                        theory-making workshops. We felt that experimentation and prototyping can
                        help us <quote rend="inline">reappraise . . . the utilitarian design</quote>
                        of DH <ptr target="#mauroflude2016" loc="167"/>

                        diverse critical pedagogy and disciplinary traditions — public humanities,
                        postcolonial studies, DH, EH, design studio and art pedagogy, and critical
                        media/internet studies — and developed a series of interconnected
                        reiterative activities, some deriving from the traditional print-based
                        literary studies and others from multimodal writing and the design pedagogy

                        enabled a recognition of neglected forms of nonprint post/decolonial
                        storytelling and meaning-making and speculations.<note>For a discussion of

                <p>Importantly, our activities and experiences were not simply hands-on but, often,
                    words-off, other-senses-on, with a focus on reflection and immersion, an
                    approach that warrants its own entry. Against better advice, we centered on
                    continuous meta-reflections on the learning processes and specific encounters
                    with texts, artifacts, and living organisms, foregrounding epistemological
                    ruminations on analog and digital technology and D&amp;EH art and literature in
                    each class, exhibit visit, or workshop activity. In that sense, we reversed the
                    order of Hayles and Pressman’s (<ref target="#hayles2013">2013</ref>) dictum
                        <quote rend="inline">making, critique,</quote> by beginning,
                    counterintuitively, with theory and critical reflection. Ryan Cordell (<ref

                    students, unlike administrators and professionals, are not invested in the
                    debates about the field or the disciplines (460–61) and implies that these
                    conversations should follow, not preempt, the examination of case studies. We
                    had heeded his advice in earlier practical workshops, and it had served us well.
                    That time, however, we wanted to experiment with foregrounding theory, ethics,
                    and reflection as missing <quote rend="inline">foundations of [D&amp;EH]

                    political <soCalled>touch</soCalled> of multimodal storytelling, in spaces
                    literally oversaturated with competing human and nonhuman bio and digital
                    stimuli, enhanced by interactive digital tools such as algorithms, VOC terpene

                    with participants, challenging many assumptions about what students/participants

                    facilitated precisely such corporal humanistic reflections. Initially, our
                    literature and humanities students, mostly newcomers to EH and DH, and to
                    contemporary art, were more comfortable with the dominant role that ocular
                    sensations, words and reading specifically, play in the process of learning and
                    interpretation. As Cordell (<ref target="#cordell2016">2016</ref>) predicts,
                    they were not troubled by disciplinary limits that a literature class may
                    impose. However, as they encountered environmental print theory and fiction,
                    alongside experiencing postprint work and immersive ecological art praxes
                    spatially and in other, nontextual, somatic ways, their very understanding of
                    possible modes of embodied storytelling and knowledge-making expanded, too.
                    Temporarily taken aback by the force of sensory affects and disciplinary
                    bordercrossings, participants soon found the techno-biologist poetic exchanges

                <p>To this end, we turned to one of two archival digital art projects exhibited at

                        Future: Lab Series</title> (2017), a mournful project on avian storytelling
                    and species extinction (Figures 4–5).<note>For a discussion of another nonhuman
                        species extinction archival installation by Heldén and Jonson (2017), see
                        Musiol (<ref target="#musiol2020">2020, 269–72</ref>).</note> This archival
                    installation used visual projections and an ambisonic speaker setup to
                    spatialize extinct and nonextinct bird sounds (Figure 3) which enveloped
                    visitors in an imagined, impossible sonic landscape of zebra finches — common
                    lab birds of our era — and of the extinct Hawaiian Kauaʻi ʻōʻō honeyeater birds.
                    The installation also activated multiple senses — sight, touch, hearing —
                    immersing visitors in historical and speculative sounds within this archive and
                    a transmedia elegy for the biodiversity, soundscape, and cultural lore lost. For
                    instance, participants watched oversized, looped footage of distraught finches
                    handled with lab instruments in an ornithological laboratory (Figures 3–4) while
                    immersed in the archival and speculative soundscape. But while the video
                    projection was consumed more passively, visitors also played with vintage
                    stereoscopes, examining Krista Caballero’s composite cards and their different
                    visual and tactile handling of human-avian stories (Figure 4).<note>Each card
                        displayed images of different bird species, and ornithological and cultural
                        information about them — including poetry and other cultural lore associated
                        with different migratory birds in the different regions through which they
                        migrate.</note> This transformed the gallery into a historic and imaginary,
                    multisensory, dynamic, participatory archive<note>Many digital archives are
                        participatory and crowdsourced. However, here the participation, while
                        collective, was also corporeal, intimate, and individual first.</note>

                        >Birding the Future’s</title> (2017) archive depended on various digital and
                    new and old media technology, such as hearing- and vision-enhancing analog and
                    digital tools — video projectors; vintage stereoscopes; composite illustrations
                    based on images taken with digital cameras and then processed with Adobe Pro,
                    Photoshop, and Illustrator; as well as the vector-based amplitude panning
                    algorithm; a multichannel audio (ambisonic) sound spatialization system; and a
                    Raspberry Pis setup — to collapse the temporal distinctions between the
                    irreversible past, the now of the exhibit, and the anticipated future. But their
                    use of sound, visual, and computer technologies was not simply functional and
                    prosthetic — enhancing human vision and hearing — but epistemological,
                    speculative, performative, and <soCalled>scriptive</soCalled>
                    <ptr target="#bernstein2011"/>. To Bernstein (<ref target="#bernstein2011">2011,
                        12, 69–91</ref>), archival work is often a feat of forensic <emph>and</emph>
                    performative imagination about how historical objects were and
                        <emph>might</emph> have been used. If what no longer is can only be imagined
                    and speculated about, the installation reminded us that imagination and
                    performance are also indispensable, if neglected, <emph>research</emph> skills,
                    and that technology can enable this complex understanding of research.</p>
                <p>Such complex, multilayered, conflicting use of technology made students
                    instantaneously aware of its obtrusive presence, of technologies’ histories, and
                    of their speculative power in this archive (something we had been trying to
                    expose in other DH classes, but with less success). Eirik Klakegg Thorsen wrote,
                    for instance, that the installation offered <quote rend="inline">a great example
                        of how technology can both be a distraction and the only possible way to
                        really <emph>imagine a historical moment</emph> [my emphasis].</quote> He
                    continued: <quote rend="block">I thought that the stereoscope took some of the
                        focus away from the extinct birds and drew the focus more over on the actual
                        technology itself. If the speakers and video were . . . placed in a dark
                        room where one could have focused solely on the sound and picture (or only
                        sound), and tried to imagine the significance of why they [birds and their
                        sounds] are gone, and not get distracted (by the first pair of stereoscopes
                        I have touched since my childhood), I think the experience would have been
                        even more powerful. But then, the artwork would have been much darker,
                        without much hope, and the story would have been completely different. The
                        digital sound and video of the birds show how digital technology may be the
                        only possible way to archive some types [of] <emph>historical moments</emph>
                        [my emphasis]. One could probably argue that it would be possible to paint a
                        lifelike picture of the birds and maybe even describe a sound by the use of
                        words and musical <soCalled>notations,</soCalled> but I would argue that, at
                        least for the sound, it would not be possible to <emph>do the imagination
                            without the technology</emph> . . . (Eirik Klakegg Thorsen, November 1,

                <p>While DH often engages in more positivist forensic archival work, in this
                    installation, vintage and new technology (stereoscopes and turn-of-the-century
                    recordings) in particular operated as <soCalled>scriptive</soCalled> historical
                    objects <ptr target="#bernstein2011"/>, inviting audiences to touch and use them
                    to imagine ways in which they had been used historically, replicating ways of
                    seeing and hearing <soCalled>nature</soCalled> at the beginning of the previous
                    and in our century. Just as our students did not initially consider that
                    storytelling might take on transmedia forms, or that algorithms and magnolias
                    can become poetic partners in crime, their initial understanding of
                    history-making and archives derived from their trust in an objective and static
                    textual record of human experience.<note>Of course, our Norwegian students had
                        different understandings of the objectivity of archives than did Indigenous
                        Sámis or (im)migrant participants of our classes.</note> Stereoscopic
                    technology challenged such views; it produced a sense of archival
                    multidimensionality and embodiment as it layered different genres and realms of
                    touchable knowledge (science, cards, visual art, and transnational poetry)
                    across time but also encouraged a performative, multisensory,
                    digital-tools-mediated engagement with the archive (Figure 4).</p>
                <p>Like <title rend="italic">Unknown Giants</title>, <title rend="italic">Birding
                        the Future</title> activated an embodied historical, fleshy, archival
                    sensorium; foregrounded multipurpose and multimodal affordances of digital and
                    analog technology and art; and revealed the critical force of affect produced by
                    immersive visual, sound, and digital tools. Moreover, participants also became
                    attentive to the challenges of creating non- or trans-human stories archives,
                    wondering how one can acknowledge the agency and <soCalled>voice</soCalled> of
                    nonhuman <soCalled>others</soCalled> when these extend beyond human cognitive
                    capacity. Moreover, this archival installation managed to raise with course
                    participants the important questions in literary and D&amp;EH studies about
                    access and presence in archives. Who belongs in a <soCalled>heritage
                        future</soCalled>
                    <ptr target="#nowviskie2018"/>? How can we preserve, display, care for nonhuman
                    lore, without using violent practices and instruments of captivity (Figure 4)?
                    We also wondered what constitutes ethical <soCalled>collaboration,</soCalled>
                    storytelling, archival evidence, or historical <soCalled>heritage</soCalled> in
                    that context. Ultimately, students and community residents came away from the
                    installation with a different understanding of the role they can play in the
                    archives and in the networks of ecological preservation, interpretation, and
                    care.</p>

                    Similarly, his prototyping D&amp;EH workshops at NTNU aimed to explore the
                    reflective and the speculative capacity, as well as the community-building
                    potential of the prototyping process. Mainsah drew specifically from the work on

                <p>In both workshops, hackneyed tech buzzwords — rapid prototyping, innovation,
                    invention, disruption — so cliché and common in DH, at NTNU and beyond, as well
                    as ephemeral concepts, tools, and environmental concerns, were brought together
                    and played with critically, tongue-in-cheek. As participants scrutinized and

                    <ptr target="#ruecker2015" loc="9"/> they also reflected on the questions their

                    gain or lose, and the troublesome issue of legal and commercial ownership.
                    Again, the emphasis on experimentation and its consequences was key, <quote

                    <ptr target="#ward2015" loc="231"/>. The workshop evaluations supported Ward’s
                    observations and included numerous meditations not simply on the prototyped
                    object or concepts but on the importance of the process and the playful and
                    grave ramifications of speculative designs.<note>All were included in an

                    Participants also noted the expanded understanding of the impact of digital
                    technology on their disciplinary and theoretical vocabulary, and on their
                    interpretative practices. Foregrounding the speculative, poetic, critical, and
                    philosophical potency of digital tools concretized for us and course
                    participants the idea that ethics and theory are digital building blocks — and
                    that they are the building blocks that are often missing. Ultimately,
                    speculative prototyping, a workshop activity enabling creative, transmodal
                    (sonic, somatic, tactile, kinetic, and textual) practices, became a framing
                    metaphor for our pedagogical work within DH <ptr target="#mauroflude2017"/>

                <p>In our context, institutionalized, <soCalled>semi-normal[ized]</soCalled> DH,
                    unlike in critical internet or media studies, which celebrate new textual
                    modalities, immersive, transmodal narration, and the poetics and theatre of the
                    digital <ptr target="#mauroflude2016"/>, <soCalled>semi-normal[ized]</soCalled>
                    DH in our institutional context often excludes emergent twentieth- and
                    twenty-first-century digital art, poetry, and storytelling from the curricula
                        <ptr target="#ackerman2017"/>
                    <ptr target="#underwood2019" loc="96"/>. Critical media art has much to teach
                    word- and print-focused DH literary analytics, then, especially in terms of
                    fostering noninstrumentalist experimentation with aesthetics and appreciation
                    for <quote rend="inline">creative exuberance and innovative form</quote>
                    <ptr target="#hayles2013" loc="xiv"/>. Moreover, Risam et al. (<ref
                        target="#risam2017">2017</ref>) are right to point out the public mission
                    obligation, especially at public-mission-oriented institutions, to attend to the
                    digital and media literacy needs of undergraduate students. Institutional DH
                    infrastructure, when available at all, is often built so as to neglect the needs
                    of students whose career paths lie outside doctoral research and are instead
                    often in cultural sectors, in public education classrooms, and local
                    communities. DH’s focus on <quote rend="inline">logocentric practice[s]</quote>
                    <ptr target="#clement2016" loc="534"/> and on systematic and deliverable
                    projects is, of course, warranted, needed, and should not be avoided, but the
                    somatic, affective, creative, poetic, or speculative digital design practices
                    that often escape <quote rend="inline">the precision-nested scales</quote> of DH
                    deserve attention and space, too <ptr target="#tsing2012" loc="505"/>. And so
                    does the emphasis on theory, as a design element. And on artistic practice and
                    performative methods. Engaging in critical design processes and art-centered
                    pedagogical activities re-centers on the theoretical, methodological, and
                    ethical dilemmas of the humanities, including digital and environmental ones, of
                    liberal arts, and makes these <emph>matter</emph> in an undergraduate classroom
                    and in the community <ptr target="#sack2019"/>.</p>
                <p>Moreover, if theory and ethics are to shape design, we must make more room for
                    them, if little of both is available at the undergraduate and pre-PhD levels
                    elsewhere in our institutional setting in DH, humanities, more broadly, and in
                    computer / information science training, alike. After all, scholars and academic
                    and industry practitioners insist that critical race, disability studies, queer
                    theory, or environmental justice praxis are foundational to digital literacy and

                    critical theory and ethics often are the scarcest and most frequently missing

                    <ptr target="#posner2016"/>. If we are to explore the noninstrumentalist
                    potential of D&amp;EH, we have to make it our central pedagogical focus.
                    Agonizing over inaccessibility of DH infrastructure — hardware, software, DH
                    tools training, library access, tech support availability, digital
                    accessibility, and more — is a crucial consideration. But if we decide to

                    <ptr target="#burdick2015" loc="14"/>, we cannot forget that critical theory
                    instruction within DH matters, too, and that it is often absent — its absence a
                    building block of toxic hardware that we build and the DH projects we fund.</p>
                <p>Critical design and mixmedia art practices already tackle the human–machine
                    interaction through the lens of critical theory and art, often literate and
                    performance arts, and engage with ethics, reflection, social critique, and
                        <quote rend="inline">the speech of the body,</quote> as foundational, not
                    peripheral, components of knowledge-making <ptr target="#manning2007" loc="9"/>.
                    For us, Mauro-Flude’s (<ref target="#mauroflude2019">2019</ref>) digital
                    practice-based theory of <quote rend="inline">performing the internet,</quote>
                    proved essential. In her view, nondeterministic, disobedient use of digital
                    tools it requires shifting away from the notion of <soCalled>use</soCalled> of
                    digital tools to the practice of, in our case, biodigital, speculative,
                    immersive-reflective <soCalled>performance.</soCalled> Understanding digital
                    tools as performative and sensorial instruments, or as Antonisz did, seeing
                    technology, broadly, as an expressive <quote rend="inline">form of art,</quote>
                    we have realized, may be another aspect of digital literacy and theory we are
                    not teaching, but we should <ptr target="#kordjakpiotrowska2013"/>. If we open
                    D&amp;EH pedagogy to embrace the ephemeral, immersive, performative, questioning
                    uses of technology, we may be able to imagine and cocreate other, noncorporate
                    models of digital <soCalled>arts of living</soCalled> and embodied and
                    meditative bio-sociality <ptr target="#tsing2017"/>
                    <ptr target="#mauroflude2017" loc="169"/>.</p>
                <p>Our D&amp;EH initiatives depended on existing art and knowledge networks of
                    collaboration, within and <emph>outside</emph> academia, to fulfill this utopian
                    aspiration, while also addressing specific and practical institutional needs and
                    gaps <ptr target="#musiol2021"/>. Therefore, using art modes of immersive
                    inquiry within D&amp;EH knowledge- and theory-making might not work in other
                    institutional contexts, and with different literature, art, critical theory, or
                    DH instruction traditions; we certainly do not propose it as a replacement for a
                    more instrumental DH curriculum. However, prototyping immersive D&amp;EH has
                    opened unexpected portals for us, which itself may be instructive for educators
                    and scholars interested in digital aesthetics and the noninstrumental potential
                    of D&amp;EH. Working in the immersive environment at KT, for instance, brought
                    debates about the place of ethics, theory, and transmedia aesthetics back into
                    to the D&amp;EH literature classroom. It also helped students recognize that
                    these conversations take place outside the university, too, and that they
                    themselves can <emph>play</emph> an important part in them. Moreover, pushing
                        <quote rend="inline">beyond the word</quote> led us to explore digital
                    technology and the human/nonhuman body as <quote rend="inline">thinking,
                        feeling</quote> interfaces, and <emph>experience</emph> viscerally,
                    collectively and individually, the expressive affordances of D&amp;EH. This, in
                    turn, emboldened us to further experiment with contemplative trans-human
                    co-creation <ptr target="#manning2007" loc="9"/>. Ultimately, as dutiful
