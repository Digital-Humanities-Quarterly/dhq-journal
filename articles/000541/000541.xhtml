                  <p>Our special issue explores audio and visual (AV) data as form, method, and practice
                     in
                     the digital humanities. Spurred by recent advances in computing alongside disciplinary
                     expansions of what counts as evidence, audio and visual ways of knowing are enjoying
                     a
                     more prominent place in the field. Whether the creation, analysis, and sharing of
                     audiovisual data or audiovisual ways of communicating scholarly knowledge, scholars
                     are
                     building compelling avenues of inquiry that are changing how we know, what we know,
                     and
                     why we know in the digital humanities (DH). These epistemological shifts not only
                     challenge existing methodological and theoretical pathways within the field of audiovisual
                     studies, but most importantly defy existing knowledge hierarchies within the entire
                     field
                     of DH.<a class="noteRef" href="#d4e205">[1]</a></p>

                  <div class="ptext" id="p1">Many scholars have repeatedly demonstrated how expanding our areas of inquiry builds
                     new
                     routes for the field [<a class="ref" href="#mcpherson2009">McPherson 2009</a>]
                     [<a class="ref" href="#manovich2002">Manovich 2002</a>]. Yet, often those interested in working with AV data have
                     found themselves swimming upstream. Text and word culture have enjoyed a dominant
                     position
                     in DH, bolstered by factors such as the prominence of text analysis and the form of
                     academic journals [<a class="ref" href="#svensson2009">Svensson 2009</a>]
                     [<a class="ref" href="#sula2019">Sula 2019</a>]. Replicating the larger structures of higher education,
                     racialized and gendered beliefs about what counts as "rigorous" scholarship that
                     marginalize fields such as cultural studies and visual culture studies also permeate
                     DH
                     and further explain why text (analysis) has enjoyed a privileged position along with
                     their
                     related academic fields [<a class="ref" href="#losh2018">Losh and Wernimont 2018</a>].<a class="noteRef" href="#d4e245">[1]</a> However, exciting
                     developments are continuing to support and amplify the work of AV data in DH.

                  <div class="ptext" id="p2">One of those developments is shifts in technology. The ability for computers to create,
                     "read", and store AV data followed by advances in areas such as machine learning have
                     augmented computational image and sound analysis. Pioneering approaches such as
                     cinemetrics that once relied on hand coding and text-based annotations can now be
                     automated. Within DH, this has led to new theories and methods such as cultural analytics,
                     distant listening, and distant viewing [<a class="ref" href="#manovich2020">Manovich 2020</a>]

                     [<a class="ref" href="#arnold2019">Arnold and Tilton 2019</a>]. These developments have led scholars such as Melvin Wevers
                     and Thomas Smits [<a class="ref" href="#wevers2020">Wevers and Smits 2020</a>] to argue that DH is seeing a "visual, digital
                     turn". Meanwhile, Mary Caton Lingold, Darren Mueller and Whitney Trettien [<a class="ref" href="#lingold2018">Lingold et al. 2018</a>], in the edited volume <em class="emph">Digital Sounds Studies</em>,
                     demonstrate how pairing digital tools with "interpretive practices that always attend
                     to
                     the human" forges new paths for sound studies and DH.

                  <div class="ptext" id="p3">Another critical development is digital access to AV materials. As DH scholars
                     increasingly think of their sources as data, they have benefited from large-scale
                     digitization of audiovisual collections.<a class="noteRef" href="#d4e278">[2]</a> At the forefront over the last three decades
                     have been governmental and GLAM (gallery, libraries, archives, museums) institutions
                     around the world to digitize collections, whose initiatives have often been spurred
                     by
                     deteriorating physical collections.<a class="noteRef" href="#d4e283">[3]</a> With millions of items digitized, platforms were
                     funded by cultural, government, and scientific organisations for providing access
                     to
                     audiovisual heritage collections alongside the emergence of platforms by for-profit
                     multinational corporations, all of which enabled the circulation of digitized and
                     digital-born materials online.<a class="noteRef" href="#d4e317">[4]</a>
                     While issues such as copyright and funding still loom large, DH scholars have greatly
                     benefited from the significant investment in digitization over the last 30 years.

                  <div class="ptext" id="p4">Finally, we turn to institutional developments.<a class="noteRef" href="#d4e323">[5]</a> Along with conferences specifically dedicated to DH and
                     media [e.g. <a href="https://transformationsconference.net" onclick="window.open('https://transformationsconference.net'); return false" class="ref">Transformations
                        Conference</a>], new journals have developed such as the <em class="emph">International Journal
                        of Digital Art History</em> and <em class="emph">Journal of Cultural Analytics</em> featuring
                     scholarship at the intersection of AV research and DH.<a class="noteRef" href="#d4e336">[6]</a> In order to further amplify AV work in DH, colleagues worked to
                     develop a Special Interest Group (SIG) within the Alliance of Digital Humanities
                     Organizations (ADHO). The AudioVisual in DH (AVinDH) SIG was proposed after a successful
                     workshop on how to integrate the Audiovisual in the Digital Humanities in Lausanne
                     at
                     DH2014, and formalized a year later at DH2015 in Melbourne. One result of the SIG's
                     work
                     is this special issue.<a class="noteRef" href="#d4e346">[7]</a>

                     articles in this issue. They model how AV research can be the subject of analysis
                     (e.g.
                     film) or result of analysis (e.g. podcast). They highlight less visible humanities
                     disciplines in the DH, model the importance of interdisciplinary collaboration across
                     institutional structures, demonstrate how cutting edge scholarship comes from a plethora
                     of positions, and offer new questions that the field is only beginning to grapple
                     with.

                     adding
                     intersections for engaging with audiovisual in the digital humanities. Amplifying
                     the work
                     of scholars with a range of disciplinary, institutional, and political commitments,
                     the
                     special issue constructs a more capacious configuration of DH.

                  <div class="ptext" id="p6">The special issue is organized into five sections. The first focuses on annotation
                     of AV
                     material as method and theory. The second explores analyzing (meta)data, which often
                     includes annotation, to build and analyze AV corpora. The third focuses on creative
                     and
                     liberatory ways to remix AV (meta)data as a way to innovate pedagogically and
                     methodologically while furthering discipline specific interventions. The fourth dives
                     further into computational methods, particularly machine learning, in turn demonstrating
                     how DH is reconfiguring these methods and ways of knowing to answer humanities questions.
                     The special issue ends with a focus on how AV forms such as podcasts and film can
                     also be
                     the form of scholarly knowledge in the field, highlighting how form and argument can
                     be
                     mutually constituted.

                  <div class="ptext" id="p7">Next, we turn to the contributions that comprise each section. The first explores
                     annotation as a powerful way to add context and analyze AV data. A particularly prominent
                     area of such work has been in film studies. Therefore, the first three articles offer
                     a
                     snapshot of different approaches and tools for film annotation. Cooper, Nascimento
                     and
                     Francis present their KinoLab and discuss the opportunities and challenges of Omeka
                     for
                     narrative film language analysis, including the challenges related to copyrights.
                     They
                     argue for a universally accepted data model for film analysis. We then turn to a new
                     annotation platform called <em class="emph">Mediate</em> built by a team at the University of
                     Rochester. Burges et al. discuss how they use the annotation tool in the classroom
                     in
                     three different disciplines - film and media studies, music history, and linguistics
                     - and
                     introduce the concept of "audiovisualities" as a theoretical frame for understanding
                     remediation through annotation. Next, Williams and Bell discuss how the Media Ecology
                     Project is conceived as a virtuous cycle and incubator working to increase access
                     and
                     discovery of moving images, with a particular focus on tools such as the Semantic
                     Annotation Tool. Zooming out, Clement and Fisher theorize a new approach to annotation.
                     They bring together sound and literary studies to introduce the concept of "audiation"
                     as
                     a framework for audiated annotations that increase access and discovery.

                  <div class="ptext" id="p8">The next section focuses on how (meta)data can open up analytical possibilities. Using
                     metadata to reunite AV materials, Sapienza et al. describe the process of reuniting
                     radio
                     and text files virtually that belong together but ended up at different institutions.
                     After discussing why audiovisual collections in general are heavily under described,
                     they
                     describe how virtual reunification and integrated access was realized through the
                     use of
                     linked data, minimal computing, and synced transcripts. Next, Hoyt et al discuss the
                     analytical possibilities afforded by metadata. Focused on podcasting, they discuss
                     three
                     different methods for studying RSS feeds and podcast metadata, and point at the
                     specificities of methods for born-digital media vis-à-vis digitized media. Carrivé
                     et al.
                     then focus on the first development phase of their ANTRACT project for the
                     transdisciplinary content analysis of 1262 newsreels containing more than 20,000 French
                     news reports. They discuss how they dealt with the project's main technological challenge
                     to process data and build tools to familiarize historians with the automated research
                     of
                     large audiovisual corpora in order to then use the data to pursue inquiry about Les
                     Actualités Françaises news reports. Finally, Burghardt et al. show what can be done
                     when
                     data is brought together from different sources to analyze music collaboration. They
                     demonstrate how network analysis can reveal the contours of collaboration among
                     musicians.

                  <div class="ptext" id="p9">In the third section, the authors creatively (re)mix AV data with a focus on audio
                     data.
                     Using audio data, Tycheia and Elhauge demonstrate how centering Afrofuturism in DH
                     pedagogy through mixtapes can not only realize the goals of an undergraduate composition
                     course but realize a liberatory DH praxis. Bonnet et al. combine data art, landscape
                     art
                     and augmented reality in their DataScapes Project. Departing from the premise that
                     data
                     can be translated into visual and sonic forms, they use protein data and texts from
                     the
                     bible, turn them into sequences, and translate these into visualisations and compositions.
                     Kramer then asks what if we listened to images. Building off of previous work on "image
                     sonification", he argues that transforming the visual into audio opens up new ways
                     of
                     seeing and hearing the past. Next, Have demonstrates how toggling from close to distant
                     listening offers insights about the longue duree of Danish radio content by scrutinizing
                     what is audible with the human ear and searching for patterns using AI. Next, we turn
                     to
                     work that makes field specific interventions. Martin constructs a new path for listening
                     to gentrification in Washington DC by combining ethnography, passive acoustic recording,
                     and computational sound studies. The work also demonstrates how centering Black DH
                     offers
                     new ways to understand the relationship between embodied and computational audio analysis
                     in DH, in turn forging new liberatory possibilities for the field.

                     techniques, particularly machine learning, to conduct data analysis on large collections
                     of AV data. Looking at a large collection of artwork showcasing musical instruments,
                     Sabatelli et al. introduce the usage of computer vision techniques to automatically
                     locate
                     musical instruments in images. They investigate the algorithmic properties of their
                     analysis and show how it leads to innovative scholarship in music iconography. A paper
                     by
                     Lupker and Turkel illustrates the potential of investigating novel intersections between
                     research in the humanities by using musical theory to guide the training and usage
                     of
                     machine-learning algorithms applied to a large corpus of digitized music. A born-digital
                     collection of K-pop dance videos hosted on YouTube is analyzed using state-of-the-art
                     computer vision techniques in a paper by Broadwell and Tangherlini. Their article
                     develops
                     a typography for describing and analyzing poses and choreography to facilitate the
                     data-driven analysis of time-based media. Oyallon-Koloski, Valkanova and Junokas present
                     a
                     different approach to the study of movement in space by showing how motion capture
                     technology can be used within film, dance, and movement studies. As with the Lupker
                     and
                     Turkel article, Oyallon-Koloski et al. illustrate the novel integration of theoretical
                     frames from the humanities – in their case, Laban Movement Analysis and Bartenieff
                     Fundamentals and Movement Studies – and the usage of computational techniques. In
                     another
                     take on the detection of bodies moving in space, Fragkiadakis, Nyst and van der Putten
                     introduce an automatic system and taxonomy for tagging and describing digital videos
                     of
                     sign-language usage. Together, these articles illustrate the potential for work in
                     AV DH
                     to infuse machine learning with analytical commitments from the humanities.

                     knowledge. In order to demonstrate how the podcast format expands our definitions
                     of text,
                     Edwards and Hershkowitz reveal how podcasts can realize intersectional feminist approaches
                     to DH. Along with demonstrating and discussing the creation of the Books Aren't Dead
                     (BAD)
                     podcast in the article, they discuss the process in a podcast for this special issue.
                     Kim
                     then explores how motion caption and virtual reality can be used to record and visualize
                     movement histories as a form of cultural heritage preservation. Through these forms,
                     one
                     can then use visual storytelling, she argues, to demonstrate how movement, dance,
                     and
                     ritual cannot be separated from a person's personal narration of the experience. Finally,
                     Mittel's contribution showcases twenty audiovisual deformations of the classic musical
                     "Singin in the Rain" in still image, GIF, and video formats. The essay considers both
                     what
                     each new deformation reveals about the film and the way we engage with the by algorithmic
                     practices derived object as a product of the "deformed humanities."

                     between form and argument is one we also embraced. The publication needs, some of
                     which
                     weren't possible, of our special issue pushed the boundaries of the form and format
                     of DHQ
                     as a journal that is catered for linear reading of articles as written texts in XML.
                     As a
                     result, the articles in this special issue include 5 sound files, 52 embedded videos,
                     and
                     176 gifs and images. These AV components are key elements of the authors' argumentation.
                     The special issue attempts to more closely mirror how scholars of AV materials in
                     DH
                     actually produce and create scholarship. In this context we take as a guide other
                     pioneering initiatives in this field such as <a href="https://scalar.me/anvc/about/" onclick="window.open('https://scalar.me/anvc/about/'); return false" class="ref">Scalar</a>, <a href="https://viewjournal.eu/" onclick="window.open('https://viewjournal.eu/'); return false" class="ref">VIEW journal</a>, <a href="https://vimeo.com/groups/audiovisualcy/" onclick="window.open('https://vimeo.com/groups/audiovisualcy/'); return false" class="ref">Audiovisualcy</a>, and <a href="http://mediacommons.org/intransition/" onclick="window.open('http://mediacommons.org/intransition/'); return false" class="ref">[in]transition</a> that question the
                     relation between the affordances of a publication platform and the interactivity and
                     multimodality of scholarship that increasingly embraces creative modes of production.
                     We
                     hope that these incremental steps within DHQ can forge exciting new possibilities
                     for the
                     field.

                     work in
                     DH. First, our own areas of expertise – statistics and digital images, history and
                     audio,
                     american studies and photography, and media studies, television &amp; film – reflect a
                     range of audio and visual scholarship that animates DH. Second, the inclusion of a
                     colleague housed in a Math &amp; Computer Science department, Tayor Arnold, demonstrates
                     how digital humanities scholarship often requires working with and giving proper credit
                     to
                     experts trained in computational fields. Third, we wanted to build collaborations
                     across
                     geopolitical boundaries and languages that might help us think critically and beyond
                     the
                     particular configurations of DH that shape our local, regional, or national context.
                     We
                     recognize that our positionalities as White able-bodied scholars living in the global
                     west
                     and north also brings limits. As a part of our efforts, we paid special attention
                     to
                     circulating the CFP beyond our immediate DH circles with particular attention to reaching
                     beyond the US and Western Europe. However, there is still more work to do. Yet, we
                     do hope
                     that the issue in aggregate reveals how thinking across disciplinary, cultural, and
                     spatial boundaries enables a more capacious configuration of the field than currently
                     articulated.

                     about
                     the challenges. Along with the work featured in this special issue, areas such as
                     3D,
                     AR/VR, and game studies are forging exciting paths. As disciplines (albeit slowly)
                     adopt
                     more capacious guidelines for what counts, forms of scholarship such as films, multimodal

                     of the
                     teamwork and expertise often required to access and work with AV data, this area of
                     DH
                     also pushes us to work across ossified divisions such as the "Humanities" and "Sciences",

                  <div class="ptext" id="p15">At the same time, challenges remain. There are major obstacles to working with AV.
                     For
                     example, digitized images have significantly larger file sizes than textual data making
                     them hard to transfer and process even in light of recent technological advances [<a class="ref" href="#simoncelli1997">Simoncelli 1997</a>]. This makes computational analysis of large collections of
                     digitized visual materials difficult for institutions that do not have access to extensive
                     computational resources. Audiovisual materials are also often subject to varying degrees
                     of copyright and access restrictions, dictated often by large multimedia producers
                     [<a class="ref" href="#menell2002">Menell 2002</a>]. This makes it relatively difficult to work with certain
                     collections, such as television news programs and feature films, and risks limiting
                     the
                     kinds of work with which digital humanists can work. Even when we do have access,
                     the
                     scale of AV data is growing rapidly, particularly given the rise of born digital AV
                     content, and with this comes implications for how and who is positioned to analyze
                     these
                     materials. Existing audiovisual archives are heavily skewed towards European- and
                     U.S.-centric collections. As we work through these challenges and opportunities, we
                     need
                     to continue to listen and engage with the cautions and critiques about computation
                     and
                     algorithms from scholars such as dana boyd and Kate Crawford [<a class="ref" href="#boyd2012">boyd and Crawford 2012</a>],

                     Editor Cassandra Cloutier, for their work. Even under what were once "normal" conditions,
                     writing an essay for publication is demanding. The challenges quickly mounted as authors
                     revised amidst a global pandemic that disrupted everyone's daily lives and affected
                     communities unequally due to structural inequalities. As authors and our colleagues
                     at DHQ

                     computational text analysis as more rigorous and hard in part based on claims to the
                     use
                     of scientific methods has asserted problematic hierarchies of knowledge production
                     in
                     the field. It is not a coincidence that the field has been slow to acknowledge and
                     engage with the work of humanities fields that have been feminized and racialized.
                     Scholars from these fields have long proven how ways of knowing - such as affective,
                     aural, embodied, and performative, and visual - may actually be the only way to recover
                     the pasts that constitute (and often haunt) our present and through which we can imagine
                     new futures. The work of scholars such as Kim Gallon [<a class="ref" href="#gallon2016">Gallon 2016</a>], Safija
                     U. Noble [<a class="ref" href="#noble2019">Noble 2019</a>], Amanda Phillips [<a class="ref" href="#bailey2016">Bailey et al. 2016</a>],
                     Roopika Risam [<a class="ref" href="#risam2019">Risam 2019</a>], and Puthiya Purayil Sneha [<a class="ref" href="#sneha2016">Sneha 2016</a>] to center BlackDH, postcolonial DH, and #transformDH has made
                     important space to think about other forms of knowledge.</span></div>

                     look back to Miriam's Posner's article on the term "humanities data" [<a class="ref" href="#posner2015">Posner 2015</a>]. Posner notes that this is an unusual term for humanities
                     scholars. Fast forward five year and it is increasingly common to hear materials such
                     as
                     books, films, and photo called data.</span></div>
               <div class="endnote" id="d4e283"><span class="noteRef lang en">[3] We give some examples of digitisation initiatives
                     from around the globe for further reading. A number of initiatives across Asia and
                     the
                     Pacific are mentioned in a report about digitisation of Indian cultural heritage at
                     the
                     <em class="emph">Indira Gandhi National Centre for the Art</em>
                     [<a class="ref" href="#bakhsi2016">Bakhsi 2016</a>], a centre which itself has digitized a considerable
                     proportion of its heritage resources, and made them available through its website.
                     Other
                     initiatives mentioned in the report are a.o. [<a class="ref" href="#zhizhong2009">Zhizhong 2009</a>], [<a class="ref" href="#manaf2007">Manaf 2007</a>], and [<a class="ref" href="#urgola2014">Urgola 2014</a>]. When considering Africa, a
                     special issue on the impact of digitisation and new media on various African societies
                     in the <em class="emph">Journal of Eastern African Studies</em> sheds light on how in this part
                     of the world the digital transformation primarily manifests itself by the uptake of
                     social media [<a class="ref" href="#srinivasan2018">Srinivasan et al. 2018</a>]. Classical ancient works are digitized in
                     Egypt, at the remake of the ancient Library of Alexandria, the <em class="emph">Bibliotheca
                        Alexandrina</em> that can be found in present day Alexandria. In a report published
                     by the Unesco on digital culture in Spanish speaking countries [<a class="ref" href="#kulesz2017">Kulesz 2017</a>], the core initiatives are investments in infrastructure to decrease the digital
                     divide within the countries. In the US, the Federal Agencies Digital Guidelines
                     Initiative FADGI established guidelines for digitization in 2007, enabling standardized
                     digitization of cultural heritage collections by archives, museums and libraries.
                     For
                     more information about the EU's work, see [<a class="ref" href="#de2007">de Jong and Wintermans 2007</a>] [de Jong and
                     Wintermans 2007]. Given the important calls for a postcolonial DH, it is worth noting
                     that ideas of nation and nation building are inextricably linked to many of these
                     initiatives. Such work can be a colonial project as well as a form of resistance and
                     decolonization. What gets digitized and by whom is a complicated, and often fraught,
                     process, see [<a class="ref" href="#moseley2008">Moseley and Wheatley 2008</a>]
