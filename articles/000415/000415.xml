                <p>This paper explores different ways of modelling and simulating complex spatial
                    and temporal events, such as battles, for which it has been practically
                    impossible to (re)construct the thousands if not hundreds of thousands of
                    variables of which they are comprised. This research utilises as a case study
                    the Battle of Mount Street Bridge of the Irish Easter 1916 Rising, in which the
                    number of British casualties has been fiercely debated. The research is framed
                    within the theory and practice of digital scholarly editions, which provides a
                    new paradigm for approaching virtual worlds in a contextualized and annotated
                    environment. This paper also discusses the challenges of creating virtual worlds
                    for online environments in which there is rapid obsolescence of software and
                    platforms and an absence of standards.</p>

                <p>In the last three decades, cultural heritage, history, and archaeology have made
                    use of three-dimensional digital (re)constructions as tools in the process of
                    knowledge production by making complex two-dimensional data more comprehensible
                    and by simulating spatial and temporal aspects of the past that could not be
                    addressed by using conventional methods. Despite the precariousness of working
                    with 3D technologies in which research projects are reliant on software,
                    hardware, operating systems, and the Internet itself that constantly change, we
                    argue here that the benefits of translating physical environments into
                    three-dimensional models - both the process of modelling as well as the models
                    themselves - outweigh the problems caused by the medium.</p>
                <p>Contested Memories: The Battle of Mount Street Bridge project focuses on a battle
                    that took place on Wednesday, 26th April 1916 during the week of the Easter
                    uprising in Dublin. This battle, between a small group of Irish rebels and a
                    much larger force that the British high command sent to Dublin to put down the
                    rebellion, was used to investigate to what extent a virtual world can enable
                    alternative forms of research, help in the interpretive process, and assist
                    knowledge production for both general audiences and specialists. More
                    specifically, it explores how 3D (re)constructions can augment and enrich the
                    palette of methodologies that we use to answer traditional historical questions
                    by enhancing our ability to understand and interpret space as well as to map
                    temporal dimensions within that space. In seeking to map both time and space, we
                    encountered a common problem reported in 3D scholarship; that is the depiction
                    of time in a meaningful way that complements the spatial dimension and enhances
                    the perception of the virtual world <ptr target="#zuk2005"/>
                    <ptr target="#stefani2008"/>
                    <ptr target="#laycock2008"/>. </p>
                <p> This paper will discuss the decision-making process of gathering and
                    interpreting primary sources for the construction of a virtual world, issues of
                    3D modelling and representation, the challenges that the project faced, and its
                    future directions. It will also problematise the term <q>virtual world</q> by
                    referring to previous and current examples in heritage studies, also proposing a
                    typology based on their use in teaching, research, and dissemination. It will
                    argue that the process of (re)construction is a valuable tool that provides
                    opportunities for experimentation and new insights, enabling specialists to
                    better comprehend the multidimensional and ambiguous character of historical
                    settings and events. Finally, by drawing from the theory and practice of Digital
                    Scholarly Editions, this paper will suggest that 3D (re)construction projects
                    can become knowledge sites in which the models are seen as text, and documentary
                    evidence in the form of apparatus provides an enriched understanding of its
                    content, thus giving credit and value to the products of 3D modelling as
                    scholarship. </p>

                <head>2. HISTORICAL VIRTUAL WORLDS: THE CHALLENGES OF THE STATE-OF-THE-ART</head>
                <p>In more than three decades of 3D heritage visualisation and simulation there have
                    been immense technological advancements in both hardware and software, which
                    have also driven the development of theoretical and methodological approaches,
                    processes, and products; from the first schematic representations of buildings
                    (see <ptr target="#reilly2016"/> to photorealistic renderings and predictive
                    simulations of ancient structures (see <ptr target="#dawson2007"/>); and from
                    spatial analysis (see <ptr target="#paliou2011"/>) and physics simulations (see
                        <ptr target="#oetelaar2016"/>) to interactive virtual worlds utilising
                    online platforms (see <ptr target="#sequiera2013"/>) and game engines (see the
                    projects carried out as part of the Humanities Virtual Worlds Consortium – <ref
                        target="http://virtualworlds.etc.ucla.edu/"
                        >http://virtualworlds.etc.ucla.edu/</ref>). </p>
                <p>In the last ten years, there have been several definitions for virtual worlds
                    primarily reflecting Second Life and multiplayer game approaches; from Bell’s
                    (2008) <quote rend="inline" source="#bell2008">synchronous, persistent network
                        of people, represented as avatars, facilitated by networked
                        computers</quote> to Schroeder’s (2008) <quote source="#schroeder2008"
                        rend="inline">persistent virtual environments in which people experience
                        others as being there with them – and where they can interact with
                        them</quote>. Girvan (2013) defines a virtual world as a <quote
                        rend="inline" source="#girvan2013">persistent, simulated, and immersive
                        environment facilitated by networked computers, providing multiple users
                        with avatars and communication tools with which to act and interact in world
                        and in real time</quote>. Nevelsteen (2017) on the other hand describes a
                    virtual world as a <quote source="#nevelsteen2017" rend="inline">simulated
                        environment where MANY agents can virtually interact with each other, act
                        and react to things, phenomena and the environment; agents can be ZERO or
                        MANY human(s), each represented by MANY‖ entities called a virtual self (an
                        avatar), or MANY software agents; all action/reaction/interaction must
                        happen in a real-time shared spatiotemporal nonpausable virtual environment;
                        the environment may consist of many data spaces, but the collection of data
                        spaces should constitute a shared data space, ONE persistent shard</quote>.
                    Trying to map these definitions to historical virtual worlds becomes futile,
                    since the vast majority do not fulfil the necessary conditions to be classified
                    as virtual worlds: avatars, multiple users and in-world interaction, real-time,
                    persistency, communication tools, to name a few. Also, these definitions neglect
                    more recent approaches in which such environments become tools in research and
                    education. For this reason, we might either abandon the term and continue using
                    the more generic terminology that is typically used interchangeably in such
                    contexts, such as 3D visualisations, computer graphic simulations, and digital
                    (re)constructions, or reconceive the definition of virtual worlds so that they
                    can better encompass the historical environments created and their role and
                    value in the process of knowledge production. </p>
                <p>An abundance of virtual world projects in archaeology, history, and
                    heritage-related subjects have been created, especially since the 2000s,
                    particularly during the years that Second Life and Open Simulator were at their
                    peak. Both platforms, and especially Open Simulator which is the free and
                    open-source alternative to Second Life, democratised the process of creating
                    virtual worlds as they did not require highly advanced 3D modelling skills.
                    These online environments enabled a novel way of experiencing history/heritage
                    and working in an online environment for pedagogical and research purposes
                    unlike anything previously available <ptr target="#wankel2009"/>. </p>
                <p>Second Life, as the name suggests, attempts to immerse its users in a world that
                    has its own social and cultural systems, industry, and currency, while
                        <soCalled>residents</soCalled> in order to build and maintain their second
                    lives have to buy or rent a piece of land on the <soCalled>grid</soCalled>. In
                    the early years of Second Life, many educational institutions and projects
                    purchased mainland regions or islands to build hubs that would enable new ways
                    of online teaching, collaboration, and knowledge creation. However, due to the
                    policy of Linden Labs to discontinue educational pricing, Second Life became
                    unaffordable for many research groups and institutions. As a result, and due to
                    the way that these virtual worlds functioned, e.g. in-world created 3D models
                    and modalities of communication that could not be exported, most of these worlds
                    have now vanished <ptr target="#mcdonough2010" loc="89–97"/>. One of the most
                    characteristic examples of this was the Okapi (Open Knowledge and the Public
                    Interest) island built by the University of California Berkeley to create an
                    online collaborative environment based on the excavation of Çatalhöyük, a
                    Neolithic site in Anatolia, Turkey <ptr target="#morgan2009"/>. Okapi island
                    gained international media exposure and virtual learning awards, and soon became
                    an exemplar of how such virtual worlds could function for educational and
                    research purposes. However, due to the exigencies of the platform, Okapi island
                    ceased to exist in February 2012. Several other projects developed in Second
                    Life, such as the Virtual Rosewood <ptr target="#gonzalez-tennant2013"/> and
                    Theatron <ptr target="#beacham2009"/> are no longer accessible since the
                    platform’s maintenance costs were prohibitive for the research teams. </p>
                <p>Despite the profound benefits of platforms, such as Second Life, it was the
                    advent of Unity Technologies that boosted the production of heritage virtual
                    worlds since they enabled the creation of highly-detailed models, the embedding
                    of features found in game engines, such as real-time physics and lighting
                    effects, while allowing in-browser experiences without the need to download
                    additional software. They also allowed modellers to reuse their content created
                    in specialised computer graphics packages, thus not requiring in-world modelling
                    or the translation/modification of existing models. However, similar to the
                    problems in Second Life, online virtual worlds developed in the game engine,
                    Unity 3D, recently ceased to exist due to the Netscape Plugin Application
                    Programming Interface (NPAPI) that was phased out by browsers in the period
                    2014-2017. The NPAPI is a technology that allows third party software developers
                    to produce plugins and web extensions that can run software as a layer within
                    html pages on internet browsers (e.g. Oracle’s Java plugin, Adobe Flash, and
                    Apple Quicktime web extensions). Since these plugins became increasingly
                    vulnerable to security flaws, browser manufacturers decided to replace the

                <p>Considering that virtual worlds developed in Second Life or Unity 3D were
                    intended to be available online, it is striking that at the time of writing this
                    paper only a handful are still accessible. Contrary to the video game community
                    that often builds emulators to overcome – even temporarily – problems of access
                        <ptr target="#kraus2012"/>, heritage virtual worlds cannot cope with such
                    demands. Many first generation projects are inaccessible and thus it is
                    difficult for new projects to learn from previous work, especially when the
                    experiential three-dimensional approach to space and time is only accessible via
                    conventional, static, two-dimensional images. Therefore, the vast majority of
                    the-state-of-the-art - at least in its original format - is lost. Online and
                    interactive scholarship, even text-based, has always faced technological shifts
                    and exigencies; however, even in such a fragile ecosystem, changes, successes,
                    and failures enable alternative forms of research, inform the interpretive
                    process, and assist knowledge production. </p>
                <p>In the following paragraphs, we will refer to previous and current heritage
                    virtual worlds projects dividing them into three broadly defined categories:
                    Virtual Museums; Research Laboratories; and Teaching Environments, taking into
                    account the features of each environment, intended purposes, as well as use by
                    different audiences.<note> For an earlier classification of virtual worlds see
                        Champion and Dave (2007) <title rend="quotes">Dialing up the Past</title>,
                        who divided virtual worlds into spatially visualised, activity-based, and
                        hermeneutic in a pursuit of placemaking in such environments and in response
                        to Kalay’s and Marx’s (2005) cyber-placemaking. Also see Anderson et al.
                        (2010) on a typology for serious games.</note> Standalone, offline, 3D
                    modelling projects have a much longer history than online environments and could
                    also be categorised under the proposed typology as they were created to fulfil
                    different purposes and for different audiences. However, given that these were
                    not intended to be publicly available and were created to fulfill different
                    goals, we will only refer here to online virtual worlds.<note> For
                        representative examples of standalone, offline 3D projects that have been
                        used to analyse spatial and temporal features in past environments see: <ptr

                <p><q>Virtual Museums</q> are environments that represent buildings, cityscapes, or
                    landscapes at a moment of their existence or through time, allowing user
                    navigation either using avatars or a first person view. We use the word
                        <q>museum</q> since these environments are experienced in a similar way to
                    museum exhibits; users can move around and observe the artefacts but cannot
                    interact with, manipulate, or modify them. Such virtual worlds include little or
                    no contextual information in-world, whereas contextual and interpretative
                    material may be supplied in the form of accompanying online resources, e.g.
                    website, or conventional publications. By definition, most virtual world
                    projects fall under the <q>Virtual Museums</q> category since the minimum
                    condition that has to be fulfilled is a 3D model accessible online. For example,
                    the Zamani project (<ref target="http://www.zamaniproject.org/"
                        >http://www.zamaniproject.org/</ref>) has recorded highly-detailed and
                    metrically accurate 3D models of Africa’s heritage sites that – among others –
                    can be explored using the Unity Web player. Similarly, the Virtual Rosewood
                    Research project (<ref target="http://www.rosewood-heritage.net/"
                        >http://www.rosewood-heritage.net/</ref>) that focuses on Rosewood, Florida,
                    an African American town destroyed during the 1923 race riot (<ptr
                        target="#gonzalez-tennant2015"/>; also see <ptr
                        target="#gonzalez-tennant2013"/> for previous reconstructions of Rosewood on
                    Second Life), and Virtual Williamsburg 1776 (<ptr target="#fischer2011"/>; <ref
                        target="http://research.history.org/vw1776/"
                        >http://research.history.org/vw1776/</ref>), have made use of Unity to make
                    these available online. Zamani, Rosewood, and Williamsburg projects are only
                    comprised of 3D models and do not include any supplementary material in-world.
                    Information that contextualises and provides additional information on these
                    projects, including background, decision-making, and 3D modelling, is included
                    on the websites that host the virtual worlds and in the referenced publications. </p>
                <p><q>Research Laboratories</q> on the other hand, do not only enable users,
                    primarily researchers, to experience (re)constructions of and gain knowledge
                    about past places, periods, and events but also provide them with
                    experimentation opportunities by permitting the alteration of variables, thus
                    allowing testing of hypotheses, new approaches to old data and research
                    questions, and the construction of new narratives. These processes stimulate
                    discussion and produce creative responses, thus having a transformative impact
                    on historical sense-making, reasoning, and understanding. Therefore, virtual
                    worlds become synonymous with knowledge production and the research process that
                    leads to their creation, i.e. problematising sources, identifying variables, and
                    justifying solutions, opens a dialogue that can generate new avenues of
                    scholarship unlike traditional spatiotemporal approaches. For example, the
                    Digital Hadrian’s Villa project <ptr target="#frischer2016"/>, whose online
                    version is implemented in Unity (not currently active), allows users to test
                    archaeoastronomical theories, including the alignment of the sun with the tower
                    of Roccabruna, in the summer solstices during Hadrian’s reign to discover
                    celestial arrangements in the night sky as these would have been seen in the
                    past (for a similar example on WebGL – currently active – see the Virtual
                    Meridian of Augustus, <ref
                        target="http://cgi.soic.indiana.edu/~vwhl/VirtualMeridian/WebGL/index.html">
                        http://cgi.soic.indiana.edu/~vwhl/VirtualMeridian/WebGL/index.html</ref>;
                    also see <ptr target="#frischer2017"/>). Similar attempts using the Virtual
                    Reality Modelling Language (VRML) to create interactive visualisations with
                    parameters that can be changed to demonstrate possibilities and variations in
                    digital (re)constructions have been implemented since the early days of computer
                    graphics (see for example <ptr target="#roberts1997"/>'s work on a Roman theatre
                    in Canterbury). This category is the one with the fewest examples since there is
                    no off-the-shelf platform that supports the interactive elements of such worlds
                    as it requires many more resources in comparison to Virtual Museum projects
                    since interactions have to be designed and pre-programmed by specialists with
                    subject expertise and often to be enabled by Artificial Intelligence mechanisms
                    (see for example <ptr target="#vosinakis2016"/>). </p>
                <p> In the <q>Teaching Environments</q> category, virtual worlds act as fora of
                    communication, discussion, and outreach. It is not only about the virtual worlds
                    themselves but also about how such worlds are used as a basis for teaching
                    different groups and stakeholders, enquiry, synthesis, and critical analysis.
                    Although there are a few cases where virtual classes are held within virtual
                    worlds in which users can collectively attend teaching sessions and interact
                    with each other and the instructor(s), as well as virtual worlds that were
                    adapted to be used as teaching material (see for example <ptr
                        target="#earle2011"/>; <ptr target="#earle2009"/> on the Crystal Palace
                    Project – VW is inactive: <ref
                        target="http://slurl.com/secondlife/Sydenham%20Crystal%20Palace/158/201/23"
                        >http://slurl.com/secondlife/Sydenham%20Crystal%20Palace/158/201/23</ref>);
                    this category primarily includes virtual worlds built to provide an embodied and
                    sensorial understanding and an immersive experience of a period, culture, or
                    historical event by employing a narrative that guides users in their experience
                    of the virtual world. For example, Oxford’s First World War Second Life project
                    (still active: <ref
                        target="http://maps.secondlife.com/secondlife/Frideswide/219/199/646/"
                        >http://maps.secondlife.com/secondlife/Frideswide/219/199/646/</ref>) that
                    combines areas of the Western Front (1914-18) and digitised poetry from the
                    First World War Poetry Digital Archive (<ref
                        target="https://www.oucs.ox.ac.uk/ww1lit/"
                        >https://www.oucs.ox.ac.uk/ww1lit/</ref>), allows visitors to experience the
                    poetry of the Great War in an evocative and emotive visualisation of the Western
                    Front by providing access to archival material, such as veteran interviews,
                    video clips, readings of poems, and manuscripts. In this category we also
                    include novel approaches to teaching and learning that promote enquiry,
                    teamwork, effective participation, self-management, reflective learning, and
                    creative thinking, such as Okapi Island’s Machinima: The Hunt, a film made by
                    students and faculty exclusively within the virtual world (<ref
                        target="https://youtu.be/n86eZOr-9xE">https://youtu.be/n86eZOr-9xE</ref>),
                    portraying hunting and burial ceremonies in everyday life at Çatalhöyük. </p>
                <p>While the typologies of 3D scholarship outlined above make the models of use to a
                    wider audience, they do not provide an integrated environment that brings to the
                    fore the decision making process, for example by making available the materials
                    collected that informed the research behind or steps taken to create the models
                    so others - beyond the research team - can utilise the knowledge developed
                    during the modelling process. As a result, this scholarship exists in a
                    trifurcated information space; the original models are available to the
                    individual or the team who worked on them, a version of the models - often
                    downgraded - exists electronically (if technology allows), while the materials
                    that informed decisions and the knowledge generated from them is written about
                    in conventional publication formats or never become available beyond the
                    research team. To overcome this, we are proposing a fourth, still relatively
                    nascent typology, that of 3D Scholarly Editions. 3D DSEs are knowledge sites
                    that provide hermeneutic richness <ptr target="#champion2015"/> that takes
                    advantage of the interactivity of the medium and enables the communication of
                    the process and results of that scholarship within a single spatiotemporal,
                    immersive, and sensory environment. </p>
                <p>The typologies explored here are offered as ways of creating broad categories for
                    3D (re)presentations in order to begin to develop, not only a shared vocabulary
                    for discussing virtual worlds as knowledge production, but to begin to theorise
                    this type of scholarship, not in terms of best practice but in terms of more
                    consistency with other digital scholarship, including research goals, audiences
                    addressed, methodologies and standards, and features that can be expected from
                    each type of virtual world. </p>
                <p> In the research trajectory of the Battle of Mount Street Bridge project, the 3D
                    environment was one of several tools and resources that formed a Research
                    Laboratory (per the typology enumerated above). Analogue and digital resources,
                    spreadsheets and models, along with excursions to the battle site were utilised
                    to build an increasingly nuanced and complex understanding of the battle. Once
                    the article was published that explored our research findings <ptr
                        target="#hughes2017"/> we became dissatisfied that outside of our project
                    team, the wider community interested in the battle could not access, evaluate,
                    and reuse our decision-making process, nor could it use the 3D environment to
                    posit alternative theories; hence our investigation of a fourth model, that of a
                    Digital Scholarly Edition (DSE). </p>

            <div>
                <head>3. TOWARDS 3D SCHOLARLY EDITIONS</head>
                <p>3D DSEs are 3D (re)constructions which include robust contextual information,
                    metadata, and paradata either in the form of in-world annotations or
                    supplementary side sources. In both cases the contextual information or
                    annotation can be text or multimodal. Indeed, we would argue that the annotation
                    needs to take advantage of the affordances of the medium to be truly effective
                    in providing access to the creation process, background information about the
                    world being modelled, and alternative versions of the (re)construction. This
                    type draws from the theory and practice of Digital Scholarly Editing (DSE) which
                    derives from a long history of practice in editing texts for print (See <ptr
                        target="#shillingsburg1996"/>; <ptr target="#apollon2014"/>; <ptr
                        target="#schreibman2013"/>; <ptr target="#pierazzo2015"/>; <ptr
                        target="#driscoll2016"/>). </p>
                <p>The digital has provided textual scholars with a wide palette with which to
                    remediate, not only the textual record (from grave inscriptions to manuscripts
                    of modernist texts to multiple editions of a work in print), but increasingly
                    other mediums of knowledge transmission (e.g. images, audio recordings, maps),
                    recording, (re)creating, and describing a wide variety of linguistic and
                    non-linguistic features (verbal, visual, oral, and numeric). Textual scholarship
                    includes not only the transmission of texts, but the social processes of their
                    transmission <ptr target="#mckenzie1999" loc="13"/>. Thus a 3D scholarly edition
                    should not be thought of as a defined object, but a methodological field in
                    which a set of codes, not only the technological codes that govern the creation
                    of the world, but the social, theoretical, and historical codes that its makers
                    adopt in its creation, impose a prefiguring frame on the reality being created
                        <ptr target="#barthes1977"/>. </p>
                <p>The construction of such an edition entails building an intertextual network
                    composed of the primary text (in this case the 3D model) along with its
                    accompanying annotation and apparatus providing a base from which the reader can
                    actively engage in the knowledge creation process. Embedding the iconography of
                    virtual worlds into what we might broadly describe as scholarly editing
                    practice, opens up new vistas for scholarship and communicating the results of
                    that scholarship within spatiotemporal environments that are immersive and
                    multisensorial <ptr target="#schreibman2019"/>. If the goal of the modelled
                    world is to create its own ecosystem to provoke and encourage evolving thought
                    about the material, aesthetic, and cultures of the real-world events it
                    simulates <ptr target="#schreibman2013"/>, at the heart of this ecosystem is the
                    text, the modelled world. </p>
                <p>All edited texts are, at their core, dialogues <ptr target="#driscoll2016"
                        loc="xiv"/>. Dialogues between the text and the editor and between the
                    edited text and its readers. Scholarly editions are fundamentally, fabrications.
                    They (re)present a work (or in the case of 3D, a world) as it never existed
                        historically,<note> In the simplest case, in editing a manuscript for print
                        publication an editor must make decisions in interpreting characters or
                        words, in the case of deletions and additions, in what order the text should
                        be presented, and in manuscripts that contain multiple texts, if portions
                        should be considered part of the work being edited or of another work. More
                        complex editing may involve creating the text from multiple extant versions
                        (or witnesses) in which no single version carries final authorial
                        intention.</note> but in its (re)presentation, providing greater access to
                    readers, not only to the textual record, but to the social, historical, and
                    economic factors which led to its creation and subsequent use. This surrounding
                    material, referred to as apparatus is annotative, providing critical, textual,
                    and biographical notes. This can be seen in an online edition such as The
                    Chymistry of Isaac Newton (<ptr target="#newman2016"/>; <ref
                        target="http://webapp1.dlib.indiana.edu/newton/"
                        >http://webapp1.dlib.indiana.edu/newton/</ref>) that provides both
                    diplomatic and normalised (modernised) transcriptions, alongside online tools,
                    such as glossaries, indexes, and a guide to the symbols Newton used, so that the
                    reader can better interpret the text. Depending on the theory with which the
                    editor produces the text (typically described in the introductory material), the
                    annotation, as well as edited text itself, follows standard editorial
                        practices.<note> Editorial theory covers a wide range of practices and
                        documentary types. For example, documentary editing is typically used for
                        historical texts that exist in one version in which the manuscript is
                        reproduced in print as accurately as possible (e.g. without correction of
                        spelling, with additions and deletions, etc.). Genetic editing is typically
                        used for manuscripts of literary texts in which the author has significant
                        revision on the page. Here the goal of the editorial process is to
                        understand the thought process of the author through the revision process.

                </p>
                <p>Digital Scholarly Editions (as opposed to editions edited for print) have opened
                    up new modalities for annotation to include, in addition to text, audio, video,
                    images, and data linked from other sources. An example of this is The Walt
                    Whitman Archive (<ptr target="#folsom2017"/>; <ref
                        target="http://whitmanarchive.org/">http://whitmanarchive.org/</ref>) that
                    publishes Whitman’s published work alongside manuscripts (in both image and
                    transcription formats), coupled with commentary, translations, audio recordings,
                    and bibliographic information. In the case of 3D (re)constructions, annotation
                    might include in-world sampling of sound in different sections of a renaissance
                    church based on the position of the user in the virtual world, mechanisms to
                    present alternative structural models according to written evidence and parallel
                    sources, or a video in which a person describes some aspect of the text. We are
                    calling these features annotations because, unlike the testing amongst multiple
                    variables that users can undertake in <q>Research Laboratories</q>, their goal
                    is to explicate as opposed to test. For example, the 3D (re)constructions may
                    offer one version of a building; however, evidence that supports alternative
                    versions of certain architectural features may be represented by other models
                    accessible in-world through a pop-up box or by replacing the current version of
                    a feature with other possible versions; areas of uncertainty may be rendered in
                    different colours and shading to indicate hypotheses, sources, and surviving
                    evidence; or, ambiguous features may be toggled on and off or replaced by
                    alternative versions, also indicating how other elements will be affected by
                    these changes (e.g. a larger door opening may indicate a lighter roof
                    structure). Although such approaches in the creation of digital
                    (re)constructions, especially in archaeological contexts, have been presented
                    since the early years of the application of computer graphics in the field (see
                    for example <ptr target="#roberts1997"/>; <ptr target="#strothotte1999"/>; <ptr
                        target="#eiteljorg2000"/>; <ptr target="#djurcilov2001"/>; <ptr

                        target="#papadopoulos2009"/>), we believe that they haven’t been adequately
                    supported by theoretical and methodological frameworks. In this paper we argue
                    that following the paradigm of digital scholarly editions, the processes and
                    results of digital (re)constructions for heritage datasets can be further
                    informed, thus creating a more robust framework for considering 3D models and
                    modelling as scholarship (also see <ptr target="#schreibman2019"/>). </p>
                <p>Several virtual world projects have followed the paradigm of what we call 3D
                    Scholarly Editions, providing contextual information, including metadata and
                    paradata, in the form of in-world textual and multimedia annotations, and/or
                    supplementary side sources. For example, the Virtual Middletown Living Museum
                    Project (<ref

                    life in Muncie, Indiana in 1920-30s based on the seminal Middletown Studies by
                    Robert and Helen Lynd, includes for the virtual world of the Ball Glass Factory,
                    in-world interactive multimedia annotations to re-enact and inform visitors
                    about the working life in a factory of the period.<note> This project has been
                        built and can be accessed by using the Blue Mars Virtual World Platform

                    temporal, and geographic data, archival material, and multimedia for Soweto
                    under the South African apartheid regimes. Lastly, we should highlight VSim, the
                    only off-the-shelf platform to date that was developed in an attempt to respond
                    to the criticisms about the transparency of 3D modelling as a process and the
                    concerns over the establishment of 3D as an accepted modality of scholarship by
                    embedding annotations and links to sources, crafting narratives, and building
                    arguments within the 3D models <ptr target="#snyder2014"/>
                    <ptr target="#sullivan2017"/>. Some of the features supported in VSim are
                    similar to those we describe for 3D Editions (e.g. textual annotations). </p>
                <p>However, we believe that 3D scholarship could afford more dynamic and interactive
                    annotative features that go beyond conventional textual and multimedia paradigms
                    as outlined above.<note> The authors currently are exploring the affordances of

                    PROJECT</head>
                <p>Contested Memories: The Battle of Mount Street Bridge (BMSB) project began in
                    2013 as part of the Humanities Virtual World Consortium (HVWC) (<ref
                        target="http://virtualworlds.etc.ucla.edu/">
                        http://virtualworlds.etc.ucla.edu/</ref>), funded by the Andrew W. Mellon
                    Foundation. The HVWC planning grant was funded in 2010 at what was arguably the
                    height of academic interest in virtual worlds. Despite the excitement of the
                    affordances of the technology, there was a growing awareness that for virtual
                    worlds to flourish in heritage and academic settings, an alternative platform
                    was necessary that allowed institutions greater control over their assets along
                    with a security of tenure. As can be seen from section two, the final blow to
                    many of the projects constructed in Second Life was the 2012 pricing structure
                    which caused the vast majority of projects to abandon their assets and their
                    lands. </p>
                <p> The HVWC sought to intervene by exploring how online and interactive virtual
                    worlds that provide tools and methods to approach space and time in three
                    dimensions can enable collaborative networked approaches to cultural heritage,
                    transform scholarly communication, evoke sensorial experience, and advance
                    research practices in the humanities. These goals were in line with the
                    definitions of virtual worlds referenced above by Bell, Schroeder, Girvan, and
                    Nevelsteen, with the added ambition of advancing research practice in the
                    humanities to provide a broader palette for researchers to ask and answer
                    research questions in which the phenomenology of time and space could not be
                    addressed using conventional (including more traditional digital) methods. In
                    order to fulfil the aims of the Consortium, four projects were developed that
                    covered a range of disciplines, including ancient and modern history,
                    architecture, archaeology, and Tibetan studies, and a time frame from the Roman
                    period to the early 20th century. The other projects of HVWC included RomeLab,
                    led by Chris Johanson (UCLA); Lhasa, led by David Germano, Kurtis Schaeffer, and
                    Tsering Gyalpo (University of Virginia); and, Hadrian’s Villa, led by Bernard
                    Frischer (University of Indiana and John Fillwalk in the IDIA Lab of Ball State
                    University). At the time, Unity 3D was selected as the platform to host the four
                    virtual worlds. Although Unity 3D is a closed-source game development engine, it
                    supported, contrary to other platforms evaluated in the planning stage of the
                    grant (Second Life and OpenSimulator), highly detailed models and most features
                    found in game engines, including real-time physics, lighting effects, and the
                    ability to modify the Graphic User Interface. Unity would also allow tailoring
                    the front-end to accommodate the four diverse projects and would support
                    networked research and learning. Most of all, using a platform that seemed to
                    emerge as the standard for virtual worlds would allow the partners to focus on
                    scholarly content rather than dealing with technical challenges. </p>

                <head>5. THE BATTLE OF MOUNT STREET BRIDGE: A BRIEF HISTORICAL BACKGROUND</head>
                <p>The Easter Rising of 1916 is considered the single most important event in the
                    fight for Irish independence from Great Britain. It began on Easter Monday, 24th
                    April, with Patrick Pearse, the leader of the Rising, declaring an Irish
                    Republic on the steps of the General Post Office in Dublin's city centre. Within
                    minutes, the British were telegraphed about the insurrection and the following
                    day began mobilising troops who were training in England for the open fields of
                    the Western Front. In less than a week the rebels had been defeated and rounded
                    up. By 12th May, 14 leaders had been executed. Although the Rising might be
                    considered a failure militarily, it set the wheels in motion for Irish
                    independence which was achieved in 1921. </p>
                <p>The Irish (known as the Volunteers) took a number of key locations around Dublin
                    on Monday afternoon, forming, in effect, a perimeter ring around the city
                    centre, blocking the major routes of entry. One of the most important of these
                    locations was to the south where the port of Kingstown (now Dún Laoghaire) is
                    located. The 3rd Battalion of the Irish Volunteers took over Boland’s Mill on
                    Grand Canal Dock on one of the southern routes into the city centre under the
                    command of Éamon De Valera. It was from this location that the command of south
                    inner city was to take place. A small detachment – 14 men – under the command of
                    Lieutenant Michael Malone – occupied four buildings to the west of Boland Mills:
                    25 Northumberland Road, St. Stephen’s Schoolhouse, St. Stephen’s Parochial Hall,
                    and Clanwilliam House in and around Northumberland Road. In effect, this blocked
                    the coast road route to the city centre via Mount Street Bridge. Three
                    additional men under the direct command of de Valera, were stationed on the
                    rooftop of Robert’s Builders yard (<ref target="#figure01">Figure 1</ref>). </p>

                        direction of Dun Laoghaire) and first came under gunfire from 25
                        Northumberland Road.</head>

                </figure>
                <p>On Monday afternoon British authorities began mobilising troops in England to
                    reinforce the forces already in Ireland, many of them in training. On Tuesday
                    evening, two battalions — the 2/7th and 2/8th — popularly known as the Sherwood
                    Foresters sailed on a night boat from Liverpool to Kingstown. On Wednesday
                    morning around 11.00 a.m. 26 April, some 1750 men marched up the coast road
                    towards the city centre. At around 12.30 p.m. the forward company, Company C of
                    the 2/7th met stiff resistance from 25 Northumberland Road where Malone and
                    James Grace opened fire into the oncoming troops as they approached the
                    junction. The first casualties included Captain Frederick Christian Dietrichsen
                    and 2nd Lieutenant William Victor Hawken as they were easily distinguished from
                    the other ranks as only officers carried pistols (regular troops were issued
                    with rifles). </p>
                <p>The battle raged well into the evening, with detachments of British troops making
                    their way North on Northumberland Road, being met with gunfire, first from the
                    four men in Parochial Hall, then shortly afterwards by fire from the eight
                    Volunteers in Clanwilliam House. Other detachments made left and right flanking
                    actions attempting to find alternative routes by which to take Mount Street
                    Bridge. Troops that took the right flank found themselves under fire as they
                    approached the canal from Robert’s Builders Yards, and those that approached
                    from the left were fired upon by the Volunteers in Clanwilliam House (<ref
                        target="#figure02">Figure 2</ref>). Eventually, the sheer numbers of the
                    British troops, coupled with their superior firepower, allowed them to take the
                    occupied buildings: 25 Northumberland Road fell first, with Malone killed and
                    Grace escaping from the back of the house; the men in Parochial Hall ran out of
                    ammo and escaped into the back garden; the British spent significant time in
                    taking the School House, only to find it empty (it had been abandoned by the
                    Volunteers Tuesday as being a poor position); Clanwilliam House was the last of
                    the Volunteer posts to fall following a concerted rush by troops from the 2/8th
                    and 2/7th Sherwood Foresters during which the house caught fire after successive
                    bombing by the British: three of the eight men inside died (see <ptr
                        target="#hughes2017"/> for a more thorough description of the battle). </p>

                <p> Militarily and in terms of casualties inflicted, the battle at Mount Street
                    Bridge was the most successful Irish engagement of the Rising and accounted for
                    a significant proportion of British casualties. And although the Rising has been
                    the subject of a vast and growing historiography, there remained a number of
                    significant questions surrounding this battle. Among the most contested is the
                    extent of the casualties suffered by the British; the rebel casualties are clear
                    – four of the volunteers were killed. Most commonly, historians have cited the
                    figure produced for British casualties provided by General Sir John Maxwell
                    (appointed general officer commanding in chief the forces in Ireland after the
                    outbreak of the Rising) in a report compiled shortly after the event in May
                    1916: 234 casualties. <q>4 officers were killed, 14 wounded, and of Other Ranks
                        216 were killed and wounded</q> (The National Archives, WO 32/9523 Maxwell
                    to French, 25 Apr. 1916). These figures are usually reproduced uncritically but
                    are problematic. For one, they contrast significantly with other British sources
                    produced at the time and afterwards that offer casualty figures ranging from 155
                    to 196 (see <ptr target="#hughes2017"/>). </p>
                <p>Given the potential range of figures, and the almost propagandistic nature of
                    some of the writing on the battle itself, it was felt that this event lent
                    itself to the types of methods outlined in this paper to create a more realistic
                    narrative around the events on Mount Street. Moreover, this battle is of
                    additional interest as it is one of the first that widely documents fighting in
                    a built-up area; thus this research can demonstrate alternative ways for
                    analysing battles using 3D technologies where extensive, albeit contradictory
                    documentary evidence exists. Since at the time, the British Army only received
                    training for field fighting in open environments (such as the one on the Western
                    Front), it is important as an early example of urban warfare in understanding
                    how a small number of strategically placed combatants, even those with a minimum
                    of military training, as the Irish had, were able to engage and hold off a far
                    superior force over the course of the day. </p>

                        </cit>. While chess is an example of an abstract game of strategy, in the
                        late eighteenth century, Johann Christian Ludwig Hellwig developed a more
                        representational war game which incorporated details of the terrain types
                        (with each square representing two-thousand paces across) and reclassified
                        chess pieces into branches of the military. Although Hellwig’s games were
                        used by his contemporaries to fight both imaginary and past battles,
                        ultimately, Hellwig realised that there existed an inverse relationship
                        between introducing increasingly more realistic features into game play in
                        an effort to represent what actually happens on the battlefield and the
                        playability of the game. Hellwig’s insight, the trade-off between realism
                        and playability, is still one of the fundamental challenges of wargame
                        design <ptr target="#peterson2016" loc="4–6"/>. Hence the next generation of
                        war games began to introduce more abstract representations: dispensing with
                        board and chess-like statuettes representing soldiers, replacing them with
                            <quote rend="inline" source="#peterson2016">small, nondescript wooden

                    <p> Concerns of time and space, and the trade-offs herein, still occupy the
                        minds of the designers of war games or simulations created for pleasure, as
                        a means to understand the past, or for training purposes (although these
                        goals are not incompatible). In particular, in the case of representing
                        historical events, there exists a tension between what actually occurred and
                        the impossibility of representing a complex, multidimensional event with
                        hundreds or thousands of actors, each making decisions, the vast majority of
                        them lost to time. Nakamura argues that games that attempt to create
                        simulations of past events can be considered <quote rend="inline"
                            source="#nakamura2016">correct</quote> if they present a <cit>

                        </cit>, embedding a narrative and internal consistency that somebody
                        familiar with the event would recognise. Jettisoning what the designers of
                        the simulation consider extraneous to the narrative is not unlike the
                        choices film directors make when (re)constructing historical events to
                        create a real-time aesthetic. Both film (through narration) and simulations
                        (through interactivity) remediate events and hence the temporal engagement
                        of their viewers/users in the construction of historical time <ptr
                            target="#crogan2011" loc="60–61"/>, albeit through the cultural,
                        political, and social lens of the time in which it was created <ptr
                            target="#antley2016" loc="464"/>.</p>
                    <p>There are, however, crucial differences in utilising virtual world
                        technologies in the construction of war games in which the simulation
                        typically allows outcomes that are inaccurate historically (see <ptr
                            target="#crogan2011" loc="60"/> and following; <ptr
                            target="#nakamura2016"/>, and <ptr target="#mccall2016"/>), and the use
                        of these methods for academic purposes in which a fidelity to historical
                        accuracy is paramount. For example, war games may privilege users’ immersion
                        in the virtual environment over accuracy.<note> There are war games that
                            have invested in both realism and accuracy. For example, the development
                            of the multiplayer first-person shooter game, Verdun (<ref
                                target="https://www.verdungame.com/"
                                >https://www.verdungame.com/</ref>), included historical research to
                            accurately depict weapons, uniforms, and battlefields, as well as bullet
                            physics. </note> They may also lack contextual evidence, again, in the
                        interest of immersivity, although many war games do provide sources from
                        which users make strategic decisions.<note> In the war game, Battlefield 1
                                (<ref target="https://www.battlefield.com/"
                                >https://www.battlefield.com/</ref>), players have to complete
                            certain challenges, called Codex Entries, to unlock information written
                            by military and WWI historians. One of these, refers to <title
                                rend="quotes">Dicta Boelcke</title>, a list of aerial combat
                            techniques for attack procedures and tactics written by the German
                            flying Ace, Oswald Boelcke.</note> Having documentary sources, or
                        annotation, embedded in-world, however, is an inherent feature of 3D
                        Scholarly Editions. Here, the goal is not to have users suspend disbelief
                        through an immersive environment, but to provide a contextualised
                        environment to better understand, and hence draw their own conclusions,
                        about the text, in this case, the created world. </p>
                    <p> Another key difference between modelling worlds for gaming as opposed to
                        academic purposes is what might be typified as an absence of interaction
                        between the user and the virtual world (e.g. the user is not able to shoot),
                        be among simultaneous users, and the fact that the first-person perspective
                        is not avatar-based. In other words, users cannot see their representation
                        in the world. Computer games typically implement either a first-person
                        avatar-based perspective through which players can see part of the avatar’s
                        body, often including hands or a weapon, or a third-person perspective in
                        which the player can see the body of the avatar (for an overview of avatar
                        representation in cultural heritage applications see <ptr

                    <p>Because of the constraints of modelling the complexity of real-world events

                        </cit>. To do this, we employed a wide range of research methods:
                        conventional archival research and meetings with military historians were
                        carried out to document different sources that provide evidence for the
                        buildings that were occupied, participant accounts, and the accuracy of the
                        weapons used. Since period guns were held by our collaborators, we were able
                        to undertake controlled experiments, using shooters of various skill levels,
                        which would have mirrored the situation of the Irish Volunteers. Period
                        photographs and visits to the battlefield, now a peaceful leafy suburban
                        street in Dublin, also enhanced our spatial conception of the event. </p>
                    <p>Due to the difficulties in mapping time in 3D representations, including
                        technological constraints and the ambiguity of the sources, many virtual
                        worlds are either atemporal, thus failing to depict the passing of time and
                        how this affects spaces or events, or condense time, for example, by showing
                        changes that occur over a period (from hours to years or even centuries),
                        into short timeframes. Despite the amount of information gathered for the
                        project from a wide range of contemporary and later sources, not
                        surprisingly, the temporal dimension of the battle was, and remains, the
                        most elusive. Although sources give some indication about the sequence of
                        events (e.g. one house was attacked after another), they are rarely clear
                        about the time that a particular event took place, and indeed, are
                        frequently contradictory. Although the release into the public domain of
                        archival material during the project period, including the Bureau of
                        Military History (<ref target="http://www.bureauofmilitaryhistory.ie/"
                            >http://www.bureauofmilitaryhistory.ie/</ref>) and Military Pension

                        often contradicted (rather than confirmed) the British regimental histories
                        written closer in time to the event<note> Battalion histories for the 2/7th
                            and the 2/8th Battalions of the Sherwood Foresters exist, each with

                        <ptr target="#hoods1921"/>. This is because the surviving testimonies carry
                        biases and distortions, sometimes because of the time lag between the event
                        and the recollection (the witness statements of the Irish volunteers were
                        collected some 30 years after the event), other times due to the nature and
                        purpose of the source itself, for example the British Battalion histories,
                        the main sources for the British accounts. These accounts, written by the
                        Officers of the Battalions (published in 1920 and 1921 for the 2/8th and
                        2/7th respectively) were far more circumspect in providing certain details,
                        which is not surprising given the substantial casualties inflicted on the
                        troops. Therefore, a significant aspect of the research was devoted to
                        evaluating different accounts and problematising their reliability,
                        acknowledging that despite the number of sources collated, a detailed
                        timeline of the battle remains problematic.<note> For a detailed historical

                    <p>The project experimented with a number of representations of the world, from
                        more schematic representations (e.g. omitting features such as textures on
                        the buildings, road features, and natural light, <ref target="#figure03"
                            >Figure 3</ref>) to more detailed models that more closely mirrored the
                        built and natural environment (<ref target="#figure04">Figure 4</ref>).
                        Ultimately, the latter representation was chosen, due in some measure, to a
                        feedback session with a group of military historians fairly early in the
                        development process (see <ref target="#figure03">Figure 3</ref>) in which it
                        was clear that the absence of realism (e.g. buildings, streets, foliage) as
                        well as more schematic representations of soldiers, did not provide enough
                        context for a primary audience of the research to utilise it. </p>

                    <p>Feedback from the group also strengthened our resolve to have users enter the
                        world disembodied. This decision was taken for several reasons. We had
                        previously decided not to allow users adopt one of the personas engaged in
                        the battle (either one of the named people, such as a Volunteer or an
                        unnamed British soldier) because of the historiography of Irish
                        participation in the Great War. We did not want to encourage users to ‘take
                        sides’ by choosing an avatar, hence affiliating oneself with the British or
                        the Irish. While online war games, even those based on real battles, allow
                        hundreds of players making thousands of decisions, these games loosely
                        follow the battle trajectory. On the other hand, our goal in modelling the
                        battle was to better understand the trajectory of the battle and what
                        conditions afforded the Volunteers such an advantage. We had no wish to
                        allow users to ‘relive’ the battle, nor did we want to glorify it. We also
                        did not want additional avatars in the scene for simultaneous users, even if
                        dressed appropriately for the time, as this would have taken away from the
                        historicity of the created world. The goal was not to allow users to play
                        out a specific battle using Real Time Strategy (RTS) techniques or to
                        provide an immersive experience utilising a First Person Shooter (FPS)
                        perspective, but to use the 3D environment as a way to map the documentary
                        sources onto a 3D plane, emphasising the dialectical and the tactical,
                        allowing simultaneous temporal aspects of the battle to be better understood
                        in a way that simple 2D mapping cannot. </p>
                    <p> Contrary to many digital (re)constructions of ancient spaces in which
                        architecture is a fundamental research question that helps understand the
                        relationship between people, artefacts, and movement, the area in which the
                        Battle of Mount Street Bridge took place is more or less the same today as
                        in 1916. Although there are buildings that were destroyed during the course
                        of the battle and replaced by modern office blocks (such as Clanwilliam
                        House and Robert’s Builders Yard) the rest of the buildings and the layout
                        of the streets are virtually the same (the main difference being the trees
                        on the street are 100 years older). </p>

                    <p>Unlike the challenges that many wargame designers have faced in terms of
                        designing large battlefields that need to be compressed into a playing
                        field, the Battle of Mount Street Bridge took place in a constrained
                        environment with the majority of action taking place on one city block
                        (Northumberland Road between the Grand Canal and Haddington Road), with
                        forays down adjoining streets around the backs of buildings (<ref
                            target="#figure02">Figure 2</ref>). Moreover, there exists fairly
                        detailed cross-referenced sources about how the battle was waged spatially,
                        which provided the BMSB team with quite accurate means for the
                        (re)construction. </p>
                    <p> In order to develop the model a laser scan survey was conducted by Discovery
                        Programme Centre for Archaeological Research and Innovation. Northumberland
                        Road, where most of the events took place, was scanned in its entirety
                        producing a highly detailed point cloud. The option of using this detailed
                        point cloud for automatic mesh reconstruction was explored, but the models
                        produced were found to be too noisy and computationally intensive for a
                        real-time visualisation. Therefore, the detailed point cloud was only used
                        as an accurate reference to simplify the modelling of the street from
                        scratch. </p>
                    <p>Constructing the area that was not covered by the point cloud as well as the
                        buildings and structures that are no longer present was achieved by using
                        Google Earth imagery, the 1911 Ordnance Survey map of Dublin, photographs
                        taken after the Rising (particularly of the burnt-out buildings), and site
                        visits. In the case of features that do not exist, perspective and heights
                        in the photographic records and comparison with existing features, such as
                        lamp posts, were used to model these as accurately as possible. On the other
                        hand, for existing structures of the wider area that were not recorded by
                        the laser survey, the PhotoMatch feature in SketchUp was used to generate
                        simple effective textured photogrammetry models from a range of photographs
                        to provide the urban context of battlefield. Finally, for the buildings that
                        had a crucial role in the battle but there is no photographic evidence, such
                        as the Robert’s Builders Yard, schematic models rendered in grey were
                        created from the 1911 Ordnance Survey map. The modelled scene was given
                        texture coordinates to enable the accurate lighting and texture in the Unity
                        Engine. </p>
                    <p>Once the 3D model was completed in 3dsMax, it was exported as an FBX and
                        imported into Unity 3D Version 5.0 as an Asset to enable an in-browser 3D
                        world for users to explore (Figure 5). The real-time interactivity that the
                        platform provides with the free-roaming, user-directed camera contrary to
                        static renderings and predefined animations allows users to explore the
                        space at their own pace without predetermined paths, views, and
                        orientations, thus enabling new discoveries that the modeller or the
                        researchers involved in the decision-making process may not have considered.
                        The camera views in Unity were based on the functionalities developed by the
                        HVWC: Bird’s-eye view (from above); near-field view based on movement with
                        WSAD keys; and third-view in which the camera is orbited using the mouse.
                        Users can also <soCalled>Fly</soCalled> to observe the scene from different
                        heights. </p>

                    <p>The model for the project was developed to be viewed using the Unity Web
                        Player, an NPAPI-based plugin. However, by the end of the first phase of the
                        project in 2016, NPAPI, and consequently the Unity Web Player, was no longer
                        supported by browsers. It was only Firefox that could run BMSB until Spring
                        2017, which also stopped supporting NPAPI later in the year.<note>
                            Alternative web players, such as Gameload &lt;www.gameload.top&gt; can
                            be installed as an extension to Chrome in Windows PCs, thus enabling an
                            in-browser activation of a Unity game. Unity virtual worlds mentioned in
                            Section 1 <title rend="quotes">Historical Virtual Worlds: The Challenges
                                of the State-of-the-Art</title> that were still available online
                            were opened at the time of writing this paper using Gameload; however,
                            due to the instability of the application (often needed to be
                            reinstalled to run properly) navigation features were disabled in many
                            of these.</note> For this reason, the BMSB, similarly to other
                        Unity-based projects, stopped being accessible via a browser. Since the
                        project was committed to providing a publicly-available, online version of
                        our research, the model had to be optimised to run in Unity WebGL, which
                        uses HTML5 technologies and the WebGL rendering API to run Unity content in
                        a browser (<ref target="#figure06">Figure 6</ref>). Due to the geometric and
                        textural complexity of the original models, it was necessary to simplify
                        them and find ways to reduce the complexity of the scene, e.g. by reducing
                        the buildings in the background to geometry <soCalled>instances</soCalled>
                        that have a much lower memory footprint since they only consist of a
                        reference to the original vertices and textures. </p>

                    <p>The version of Contested Memories: The Battle of Mount Street Bridge that we
                        have been writing about here can be classified under the <q>Virtual
                            Museums</q> category since it is comprised of a digital (re)construction
                        of the battlefield with limited contextual information (e.g. buildings,
                        people, and weapons) included in the website that hosted the virtual world
                            (<ref target="https://mountstreet1916.ie/"
                            >https://mountstreet1916.ie/</ref>) and in a sidebar next to the world
                        once launched. However, the project team decided to create bipartite
                        instantiations of the model. </p>
                    <p>Given the issues in hosting the project online due to the deprecation of
                        Unity’s web player, the optimised WebGL online version has now taken on the
                        role of a more traditional abstract, a taster, or a more condensed version
                            (<ref target="#figure06">Figure 6</ref>). This means that the online
                        model could run smoothly on most browsers and on much slower computers
                        contrary to the previous Webplayer version. To provide an overview of the
                        battle, there is also a narrative-driven camera in which a voice over,
                        featuring retired Commandant Billy Campbell, one of the researchers on the
                        project, provides an evidence-informed interpretation of how the battle
                        unfolded, while the camera moves concurrently to the various locations. Due
                        to the limitations of the online model, during the narrative the user cannot
                        interact with the scene. </p>
                    <p>On the other hand, the offline version which utilised the full Unity model is
                        moving towards the paradigm of 3D Scholarly Editions, providing a framework
                        to build a knowledge site, i.e. a single spatio-temporal environment that is
                        immersive and multisensorial that provides the means to: 1) depict ambiguity
                        and make the decision-making process transparent; 2) create annotations that
                        would allow readers to make their own interpretations of the text; and, 3)
                        depict both spatial and temporal aspects of the model. As this is part of a
                        broader effort to develop a 3D edition framework that could be utilised by
                        other Unity-based 3D worlds, the first step in the process was to develop a
                        user-friendly interface that will include generalisable features so other
                        projects can easily use them without the need to develop costly and
                        unsustainable bespoke solutions. The prototype developed for BMSB makes use
                        of clickable hotspots that include annotations for different aspects of the
                        battle (e.g. buildings, volunteers etc.) on a side panel. This can
                        accommodate not only textual information but also multimedia, such as videos
                        recorded during our research in which military experts talk about different
                        aspects of the battle, as well as sound. For example, in one of our visits
                        to the shooting range we recorded the sounds of guns used in the battle.
                        Incorporating these can also work as another cue in developing spatial
                        awareness and understanding the chaos of echoing <ptr target="#dinh1999"/>
                        <ptr target="#schmidt2012"/>, which could have been a critical factor in
                        preventing the British soldiers from determining the exact location of the
                        source of shooting by the Volunteers, especially at the beginning of the
                        battle. Among the features of the 3D Edition is a timeline which indicates
                        the moment an event happened (and/or its duration) also providing relevant
                        annotations on the side panel (<ref target="#figure07">Figure 7</ref>). </p>
                    <p> In order to make the addition and updating of annotations easy to handle
                        without the need of any technical expertise, a mechanism that allowed their
                        creation outside the Unity Game Engine was developed. In the first
                        experiments, an online Google spreadsheet was used, in which each line
                        corresponds to a hotspot which has a unique ID and includes all the
                        information that is pulled in the annotation panel. All multimedia are
                        stored in a separate online folder and get connected to the hotspot based on
                        their unique IDs. In such a way any changes in the annotations can be
                        updated within the annotation panel without any Unity or other technical
                        skills. We are currently reworking the spreadsheet into an annotation
                        management system that makes entering and changing information more user
                        friendly. Since the 3D edition framework is still in development and goes
                        beyond the BMSB project, future iterations will also include ways to present
                        alternative reconstructions with associated annotations as well as ways to
                        show different levels of uncertainty, both of which are critical for 3D
                        worlds based on inconsistent and ambiguous primary sources. </p>
                    <p> The offline version also provided opportunities to experiment with more
                        computationally intensive annotations of the battle. For example, some of
                        the Irish Volunteers described the scene when they saw the seemingly endless
                        formation of British soldiers approaching them. In order to replicate that
                        and due to technical constraints in rendering 1750 realistic soldier
                        representations, we developed a more stylised view by deploying Artificial
                        Intelligence (AI)-driven troop formations, using the Unity plugins Apex
                        Utility AI (<ref

                <p>The 3D world of the Battle of Mount Street Bridge enabled our research team to
                    map our interpretation of documentary evidence and secondary sources on a
                    three-dimensional terrain. Our goal was to stimulate a wider discussion and to
                    enlarge the palette of creative responses to the event which had been long stuck
                    in an Irish vs British, victor vs loser mode, along with hyperbolic and largely
                    unproven claims. Our goal, as with many other research projects in employing
                    these methods, was that introducing 3D modelling would have a transformative
                    impact on sense-making, reasoning, and understanding through the process of
                    problematising sources, identifying variables, and justifying solutions, opening
                    a dialogue to generate new avenues of scholarship unlike the traditional
                    spatiotemporal approaches that had been used in the past. </p>
                <p> The technical challenges encountered by the BMSB project, and also the myriad of
                    projects no longer accessible outlined above, highlight the precariousness of
                    working with these technologies <ptr target="#mcdonough2010"/>
                    <ptr target="#ruan2009"/>
                    <ptr target="#ads2011"/>). The instability of the research environment is a
                    deterrent to more researchers working with such methods, since even when virtual
                    worlds can be ported from one framework to another, this involves significant
                    costs, downsampling and even rebuilding models, and repurposing content that
                    cannot be fully migrated. Not only have we grown accustomed to expecting
                    research outputs being available for hundreds of years in print-based
                    environments, but for text-based digital scholarship, much of which has lasted
                    decades, there exists models for preservation. </p>
                <p> Despite these challenges, in the case of the BMSB project, there was no doubt
                    amongst the project team, that it was only after we had the opportunity to
                    navigate the photorealistic virtual world accompanied by a live narration by our
                    collaborator Retired Commandant Billy Campbell describing the movements of the
                    British soldiers that we managed to create a mental map of how and when the
                    battle unfolded, which in turn affected our perception of the actual
                    battlefield. The 3D world provided us a palette from which to map the battle in
                    four dimensions, with actors moving concurrently in space over time. Early
                    attempts to achieve this (before the 3D models were available) using more
                    conventional methods (eg. spreadsheets and 2D maps) lacked an aspect of this
                    multi-dimensionality, allowing us to only partially reconstruct spatial/temporal
                    aspects of the battle. Moreover, despite having repeatedly walked the
                    battlefield and extensively discussed the sequence and details of the various
                    events, it was our experience of the 3D world with its vantage and viewpoints
                    (whether flying above the world, looking out from a window in which a Volunteer
                    stood, or being on the spot where the fighting broke out, without the
                    distraction of present-day traffic and pedestrians) that provided us with a
                    sense of presence <ptr target="#heeter1992"/>
                    <ptr target="#steuer1992"/> and solidified our understanding of the trajectory
                    of the battle. </p>
                <p> The model was crucial in answering the primary research question with which the
                    project began: e.g. how many British casualties did the British forces suffer at
                    this battle. The model in and of itself did not provide the answer: this was
                    arrived at through exhaustive research into primary and contemporary secondary
                    sources (for more details on this aspect of research see <ptr
                        target="#hughes2017"/>). What the world provided us with, however, was an
                    understanding of <emph>how</emph> this could happen. As stated above, while the
                    figure for casualties (both killed and wounded) most cited is 234, given by
                    General Sir John Maxwell, our research provided us with a more nuanced figure of
                    26 killed and 124 wounded. While this is not an insignificant figure, it is far
                    lower than Maxwell’s more contemporary report, with a more precise number for
                    those killed. Of the wounded, the discovery of a journal at the Bodleian Library
                    of lists of casualties provided us with a more nuanced understanding of the
                    range of reasons men presented with wounds: from wounds to the body to sprained
                    ankles to shock. Typically, only body parts are listed in these reports: throat,
                    hand, thigh, which in many instances we can presume were caused by bullets
                    (throat, thigh); others, such as head, hand, ankle, are not as clear as these
                    may have also been the result of sprains and falls <ptr target="#nathan1916"/>.
                    The very low ratio of wounded to dead may have also been due to the triage by
                    medical personnel who were reported in multiple sources as being on site for the
                    duration of the battle and able to provide immediate medical care (see for
                    example, <ptr target="#hoods1921" loc="288"/>; <ptr target="#oates1920" loc="42"
                    />). Our much lower figure of troops that were killed also maps onto the
                    preparedness of the Volunteers who had reasonable training, albeit not always
                    with live ammo <ptr target="#hughes2017" loc="15"/> coupled with an odd
                    assortment of guns each with limited and not-interoperable ammo. Nevertheless,
                    they were firing into, in military terms, a <q>target rich environment</q> with
                    hundreds of troops within range. </p>
                <p> The model, above all, provided us with a way to map, both temporally and
                    spatially, the unfolding of the battle as the buildings held by the Volunteers
                    were captured or vacated, as well as the complex movements of hundreds of
                    British troops at any given time as various companies made flanking movements,
                    attempting to find alternative routes to approach Mount Street Bridge, not
                    knowing whether or where the Volunteers had occupied other buildings. The
                    photorealistic rendering of the world provided us with clearer evidence than a
                    two-dimensional map did of the terrain of the battlefield: eg., the lack of
                    cover, the obstacles in the way of storming buildings (such as the high rails
                    typically fronting each house). The high casualty figures may also be due to the
                    British troops' lack of experience. They were still in early days of training
                    for the open fields of the Western Front which included no training for warfare
                    in an urban or built-up environment. This dimensionality provided us with a
                    tangible fourth dimension which helped us resolve conflicting information about
                    how the battle unfolded in time. An example of this is the fall of 25
                    Northumberland Road, the first building captured by the British. The 2/7th
                    battalion history claims the unit had taken the building soon after 2.45pm <ptr
                        target="#oates1920" loc="285"/> while the sole survivor, Grace, placed it c.
                    8.30 pm, which is unrealistically late given other events for which we have more
                    precise timings <ptr target="#gracend" loc="9"/>. Given the beginning of the
                    battle around noon, and the accounts of other buildings north of 25 having
                    vacated by early evening, the model provided us with an environment from which
                    we could map and remap our evidence, arriving at a more comprehensive and
                    source-driven picture of the event. </p>
                <p> At the same time, the BMSB project has been used as a test case to explore how
                    to integrate a 3D visualisation as the primary text of a digital scholarly
                    edition, raising issues of how the phenomenology of place and space can be used
                    to design a new language of scholarly editions, one that has the ability to
                    model experience lost because of technological and evidentiary constraints <ptr
                        target="#schreibman2013"/>. This edition, like traditional DSEs, also brings
                    together documentary evidence in the form of apparatus, reimagining digital
                    textuality. We argue that the theories behind digital scholarly editing can be
                    used as a theoretical and representational scaffolding to historical modelling
                    in 3D to provide a framework from which to construct the world as well as for
                    readers to understand the rationale and decision-making that underpins the
                    creation of the world (for a discussion of the framework see <ptr
                        target="#schreibman2019"/>). At the same time, such a framework provides us
                    with the means to valorise and to evaluate 3D visualisation scholarship,
                    utilising similar principles to the ways in which we valorise and evaluate more
                    established scholarly outputs <ptr target="#sullivan2018"/>. </p>
                <p> Despite the constantly evolving landscape in which we do research, 3D
                    (re)constructions provide both modellers and users with an advanced
                    understanding of spatial and temporal dimensions of past environments. Although
                    research is yet inconclusive regarding virtual world features that generate a
                    sense of presence in these environments, e.g. textual annotation, storytelling,
                    sound, visual realism etc. <ptr target="#pujol2019"/>, we believe that by
                    combining two seemingly incompatible paradigms, our work provides a framework
                    for infusing 3D worlds with a hermeneutic richness <ptr target="#champion2015"/>
                    consisting of visual and auditory immersion and dynamic annotative features that
                    will enhance the interactivity of the medium. </p>
