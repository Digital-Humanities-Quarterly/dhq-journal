                     in the Digital Humanities and Object Orientations Everywhere."

               <div class="ptext" id="p1"> The first time that I taught Jamie Skye Bianco’s digital essay "Man and His Tool, Again?" a number of my students, frustrated with the
                  tediousness of having to click each part of the text before moving to the next,
                  simply downloaded the PDF file and read it from beginning to end. Others, unsure of
                  the essay’s operations, clicked through the quotations without ever removing their
                  mouse from the text. Most of the students had only a vague understanding of how
                  their experience was being algorithmically (algorythmically, in Bianco’s terms)
                  constructed. In the discussion that followed, it became clear that we had not all
                  read the same essay. We were differently oriented to the text’s fragmentations, the
                  temporal and spatial arrangement of sentences and quotations, and the computational
                  scripts underlying their delivery. Our embodied reading practices did more than
                  shape our opinions about Bianco’s piece, they were integral to the composition of
                  the argument itself.

               <div class="counter"><a href="#p2">2</a></div>
               <div class="ptext" id="p2"> The orientation of "Man and His Tool, Again?" foregrounds
                  a longstanding observation that texts and technologies are not neutral conduits for
                  meaning, but are actively produced in their readers, viewers, and users. The work
                  uses digital methods to play with text and context, with coherence and
                  fragmentation, and with visibility and invisibility. The HTML version of the project
                  positions the user as an agent in the production of the argument, and, in laying
                  bare the conditions of its operation, confronts her with the contradictions that
                  underlie digital tools. In order to grasp these dynamics, we cannot simply read
                  Bianco’s essay at the level of surface text, but must also grapple with the code
                  beneath it. 
               </div>
               
               <div class="counter"><a href="#p3">3</a></div>
               <div class="ptext" id="p3">On the most basic level, the essay is a summary of findings using one of the most
                  simple and pervasive digital humanities methods: the counting of word frequency in
                  a
                  written corpus. It uses exemplary works to stand in for a field, in this case two
                  edited anthologies of digital humanities scholarship, and counts the reoccurrence
                  of
                  a set of key terms. Bianco finds that there are 700 uses of tool#, approximately ~8
                  per essay, in contrast with approximately ~3.5 uses of rac# (including race, racism,
                  and racial), fem# (feminism, feminist, femme, female, fem, feminine), queer# (queer,
                  queerer), gender# (gender, gendered), and sex# (sexuality, sex, sexual, sexy,
                  sexually) per essay. She also presents a series of observations that focus our
                  attention on the differential emphasis of digital humanities work on tools, compared
                  to race, gender, and sexuality: for example, she observes that 70% of the essays
                  make no mention of rac#, fem#, queer#, gender#, sex# and 70 of these occurrences are
                  in one essay alone. To take a neutral view of word frequency analysis, or to simply
                  read the text in bold on the PDF version of the essay (as many of my students did),
                  one might conclude that the relative frequency of tool# to rac#, fem#, queer#,
                  gender#, and sex# is proof of the marginalization of race, gender, and sexuality in
                  the digital humanities. 
               </div>
               
               <div class="counter"><a href="#p4">4</a></div>
               <div class="ptext" id="p4">The essay, however, does not simply present us with this data, but layers it into
                  an
                  interface that makes visible the problematics of data compilation, interpretation,
                  and presentation. The project is structured such that the analysis of keywords is
                  separated into fragments, ranging in length from a word to a sentence. When the user
                  moves their mouse over one of these fragments, a quotation including tool#, rac#,
                  fem#, queer#, gender#, and sex# from one of the digital humanities collections
                  appears. Clicking on this text causes another quotation to replace it. To reveal the
                  next fragment of the analysis, the user must move their mouse away from the
                  quotation. What results is a juxtaposition of an argumentative thread that analyzes
                  the meaning of key terms with a quotation thread that reveals the contexts in which
                  they were used. Bianco points out that such contexts are essential for understanding
                  the function of any individual word. Indeed, a citation from her own article in the
                  <cite class="title italic">Debates in the Digital Humanities</cite> uses the term
                  tool# to focus critical attention on the ideologies embedded in tool-building:
                  "Tools are also about something other than
                  themselves." In turn, even when rac#, fem#, queer#, gender#, and sex#
                  appear, they might align with existing structures of power. Sexy, for example, is
                  used in the phrase "sexy librarian." The terms feminine and
                  masculine are used to reinstate a binary approach to gender. The structuring of the
                  digital essay asks the user to stitch together the fragments of the argumentative
                  thread, all the while being interrupted by the hidden contexts stripped out of the
                  word frequency analysis.
               </div>
               
               <div class="counter"><a href="#p5">5</a></div>
               <div class="ptext" id="p5">There is a play with visibility here, one that builds on a long history of feminist
                  and queer reading practices. To merely click through the quotations, one would
                  literally fail to see the argument. The piece forces the reader to pause, to move
                  her indexical pointer away from the quotations in order to reveal the feminist
                  analysis. This not only instantiates a particular politics of visibility, in which
                  we must unearth voices hidden beneath, but requires an active and embodied reader
                  to
                  move through the work, clicking each fragment to move the narrative along. This
                  structure draws our attention to the ways in which feminist or queer arguments are
                  not visible in the surface text, but rather in our performance of it. In the PDF
                  version, a read-only text, these kinds of relationalities are written out. Digital
                  technologies in the essay are therefore not merely used to extract data and present
                  it as evidence for an argument about the concerns of the digital humanities, but to
                  undermine the truth-telling status of the data itself, a process that complicates
                  our relationship to the tools that produced it. 
               </div>
               
               <div class="counter"><a href="#p6">6</a></div>
               <div class="ptext" id="p6">To fully understand this intervention, and to critically assess the way that Bianco
                  uses digital technologies, we need to look at the technical construction of the
                  project. To view the scripts that underlie the essay, the user should first view the
                  page source (<a href="#figure01">Figure 1</a>). 
                  <div id="figure01" class="figure">
                     
                     <a href="resources/images/figure01.png" rel="external"><img src="resources/images/figure01.png" alt="" /></a>
                     
                     <div class="caption">
                        <div class="label">Figure 1. </div>To reveal the menu and view the page source on a Mac, CTRL-click on the
                        screen.
                     </div>
                  </div> Compared to many websites, the page source of this essay is relatively
                  legible. The project has been built in such a way that, instead of clicking through
                  many separate webpages to access different parts of the text, everything is
                  contained on a single page, with sentence fragments and quotations revealed and
                  hidden via a hide-show script (<span class="error"><a href="#figure02">Figure 2</a></span>). As a result,
                  almost all of the material, with the exception of the formatting (contained in a
                  separate stylesheet), can be easily accessed. This code could be easily copied and
                  reproduced by other digital humanities scholars. 
                  <div class="figure">
                     
                     <a href="resources/images/figure02.png" rel="external"><img src="resources/images/figure02.png" alt="" /></a>
                     
                     <div class="caption">
                        <div class="label">Figure 2. </div>The hide-show script that governs the operations of “Man and His Tool,
                        Again?”
                     </div>
                  </div> The project’s operations are also relatively simple: there are only two
                  scripts that dictate the majority of its functionality. The first is a basic
                  hide-show script, repeated one hundred and one times: 
                  <div class="example">
                     
                     <div class="ptext">$("#argumentfragment1").click(function(){</div>
                     
                     <div class="ptext">$("#argumentfragment1").hide(); </div>
                     
                     <div class="ptext">$("#argumentfragment2").show();</div>
                     
                     <div class="caption-no-label">
                        <div class="label">example 1. </div>
                     </div>
                  </div> This function determines that when an argument fragment is clicked,
                  it is hidden and a second argument fragment is revealed. This instantiates the play
                  of visibility described above at the level of the code. Each click does not allow
                  us
                  to navigate to a different location, but merely replaces what came before it,
                  showing a new piece of information in the same exact spot on the page. We are not
                  moving anywhere. Moreover, these fragments do not accrete, but are lost as we
                  continue to click through the work. 
               </div>
               
               <div class="counter"><a href="#p7">7</a></div>
               <div class="ptext" id="p7">The second set of functions – "onmouseover" and "onmouseout" – replaces
                  each argument fragment with a quotation when the user moves their mouse over it.
                  Thus, in Figure 3, when the user hovers over the text "Inventories run through algorithms…" the quotation "Databases were recognized as valuable tools quickly; so were graphical
                  applications’ (Eiteljorg 23)" is revealed. When the user removes their
                  mouse from the text ("onmouseout"), "Inventories run
                  through algorithms…" is shown again. Both of these text fragments are
                  referred to as "obj.innerHTML" – they are objects embedded inside the HTML,
                  revealed at select moments in response to user input. 
                  <div id="figure03" class="figure">
                     
                     <a href="resources/images/figure03.png" rel="external"><img src="resources/images/figure03.png" alt="" /></a>
                     
                     <div class="caption">
                        <div class="label">Figure 3. </div>The "onmouseover" and "onmouseout" functions.
                     </div>
                  </div> These functions could have been set up in drastically different ways.
                  Bianco might have written an iterative script, storing all of these fragments in a
                  database located elsewhere. She might have written the code so that sentence
                  fragments were periodically released on all parts of the screen, eventually
                  mirroring the PDF version. Instead, she constructed the program such that each user
                  would have to click through all one hundred and one fragments (requiring embodied
                  labor) and that these fragments would disappear (perhaps signifying the continual
                  erasure of feminist and queer histories). While the text is difficult to navigate,
                  the code remains accessible, and the project refutes the values that are often
                  circulated in the world of programming, such as efficiency and elegance. It does not
                  presume a high level of expertise. By simply copying and pasting this page source,
                  any user could replicate the essay using different content. These choices,
                  instantiated in the code, produce a vastly different set of relationalities between
                  readers and machines than the PDF version of the essay – one that orients us as
                  embodied readers, potential hackers, and participants in the silencing and making
                  visible of feminist narratives.

               <div class="counter"><a href="#p8">8</a></div>
               <div class="ptext" id="p8">If one were simply to review the data produced by Bianco’s word frequency search,
                  it
                  might be tempting to imagine a tool that could reveal privilege, a program that
                  searches a broader digital humanities corpus for keywords rac#, fem#, queer#,
                  gender# and sex#, and gauging their relative frequency, assigns each text a
                  privilege ranking. It is precisely this imaginary that Bianco seeks to disrupt.
                  Towards the end of the essay, she references a well-known quote from Audre Lorde:
                  
                  <div id="figure04" class="figure">
                     <a href="resources/images/figure04.png" rel="external"><img src="resources/images/figure04.png" alt="" /></a>
                     
                     <div class="caption-no-label">
                        <div class="label">Figure 4. </div>
                     </div>
                  </div> Bianco’s essay draws into relief the ways in which the use of digital
                  tools such as word frequency analysis often require the erasure of context and
                  complexity, distilling multi-faceted cultural processes down to modular fragments.
                  If these are the master’s tools, indeed they will never dismantle the broader
                  regimes of classification and containment of racial, gendered, and sexual
                  differences. Yet, at the same time she speculates that if we were to "jettison the 'man and his tool'
                  business" we might be able to produce other kinds of digital technologies
                  and experiences. This essay is one such example. It takes into account the questions
                  of embodied engagement and the differential relationships we have to digital
                  systems. Rather than assume a universal set of values such as transparency and
                  coherence, it plays with visibility and fragmentation at the level of text and code.
