                  <p>The Digital Prosopography of the Roman Republic (DPRR) project has created a
                     freely available structured prosopography of people from the Roman Republic. As
                     a part of this work the materials that were produced by the project have been
                     made available as Linked Open Data (LOD): translated into RDF, and served
                     through an RDF Server. This article explains what it means to present the
                     material as Linked Open Data by means of working, interactive examples. DPRR
                     didn't do some of the work which has been conventionally associated with Linked
                     Open Data. However, by considering the two conceptions of the Semantic Web and
                     Linked Open Data as proposed by Tim Berners-Lee one can see how DPRR's RDF
                     Server fits best into the LOD picture, including how it might serve to
                     facilitate new ways to explore its material. The article gives several examples
                     of ways of exploiting DPRR's RDF dataset, and other similarly structured
                     materials, to enable new research approaches.</p>

               <div class="ptext" id="p1">In a TED conference in 2009 Tim Berners-Lee gave a presentation entitled <cite class="title italic">The Year open data went worldwide</cite>
                  [<a class="ref" href="#bernerslee2010">Berners-Lee 2010</a>]. In it he gave some examples of how open data from
                  “governments, scientists and institutions” could be used to make
                  significant statements about the state of affairs in society. He then asked
                  governments, scientists and institutions to support this kind of work by making more
                  of their data freely available in a form where it could be further processed rather
                  than just looked at. This was a part of what he called the “Linked
                  Data” Initiative, and which has more recently often been called
                  “Linked Open Data” (LOD).</div>

               <div class="ptext" id="p2">Berners-Lee has a scientific background, so perhaps it was not surprising that he
                  didn't seem
                  to think about LOD data from the humanities. Nonetheless, there is no technical
                  reason why those Digital Humanists who have suitable data should not be be making
                  their material openly available too. Indeed, the desirability of
                  Linked Open Data from and for the humanities has been expressed by others in the
                  digital humanities community for some time. One can, for example, see a similar
                  motivation in the premise behind the workshop <cite class="title italic">Linked Data for
                     Digital Humanities</cite> that was held in the 2016 DHOxSS Summer School [<a class="ref" href="#nurmikkofuller2016">Nurmikko-Fuller 2016</a>], James Smith's <cite class="title italic">RDF and

                  Institute, and in other similar workshops that explore the ideas of applying Linked
                  Open Data technologies to humanities-oriented materials.</div>

               <div class="ptext" id="p3">This paper introduces recent project work done at King's College London which makes
                  one of
                  its many online web resources available as Linked Open Data. The project is the recently
                  completed
                  <cite class="title italic">Digital Prosopography of the Roman Republic</cite> (DPRR), and this part of its work was a response
                  to Berners-Lee's TED talk challenge mentioned above in which he asked people to deliver
                  their data as LOD.
                  This paper is also a part of this response. Here we will consider why DPRR was the
                  first humanities project
                  by KCL to have its full set of data published as LOD data, and what in DPRR's characteristics
                  made it particularly suitable
                  for this. The paper will then explore what DPRR's LOD server looks like to a user,
                  what kind of interactions with the
                  data it makes possible, and how this connects with Berners-Lee's view of how LOD should
                  be expressed. Having done
                  this, it will then consider what might come from allowing anyone to get at this historical
                  material directly as
                  pure data rather than exclusively through a browser oriented front end which, as we
                  will see below, acts as
                  a focusing filter between the material-as-data and the user's browser. Does this direct
                  access truly empower people
                  to explore our material in the way Berners-Lee and other people who have taken up
                  the LOD cause intend? Does
                  it allow for new kinds of analysis and research to be carried out, hopefully revealing
                  new insights for the
                  materials that are not visible through even our rather sophisticated browser-oriented
                  front end? Some part
                  of this issue arises out of research about the nature of querying that has been carried
                  out in the context
                  of the Semantic Web, and we will briefly describe this here; contrasting the original
                  AI-related vision of
                  the Semantic Web in the late 1990s, with the more pragmatic Linked Data vision that
                  emerged a few years later.
                  And finally, how does DPRR's RDF server fit with one of the major interests from the
                  Digital Humanities that
                  have come out of LOD thinking: an interest in adding links from digital resources
                  to standard authority lists
                  such as <em class="emph">VIAF</em> [<a class="ref" href="#viaf2010">VIAF 2010-16</a>] or, say, <em class="emph">Pelagios</em> [<a class="ref" href="#pelagios">Pelagios nd</a>]
                  to aid in the aggregation of data between different data sets?</div>

                  <div class="ptext" id="p4">I started work at King's College London (KCL) in 1997, first at its Centre for Computing
                     in the Humanities which was subsequently renamed the Department of Digital Humanities
                     (CCH/DDH). Most recently
                     I have also become associated with at a new unit at KCL called the King's Digital
                     Lab (KDL). During this period
                     CCH, DDH and KDL have built many academic resources in collaboration with humanities
                     academic partners.
                     In all these projects we have championed the concept of openness and accessibility.
                     As a consequence, since
                     the late 1990s we have, as conscious policy, made sophisticated online digital resources
                     available for
                     free over the WWW.</div>

                  <div class="ptext" id="p5">One of the challenges for the work in which I particularly was involved arose
                     out of the fact that almost all my collaborative academic projects took a strong
                     “data” perspective to their materials. This is an
                     approach which can seem very foreign to the text-orientation of much of the
                     humanities and the digital humanities too. Having created a highly structured
                     and complex set of data as a product of the scholarship, how could it be made
                     accessible to the rather non-technical scholarly audience? Out of this issue
                     came much work on how to present this complex data adequately through web
                     applications. Indeed, the development of these delivery apps became a large part of
                     CCH/DDH's standard project practice, and the focus was always (indeed, had to
                     be, due to the intended audience) on making that access as non-technical as
                     possible by creating a web application that mapped each project's data into
                     dynamic web pages that could be displayed by any browser. Thus, although almost
                     all browser-mediated resources created at KCL have been open and freely
                     available, they have not really been conceived as providing direct access to the
                     data <em class="emph">behind</em> the web application in the way that Berners-Lee
                     meant for LOD in his TED talk.</div>

                     opportunity to publish the same material in two different forms. First, like all
                     pre-existing data-oriented resources that we had created, DPRR has its web
                     application that made access possible for nontechnical users. Second, however,
                     and at very little additional development cost, DPRR's data has also been made
                     available as pure data, in a form suitable for LOD.</div>

                  <div class="ptext" id="p7">Why was DPRR the target for this work? From a fully pragmatic perspective, DPRR
                     came to be expressed as LOD because in its AHRC funded research proposal we
                     actually proposed offering direct data access, in the spirit of LOD, as one of
                     the project's outcomes. Furthermore, RDF and related technologies had been in
                     the mix within the <a href="https://ancientwisdoms.ac.uk/" onclick="window.open('https://ancientwisdoms.ac.uk/'); return false" class="ref"><cite class="title italic">Sharing Ancient Wisdoms project</cite></a> (SAWS)
                     project which had been carried out with DDH as a partner, so there was some
                     significant experience of RDF to draw on in previous work. However, we did not do
                     the work of expressing DPRR materials in LOD-compatible ways only because we had
                     promised it in the proposal, or because of our experience with the SAWS project,
                     but because we believed that DPRR connected in particularly useful ways to the
                     three components of the idea of LOD: <em class="emph">openness</em>, <em class="emph">linked</em>,
                     and <em class="emph">data</em>, and we thought it plausible that by opening up DPRR in this
                     way we would allow others to explore more richly what DPRR contains than what our
                     conventional browser-oriented mechanisms, as sophisticated as they are, would
                     enable.</div>

                  <div class="ptext" id="p8">First, <em class="emph">Openness</em>: DPRR is a published prosopography, and we believe
                     that, as such, it offers a highly suitable source for open data. A published
                     prosopography is consciously intended by its creators for a global audience and
                     for this reason it is ideally an open publication and compatible to many of the
                     ideas of open data. This is particularly true for a prosopography which is free
                     to all online, as DPRR is.</div>

                  <div class="ptext" id="p9"><em class="emph">Linked</em>: DPRR is also a good example of scholarship that invokes the
                     essential spirit and principles of linked data. Of course, DPRR hopes that
                     modern Roman Republic scholars will explicitly link to it by referencing the
                     historical entities — presumably primarily historical people — that it
                     defines. If this happens, DPRR will become integrated into the global
                     scholarship around the Roman Republic. However, DPRR has more significance to
                     linking than just this. DPRR, like any prosopography, establishes formal
                     identities for their historical persons out of the appearance of them in a range of
                     sources, and it thus links these sources together through their shared
                     historical people. However, DPRR takes a different approach to its prosopography
                     than the other, factoid-based (defined in [<a class="ref" href="#bradley2017a">Bradley 2017a</a>]), digital
                     prosopographies in which DDH/CCH has been involved. Unlike these other
                     prosopographies, such as <cite class="title italic">the People of Medieval
                        Scotland</cite>

                     [<a class="ref" href="#pase2016">PASE 2016</a>], which draw almost exclusively on their projects'
                     interpretation of their primary sources, DPRR has assembled and aligned work
                     done by a range of already existing nineteenth, twentieth and twenty-first
                     century prosopographies, and could thus be said, in itself, to represent a
                     multi-source “global graph” (to use RDF terminology) of
                     recent Roman Republic prosopographical scholarship. It, and many of the works
                     upon which it draws, has been built on the work of T. Robert Broughton's study of
                     office-holders [<a class="ref" href="#broughton1951">Broughton 1951-2, 1986</a>] which remains to this day a
                     standard reference work. Furthermore, underpinning all these other
                     prosopographies, including Broughton, is the monumental 83 volume nineteenth

                     projects in that it is data-oriented rather than being, as traditional published
                     prosopography has been, article oriented. Like PoMS or PASE, DPRR represents its
                     materials in the form of highly structured data, and, like DDH/CCH's other
                     structured prosopographies, is built on top of that quintessential highly
                     structured paradigm: the relational database. Thus, DPRR's historical research
                     work has been expressed in terms of the semantic concepts of
                     “entities”, “attributes” and
                     “relationships” as they are thought of in the relational

                     presented in the forms apparently meant by Tim Berners-Lee requires taking up
                     technologies developed for LOD. Thus, we followed the thinking of the original
                     developers of the Linked Data (LD) concept, and of the rather broader Semantic
                     Web too, in adapting the Resource Description Framework (RDF) [<a class="ref" href="#rdf2014">RDF 2014</a>] and its related components as fundamental technologies
                     for expressing DPRR as LOD. RDF links have been described as “the glue of the
                     data web”
                     [<a class="ref" href="#bizer2008">Bizer 2008</a>, 1265], and RDF has been given by LD's
                     original thinkers as a key part of Berners-Lee's “four
                     rules” to allow published data to become “part of
                     a single global data space”
                     [<a class="ref" href="#bizeretal2009">Bizer et al 2009</a>, 2]. Furthermore, relational data structures
                     (the paradigm used for organising data in DPRR) generally map particularly well
                     onto RDF. As Berners-Lee remarks about RDF and the Semantic Web: “[O]ne of
                     the main driving forces for the Semantic web has always been the expression,
                     on the Web, of the vast amount of relational database information”
                     [<a class="ref" href="#bernerslee1998">Berners-Lee 1998</a>]. Indeed, exactly because of this thinking within
                     the fundamental design of RDF, the task of mapping DPRR's materials into RDF --
                     turned out to be conceptually relatively straightforward.</div>

                     interface strategies used in other commonly used sites such as Amazon's, and is

                     study of Roman Republic society, because they are expected to know, for example,
                     what a “Praenomen” is) to find things that will interest

                     the pages that the RDF Server can show to us, one can quickly see that the
                     RDF's server's web interface is built under a very different set of assumptions
                     about the kind of user who will be working with it. Indeed, although there is a
                     banner at the top of the screen that identifies it with DPRR, the DPRR RDF
                     server's public interface is not specific to DPRR in the way that the facetted
                     search browser presented earlier is, but represents instead a general kind of
                     interface that could be used with any collection of RDF data on any subject. The
                     web-browser interface for DPRR we looked at a moment ago has been tailored
                     specifically to make front and centre how DPRR's materials are organised and to
                     show under what semantic issues they operate. Here, in contrast, other than that
                     obvious DPRR banner, this RDF server could look virtually the same if it was
                     giving access to an entirely different set of RDF data.</div>

                     work usefully with <em class="emph">any</em> kind of RDF data. Indeed, DPRR's RDF
                     server's browser interface focuses primarily on providing an interface that fits
                     with RDF and related technologies like SPARQL rather than being an interface
                     that is tailored specifically to express DPRR's concepts and materials. For
                     someone to use the RDF server they need to know not only about DPRR's data and
                     how it is represented in RDF, but also how RDF works and (for this particular
                     web page) how to express queries in the SPARQL language that will be able to
                     fetch data for the user's particular needs. We'll see examples of SPARQL being
                     used in this way later in this article. The important point at this moment is
                     that this browser interface says something about its intended audience: to use
                     it one needs to have a solid technical familiarity with RDF and its
                     technologies, and to be capable of exploiting materials presented in this
                     way. This article will look briefly at some of the other parts of its interface that

                     attention to how DPRR's RDF server addresses the basic requirement of Christian
                     Bizer, Tom Heath and Tim Berners-Lee's conception of Linked Open Data as they
                     describe it in their 2009 article that was mentioned earlier: [<a class="ref" href="#bizeretal2009">Bizer et al 2009</a>].</div>

                  <div class="ptext" id="p25">The first point to notice is that the server supports the fundamental principle
                     stated by Berners-Lee and others about open data: that all entities in the data
                     have globally defined URIs for them, and if one gives the URI for any one of
                     these entities to the web as a URL, one gets data back from the server about it.
                     Thus, all of DPRR's data (as we will see shortly, not just DPRR persons) are
                     globally accessible in this way, since all entities in the DPRR dataset are
                     assigned global URIs and can be directly referenced by anyone with web access
                     who wishes to do so.</div>

                     refers to one of the historical persons in the dataset: in this case the famous
                     Roman author Cicero. (A screen shot showing what my browser gives me in response is
                     given in the appendix as <a href="#figure03">Figure 3</a>.) If you give your browser this URI (and if you are reading
                     this article online you can readily do this by simply clicking on the URI-as
                     link showing here) it will find its way to the DPRR RDF server. There, the server
                     will
                     fetch the data about the person identified by this URI (Cicero) and will
                     return to your browser all the data it has about him, delivering it to you through
                     the <em class="emph">rdf4j</em> workbench “wrapper” which presents all
                     these RDF statements wrapped in lightweight HTML so your browser can effectively
                     display them. The tabular part of the display shows the RDF statements that
                     reference DPRR's URI for Cicero. RDF statements have three parts in the order
                     “&lt;subject&gt; &lt;predicate&gt;
                     &lt;object&gt;”. Thus, one of the triples part way down the list in
                     the table can be read “The entity with URI

                     Cognomen 'Cicero'”. Cicero's URI is likely to appear as Subject or Object
                     part of the RDF statements (and is allowed as a Predicate, although because of
                     the way DPRR's RDF works, Cicero's URI does not in fact occur there), and this
                     display shows all the RDF statements that reference Cicero's URI for all three
                     possible types of reference.</div>

                     similar to the RDF URI used to identify Cicero: <a href="http://www.romanrepublic.ac.uk/person/2072/" onclick="window.open('http://www.romanrepublic.ac.uk/person/2072/'); return false" class="ref">http://www.romanrepublic.ac.uk/person/2072/</a>

                     designed to present visually well in a conventional browser for a human reader.
                     Although both the “browser friendly” URL and the RDF-oriented
                     URI for Cicero are based on the same underlying data and return similar results
                     the differences between them are similar
                     to the differences described earlier about the two front pages: Cicero's RDF URI
                     is presented in terms of its RDF representation, whereas his browser-oriented
                     URL immediately presents its material in terms focused on how DPRR data about
                     Cicero is organised in a format which is calculated to be more immediately accessible
                     to

                     RDF statements it holds still wrapped in a little presentation HTML you can in
                     fact ask the RDF server to deliver its result in pure RDF — immediately
                     suitable for further machine processing. There are two ways to do this. One can use
                     the mechanisms recommended in the W3C's specification for RDF servers [<a class="ref" href="#speicheretal2015">Speicher et al 2015</a>]: to ask the server to create the result in
                     a particular RDF format by identifying the type you want with a suitable RDF
                     mime-type (such as “application/rdf+xml”, which
                     requests RDF expressed in XML) in the <em class="emph">HTTP request header</em>. This
                     approach can be relatively readily done if you use the http support in most
                     programming languages such as Python or Java. However, if you are trying to use
                     a web browser to fetch data as simple RDF it is difficult to follow these W3C
                     guidelines and to control the mime-type the browser will specify in the HTTP
                     request it generates for you. So, for browser users who actually want the plain RDF
                     rather than an HTML representation of the RDF this W3C recommended method is
                     difficult to carry out. For this reason, DPRR's RDF server has been extended
                     beyond the W3C specification to support a parameter “format”.
                     Specifying one of the standard mime-types for RDF (or more simply
                     “rdf”) with it will cause the DPRR server to deliver the
                     RDF data directly in the corresponding standard representations of RDF:

                     that is the intent of its design. Furthermore, the DPRR development team
                     worked to combine together data from various related parts of the DPRR

                     links given as URIs in the RDF statements and thus to look at other related

                     Whereas arguably the browser-oriented presentation is easier for a person to
                     interpret, it is not as straightforward to use when the purpose is to gather
                     data from it for further processing. Techniques called “screen
                     scraping” or, more specifically, “web scraping”
                     (see Wikipedia's definition of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_scraping" onclick="window.open('https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_scraping'); return false" class="ref">“web
                        scraping”</a> for a good introduction) have been developed
                     to get data out of human-oriented web pages such as DPRR's reader-oriented
                     presentation — but screen scraping techniques are notoriously unreliable for
                     getting at the underlying data which is presented for human eyes through the web
                     page. In contrast, RDF has straightforward and consistent structures that are
                     easy to process in a programming language such as Python or Java. If your aim is
                     to further process the DPRR materials you fetch, using the RDF formats as the delivery
                     mechanisms from DPRR are most definitely the better bet. Furthermore, as we
                     shall see when we look at the server's query (SPARQL) mechanisms, the data there
                     can also be delivered both in formats not only suitable for further processing
                     in Python or Java, but also in spreadsheet-friendly formats such as

                     is one of the many Post Assertions recorded in DPRR. This particular Post

                     think about what this approach — providing a data-oriented historical site like
                     DPRR as Linked Open Data (in the sense that Tim Berners-Lee conceives of it) —

                     challenges of LOD focus on work that is often described as “enriching the
                     global graph”: making explicit the links between <em class="emph">different</em>
                     internet-accessible data collections. We can see work of this kind in projects

                     spite of the different connection that DPRR has to LOD than the “enriching the global graph” initiatives have, I believe that
                     DPRR's RDF should still be interesting to the humanist LOD community. One needs
                     to start by thinking more about the two different kinds of engagement with LOD

                     2001 <cite class="title italic">Scientific American</cite> article “The Semantic Web”
                     [<a class="ref" href="#bernersleeetal2001">Berners-Lee et al 2001</a>]. Here we see the authors proposing a data
                     and semantically-rich extension to the already existing document-oriented web in
                     a way that would allow ordinary folk without formal training in digital
                     semantics to exploit this semantic richness. The authors give a number of imagined
                     examples of agent-based software that could automatically exploit formal
                     semantic data across different sources. One example (see page 36) tells us of a user
                     who
                     sends her agent software off to make an appointment with a medical specialist for
                     her mom. To do this requires the agent to find specialists that fit with mom's
                     prescribed treatment, then match up the appointment calendars for mom and those
                     specialists. The software agent also needs to take into account other parameters
                     such as distance to the appointment, and the need for physical therapists.
                     Allowing a user's software agent to perform this kind of complex task reliably
                     requires that the material it works with must be highly structured and have
                     appropriate software-accessible semantics formally available so that the
                     software agent can, on its own without human intervention, connect it together
                     correctly and exploit it. In the ideal Semantic Web described by Berners-Lee et
                     al in 2001 a human user would be able to safely delegate this task to their
                     agent software and wouldn't need to worry about the details of how the agent did
                     the job, although if she was interested she could ask the system how it went
                     about carrying out the task and, since the computation would be based on
                     structures that semantically mirror parts of our human understanding of the
                     world, receive an answer that could be understood.</div>

                     quite ambitious. As a consequence there has been work in Computer Science to
                     explore the somewhat simpler task of trying to make semantic web data help
                     ordinary, non-technical users better search for things in which they are
                     interested in the vast global internet-wide data graph. Some of this work
                     involves trying to find ways to enrich google-like searching (which is centred
                     primarily on very sophisticated Natural Language retrieval principles (NLP)
                     applied to the WWW's text-oriented documents) with semantically-structured
                     material expressed in RDF and its associated technologies. When researchers
                     tried to build systems that could jointly exploit RDF-like structured data as well
                     as the text in Web pages they found it
                     to be a real challenge. One of the issues was that independent but semantically
                     related data collections were likely to have differing internal structures and
                     might well use different vocabulary in their formal structure for what were the
                     same or similar concepts: a condition called “Heterogeneous
                     Datasets” by some researchers. A good summary of some of the
                     thinking in this area from a few years ago can be found in [<a class="ref" href="#freitasetal2012">Freitas et al 2012</a>]. It is not quite clearly spelled out in this
                     article, but an important assumption seems to be that the tools that they were
                     interested in would ideally support querying that could be characterised as
                     coming from what I am calling here an “intuitive user”.</div>

                  <div class="ptext" id="p43">Consider Google as an example of an existing service which is also conceived of
                     as serving an “intuitive user”. Most Google users are not
                     familiar with the range of material that the web possesses when they start a
                     Google search, and they phrase their question without knowing the structure or
                     vocabulary applied to materials on the web. In this sense, their querying is
                     intuitive. Similarly, some of the engines that Freitas
                     <em class="emph">et al</em> describe are meant to allow users to ask questions in a
                     natural language without knowing much about the domains the data represents.
                     These engines use a combination of NLP techniques combined with a sophisticated
                     understanding of relevant RDF data with their ontologies that describe them, to
                     provide a better query result than NLP could deliver on its own. The aim is to
                     allow users to come with what are intuitive text-oriented questions and get
                     richer, more trustworthy, results than they would get from the NLP approaches
                     against text-oriented documents alone. There is a good summary of more recent
                     thinking in this area in [<a class="ref" href="#noyetal2019">Noy et al 2019</a>].</div>

                     text as data without needing large amounts of hand crafted formal semantic data
                     at all. Thus, it would seem that if the 2001 Semantic Web vision is ever going
                     to be achieved, the emergence of platforms that have rich, widely available,
                     semantic data expressed in RDF and its associated technologies, combined with AI
                     software of the kind envisioned here that can make use of it, are still

                  <div class="ptext" id="p45">Perhaps as the challenges of implementation of the ideas in the 2001 article
                     became clearer, Berners-Lee began to think about the benefits of having the data
                     without the sophisticated AI-like framework that would be needed to make the
                     more sophisticated ideas of the 2001 article work. This is the situation we find
                     in Berners-Lee's 2010 TED talk that I mentioned earlier. Here, the users of
                     Berners-Lee's global data are not the kind of intuitive user with their natural
                     language query that I have just described; a user which would need to be supported
                     by
                     substantial Artificial Intelligence-like methods hidden from him/her. Instead,
                     Berners-Lee gives examples of people exploiting the power of formally structured
                     data through “mashups” which explicitly join together bits of
                     previously disconnected global data to gain new insights into the material. In
                     one of Berners-Lee's illustrations we see a person joining together data
                     about what streets a new municipal water pumping station served with demographic
                     data about those streets, and then being able to show how this town's new station
                     was
                     disproportionally serving the wealthier parts of the town. This kind of working
                     with disparate data from different sources requires something quite different from
                     its user than the
                     intuitive engagement of the Google-like NLP+Semantic-data approach that Freitas
                     <em class="emph">et al</em> and Noy <em class="emph">et al</em> are exploring. If someone wishes
                     to join up data from different sources like this they cannot be an intuitive user
                     and take an intuitive approach based on only a limited understanding of the data
                     one is querying. Instead, to join them together they need to understand in some
                     detail the semantic structure and significance of their data sources, and know
                     how to formally join them correctly.</div>

                     discovery of the link between the new water plant and the people it served

                     deliberate bringing together of two sources of structured data in a way that no
                     one else had done. To achieve this, the data analyst needed, in some way, to be
                     the opposite of intuitive. Instead, s/he could only create new information when
                     s/he thoroughly understood the semantics of the pieces of data s/he is working

                     with “precise answers” of the kind given by database formal
                     queries in languages like SQL [<a class="ref" href="#freitasetal2012">Freitas et al 2012</a>, 29]. These
                     interactions with data are not like queries that are conceived of as Google-like
                     semi-natural language expressions, where one cannot actually be sure either that the
                     result one gets matches a natural human understanding of the query or that one
                     gets all the material that a human would consider relevant to the question
                     asked. Instead, these crisp structured queries have a kind of processing model that,
                     to the degree that the data being queried can be considered to be an accurate
                     representation of its material (admittedly, an important qualification) and
                     inasmuch as one can express what one is interested in in the formal nature of

                     allows users to write queries against [...] data that follow the RDF
                     specification of the W3C”. It works by allowing the SPARQL query creator
                     to specify a pattern to look for in the RDF graph, and to display parts of the
                     selected bits that match the pattern as results. This certainly is not the place
                     to provide a tutorial on SPARQL, but here is an example of a query in it:</div>

                     thereafter you should receive a response from the Server showing, in a table,

                     could be copied and pasted into that screen and run from there, and would have

                     relevant to the furtherance of the study of the Roman Republic. I can see three
                     possible concerns:</div>

                        <li class="item">Both Berners-Lee's mashup builder and DPRR's SPARQL query engine require a
                           complex set of technical skills that one would think does not match well
                           with the normal skill-set profile of someone interested in DPRR.</li>
                        <li class="item">Whereas Berners-Lees examples draw data from disparate sources and joins
                           them together to make their point, DPRR is, by itself, a single source.
                           Berners-Lees is making the point that the strength of LOD as a new way to
                           look at data arises precisely from the way that it allows sources that have
                           not been brought together before to be joined. What do LOD approaches have
                           to offer for a single source like DPRR?</li>
                        <li class="item">Finally, whereas Berners-Lee's examples use the connecting together of
                           data to make political points, there are likely to be few, if any, political
                           arguments of the kind that Berners-Lee is interested in that could come out

                        learn sufficient technical foundations to be able to engage with
                        data-oriented materials such as DPRR's RDF representation effectively. These

                        bring these humanities-oriented interests and curiosity to bear on their

                        something like DPRR's <em class="emph">timeline</em> example. Indeed, more than one
                        student who has attended these two modules has directly told me that they
                        believe that they came away from these modules with the beginnings of

                        in exactly this way. Although the RDF server has only been available for a
                        few months at the time this article was being written, a researcher working in 
                        an independent
                        research project run by Professor Chris Johanson (UCLA’s Department of Classics)
                        which is entirely external to DPRR reported to me that the
                        RDF data has made an important contribution to their work. The project team
                        was interested in trying to generate visualizations of Rome's Rostra
                        during funerals of important people in the Roman Republic and to show the
                        different types of togas that would be worn by the actors playing the part
                        of the deceased's ancestors. They found the DPRR RDF server useful because
                        they could use their own queries to get information about how different
                        people were related and what offices they had held (and thus, which toga
                        would be used to represent them). To that end the team started from the
                        results of relevant queries to the DPRR RDF server to generate a directed
                        graph (nodes=people, edges=paternal relationships) which they could then
                        traverse to determine the set of togas to depict. As they say in one of the
                        emails they have sent me, they were able to use the server to fetch readily
                        the materials they needed themselves much more directly than they could have
                        done with either the user-friendly DPRR web front end, or, of course, if
                        DPRR data had not been available to them at all. There is more information
                        at [<a class="ref" href="#johansonetal2019">Johanson et al 2019</a>], including specifically the visualisations

                     <div class="ptext" id="p65">Berners-Lee's examples of exploiting Linked Data are often classified as what
                        are called <em class="emph">mashups</em>: the joining together of more than one data
                        source to enable a new representation that any one data source, by itself,
                        could not achieve. Speaking strictly, then, the <em class="emph">timeline</em>
                        example is not a mashup because it draws all its materials from the single
                        DPRR data server. Thus, some might argue that it does not fit well with the
                        assumptions in the LOD movement: that it is in the bringing together of data
                        from <em class="emph">multiple</em> sources that new insights can come. However, it
                        is important to understand that Berners-Lee's examples in his TED talk
                        require multiple different sources of data because each online
                        source is relatively small and structurally straightforward piece of
                        data; the kind of thing that can be comfortably represented in, say, a
                        spreadsheet. This is not the situation, however, with DPRR. DPRR's original
                        relational model already supports quite a rich kind of interaction between
                        many different kinds of objects, and DPRR's set of RDF — which is, after
                        all, simply an expression of DPRR's complex database — has in fact 39
                        different entity types, related together by 30 types of relationship and 53
                        kinds of data properties spread across those 39 entity types. Thus, the DPRR RDF graph
                        is already by itself a complex interconnected graph of data of which only a
                        handful of all the implied relationships between these objects has ever been
                        explored. Thus it is reasonable to expect that queries which can, relatively
                        straightforwardly, draw on the complex interconnections in DPRR's RDF alone
                        can expose connections that have never before been considered. Many more
                        visualisations like the DPRR <em class="emph">timeline</em> demonstration are
                        possible without needing to go outside of DPRR's internal web of data, and
                        some of these might well make new insights possible about the Roman
                        Republic.</div>

                        project PoMS (which is a factoid prosopography and was captured, like DPRR,
                        in highly structured data) suggests that significant new approaches to
                        historical materials, when available as complex structured data and explored
                        from new perspectives, are both possible and reveal significant potential
                        for new insights. Starting several years ago, thanks to a grant from the
                        Leverhulme Trust, the data <em class="emph">behind</em> PoMS's public website has
                        been used as a base for historical Social Network Analysis (SNA)
                        experiments. This SNA analysis work on PoMS has been initially extensively
                        reported on in [<a class="ref" href="#hammondandjackson2017">Hammond and Jackson 2017</a>] which is an e-book of
                        over 500 pages. As it is pointed out in the preface for this book, all the
                        SNA analysis was enabled by PoMS's data-oriented interpretation of its
                        sources and came from the relationships recorded directly and indirectly in
                        the PoMS database. The data needed for the SNA work was explicitly provided
                        by the database, and yet could not have been carried out with either PoMS's
                        public web interface or with google-like intuitive queries that might have
                        selected PoMS materials. To perform it effectively required access to the
                        information behind PoMS's public interface. Since PoMS's data was organised
                        in a relational database, the process that was used to fetch data for SNA
                        analysis used queries expressed in the relational database's standard query
                        language SQL [<a class="ref" href="#sql2018">SQL 2018</a>] that were quite different from those
                        SQL queries used behind the scenes to drive PoMS's public interface with its particular

                        that were quite different from what one could achieve through its public
                        interface. Although the work was still in its early days when the Leverhulme
                        grant was over, the team was even then beginning to see that this novel SNA
                        perspective was pointing the way to possible new insights into Medieval
                        Scottish society. As a result, work has continued exploring this SNA

                        leading of a number of workshops and demonstrations to the growing Digital

                        analysis of PoMS was done in the formal language of SQL rather than with LOD
                        technologies, this technical work was quite similar to what RDF, SPAQRL, and
                        related technologies would have enabled. If PoMS data had been available as
                        RDF through a PoMS RDF Server this same work could have been carried out by
                        anyone with internet access using Semantic Web technologies such as SPARQL.
                        Furthermore, although one of the members of the SNA team, Dr Matthew Hammond,
                        is trained as a historian, rather than as a computer scientist, he was able
                        to master the formal language SQL well enough to, on his own, get the data
                        in the forms that he could use for his SNA work. If PoMS data had been made
                        available through an RDF Server like DPRR's, he could certainly have done
                        the same work in SPARQL instead.</div>

                  <div class="ptext" id="p70">As this article has shown, DPRR is a complex and interconnected collection of RDF
                     statements which both (i) forms, within itself, a complex and disciplined graph
                     of information and (ii) thus offers many possible routes for exploration.
                     However, other than the standard references to RDF vocabularies such as RDFS and
                     OWL, DPRR's RDF does not point out of itself into materials created and held
                     elsewhere. Since the linking together of data across the entire
                     “global” rather than DPRR's “local
                     graph” is part of the vision of linked data, one needs to also think
                     about what needs to be done within DPRR to bring it more into alignment
                     with this aspect of the global graph vision.</div>

                  <div class="ptext" id="p71">As mentioned earlier, most of those people in the digital humanities who are
                     currently working on the challenges of LOD are interested in what is often
                     described as “enriching the global graph” — making explicit the links
                     between <em class="emph">different</em> internet-accessible data collections. This work
                     has sometimes been categorised as “aggregation”, and is often
                     done by making a block of “SameAs” assertions using the
                     <span class="monospace">owl:sameAs</span> predicate or something like it. For instance, [<a class="ref" href="#viaf2010">VIAF 2010-16</a>] describes itself as the “Virtual International
                     Authority File”. It is a resource maintained by OCLC as a service to
                     libraries which aims to “lower the cost and increase the utility of library
                     authority files by matching and linking widely-used authority files and
                     making that information available on the Web”. Thus, VIAF has the URI
                     <a href="https://viaf.org/viaf/78769600/" onclick="window.open('https://viaf.org/viaf/78769600/'); return false" class="ref">https://viaf.org/viaf/78769600/</a> for Cicero and when it is invoked one
                     gets a web page that shows how major world libraries have identified him. Thus,
                     this VIAF URI can be considered as VIAF's identifier for the historical person
                     Cicero. One can then make an <span class="monospace">owl:sameAs</span> assertion via an RDF triple
                     that asserts that the person associated with DPRR's URI (<a href="http://romanrepublic.ac.uk/rdf/entity/Person/2072" onclick="window.open('http://romanrepublic.ac.uk/rdf/entity/Person/2072'); return false" class="ref">http://romanrepublic.ac.uk/rdf/entity/Person/2072</a>) for Cicero is the
                     same person as the person VIAF identifies with their URI. This kind of work,
                     when done with as many of DPRR's persons as VIAF has also identified, is
                     arguably the first step in aligning DPRR's data with the larger digital world of
                     data, at least as it exists in the context of libraries. Similar work could be
                     done with world wide resources such as, say, WorldCat [<a class="ref" href="#worldcat">WorldCat nd</a>].</div>

                     to show how they connect to each other seems to be obviously a good idea that
                     enriches the interlinking in global data, especially if one of the links is to a
                     recognised authority, such as VIAF. Of course, DPRR is a published
                     prosopography. The identification of people is the point of the work it
                     represents, and hence DPRR has some reason to claim to be an authority for Roman
                     Republic persons in its own right. Perhaps, then, in the same way as in the past
                     many different independent researchers working on the Roman Republic often
                     used Pauly's RE as an authority and identified people using the person identity
                     scheme used in it, people in the future could use DPRR's URIs to identify which
                     historical Roman person they were referring to.</div>

                  <div class="ptext" id="p73">Much of the work done in the DH that involves linking to authorities like VIAF
                     has been carried out in the context of identifying people who appear in texts — 
                     as a reference from a spot in a digital edition of a text, say, or perhaps from
                     a reference in a piece of research being written up as an article or a monograph
                     — and is undertaken in the context of textual markup. This linking of a spot in
                     a text to an authority such as VIAF (or DPRR itself) is a useful enriching
                     process. However, the benefits are perhaps obviously greater when the links are
                     not from a <em class="emph">text</em> (even one marked up using TEI) to RDF data such as
                     DPRR, but between separate datasets both of which can both be queried by SPARQL,
                     since SPAQRL's Federated Query mechanisms [<a class="ref" href="#seaborneetal2013">Seaborne et al 2013</a>]
                     allows a single query to span across more than one dataset. If, for example, a
                     dataset (let us call it “A” here) outside of DPRR had kinds
                     of information that does not appear in DPRR about Roman persons, and if both
                     DPRR and “A”'s dataset's associated persons could be
                     connected through references to common VIAF URIs, it would be possible to query
                     data that crossed both DPRR and “A”, taking advantage of the
                     data strengths of each of them.</div>

                  <div class="ptext" id="p74">In some ways this linking work fits with the spirit of what DPRR was already
                     doing: bringing together hitherto separate Roman Republic prosopographies;
                     although DPRR's work was based more on establishing collections between what had
                     been separate primarily <em class="emph">print</em> prosopographies. However, although
                     DPRR did indeed assemble materials from these various prominent, independently
                     produced, specialist prosopographies into a single large collection they were
                     not able to take up the further task of linking their people to a world-wide
                     resource such as VIAF. There simply was not the time and funds available. As it
                     turns out, this may be the place for a <em class="emph">third</em> kind of person to engage in DPRR's
                     LoD data: someone who might be called an “aggregator”. This third kind of user
                     arises from the fact that it is in the nature of LOD that, now that DPRR data is
                     open and freely available through DPRR's RDF server, someone <em class="emph">else</em>
                     with an interest in historical people from the Roman Republic that appear in
                     VIAF or WorldCat can choose to create RDF triples independently of DPRR's
                     research team that assert the connections between the people identified in these
                     resources, and those identified through DPRR's person URIs and then make their
                     collection of “sameAs” RDF triples that assert the connections available over
                     the web. Indeed, by hosting these triples that connect DPRR entities to VIAF or
                     WorldCat outside of DPRR itself one avoids the possible confusion by users of
                     who did what: it will be clear that the links between DPRR and VIAF or WorldCat
                     were done as a separate project outside of DPRR. In fact, this is one of the
                     benefits of the conception of LOD as data distributed worldwide when it is based
                     on the RDF technologies.</div>

                  <div class="ptext" id="p75">So far in this section we have focused on DPRR's historic persons as the centre
                     of a linking initiative, and DPRR is, after all, a prosopography, and thus
                     exploiting the URIs for its people through links seem like the most obvious
                     thing to do. However, in the RDF context all of DPRR's data is open and globably
                     available. Thus, there are URIs in DPRR that represent things other than
                     persons, and linking these other non-person objects in DPRR to authorities
                     elsewhere could also be useful to do. For example, DPRR has what the Romans
                     called <em class="emph">provinces</em> as entities associated with offices. Not all the
                     Roman provinces were geographically based, but many of them were. Thus, perhaps
                     a sameAs link could be establised between these geographically based provices
                     identified in DPRR and those same geographic provinces as they are identified in
                     geographic authority sites such as <cite class="title italic">Pelagios</cite>
                     [<a class="ref" href="#pelagios">Pelagios nd</a>]. Then, if other RDF sites also used Pelagios URI
                     identifiers in their data, these Pelagios URIs could be used as linking
                     mechanisms to allow these two datasets to be joined together in a federated
                     SPARQL query. If, for example, there was a set of RDF data that associated
                     climate conditions with Pelagios places, federated queries could be used to
                     explore if there was any evidence that climate had any effect on who got postings
                     associated with these provinces.</div>

                     also seen that the DPRR RDF Server's more dynamic approach to direct data access
                     also has the potential to fit with this part of their vision. Rather than being

                     already have an important role to play to further new humanities research in
                     their own right. As a consequence, perhaps, like DPRR, research data for other
                     of these web resources might well also deserve to be set free for those in the
                     humanities who are equipped to take advantage of them.</div>

                  <div class="ptext" id="p79">DPRR, like all similar DH projects in which I have been involved, involves a range
                     of organisations and people.  There are, thus, several organisations and people to
                     acknowledge here.  First, one must thank the UK's Art's and Humanities Research Council,
                     who funded the academic and technical work involved in the creation of the DPRR data
                     and website. Second, I would like to thank the academic colleagues in the DPRR project
                     with whom we worked for several years to create the data. Third, I must thank my colleagues
                     at King's Digital Lab group (KDL), who have made it possible for the RDF Server described
                     here to be publicly hosted on their servers. And finally, I should thank colleagues
                     at DHQ who not only provided their stellar editorial support for this article, but
                     agreed to extend their technical infrastructure to allow this article's unusual integrated
                     interactive components to be accommodated by their digital publishing system.
