                <!-- Include a brief abstract of the article -->
                <p>The Digital Prosopography of the Roman Republic (DPRR) project has created a
                    freely available structured prosopography of people from the Roman Republic. As
                    a part of this work, the materials that were produced by the project have been
                    made available as Linked Open Data (LOD): translated into RDF, and served
                    through an RDF Server. This article explains what it means to present the
                    material as Linked Open Data by means of working, interactive examples. DPRR
                    didn't do some of the work which has been conventionally associated with Linked
                    Open Data. However, By considering the two conceptions of the Semantic Web and
                    Linked Open Data as proposed by Tim Berners-Lee one can see how DPRR's RDF
                    Server fits best into the LOD picture, including how it might serve to
                    facilitate new ways to explore its material. The article gives several examples
                    of ways of exploiting DPRR's RDF dataset, and other similarly structured
                    materials, to enable new research approaches.</p>

            <head/>
            <p>In a TED conference in 2009 Tim Berners-Lee gave a presentation entitled <title rend="italic">The Year open data went worldwide</title>
                <ptr target="#bernerslee2010"/>. In it he gave some examples of how open data from
                    <q>governments, scientists and institutions</q> could be used to make
                significant statements about the state of affairs in society. He then asked
                governments, scientists and institutions to support this kind of work by making more
                of their data freely available in a form where it could be further processed rather
                than just looked at. This was a part of what he called the <soCalled>Linked
                    Data</soCalled> Initiative, and which has more recently often been called
                    <soCalled>Linked Open Data</soCalled> (LOD).</p>

            <p>Perhaps, given his scientific background, it was not surprising that he didn't seem
                to think about LOD data from the humanities. Nonetheless, there is no technical
                reason why those Digital Humanists who have suitable data should not be be making
                their material openly available too, and indeed, this idea of the desirability of
                Linked Open Data from and for the humanities has been expressed by others in the
                digital humanities community for some time. One can, for example, see a similar
                motivation in the premise behind the workshop <title rend="italic">Linked Data for
                    Digital Humanities</title> that was held in the 2016 DHOxSS Summer School <ptr target="#nurmikkofuller2016"/>, James Smith's <title rend="italic">RDF and
                    Linked Open Data</title>
                <ptr target="#smith2017"/> at University of Victoria's Digital Humanities Summer
                Institute, and in other similar workshops that explore the ideas of applying Linked
                Open Data technologies to humanities-oriented materials.</p>

            <p>This paper introduces recent project work done at King's College London to make one
                of its many online web resources available as Linked Open Data. The project is the
                recently completed <title rend="italic">Digital Prosopography of the Roman
                    Republic</title> (DPRR). The work done to deliver DPRR as linked open data is,
                in various ways, a response to Berners-Lee's challenge to people with relevent
                materials deliver it as LOD, and this paper can also be viewed as a part of this
                response. Thus, in this paper we will consider why DPRR was the first humanities
                project to be expressed by KCL as LOD data, and what in its characteristics made it
                particularly suitable. This having been done, the paper will explore what DPRR's LOD
                server looks like to a user, and what kind of interactions with the data it makes
                possible. This connects with Berners-Lee's view of technically how LOD should be
                expressed. Having done this, it will then consider what might come from allowing
                others to get at this historical material directly as pure data rather than
                exclusively through a browser oriented front end which, as we will see below, acts
                as a filter between the material-as-data and the user's browser. Does this kind of
                direct data access truly empower people to explore our material in the way
                Berners-Lee in his 2009 TED talk and other people who have taken up the LOD cause
                intend? Does it allow for new kinds of analysis and research to be carried out,
                hopefully revealing new insights from the materials that are not visible through
                even our rather sophisticated browser-oriented front end? This part, then, responds
                to that aspect of Berners-Lee's 2009 TED presentation which presents examples of
                interesting outcomes that arise from the availabilitiy of LOD. Some part of this
                issue comes out of some thinking about the nature of querying which have arisen as a
                result of research connected to the Semantic Web, and we will briefly describe this
                here; contrasting the AI-related vision of the Semantic Web in the late 1990s, with
                the more pragmatic Linked Data vision that emerged a few years later. And finally,
                how does DPRR's RDF server fit with one of the major interests from the Digital
                Humanities that have come out of LOD thinking: an interest in adding links from it
                to standard authority lists such as <emph>VIAF</emph>
                <ptr target="#viaf2010"/> or, say, <emph>Pelagios</emph>
                <ptr target="#pelagios"/> to aid in the aggregation of data between different data
                sets?</p>
            <div>
                <head>Why have DPRR as Linked Open Data?</head>
                <p>Throughout my time at King's College London (KCL), starting in 1997, first at its
                    Centre for Computing in the Humanities (subsequently renamed the Department of
                    Digital Humanities (CCH/DDH)) and now more recently at a new unit at KCL called
                    the King's Digital Lab (KDL), we have built many academic resources in
                    collaboration with humanities academic partners. In all these projects we have
                    championed the concept of openness and accessibility. As a consequence, as
                    conscious policy we have made sophisticated online digital resources available
                    for free over the WWW since the late 1990s.</p>

                <p>One of the challenges for the work in which I was particularly involved arose
                    from the fact that almost all my collaborative academic projects took a strong
                        <soCalled>data</soCalled> perspective to their materials. This is an
                    approach which can seem very foreign to the text-orientation of much of the
                    humanities and the digital humanities too. Having created a highly structured
                    and complex set of data as a product of the scholarship, how could it be made
                    accessible to the rather non-technical scholarly audience? Out of this issue
                    came much work on how to present this complex data adequately through web
                    applications. Indeed, the development of these apps became a large part of
                    CCH/DDH's standard project practice, and the focus was always (indeed, had to
                    be, due to the intended audience) on making that access as non-technical as
                    possible by creating a web application that mapped each project's data into
                    dynamic web pages that could be displayed by any browser. Thus, although almost
                    all browser-mediated resources created at KCL have been open and freely
                    available, they have not really been conceived as providing direct access to the
                    materials <emph>behind</emph> the web application in the way that Berners-Lee
                    meant for LOD in his TED talk.</p>

                <p>Recently, however, the <title rend="italic">Digital Prosopography of the Roman
                        Republic</title>
                    <ptr target="#mouritsenetal2017"/> was completed, and it presented us with an
                    opportunity to publish the same material in two different forms. First, like all
                    pre-existing data-oriented resources that we had created, DPRR has its web
                    application that made access possible for nontechnical users. Second, however,
                    and at very little additional development cost, DPRR's data has also been made
                    available as pure data, in a form suitable for LOD.</p>

                <p>Why was DPRR the target for this work? From a fully pragmatic perspective, DPRR
                    came to be expressed as LOD because in its AHRC funded research proposal we
                    actually proposed offering direct data access, in the spirit of LOD, as one of
                    the project's outcomes. Furthermore, RDF and related technologies had been in
                    the mix within the <ref target="https://ancientwisdoms.ac.uk/"><title rend="italic">Sharing Ancient Wisdoms project</title></ref> (SAWS)
                    project which had been carried out with DDH as a partner, so there was some
                    limited experience of RDF to draw on in previous work. However, we did not do
                    the work of expressing DPRR materials in LOD-compatible ways only because we had
                    promised it in the proposal, or because of our experience with the SAWS project,
                    but because we believed that DPRR connected in particularly useful ways to the
                    three components of the idea of LOD: <emph>openness</emph>, <emph>linked</emph>,
                    and <emph>data</emph>, and we thought it plausible that opening up DPRR in this
                    way would allow others to explore more richly what DPRR contains than what our
                    conventional browser-oriented mechanisms, as sophisticated as they are, would
                    enable.</p>

                <p>First, <emph>Openness</emph>: DPRR is a published prosopography, and we believe
                    that, as such, it offers a highly suitable source for open data. A published
                    prosopography is consciously intended by its creators for a global audience and
                    for this reason it is ideally an open publication and compatible to many of the
                    ideas of open data. This is particularly true for a prosopography which is free
                    to all online, as DPRR is.</p>

                <p><emph>Linked</emph>: DPRR is also a good example of scholarship that invokes the
                    essential spirit and principles of linked data. Of course, DPRR hopes that
                    modern Roman Republic scholars will explicitly link to it by referencing the
                    historical entities -- presumably primarily historical people -- that it
                    defines. If this happens, DPRR will become integrated into the global
                    scholarship around the Roman Republic. However, DPRR has more significance to
                    linking than just this. DPRR, like any prosopography, establishes formal
                    identities for their historical persons out of references to them in a range of
                    sources, and it thus links these sources together through their shared
                    historical people. However, DPRR takes a different approach to its prosopography
                    than the other, factoid-based (defined in Bradley 2017a), digital
                    prosopographies in which DDH/CCH has been involved. Unlike these other
                    prosopographies, such as <title rend="italic">the People of Medieval
                        Scotland</title>
                    <ptr target="#poms2014"/>, or <title rend="italic">Prosopography of Anglo-Saxon
                        England</title>
                    <ptr target="#pase2016"/>, which draw almost exclusively on their projects'
                    interpretation of their primary sources, DPRR has assembled and aligned work
                    done by a range of already existing nineteenth, twentieth and twenty-first
                    century prosopographies, and could thus be said, in itself, to represent a
                    multi-source <soCalled>global graph</soCalled> (to use RDF terminology) of
                    recent Roman Republic prosopographical scholarship. It, and many of the works
                    upon which it draws, build on the work of T. Robert Broughton's study of
                    office-holders <ptr target="#broughton1951"/> which remains to this day a
                    standard reference work. Furthermore, underpinning all these other
                    prosopographies, including Broughton, is the monumental 83 volume nineteenth
                    century <title rend="italic">Real-Encyclopaedie der classischen

                    <ptr target="#pauly1893"/> -- referred to as RE and once called by a DPRR
                    project member the "grandfather" of all DPRR's prosopographical
                    sources. RE continues to provide the basis against which historical identity of
                    individuals is argued even today. A full list of sources that provided data for
                    DPRR can be found on their Bibiography page. <ptr target="#mouritsenetal2017"/>
                    at web page <ref target="http://www.romanrepublic.ac.uk/bibliography/">Bibliography</ref>.</p>

                <p><emph>Data</emph>: Finally, DPRR is like DDH/CCH's many other prosopographical
                    projects in that it is data-oriented rather than being, as traditional published
                    prosopography has been, article oriented. Like PoMS or PASE, DPRR represents its
                    materials in the form of highly structured data, and, like DDH/CCH's other
                    structured prosopographies, is built on top of that quintessential highly
                    structured paradigm: the relational database. Thus, DPRR's historical research
                    work has been expressed in terms of the semantic concepts of
                        <soCalled>entities</soCalled>, <soCalled>attributes</soCalled> and
                        <soCalled>relationships</soCalled> as they are thought of in the relational
                    data model.</p>

                <p>Overall, then, DPRR can be thought of as an ideal candidate for all three aspects
                    in the LOD model: linked, open, and data oriented.</p>

                <p>To take DPRR's materials in its relational database and to turn it into LOD
                    presented in the forms apparently meant by Tim Berners-Lee requires taking up
                    technologies developed for LOD. Thus, we followed the thinking of the original
                    developers of the Linked Data (LD) concept, and of the rather broader Semantic
                    Web too, in adapting the Resource Description Framework (RDF) <ptr target="#rdf2014"/> and its related components as fundamental technologies
                    for expressing DPRR as LOD. RDF links have been described as <q>the glue of the
                        data web</q>
                    <ptr target="#bizeretal2009" loc="1265"/>, and RDF has been given by LD's
                    original thinkers as a key part of Berners-Lee's <quote rend="inline">four
                        rules</quote> to allow published data to become <quote rend="inline">part of
                        a single global data space</quote>
                    <ptr target="#bizeretal2009" loc="2"/>. Furthermore, relational data structures
                    (the paradigm used for organising data in DPRR) generally map particularly well
                    on to RDF. As Berners-Lee remarks about RDF and the Semantic Web: <q>[O]ne of
                        the main driving forces for the Semantic web has always been the expression,
                        on the Web, of the vast amount of relational database information</q>
                    <ptr target="#bernerslee2008"/>. Indeed, exactly because of this thinking within
                    the fundamental design of RDF, the task of mapping DPRR's materials into RDF --
                    a major technical component of LOD, turned out to be conceptually relatively
                    straightforward.</p>

                <p>In the online descriptive material I have provided about the DPRR server <ptr target="#bradley2017a"/>, I describe how I used the <emph>d2rq</emph> tool
                        <ptr target="#d2rqnd"/> to map DPRR's database structures into RDF, how I
                    created a basic semantic web ontology to supplement the DPRR data, and how I
                    created an RDF server as a mostly stripped down, but in a couple of areas
                    somewhat extended, version of the <emph>rdf4j</emph>
                    <ptr target="#rdf2014"/> workbench. I based much of the RDF server on rdfj4's
                    workbench because I believed that it produced quite an elegant thin HTML-based
                    wrapping around the RDF data that allowed a browser user to explore and better
                    understand the data with a web browser without having its HTML wrapping mask or
                    hide the nature of the RDF. The server's functions are documented at <ptr target="#bradley2017b"/> on web page <ref target="http://romanrepublic.ac.uk/rdf/doc/using.html">Using DPRR's RDF
                        server</ref>.</p>

                <head>Exploring DPRR's RDF Server</head>
                <p>Where on the WWW, then, does one find DPRR's LOD data representation? One must
                    engage with the RDF server we have created for DPRR, and it can be found at <ref target="http://romanrepublic.ac.uk/rdf/">http://romanrepublic.ac.uk/rdf/</ref>. All URIs and URLs that start in this
                    way are delivered to DPRR's RDF server.</p>

                <p>We have built the server to provide support for what we believed to be the main
                    characteristics of RDF-oriented Linked Open Data. What are these
                    characteristics?</p>

                <list>
                    <item>The server meets the Linked Data requirements outlined in <ptr target="#bizeretal2009"/>. In particular, it is designed so that, first,
                        all of DPRR's data are given public URIs (although DPRR is a prosopography,
                        not just historical Persons are formally identified with URIs), and second
                        that if any of these URIs is given to the WWW, they will find their way to
                        DPRR's RDF server, which will deliver data representing what it has about
                        this entity.</item>

                    <item>Furthermore, the server supports querying via RDF's standard query
                        language SPARQL (see SPARQL 2013).</item>

                    <item>Materials can be fetched as pure RDF data, suitable for further
                        processing, or filtered as RDF through a light-weight browser oriented
                        viewer to facilitate human browsing of the data.</item>

                    <item>The interconnections between the different entity types that makes up the
                        DPRR data is made evident through the provision of a basic OWL
                        ontology.</item>
                </list>

                <p>The attentive reader may have noticed that I claim here the RDF server is capable
                    of delivering the DPRR RDF data in a browser-friendly manner, and may have
                    remembered that DPRR's <emph>other</emph>, more conventional, browser-friendly
                    interface <emph>also</emph> delivers DPRR data in a browser-friendly manner.
                    What, then, is the difference between the two?</p>

                <p>When one first accesses the DPRR RDF server one can notice immediately the
                    differences between how it looks and engages with the user compared to DPRR's
                    non-RDF based web browser-oriented search engine which, although it interacts
                    with the same data, presents quite a different face to its user. As a point of
                    comparison, <ref target="#figure1">Figure 1</ref> shows the top of the front
                        <title rend="quotes">Person Search</title> page of DPRR's conventional
                    browser-oriented site:</p>

                <figure xml:id="figure01">
                    <head>DPRR's bowser-oriented site: the Person Search</head>
                    <graphic url="resources/images/figure01.png"/>
                </figure>

                <p>This figure shows what someone sees if they enter <title rend="quotes">Cicero</title> as the Cognomen for a person. We can see there that there
                    are 9 records (persons) who have <emph>Cicero</emph> as their cognomen (and they
                    are actually listed on the page, but below the displayed area in this figure).
                    If one focuses for a moment on the form area in the bottom half of the figure,
                    one sees a good number of labelled boxes that can be filled in to filter the
                    selection of persons. Note that the boxes and their labels immediately tell the
                    user what kind of data the DPRR dataset holds that can be used for filtering
                    (there are more filtering items off the bottom of this screen shot that are also
                    available).</p>

                <p>This web page uses a user interface strategy called <soCalled>facetted
                        search</soCalled> (see Wikipedia's <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Faceted_search"><soCalled>faceted
                            search</soCalled></ref> entry) to steer its user towards materials
                    relevant to them in the dataset. This facetted search approach implements
                    interface strategies used in other commonly used sites such as Amazon's, and is
                    designed to help users with limited knowledge of a field to find things that
                    they want. Thus, the facetted approach for this DPRR selection page is intended
                    to help novice users (although, of course, perhaps not so much novices to the
                    study of Roman Republic society, because they are expected to know, for example,
                    what a <soCalled>Praenomen</soCalled> is) to find things that will interest
                    them. The intent of the design is to allow people to use this page effectively
                    with what is only now-a-days conventional web-access skills.</p>

                <p>Contrast this with the front screen one sees when one fetches the front page of
                    the DPRR RDF server which, as it turns out, allows the user to explore and
                    select DPRR's data using RDF's SPARQL query language (which one provides in the
                    large text box labelled <soCalled>query</soCalled>), which is shown in <ref target="#figure02">Figure 2</ref>.</p>

                <figure xml:id="figure02">
                    <head>DPRR's RDF Server's front screen</head>
                    <graphic url="resources/images/figure02.png"/>
                </figure>

                <p>Of course, there is (not surprisingly) more to the RDF server's web-oriented
                    interface than this page alone, so only so much can be learned by examining it
                    critically by itself. Nonetheless, even though we are only looking here at the
                    first page that the RDF Server can show to us, one can quickly see that the
                    RDF's server's web interface is built under a very different set of assumptions
                    about the kind of user who will be working with it. Indeed, although there is a
                    banner at the top of the screen that identifies it with DPRR, the DPRR RDF
                    server's public interface is not specific to DPRR in the way that the facetted
                    search browser presented earlier is, but represents instead a general kind of
                    interface that could be used with any collection of RDF data on any subject. The
                    web-browser interface for DPRR we looked at a moment ago has been tailored
                    specifically to make front and centre how DPRR's materials are organised and to
                    show under what semantic issues they operate. Here, in contrast, other than that
                    obvious DPRR banner, this RDF server would look virtually the same if it was
                    giving access to an entirely different set of RDF data.</p>

                <p>In fact, this screen is part of <emph>rdf4j</emph>'s RDF workbench interface
                    which has been specifically designed by the <emph>rdf4j</emph>'s developers to
                    work usefully with <emph>any</emph> kind of RDF data. Indeed, DPRR's RDF
                    server's browser interface focuses primarily on providing an interface that fits
                    with RDF and related technologies like SPARQL rather than being an interface
                    that is tailored specifically to express DPRR's concepts and materials. For
                    someone to use the RDF server they need to know not only about DPRR's data and
                    how it is represented in RDF, but also how RDF works and (for this particular
                    web page) how to express queries in the SPARQL language that will be able to
                    fetch data for the user's particular needs. We'll see examples of SPARQL being
                    used in this way later in this article. The important point at this moment is
                    that this browser interface says something about its intended audience: to use
                    it one needs to have a solid technical familiarity with RDF and its
                    technologies, and to be capable of exploiting materials presented in this
                    way.</p>

                <p>This article will look briefly at some of the other parts of its interface that
                    is derived from the <emph>rdf4j</emph> workbench later. For now, let us turn our
                    attention to how DPRR's RDF server addresses the basic requirement of Christian
                    Bizer, Tom Heath and Tim Berners-Lee's conception of Linked Open Data, as
                    described in their 2009 article that has been mentioned earlier: <ptr target="#bizeretal2009"/>. I have chosen here to include HTML links and
                    forms that actually invoke the DPRR RDF Server, based on the principle that by
                    actually sending readers to the server, they will be better enabled to explore
                    for themselves what the server is doing. Therefore, I recommend that you, the
                    reader, click on the provided links and directly engage with the server
                    yourself. However, if for some reason you are unable to make the links work, I
                    have also included screen shots showing what shows up in my Firefox browser when
                    I click on the links. The links, both to the server, and to the corresponding
                    screen shot, are set up to cause your browser to open them in a new tab or
                    window. Hence, to return to this article, you can simple close the display the
                    link or form created when you are done with it.</p>

                <p>The first point to notice is that the server supports the fundamental principle
                    stated by Berners-Lee and others about open data: that all entities in the data
                    have globally defined URIs for them, and if one gives the URI for any one of
                    these entities to the web as a URL, one gets data back from the server about it.
                    Thus, all of DPRR's data (as we will see shortly, not just DPRR persons) is
                    globally accessible in this way, since all entities in the DPRR dataset are
                    assigned global URIs and can be directly referenced by anyone with web access
                    who wishes to do so.</p>

                <p>For example, <ref target="http://romanrepublic.ac.uk/rdf/entity/Person/2072">this entry</ref>
                
<!--                <code type="jb.dprr">

                refers to one of the historical persons in the dataset: in this case the famous
                    Roman author Cicero. (A screen shot is shown in <ref target="#figure03">Figure XX in the Appendix</ref>.) 
                    
                    
                    If you give your browser this URI (and if you are reading
                    this article online you can readily do this by simply clicking on the URI-as
                    link above), it will find its way to the DPRR RDF server. There, the server will
                    fetch the data about the person identified by this URI -- Cicero -- and will
                    return to your browser all the data it has about him, delivered to you through
                    the <emph>rdf4j</emph> workbench <soCalled>wrapper</soCalled> which presents all
                    these RDF statements wrapped in lightweight HTML so your browser can effectively
                    display it. The tabular part of the display shows the RDF statements that
                    reference DPRR's URI for Cicero. RDF statements have three parts in the order
                        <quote rend="inline">&lt;subject&gt; &lt;predicate&gt;
                        &lt;object&gt;</quote>. Thus, one of the triples part way down the list in
                    the table can be read <q>The entity with URI
                            <code>http://romanrepublic.ac.uk/rdf/entity/Person/2072</code> has
                        Cognomen 'Cicero'</q>. Cicero's URI is likely to appear as Subject or Object
                    part of the RDF statements (and is allowed as a Predicate, although because of
                    the way DPRR's RDF works, Cicero's URI does not in fact occur there), and this
                    display shows all the RDF statements that reference Cicero's URI for all three
                    possible types of reference.</p>

                <p>It is important to grasp the fact that DPRR's other non-RDF <soCalled>browser
                        oriented</soCalled> web interface can <emph>also</emph> present similar data
                    about Cicero, and this function is invoked through a URL that looks somewhat
                    similar to the RDF URI used to identify Cicero:</p>

                <p>The data about the same historical person, Cicero, is all included in the web
                    page returned to the browser too, but it is wrapped in rather more complex HTML
                    which has been tailored specifically to represent DPRR Person data, and which is
                    designed to present visually well in a conventional browser for a human reader.
                    Although both the <soCalled>browser friendly</soCalled> URL and the RDF-oriented
                    URI for Cicero return similar results the differences between them are similar
                    to the differences described earlier about the two front pages: Cicero's RDF URI
                    is presented in terms of its RDF representation, whereas his browser-oriented
                    URL immediately presents its material in terms focused on how DPRR data about
                    Cicero is organised, in a format calculated to be more immediately accessible to
                    a less technical reader.</p>

                <p>Although the RDF URI for Cicero's data caused the RDF server to respond with the
                    RDF statements it holds still wrapped in a little presentation HTML you can in
                    fact ask the RDF server to deliver its result in pure RDF -- immediately
                    suitable for further machine processing. There are two ways to do this. One uses
                    the mechanisms recommended in the W3C's specification for RDF servers <ptr target="#speicheretal2015"/>: one can ask the server to create the result in
                    a particular RDF format by identifying the type you want with a suitable RDF
                    mime-type (such as <title rend="quotes">application/rdf+xml</title>, which
                    requests RDF expressed in XML) in the <emph>HTTP request header</emph>. This
                    approach can be relatively readily done if you use the http support in most
                    programming languages such as Python or Java. However, if you are trying to use
                    a web browser to fetch data as simple RDF it is difficult to follow these W3C
                    guidelines and to control the mime-type the browser will specify in the HTTP
                    request it generates for you. So, for browser users who actually want the RDF
                    rather than an HTML representation of the RDF this W3C recommended method is
                    difficult to carry out. For this reason, DPRR's RDF server has been extended
                    beyond the W3C specification to support a parameter <soCalled>format</soCalled>.
                    Specifying one of the standard mime-types for RDF (or more simply
                        <soCalled>rdf</soCalled>) with it will cause the DPRR server to deliver the
                    RDF data directly in the corresponding standard representations of RDF:</p>

                <code type="jb.dprr">

                <p>This pure RDF is perhaps even more difficult for a human reader -- especially
                    those not familiar with RDF -- to read, but it presents the data in RDF's
                    standard Turtle format (Beckett <emph>et al</emph> 2014) that can be readily
                    processed by RDF software in programming languages like Python or Java.</p>

                <p>We have now seen the data DPRR has about Cicero in both the browser-friendly and
                    RDF data-oriented views. The packaged presentation of DPRR's reader-friendly
                    view is clearly more straightforward for a non-technical DPRR user to understand
                    -- that is the intent of its design. Furthermore, the DPRR development team
                    worked hard to combine together data from various related parts of the DPRR
                    dataset to create a unified and concise presentation that appears assembled
                    together on a single web page. In contrast, to get all the data shown on this
                    one screen through the RDF display requires the user to, themselves, follow
                    links given as URIs in the RDF statements and thus to look at other related
                    parts of the DPRR RDF dataset. Since, as we have seen, the browser-oriented
                    interface delivers information about Cicero in a way that is more user-friendly,
                    who would want to use the RDF Server's representation when arguably the
                    browser-oriented presentation is easier for us to read?</p>

                <p>This question takes us to the point of the Semantic Web and Linked Open Data too:
                    that it expresses its materials in a highly structured form (RDF) that is
                    suitable for <emph>further</emph> processing rather than just human viewing.
                    Whereas arguably the browser-oriented presentation is easier for a person to
                    interpret, it is not as straightforward to use when the purpose is to gather
                    data from it for further processing. Techniques called <soCalled>screen
                        scraping</soCalled> or, more specifically, <soCalled>web scraping</soCalled>
                    (see Wikipedia's definition of <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_scraping"><soCalled>web
                            scraping</soCalled></ref> for a good introduction) have been developed
                    to get data out of human-oriented web pages such as DPRR's reader-oriented
                    presentation -- but screen scraping techniques are notoriously unreliable for
                    getting at the underlying data which is presented for human eyes through the web
                    page. In contrast, RDF has straightforward and consistent structures that are
                    easy to process in a programming language such as Python or Java. If your aim is
                    to further process the DPRR materials you fetch, the RDF formats as a delivery
                    mechanisms from DPRR are most definitely the better bet. Furthermore, as we
                    shall see when we look at the server's query (SPARQL) mechanisms, the data there
                    can also be delivered both in formats not only suitable for further processing
                    in Python or Java, but also in spreadsheet-friendly formats such as
                    Comma-separated values (CSV) (See Wikipedia's definition of <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comma-separated_values"><soCalled>Comma-separated values</soCalled></ref> for a brief
                    introduction).</p>

                <p>We have now seen how the RDF server delivers LOD data about persons held in DPRR.
                    However, as mentioned earlier, one of the important characteristics of the RDF
                    server is that <emph>all</emph> kinds of DPRR data -- not just persons -- have
                    open and public URIs assigned to them, so that a user can fetch DPRR's data not
                    only about persons but also about any other kind of information DPRR is
                    holding.</p>

                <p>For example, Cicero is recorded in DPRR as having held a post of consul in the
                    year 66 BCE. This kind of assertion is what in DPRR is called a <title rend="quotes">Post Assertion</title> and the one about Cicero being a consul
                    is one of the many Post Assertions recorded in DPRR. This particular Post
                    Assertion can be expressed as a set of RDF statements, and has its own global
                    URI:</p>

                <code type="jb.dprr">
                    <div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
                        <p><a href="http://romanrepublic.ac.uk/rdf/entity/PostAssertion/5439" target="_blank">http://romanrepublic.ac.uk/rdf/entity/PostAssertion/5439</a><br/>
                            (a screen capture of the beginning of this generated display is <a href="resources/images/figure06.png" target="_blank">here</a>)</p>
                    </div>
                </code>

                <p>Giving this URI directly to the WWW will fetch the RDF statements that are
                    associated with this particular Post Assertion about Cicero's consulship.
                    Indeed, we can continue in the same line and, following the principle that
                        <emph>all</emph> DPRR data has a public URI attached to it, note that the
                    concept of consulship (which is referenced in this Post Assertion) also has its
                    own global URI:</p>

                <code type="jb.dprr">
                    <div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">

                            capture of the beginning of this generated display is <a href="resources/images/figure07.png" target="_blank">here</a>)</p>
                    </div>
                </code>

                <p>and all the data linked to the office of Consul, as identified by this URI will
                    be returned -- including all the Post Assertions that state that someone was a
                    consul since they will all refer to this <soCalled>Consulship</soCalled> URI
                    through their <soCalled>hasOffice</soCalled> predicate.</p>

                <p>Why does having kinds of data other than just persons directly addressable via
                    the WWW matter in what is, after all, a prosopography? Because, as we discuss
                    later in this article, being able to start anywhere (from any kind of data)
                    rather than just one or two kinds of <soCalled>entry points</soCalled> (such as,
                    for a prosopography, <soCalled>historical person</soCalled>) is a key reason why
                    structured, interconnected, data (such as that represented using the relational
                    paradigm or by graph representations such as RDF) is likely to be most useful.
                    Being able to enter DPRR's data structures in any number of different ways makes
                    possible fresh ways of looking at the data, something that would difficult to
                    achieve if you could only enter the data through persons.</p>

                <p>In order to make good use of the different kinds of interconnected data that the
                    DPRR RDF server makes available beyond persons, one needs to know in some detail
                    what is there and how it is organised. This is a place where an
                        <emph>rdf4j</emph> workbench mechanism available in the RDF server comes in
                    to be useful. The workbench's <soCalled>types</soCalled> display shows all the
                    types of data identified in the DPRR RDF collection, and is a useful starting
                    point for browsing DPRR's RDF statements. Generally, one can navigate to the
                    types display from the browser pages presented by the server via the menu of
                    options on the left side. Here is a direct link to it:</p>

                <p>Some of these items that are then displayed (the ones that begin with the prefix
                        <title rend="quotes">owl:</title>, <title rend="quotes">rdf:</title> and
                        <title rend="quotes">rdfs:</title>) are types of data that are generic to
                    RDF and are therefore perhaps less useful for a data investigation about DPRR.
                    However, the ones that begin <title rend="quotes">vocab:</title> are the names
                    for types of data that are specific to DPRR; <title rend="quotes">vocab:Source</title>, for instance, asserts that there is a type of data
                    called <soCalled>Source</soCalled> in DPRR. Looking through the list of types
                    specific to DPRR which are identified by the <title rend="quotes">vocab:</title>
                    prefix one finds other types that are immediately identifiable: <title rend="quotes">vocab:Person</title>, of course, but also <title rend="quotes">vocab:SecondarySource</title>, <title rend="quotes">vocab:Praenomen</title>
                    and perhaps <title rend="quotes">vocab:RelationshipAssertion</title> given what
                    has already been said about <title rend="quotes">vocab:PostAssertion</title>.</p>

                <p>Clicking on, say, <title rend="quotes">vocab:SecondarySource</title> causes the
                    server to list all RDF statements that make reference to it. One can see quite a
                    range of different kinds of statements about <title rend="quotes">vocab:SecondarySource</title>, including a comment associated with it,
                    which tells us that <title rend="quotes">vocab:SecondarySource</title> is <q>A
                        modern source. DPRR is primarily built by harvesting data from 19th, 20th

                    of Entities that are asserted to be Secondary Sources. Only their URIs are given
                    here so one cannot immediately tell what secondary sources they represent, but

                <p>This kind of browsing through RDF data is typical of one of the main uses of the
                        <emph>rdf4j</emph> workbench displays that have been incorporated into the
                    DPRR RDF server. They allow one to develop a feel for the meaning of the data
                    simply by browsing through the data itself. However, not all the types of data
                    are immediately understandable in this way, and their relationship between each
                    other can still be difficult to grasp. Thus, DPRR data also has what is called
                    an <emph>ontology</emph>: a formal description (written in OWL (OWL 2012),
                    another RDF-related technology) of the types of data in DPRR (called

                <head>Two perspectives on uses for RDF and LOD</head>
                <p>We have now briefly introduced several of the mechanisms the DPRR RDF server
                    makes available to the world (the query-oriented SPARQL mechanism will be
                    introduced later). It is time, therefore, to step away from its specifics to
                    think about what this approach to providing a data-oriented historical site like
                    DPRR as Linked Open Data (in the sense that Tim Berners-Lee conceives of it)
                    might mean for a humanities scholarly community.</p>

                <p>Most of those people in the digital humanities who are currently working on the
                    challenges of LOD focus on work that is often described as <q>enriching the
                        global graph</q> -- making explicit the links between <emph>different</emph>
                    internet-accessible data collections. We can see work of this kind in projects
                    like <title rend="italic">Pelagios</title>
                    <ptr target="#pelagios"/> and, perhaps more particularly, <title rend="italic">SNAP-DRGN</title>
                    <ptr target="#snapdrgn"/>. DPRR/RDF, however, does not look like recent
                    historically oriented LOD initiatives such as these, so what is its connection,
                    in and of itself, to the LOD perspective? To understand why I think that, in
                    spite of the different connection that DPRR has to LOD than the <quote rend="inline">enriching the global graph</quote> initiatives have, that
                    DPRR's RDF should still be interesting to the humanist LOD community. One needs
                    to start by thinking more about the two different kinds of engagement with LOD
                    materials by web users which appear at different points in time in Berners-Lee's
                    conception of Linked Data.</p>

                <p>Berners-Lee's first conception of the Semantic Web was described in the early
                    2001 <title rend="italic">Scientific American</title> article <title rend="quotes">The Semantic Web</title>
                    <ptr target="#bernersleeetal2001"/>. Here, we see the authors proposing a data
                    and semantically-rich extension to the already existing document-oriented web in
                    a way that would allow ordinary folk without formal training in digital
                    semantics to exploit this richness. The authors give a number of imagined
                    examples of agent-based software that could automatically exploit formal
                    semantic data between different sources. One example (see page 36) has a user
                    send her agent software off to make an appointment with a medical specialist for
                    her Mom. To do this requires the agent to find specialists that fit with Mom's
                    prescribed treatment, then match up the appointment calendars for Mom and those
                    specialists. The software agent also needs to take into account other parameters
                    such as distance to the appointment, and the need for physical therapists.
                    Allowing a user's software agent to perform this kind of complex task reliably
                    requires that the material it works with be highly structured and have
                    appropriate software-accessible semantics about the data available so that the
                    software agent can, on its own without human intervention, connect it together
                    correctly and exploit it. In the ideal Semantic Web described by Berners-Lee et
                    al in 2001 a human user would be able to safely delegate this task to their
                    agent software and wouldn't need to worry about the details of how the agent did
                    the job, although if she is interested she could ask the system how it went
                    about carrying out the task and, since the computation would be based on
                    structures that semantically mirror parts of our human understanding of the
                    world, receive an answer that could be understood.</p>

                <p><ptr target="#bernersleeetal2001"/>'s 2001 agent-oriented vision has proven to be
                    quite ambitious. As a consequence there has been work in Computer Science to
                    explore the somewhat simpler task of trying to make semantic web data help
                    ordinary, non-technical users better search for things in which they are
                    interested in the vast global internet-wide data graph. Some of this work
                    involves trying to find ways to enrich google-like searching (which is centred
                    primarily on very sophisticated Natural Language retrieval principles (NLP)
                    applied to the WWW's text-oriented documents) with semantically-structured
                    material expressed in RDF and its associated technologies. A recognised
                    challenge in trying to exploit RDF-like structured data as well as the text in
                    Web pages in this way is found in the fact that independent but semantically
                    related data collections are likely to have differing internal structures and
                    may well use different vocabulary in their formal structure for what are the
                    same or similar concepts -- a condition called <soCalled>heterogeneous
                        Datasets</soCalled> by some researchers. A good summary of some of the
                    thinking in this area from a few years ago can be found in <ptr target="#freitasetal2012"/>. It is not quite clearly spelled out in this
                    article, but an important assumption seems to be that the tools that they are
                    interested in would ideally support querying that could be characterised as
                    coming from what I am calling here an <soCalled>intuitive user</soCalled>.</p>

                <p>Consider Google as an example of an existing service which is also conceived of
                    as serving an <soCalled>intuitive user</soCalled>. Most Google users are not
                    familiar with the range of material that the web possesses when they start a
                    Google search, and they phrase their question without knowing the structure or
                    vocabulary applied to materials on the web. In this sense, their querying is
                    intuitive. Similarly, it is intended that some of the engines that Freitas
                        <emph>et al</emph> describe are meant to allow users to ask questions in a
                    natural language without knowing much about the domains the data represents.
                    These engines use a combination of NLP techniques combined with sophisticated
                    understanding of both the RDF data with their ontologies that describe them, to
                    provide a better query result than NLP could deliver on its own. The aim is to
                    allow users to come with what are intuitive text-oriented questions and get
                    richer, more trustworthy, results than they would get from the NLP approaches
                    against text-oriented documents alone. There is a good summary of very recent
                    thinking in this area in <ptr target="#noyetal2019"/>.</p>

                <p>Of course, recent work by Google and others has shown that text-oriented big data
                    strategies can achieve remarkable things with only vast amounts of almost-raw
                    text as data without needing large amounts of hand crafted formal semantic data
                    at all. Thus, it would seem that if the 2001 Semantic Web vision is ever going
                    to be achieved, the emergence of platforms that have rich, widely available,
                    semantic data expressed in RDF and its associated technologies, combined with AI
                    software of the kind envisioned here that can make use of it, are still
                    something for the future.</p>

                <p>Perhaps as the challenges of implementation of the ideas in the 2001 article
                    became clearer, Berners-Lee began to think about the benefits of having the data
                    without the sophisticated AI-like framework that would be needed to make the
                    more sophisticated ideas of the 2001 article work. This is the situation we find
                    in Berners-Lee's 2010 TED talk that I mentioned earlier. Here, the users of
                    Berners-Lee's global data are not the kind of intuitive user with their natural
                    language query that I have just described, which to be supported would rely on
                    substantial Artificial Intelligence-like methods hidden from him/her. Instead,
                    Berners-Lee gives examples of people exploiting the power of formally structured
                    data through <soCalled>mashups</soCalled> which explicitly join together bits of
                    previously disconnected global data to gain new insights into the material. In
                    one of Berners-Lee's illustrations we see how a person, by joining together data
                    about what streets a new municipal water pumping station served with demographic
                    data about those streets, would be able to show how this town's new station was
                    disproportionally serving the wealthier parts of the town. This kind of working
                    with global data requires something quite different from its user than the
                    intuitive engagement of the Google-like NLP+Semantic-data approach that Freitas
                        <emph>et al</emph> and Noy <emph>et al</emph> are exploring. If one wishes
                    to join up data from different sources like this one cannot be an intuitive user
                    and take an intuitive approach based on only a limited understanding of the data
                    one is querying. Instead, to join them together one needs to understand in some
                    detail the semantic structure and significance of your data sources, and know
                    how to formally join them correctly.</p>

                <p>The important point for us here is that the Berners-Lee TED talk's researcher's
                    observation about the link between the new water plant and the people it served
                    was made not with the aid of an intuitive google-like query, but by the
                    deliberate bringing together of two sources of structured data in a way that no
                    one else had done. To achieve this, the data analyst needed, in some way, to be
                    the opposite of intuitive. Instead, s/he could only create new information when
                    s/he thoroughly understood the semantics of the pieces of data s/he is working
                    with and understood how they connected together. Furthermore, only in this way
                    could the strength of the argument that arises from this water plant example
                    come out of the semantic juxtaposition of the materials.</p>

                <p>Freitas <emph>et al</emph> characterise this kind of interaction with data and
                    the type of <q>structured query</q> that can be expressed against it as
                        <q>crisp</q> and seems to equate <soCalled>crispness</soCalled> of response
                    with <soCalled>precise answers</soCalled> of the kind given by database formal
                    queries in a language like SQL <ptr target="#freitasetal2012" loc="29"/>. These
                    interactions with data are not like queries that are conceived of as Google-like
                    semi-natural language expressions, where one cannot be sure either that the
                    result one gets matches a natural human understanding of the query or that one
                    gets all the material that a human would consider relevant to the question
                    asked. Instead, these structured queries have a kind of processing model that,
                    to the degree that the data being queried can be considered to be an accurate
                    representation of its material (admittedly, an important qualification) and
                    inasmuch as one can express what one is interested in in the formal nature of
                    the query language, allows one to be sure of the completeness and accuracy of
                    the result. Although Freitas <emph>et al</emph> don't explain what they mean by
                        <q>crisp</q> and <q>precise</q> in their article, it is, I expect, in this
                    area that their sense of these terms resides.</p>

                <p>Does DPRR's RDF server allow for this kind of engagement with its data? Can a
                    classical scholar engage with the formally based mechanisms of DPRR in an
                    intention that is similar to Berners-Lee's water plant mashup example? Certainly
                    formal <soCalled>crisp</soCalled> queries of the form and spirit that
                    Berners-Lee's 2010 examples require are available through the DPRR RDF Server's
                    support of the SPARQL <ptr target="#sparql2013"/> query language.</p>

                <head>DPRR and SPARQL</head>
                <p>What is SPARQL? Wikipedia starts its article about SPARQL by saying <q>SPARQL
                        allows users to write queries against [...] data that follow the RDF
                        specification of the W3C</q>. It works by allowing the SPARQL query creator
                    to specify a pattern to look for in the RDF graph, and to display parts of the
                    selected bits that match the pattern as results. This certainly is not the place
                    to provide a tutorial on SPARQL, but here is an example of a query in it:</p>

                <p>The query looks for graph patterns in the DPRR RDF data that show women who are also
                    recorded has holding offices, and displays the woman's name and the name of the
                    office. It is expressed in the SPARQL language, and the reader can doubtless see
                    that it is not a trivial matter to learn to create queries of this kind,
                    particularly for those without knowledge of related query languages such as
                    XQuery for XML <ptr target="#xquery2018"/>, or SQL for relational databases <ptr target="#sql2018"/>. However, once it has been learned, it provides a
                    powerful way to explore a complex set of RDF data, such as that found in
                    DPRR.</p>

                <p>The SPARQL query presented here in this article is given in the context of an
                    HTML form that allows one to directly send the query to the RDF Server and
                    receive the result. To do so, push the <soCalled>Execute</soCalled> button. Soon
                    thereafter you should receive a response from the Server showing, in a table,
                    the names and offices of all women recorded as holding offices in the DPRR
                    dataset (or, click <ref target="resources/images/figure10.png">here</ref> to see
                    a screen image of the beginning of the server's response to this query). You
                    might recall that the first view of material from the DPRR RDF Server in this
                    article was of its SPARQL Query screen. And indeed, the query text shown here
                    could be copied and pasted into that screen and run from there, and would have
                    produced essentially the same result as what one gets from the above form.</p>

                <p>The form above causes the RDF Server to return its result embedded in a light
                    wrapping of HTML that makes it more suitable for human browsing. However, the
                    query can also be run so that it returns results in a structured form more
                    suitable for further processing. Here is the same query set up in a form that
                    causes the result to be returned in JSON -- a format suitable for further
                    processing such as Python or Java (if you are curious about JSON, a good
                    starting point is Wikipedia's <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON">definition</ref>). Results can also be returned in CSV format which can be
                    opened as a spreadsheet, although this is not shown in this example.</p>

                <p>Having now briefly seen SPARQL as a querying mechanism against the DPRR dataset,
                    the reader, perhaps, will still not find it obvious how such a thing could be
                    relevant to the furtherance of the study of the Roman Republic. I can see three
                    possible concerns:</p>

                <list>
                    <item>Both Berners-Lee's mashup builder and DPRR's SPARQL query engine require a
                        complex set of technical skills that one would think does not match well
                        with the normal skill-set profile of someone interested in DPRR.</item>

                    <item>Whereas Berners-Lees examples draw data from disparate sources and joins
                        them together to make their point, DPRR is, by itself, a single source.
                        Berners-Lees is making the point that the strength of LOD as a new way to
                        look at data arises precisely from the way that it allows sources that have
                        not been brought together before to be joined. What do LOD approaches have
                        to offer for a single source like DPRR?</item>

                    <item>Finally, whereas Berners-Lee's examples use the connecting together of
                        data to make political points, there are likely to be few, if any, political
                        arguments of the kind that Berners-Lee is interested in that could come out
                        of a study of DPRR.</item>

                    <p>In order to interact with the DPRR RDF server and get the benefits that it

                            <item>and finally how to assemble data selected from the server for
                                further processing, perhaps to turn the data into, say, useful
                                displays with a spreadsheet, or with, say, Python and something like
                                Google Graphs.</item>
                        </list></p>
                    <p>This is a tall technical order.</p>

                    <p>Of course, the complex technological requirements needed to interact with RDF
                        data, plus the assumption that DPRR's users are unlikely to have the
                        technical skills needed to interact with the data directly, is
                            <emph>exactly</emph> the reason why DPRR (like CCH/DDH's other digital
                        resources) have as its main public point of access a web-oriented
                        user-friendly front end to its complex, formally structured, relational
                        dataset. Why, then, is the fuller functionality similar to what direct
                        interaction with RDF enables through the DPRR RDF Server not made available
                        from DPRR or PoMS's more <soCalled>user friendly</soCalled> web front-ends?
                        There are two reasons: <list>
                            <item>one is User Experience (UX) based. The assumption behind much UX
                                work is that the user is going to be an intuitive user, and needs to
                                get useful results from simple interactions that require little
                                effort to understand the database and its semantic structures. The
                                design tries to, as much as possible, follow the user interface
                                principle <q>[d]on't make me think</q>
                                <ptr target="#krug2014"/> as put forward a few years ago by Steve
                                Krug, the UX guru. As a consequence of this UX thinking, if we
                                expected our web users to understand that was going on with only
                                minimal intellectual effort we had to restrict the investigation
                                paths for our users to relatively straightforward ones. However, to
                                get all the <soCalled>semantic juice</soCalled> out of DPRR, PoMS or
                                any other relational database requires more understanding of the
                                formal principles of the relational model and the structures of a
                                particular database than what matches the UX understanding of a user
                                community.</item>
                            <item>The second reason is that the results have to also be presented in
                                ways that suit the user and his/her browser rather than as
                                formally-structured data that can then be readily reprocessed by
                                software for further analysis -- as a web page rather than as
                                structured data which could be further processed -- since in this
                                day and age web pages are both accessible and, in a general sense,
                                understandable to pretty well anyone likely to be interested in
                                DPRR, including otherwise non-technical users.</item>
                        </list></p>

                    <p>How could a suitably trained person take advantage of the facilities the DPRR
                        server offers? To show how DPRR's RDF server can be exploited I have created
                        a modest <soCalled>timeline</soCalled> example and made it available with
                        the server which plots the holders of the office of <emph>consul</emph> by
                        their tribe. It shows how the technologies of RDF and Python can be engaged
                        to get materials out of DPRR's data that would be difficult to do with the
                        more <soCalled>user-friendly</soCalled> UX-designed web front-end. It is
                        based on a SPARQL query which is formulated to fetch the tribe name
                        associated with each consul holder. You can see the query that fetches the
                        relevant data in the form below, and by pushing <soCalled>Execute</soCalled>
                        you can run it for yourself.</p>

                    <p>Having created the SPARQL query which fetched the data needed to plot the
                        tribe of consuls over time, the query was then embedded in a Python script
                        which ran it directly, took the results it generated (in JSON), and used the
                        plotting services of Google Graph to generate an HTML page that plotted the
                        year vs tribe. The overall result can be seen <ref target="http://romanrepublic.ac.uk/rdf/timeline/consuls.html">here</ref>. The <emph>timeline</emph> materials, including the Python
                        script, are available from <ref target="http://romanrepublic.ac.uk/rdf/timeline/">http://romanrepublic.ac.uk/rdf/timeline/</ref>. I built the script in a
                        couple of hours and, having done one, could probably do another one for a
                        different question more quickly.</p>

                    <p>This is all well and good, I hear you say; but, of course, although I have
                        the skills needed to create something like this, I am not the right person
                        to decide whether the result that the <emph>timeline</emph> example provides
                        is actually useful to the study of Roman Republic history. Only Roman
                        Republic historians themselves can do so, since they understand whether or
                        not any connection between a person's tribe and the offices they held could
                        be historically interesting. It is thus historians rather than someone like
                        me that need to be directing the engagement with DPRR's RDF data. Is it
                        possible, then, to expect historians to be able to interact in this way with
                        the dataset: to have both the understanding of an historian and the
                        technical skills that enable one to fetch data using SPARQL and plot it in
                        something like Google Graph?</p>

                    <p>My own experiencew of teaching of Python for a number of years in DDH's
                        Digital Humanities MA programme (in a one term MA taught module) and
                        structured data, including RDF and SPARQL (in another) has led me to believe
                        that it is possible for students with a conventional humanities education,
                        but with a real commitment to engage with the potential of DH methods, to
                        learn sufficient technical foundations to be able to engage with
                        date-oriented materials such as DPRR's RDF representation effectively. These
                        students, with a humanities orientation in their background, were able to
                        bring these humanities-oriented interests and curiosity to bear on their
                        new-found technical abilities, to conceive of and perhaps construct
                        something like DPRR's <emph>timeline</emph> example. Indeed, more than one
                        student who has attended these two modules has directly told me that they
                        believe that they came away from these modules with the beginnings of
                        exactly this kind of ability.</p>

                    <p>I also have received news recently of an example of DPRR's RDF data working
                        in exactly this way. Although the RDF server has only been available for a
                        few months at the time this article was being written, an independent
                        research project which is entirely external to DPRR reported to me that the
                        RDF data has made an important contribution to their work. The project team
                        was interested in trying to generate visualizations of the Rome's Rostra
                        during funerals of important people in the Roman Republic and to show the
                        different types of togas that would be worn by the actors playing the part
                        of the deceased's ancestors. They found the DPRR RDF server useful because
                        they could use their own queries to get information about how different
                        people were related and what offices they had held (and thus, which toga
                        would be used to represent them). To that end the team started from the
                        results of relevant queries to the DPRR RDF server to generate a directed
                        graph (nodes=people, edges=paternal relationships) which they could then
                        traverse to determine the set of togas to depict. As they say in one of the
                        emails they have sent me, they were able to use the server to readily fetch
                        the materials they needed themselves much more directly than they could have
                        done with either the user-friendly DPRR web front end, or, of course, if
                        DPRR data had not been available to them at all. There is more information
                        at <ptr target="#johansonetal2019"/>, seeing specifically the visualisation

                <div>
                    <head>Point 2: single source</head>

                    <p>Berners-Lee's examples of exploiting Linked Data are often classified as what
                        are called <emph>mashups</emph>: the joining together of more than one data
                        source to enable a new representation that any one data source, by itself,
                        could not achieve. Speaking strictly, then, the <emph>timeline</emph>
                        example is not a mashup because it draws all its materials from the single
                        DPRR data server. Thus, some might argue that it does not fit well with the
                        assumptions in the LOD movement: that it is in the bringing together of data
                        from <emph>multiple</emph> sources that new insights can come. However, it
                        is important to understand that Berners-Lee's examples in his TED talk
                        require multiple different sources of data because each of the online
                        sources are relatively small and structurally straightforward source of
                        data; the kind of thing that can be comfortably represented in, say, a
                        spreadsheet. This is not the situation, however, with DPRR. DPRR's original
                        relational model already supports quite a rich kind of interaction between
                        many different kinds of objects, and DPRR's set of RDF -- which is, after
                        all, simply an expression of DPRR's complex database -- has in fact 39
                        different entity types, related together by 30 types of relationship and 53
                        kinds of data properties for those 39 entity types. Thus, the DPRR RDF graph
                        is already by itself a complex interconnected graph of data of which only a
                        handful of all the implied relationships between these objects has ever been
                        explored. It is reasonable to expect that queries which can, relatively
                        straightforwardly, draw on the complex interconnections in DPRR's RDF alone
                        can expose connections that have never before been considered. Many more
                        visualisations like the DPRR <emph>timeline</emph> demonstration are
                        possible without needing to go outside of DPRR's internal web of data, and
                        some of these might well make new insights possible about the Roman
                        Republic.</p>

                    <head>Point 3: political</head>

                    <p>Finally, Berners-Lee's TED talk shows that, as in his water plant example, it
                        is possible to see that much of the work enabled by LOD that draws on
                        contemporary data could have contemporary <emph>political</emph>
                        significance. Is something as potentially significant possible in the
                        humanities? It is true that there are unlikely to be contemporary political
                        issues that could be usefully explored by looking at the Roman Republic and
                        DPRR. However, there <emph>is</emph> some evidence around that suggests that
                        significant original ideas can be explored though data like DPRR's that
                        have, hitherto, been unavailable or difficult to work with, and that perhaps
                        some of these might represent truly original research that presents ideas
                        that no one else has noted before. As <ptr target="#guetzkowetal2004"/>

                            originality, for example, in terms of the novelty of the overall

                    <p>The representation of historical materials as data (rather than text) and the
                        drawing of historical conclusions from it has been controversial within
                        history: one recalls the debates about the use (and some would say the
                        misuse) of statistics in the <emph>Time on the Cross</emph> studies <ptr target="#fogelandengerman1974"/>. See Thomas Weiss's 2001 review <ptr target="#wiess2001"/> for a sense of the debates that arose from this
                        work. Nonetheless, in spite of the debates it has spurred, it certainly has
                        been, as Weiss says, <q>a book that has not been ignored</q>. Could some
                        kind of data analysis, perhaps statistical, that is enabled by DPRR's RDF
                        representation cause similar stimulation and consternation within the
                        community that studies the Roman Republic? Of course, it is too early to say
                        much about the DPRR RDF Server in this regard. However, the enthusiastic
                        informal reports we see from users of DDH's many data-oriented historical
                        resources such as <title rend="italic">People of Medieval Scotland</title>
                        (PoMS) and the <title rend="italic">Prosopography of Anglo-Saxon
                            England</title> (PASE) (mentioned earlier) suggests that research
                        product presented as data rather than prose can also be useful to
                        historians.</p>

                    <p>Furthermore, recent work with data in a sister data-oriented prosopography
                        project PoMS (which is a factoid prosopography and was captured, like DPRR,
                        in highly structured data) suggests that significant new approaches to
                        historical materials, when available as complex structured data and explored
                        from new perspectives, are both possible and reveal significant potential
                        for new insights. Starting several years ago, thanks to a grant from the
                        Leverhulme Trust, the data <emph>behind</emph> PoMS's public website has
                        been used as a base for historical Social Network Analysis (SNA)
                        experiments. This SNA analysis work on PoMS had been initially extensively
                        reported on in <ptr target="#hammondandjackson2017"/> which is an e-book of
                        over 500 pages. As it is pointed out in the preface for this book, all the
                        SNA analysis was enabled by PoMS's data-oriented interpretation of its
                        sources and came from the relationships recorded directly and indirectly in
                        the PoMS database. The data needed for the SNA work was explicitly provided
                        by the database, and yet could not have been carried out with either PoMS's
                        public web interface or with google-like intuitive queries that might have
                        selected PoMS materials. To perform it effectively required access to the
                        information behind PoMS's public interface. Since PoMS's data was organised
                        in a relational database, the process that was used to fetch data for SNA
                        analysis used queries expressed in the relational database's standard query
                        language SQL <ptr target="#sql2018"/> that were quite different from those
                        used behind the scenes to drive PoMS's public interface with its particular
                        user perspective.</p>

                    <p>The resulting SNA analysis showed that PoMS data could be exploited in ways
                        that were quite different from what one could achieve through its public
                        interface. Although the work was still in its early days when the Leverhulme
                        grant was over, the team was even then beginning to see that this novel SNA
                        perspective was pointing the way to possible new insights into Medieval
                        Scottish society. As a result, work has continued exploring this SNA
                        approach after the grant completed, and has resulted in particpation in and
                        leading of a number of workshops and demonstrations to the growing Digital
                        Historian SNA community. Although the fetching of data that fed the SNA
                        analysis of PoMS was done in the formal language of SQL rather than with LOD
                        technologies, this technical work was quite similar to what RDF, SPAQRL, and
                        related technologies would have enabled. If PoMS data had been available as
                        RDF through a PoMS RDF Server the same work could have been carried out by
                        anyone with internet access using Semantic Web technologies such as SPARQL.
                        Furthermore, although one of the members of the SNA team, Matthew Hammond,
                        is trained as a historian, rather than as a computer scientist, he was able
                        to master the formal language SQL well enough to, on his own, get the data
                        in the forms that he could use for his SNA work. If PoMS data was made
                        available through an RDF Server like DPRR's, he could certainly have done
                        the same work in SPARQL instead.</p>

                <head>DPRR and enriching the global graph: a third kind of user</head>
                <p>As this article has shown, DPRR is a complex and interconnected collection of RDF
                    statements which both (i) forms, within itself, a complex and disciplined graph
                    of information and (ii) thus offers many possible routes for exploration.
                    However, other than the standard references to RDF vocabularies such as RDFS and
                    OWL, DPRR's RDF does not point out of itself into materials created and held
                    elsewhere. Since the linking together of data across the entire
                        <soCalled>global</soCalled> rather than DPRR's <soCalled>local
                        graph</soCalled> is part of the vision of linked data, one can think
                    usefully about what needs to be done within DPRR to bring it more into alignment
                    with this aspect of the global graph vision.</p>

                <p>As mentioned earlier, most of those people in the digital humanities who are
                    currently working on the challenges of LOD are interested in what is often
                    described as <q>enriching the global graph</q> -- making explicit the links
                    between <emph>different</emph> internet-accessible data collections. This work
                    has sometimes been categorised as <soCalled>aggregation</soCalled>, and is often
                    done by making a block of <soCalled>SameAs</soCalled> assertions using the
                        <code>owl:sameAs</code> predicate or something like it. For instance, <ptr target="#viaf2010"/> describes itself as the <q>Virtual International
                        Authority File</q>. It is a resource maintained by OCLC as a service to
                    libraries which aims to <q>lower the cost and increase the utility of library
                        authority files by matching and linking widely-used authority files and
                        making that information available on the Web</q>. Thus, VIAF has the URI
                        <ref target="https://viaf.org/viaf/78769600/">https://viaf.org/viaf/78769600/</ref> for Cicero and when it is invoked one
                    gets a web page that shows how major world libraries have identified him. Thus,
                    this VIAF URI can be considered as VIAF's identifier for the historical person
                    Cicero. One can then make an <code>owl:sameAs</code> assertion via an RDF triple
                    that asserts that the person associated with DPRR's URI (<ref target="http://romanrepublic.ac.uk/rdf/entity/Person/2072">http://romanrepublic.ac.uk/rdf/entity/Person/2072</ref>) for Cicero is the
                    same person as the person VIAF identifies with their URI. This kind of work,
                    when done with as many of DPRR's persons as VIAF has also identified, is
                    arguably the first step in aligning DPRR's data with the larger digital world of
                    data, at least as it exists in the context of libraries. Similar work could be
                    done with world wide resources such as, say, WorldCat (WorldCat nd).</p>

                <p>Establishing <code>owl:sameAs</code> links between entities in different datasets
                    to show how they connect to each other seems to be obviously a good idea that
                    enriches the interlinking in global data, especially if one of the links is to a
                    recognised authority, such as VIAF. Of course, DPRR is a published
                    prosopography. The identification of people is the point of the work it
                    represents, and hence DPRR has some reason to claim to be an authority for Roman
                    Republic persons in its own right. Perhaps, then, in the same way as in the past
                    many different independent researchers working on the Roman Republic sometimes
                    used Pauly's RE as an authority and identified people using the person identity
                    scheme used in it, people in the future could use DPRR's URIs to identify which
                    historical Roman person they were referring to.</p>

                <p>Much of the work done in the DH that involves linking to authorities like VIAF
                    has been carried out in the context of identifying people who appear in texts --
                    as a reference from a spot in a digital edition of a text, say, or perhaps from
                    a reference in a piece of research being written up as an article or a monograph
                    -- and is undertaken in the context of textual markup. This linking of a spot in
                    a text to an authority such as VIAF (or DPRR itself) is a useful enriching
                    process. However, the benefits are perhaps obviously greater when the links are
                    not from a <emph>text</emph> (even one marked up using TEI) to RDF data such as
                    DPRR, but between separate datasets both of which can both be queried by SPARQL,
                    since SPAQRL's Federated Query mechanisms <ptr target="#seaborneetal2013"/>
                    allows a single query to span across more than one dataset. If, for example, a
                    dataset (let us call it <soCalled>A</soCalled> here) outside of DPRR had kinds
                    of information that does not appear in DPRR about Roman persons, and if both
                    DPRR and <soCalled>A</soCalled>'s dataset's associated persons could be
                    connected through references to common VIAF URIs, it would be possible to query
                    data that crossed both DPRR and <soCalled>A</soCalled>, taking advantage of the
                    data strengths of each of them.</p>

                <p>In some ways this linking work fits with the spirit of what DPRR was already
                    doing: bringing together hitherto separate Roman Republic prosopographies;
                    although DPRR's work was based more on establishing collections between what had
                    been separate primarily <emph>print</emph> prosopographies. However, although
                    DPRR did indeed assemble materials from these various prominent, independently
                    produced, specialist prosopographies into a single large collection they were
                    not able to take up the further task of linking their people to a world-wide
                    resource such as VIAF. There simply was not the time and funds available. As it
                    turns out, this may be the place for a third kind of person to engage in DPRR's
                    LoD data: someone who might be called an <soCalled>aggregator</soCalled>. This third kind of user
                    arises from the fact that it is in the nature of LOD that, now that DPRR data is
                    open and freely available through DPRR's RDF server, someone <emph>else</emph>
                    with an interest in historical people from the Roman Republic that appear in
                    VIAF or WorldCat can choose to create RDF triples independently of DPRR's
                    research team that assert the connections between the people identified in these
                    resources, and those identified through DPRR's person URIs and then make their
                    collection of <title rend="quotes">sameAs</title> RDF triples that assert the connections available over
                    the web. Indeed, by hosting these triples that connect DPRR entities to VIAF or
                    WorldCat outside of DPRR itself one avoids the possible confusion by users of
                    who did what: it will be clear that the links between DPRR and VIAF or WorldCat
                    were done as a separate project outside of DPRR. In fact, this is one of the
                    benefits of the conception of LOD as data distributed worldwide when it is based
                    on the RDF technologies.</p>

                <p>So far in this section we have focused on DPRR's historic persons as the centre
                    of a linking initiative, and DPRR is, after all, a prosopography, and thus
                    exploiting the URIs for its people through links seem like the most obvious
                    thing to do. However, in the RDF context all of DPRR's data is open and globably
                    available. Thus, there are URIs in DPRR that represent things other than
                    persons, and linking these other non-person objects in DPRR to authorities
                    elsewhere could also be useful to do. For example, DPRR has what the Romans
                    called <emph>provinces</emph> as entities associated with offices. Not all the
                    Roman provinces were geographically based, but many of them were. Thus, perhaps
                    a sameAs link could be establised between these geographically based provices
                    identified in DPRR and those same geographic provinces as they are identified in
                    geographic authority sites such as <title rend="italic">Pelagios</title>
                    <ptr target="#pelagios"/>. Then, if other RDF sites also used Pelagios URI
                    identifiers in their data, these Pelagios URIs could be used as linking
                    mechanisms to allow these two datasets to be joined together in a federated
                    SPARQL query. If, for example, there was a set of RDF data that associated
                    climate conditions with Pelagios places, federated queries could be used to
                    explore if there was any evidence that climate had any effect on who got posting
                    associated with these provinces.</p>

            <div>
                <head>A call to action</head>
                <p>The development of the DPRR RDF server has shown that the materials developed by
                    a data-oriented project such as DPRR can be certainly expressed as RDF, and can
                    be served online in this way and meet the criteria proposed for Linked Open Data
                    by Tim Berners-Lee and others. Only time will tell, of course, how useful
                    academics who are interested in the Roman Republic will find such an expression
                    of this kind of research, but the fact that very soon after its launch, the
                    project interested in Roman Republic funerals found it useful is at least
                    encouraging.</p>

                <p>Now that DPRR's data has been made available directly as LOD, perhaps it is time
                    for other data-oriented sources to be made available in this form as well. Over
                    the years King's DDH department, in collaboration with historians and other
                    colleagues in the arts and humanities as well as cultural heritage sector,
                    produced a significant number of web sites that are driven by data that could
                    readily be mapped to and delivered as RDF in the same way that DPRR's has been.
                    So, now that DPRR's data has been made available directly as LoD, provided that
                    appropriate resources are in place to support this work (see, for instance, <ref target="https://ahrc.ukri.org/funding/apply-for-funding/current-opportunities/towards-a-national-collection-opening-uk-heritage-to-the-world-pre-call-announcement/">this UKRI announcement</ref>), perhaps it is time for other data-oriented
                    sources to be made available in this form as well. Indeed, at the time of
                    writing of this article work is well progressed to publish another of them: the
                    People of Medieval Scotland (PoMS) data through its own RDF server in
                    essentially the same way.</p>

                <p>King's Digital Lab (KDL) is now the unit at King's responsible for hosting most
                    of the resources that were started by DDH such as DPRR and PoMS, and has kindly
                    agreed to take up the responsibility for hosting and maintaining their RDF
                    Servers as well. The development of RDF Servers for these projects fits well
                    with one of KDL's current initiatives which is centered on the idea of data
                    exposure and publication becoming a key element in the approach to a project's
                    development: see <ref target="https://www.kdl.kcl.ac.uk/our-work/archiving-sustainability/">this
                        KDL web page</ref> and <ptr target="#smithiesetal2019"/>. With respect to
                    legacy projects, one of the options KDL offers to project partners is dataset
                    deposit and the preparation of associated metadata cataloguing it. As a
                    consequence one of the solutions KDL has developed is a CKAN instance hosted
                    within KDL's infrastructure (https://data.kdl.kcl.ac.uk/). Nonetheless, KDL has
                    also seen that the DPRR RDF Server's more dynamic approach to direct data access
                    also has the potential to fit with this part of their vision. Rather than being
                    mediated through a web application front end, these projects' raw data might
                    already have an important role to play to further new humanities research in
                    their own right. As a consequence, perhaps, like DPRR, research data for other
                    of these web resources might well also deserve to be set free for those in the
                    humanities who are equipped to take advantage of them.</p>

                <p>DPRR, like all similar DH projects in which I have been involved, involves a range of organisations and people.  There are, thus, several organisations and people to acknowledge here.  First, one must thank the UK's Art's and Humanities Research Council, who funded the academic and technical work involved in the creation of the DPRR data and website. Second, I would like to thank the academic colleagues in the DPRR project with whom we worked for several years to create the data. Third, I must thank my colleagues at King's Digital Lab group (KDL), who have made it possible for the RDF Server described here to be publicly hosted on their servers. And finally, I should thank colleagues at DHQ who not only provided their stellar editorial support for this article, but agreed to extend their technical infrastructure to allow this article's unusual integrated interactive components to be accommodated by their digital publishing system.
