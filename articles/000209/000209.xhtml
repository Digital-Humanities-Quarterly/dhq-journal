               <div class="ptext" id="p2">The networks built through digital media production are significant attempts to
               redress the lack of care that Black trans women receive from the health care
               community and society. I argue that these processes of digital media production
               produce more than just redefined representations but also connections that can be
               understood as a form of health care praxis themselves. To reach these conclusions I
               have charted a new methodology that incorporates theoretical perspectives from Black
               queer theory, digital humanities, and feminist theory and transforms my relationship
               to the people producing these digital representations.</div>
               <div class="counter">
                  <a href="#p3">3</a>
               </div>
               <div class="ptext" id="p3">Media and cultural studies scholars have long understood the epistemological and
               pedagogical significance of popular media [<a class="ref" href="#hall1993">Hall 1993</a>]; [<a class="ref" href="#jones2003">Jones 2003</a>]; [<a class="ref" href="#jenks1995">Jenks 1995</a>]; [<a class="ref" href="#sperling2011">Sperling 2011</a>];
                  [<a class="ref" href="#macdonald1995">Macdonald1995</a>]. Similarly, marginalized groups have often used
               media production to challenge dominant scripts within mainstream outlets and the rise
               of digital platforms makes this task even easier. Black trans women’s use of Twitter,
               an existing digital media platform, creates new and alternate representations as a
               practice of health promotion, self-care, and wellness that challenge the ways they
               are depicted in popular culture. I focus on a digital project by Black trans women
               that involves the collaborative creation of images, links, and other digital media
               that trouble problematic representations through a curation process that also works
               to enrich the lives of those participating. I look at trans advocate Janet Mock’s
               twitter hashtag #girlslikeus and discuss the many issues of trans women’s collective
               survival signaled via the tweets marked by the tag. </div>

               <div class="ptext" id="p4">I focus on Mock’s use of the hashtag because I sought and achieved her permission to
               work on the project. I parse my process for achieving informed consent and how it
               differs from the paternalism of the Institutional Review Board (IRB) process. I
               acknowledge the negotiated terms under which this project is discussed to signal my
               own queer feminist praxis in conducting this research. I build towards an
               understanding of what I call <em class="emph">digital alchemy</em> as health praxis designed
               to create better representations for those most marginalized in the Western
               biomedical industrial complex through the implementation of networks of care beyond
               its boundaries.</div>

               <div class="ptext" id="p5">Alchemy is the "science" of turning regular metals into gold. When
               I discuss <em class="emph">digital alchemy</em> I am thinking of the ways that women of color,
               Black women in particular, transform everyday digital media into valuable social
               justice media magic that recodes failed dominant scripts. Digital alchemy shifts our
               collective attention from biomedical interventions to the redefinition of
               representations that provide another way of viewing Black queer and trans women. I
               argue that this process of redefining representation challenges the normative
               standards of bodily representation and health presented in popular and medical
               culture. </div>

                  <div class="ptext" id="p6">Black trans women negotiate unique threats to life and health as those multiply
               marginalized by gender, race, sexuality, and the disproportionate amounts of violence
               their communities face. On December 5, 2014, Deshawnda Sanchez, a Los Angeles area
               Black trans woman, was killed while trying to escape her murderer. Her death was one
               of 225 murders of trans women in 2014. The LGBTQ magazine <cite class="title italic">The
                  Advocate</cite> reported that in 2015, one trans woman has been murdered every
               week and the majority of these deaths are of women of color [<a class="ref" href="#miami2015">Miami 2015</a>]. These statistics do not reflect the frequent harassment, abuse, and harm that
               trans women of color survive. The deadly violence that Black trans women negotiate is
               often perpetrated by intimate partners, many of whom when asked claim they were
                  "duped" or "tricked" by their partners, and
               then justifiably enraged to the point of murder [<a class="ref" href="#gay2015">Gay2015</a>]. The popular
               media trope of trans identity as a form of deception is iconized in the 1992 film <span class="hi italic">The Crying Game</span>, a film that shows a man vomit when he realizes
               that Dil, the Black woman he loves is trans. Laverne Cox, a Black trans woman
               portraying a trans woman on the Netflix original series <cite class="title italic">Orange
                  is the New Black,</cite> notwithstanding, the generally portrayal of trans women
               and trans women of color in popular culture is one of hypersexual tricksters who
               deserve to be victimized for deceiving cis men [<a class="ref" href="#mattkane2012">mattkane2012</a>]. It is
               again in the area of representation, in visual assessment, that trans women of color,
               are judged and then responsible for the resulting violence it elicits from the people
               closest to them
               [<a class="ref" href="#lee2014">Lee 2014</a>]; [<a class="ref" href="#lee2008">Lee 2008</a>]; [<a class="ref" href="#steinberg2005">Steinberg 2005</a>].</div>

                  </div>
                  <div class="ptext" id="p7">These acts of violence also coincide with increasing visibility and advocacy by trans
               women of color, particularly through digital media outlets and in online media. In
               2012, Mock was moved to become a more outspoken trans activist because of the rise in
               the number of murders and suicides of queer and trans youth. She has used her
               platform as a former web editor for <cite class="title italic">Marie Claire</cite> as well as
               digital tools like videos and hashtags to reach out to other trans women in society.
               In explaining the origin of her hashtag #girlslikeus, Mock describes her support of
               Jenna Talackova, a contestant disqualified for the Miss Universe Pageant for in the
               words of the pageant officiates, "not being a natural born female"[<a class="ref" href="#missuniverse2014">Miss Universe 2014</a>]. Mock’s desire to help
               Talackova achieve her dream lead to the creation of the hashtag. On her personal blog
               Mock wrote, 
            <blockquote>
                        <p>So I shared Jenna’s petition on Twitter, and said:

               right. Remarkably a few more women — some well-known, others not — shared the petition
               and began sharing their stories of being deemed un-real, being called out, working
               it, fighting for what’s right, wanting to transition, dreaming to do this,
               accomplishing that... #girlslikeus soon grew beyond me... my dream came true:

               percent of all tweets, tweeted since Twitter began. As scholars in sociology and DH
               have noted, a ten percent sample of such a large database can provide statically
               significant information about the representative population
               [<a class="ref" href="#mislove2011">Mislove 2011</a>]; [<a class="ref" href="#gerlitz2013">Gerlitz 2013</a>]; [<a class="ref" href="#twitterusage2015">Twitter Usage</a>]; [<a class="ref" href="#bruns2013">Bruns 2013</a>]. I examined all publically accessible tweets
               using #girlslikeus between Mock’s first uses in March 2012 until October 2014. With
               the help of computer science graduate student Devin Gaffney, we created a script that
               gathered all instances of the hashtag within this database. With over 11,000 tweets
               stored that used the hashtag I could begin to assess significance. I used Voyant to
               mine the texts of the collected tweets. Voyant is a web-based textual analysis tool.
               It can generate word visualizations and can measure the frequency and occurrence of
               words in a corpus. The most popular hashtags used with the hashtag were other words
               of identity affirmation, including, #trans and #transgender, #twoc (trans women of

               related hashtags. Many of them have direct experience with journalists and scholars

               annoying to outright dangerous. Many amongst this group of twelve have had their work

               humanities needs to shift. Digital Humanists interested in conducting research that
               is ethical and feminist must go beyond the simple politics of citation, as citation
               itself may be the thing that creates the harm to the community. As noted in The
               #TwitterEthics Manifesto, "both academics and journalists should ask each individual
               user on Twitter for consent. They should explain the context and the usage of their
               tweets"[<a class="ref" href="#twitterethics2014">Twitterethics2014</a>]. This allows a Twitter user to prepare for a
               potential onslaught or simply say no. Consent is a form of collaboration, a
               collaborative process which means that a <em class="emph">no</em> may come later in
               the course of the collaboration. Similarly, the process of doing this research
               necessitates an ongoing commitment to understanding dynamics that emerge through
               engagement in the medium. To that end, the advisory panel proved to be more dynamic
               than even I could have anticipated.</div>

               to participate. Those who agreed were invited to join a listserv where I post
               questions and solicit help as needed. While this group was initially created to
               ensure that my work was ethical and useful, it has already been repurposed for needs
               I could not anticipate. One member of the group is an internationally renowned
               journalist. She queried the collaborators, asking for their thoughts on a story she
               was writing about the ways that the media has represented Black people, particularly
               Black women in coverage of the Ebola outbreak. Many in the group responded to her

               When I envisioned the group, I imagined what I could do for them and what they could
               do for me. Even in creating a collaborative space it didn’t occur to me that there
               might be things that we could collectively do for another member of the circle. I
               knew what I wanted from the group and assumed that I could anticipate the group’s
               needs from me. However, this emergent need and purpose for the group was possible

               one side and my collaborators on the other. This moment allowed for the realization
               that we had co-created a three dimensional space with multiple directions of flow.
               What I appreciate about the language of <em class="emph">collaborators</em> as
               opposed to <em class="emph">research subjects</em> is that it provides the potential
               for multiple levels of relationship between those participating in the research; the

               openness to feedback, the knowledge that we were all participating in a process that
               extends beyond the published article and even my book, created a level of trust that
               allowed for forgiveness and correction among peers. Many of these collaborators have

               well as my relationship to the usually distinct categories of research subject,
               researcher, and audience.</div>

               and sexuality studies, ethnic studies, and digital humanities who might be interested
               understanding the networks contemporary Black trans women create through the
               production of digital media. However I am interested in creating a book that also and
               perhaps most importantly, is useful to the communities on which my examples draw.
               More than just the world outside the academy, I want to create a resource for the
               communities with whom I am collaborating on the research. This practice involves a
               more intentional form of collaboration than I have attempted before. </div>

               role. This process also includes developing new models of expressing the value of
               everyone’s contributions. For me, the process is the product, meaning that the
               process itself is productive, creative, and transformative of the conditions we are

               that being their primary goal. The practices of reclaiming the screens of our
               computers and phones with content is not simply one of creating new representations
               but is a practice of self-preservation and health promotion through the networks of
               digital media. While often celebrated for the rehabilited images, this media is not
               often interrogated as processes that support the development of community and
               individual health strategies. Trans women of color aren’t simply naming the violence
               they experience but are building networks of support and recognition for their work
               that helps them have safer environments in which to live.</div>

               outside the identity and does the work of humanizing inadvertently and without

               is creating and supporting a network of connection among communities that have
               traditionally had trouble finding each other let alone reaching a larger audience. By
               doing the work of community building online, groups are leveraging both visibility
