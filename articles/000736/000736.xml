            <head>Recognition and Analysis of the Proceedings of theGreek
                        Parliament after WWII</head>
            <p>Abstract. The first post-WWII years in Greece were devastating. After a brutal Nazi occupation, the Greek Civil War (1946–1949) erupted. It wrecked the economy and the country’s infrastructure and altered politics and the social fabric for decades to come. For the tense and unstable first years of the conflict (1946–1947), a study of the issues discussed in the Greek parliament could facilitate our understanding of the society at the time. An obstacle is that parliament proceedings are publicly available in a machine-readable form from 1989; before that only scanned images of the original records exist. We show that text recognition followed by natural language processing can unlock this corpus for historical research. Using Transkribus, we trained a
                        text recogniser (1.5% CER) that we applied to 3,156 images from 1946 and
                        1947. As low-quality recognition is inevitable, we trained a language model
                        on the transcribed text and applied it to recognised text, discarding
                        records with high average cross-entropy. Using information extraction
                        techniques, we sampled speeches that were applauded and we
                        introducedintroduce the first quantification of issues that were thus
                        received. All our resources are made available

            <head>1 Introduction</head>
            <p>Parliamentary proceedings set a valuable resource for the historian, facilitating
                    the investigation of the politicalthe political and social history of a country
                    of a country. The investigation of parliamentary proceedings as a historical
                    source can reveal pieces of information regarding the political, social and
                    ideological status quo of a country. The history of post -WWII Greece is full of
                    political instability, ideological conflicts and social discontinuity, with ,
                    makingand the proceedings of the Greek Parliament constitute being one of the
                    most valuable sources for the period.. Therefore, Ttheir preservation in digital
                    form is vital, opening access to more researchers while who its machine-readable
                    formcan and potentially can
                    allowing them to work more efficiently throughwith a machine-readable form if
                    the material is machine-readable. In Greece, only the proceedings of the last
                    three decades exist in such a machine-readable form., since; eearlier proceedings are are only digitised but only only as
                    scanned images of the original printed records. This hinders the computational
                    exploration of the material and the application of Natural Language Processing
                    (NLP) techniques.This makes it difficult to work with the proceedings using
                    Natural Language Processing (NLP) and the computational exploration of these
                    proceedingsand can be a limitation in the broadening of the base of NLP use in
                    research in the area.</p>
            <p>The main contribution ofIn tIn this study,paper, we present is the development
                    and presentationwe introduce of a new corpus with comprising theof proceedings
                    from 1946–1947, the first years of the Greek Civil War of 1946–1949. The corpus
                    was produceddeveloped by recognising scanned files found online on the website
                    of the parliament’s library. We trained Transkribus on 16 double-column book pages achieving a character error rate
                    (CER) of 1.5%. We then used the Transkribus trained model to recognise the text
                    from 1,589 images of 3,178 pages (each image contains two pages). That is a
                    large-scale, real-world recognition experiment that contains noisy text, for
                    example from pages that include tables or distorted (bent) pages. Borrowing from
                    authorship analysis (Pavlopoulos &amp; Konstantinidou, 2022), to discard
                    low-quality recognisedtranscribed text, we trained a statistical language model
                    on the transcriptions and applied it to the recognised text, discarding 144
                    recognised texts whose Bits Per Character (BPC, ) (Graves, 2013) was
                    considerably high. The resultinged corpus is publicly released.</p>
            <p>The text recognition process described above has unlocked research capabilities
                    for the historian that were not available before. To explore this space, we
                    experimented with extracting useful information, including dates and names of
                    speakers. Furthermore, we searched for indicators of applause, revealing a
                    positive reception of the issue being discussed and approval for the speaker. We
                    compiled a set of 800 texts with an applause indicator and the corresponding
                    speaker’s name. From this set, we sampled 50 texts, which were qualitatively
                    studied further by a historian, who was part of our team.</p>
            <p>The historical analysis revealed an estimation of the distribution of the topics
                    being discussed at the time, with the most frequent one (23.56%) being
                    anticommunist speeches. Following that were comments on government policies
                    (16.67%) and issues of territorial integrity (7.78%). Although statistical
                    analysis is not the main tool of modern approaches to historical research, its
                    results will always provide a steady foundation for the acceptance or the
                    rejection of existing conclusions or the issuing of new ones. Whilst our
                    findingsthese are broad estimates, our study provides the first quantification
                    of the issues supported by the political system of the era in Greece and can be
                    of use to other researchers. Additionally the analysis provided is an example of
                    how NLP can be used by historians, to help them to approach a large corpus of in
                    order to review or construct a narrative (in this case the dominant narrative of
                    Greece’s political history after WWII). </p>
            <p>Overall, Our contribution: The contribution of this work is
                    two-fold: </p>

                        Figure 1 and explained in the rest of this work. The method allowed us to

                    ones. For instance, our method can help historians approach a large corpus of
                    historical evidence to review or construct a narrative, in this case the
                    dominant narrative of Greece’s political history after WWII. Also, although
                    broad estimates, our findings provide the first quantification of the issues
                    supported by the political system of that era in Greece.</p>

                    historical context of our corpus, in Section 2. The challenges of the corpus are
                    presented in Section 3. We then proceed to the method we devised forregarding
                    text recognition, in Section 4, and forregarding information extraction, in
                    Section 5. We present our historical analysis of the extracted material in
                    Section 6 and round up with conclusions in Section 7.</p>

            <head>2 Related Work and Context</head>
            <p>The analysis of parliamentary proceedings as historical evidence with the help of
                    NLP is not novel. Related work has drawn conclusions using text analysis (Walter
                    et al., 2021) and has provided tools to serve the work of researchers and
                    historians (Puren et al., 2022). The development of language technology helps
                    historians who are faced with an increasing amount of information. For instance,
                    in a study of the Slovenian parliamentary data, Named Entity Recognition (NER)
                    was suggested as a tool to extract information automatically from large
                    collections (Pančur &amp; Šorn, 2016). The
                    authors, however, noted that precision for the recognition of persons was not
                    perfect (85%), calling for awareness of reliability. In this work, we suggest
                    that NLP can be used to “screen” parliamentary data, allowing the historian to
                    search and focus on targeted records. Also Other work attempts have been made to
                    access and analyze the potential of Parliamentary Markup Language (PML) for
                    enabling contextualization of linguistic data in parliamentary proceedings and
                    facilitating large-scale studies in this area (Gartner, 2018). </p>
            <p>The computational study of the Greek parliament proceedings dates back todates to
                    2008 when document classification was applied to detect the topics being
                    discussed (Nikolaos &amp; George, 2018). Such studies, however, use records
                    after 1989 because only these exist in a machine-readable form on the website of
                    the Greek Pparliament’s library. Even in machine-readable data, extensive
                    preprocessing, followed by NLP, is required to create a structured dataset
                        (Dritsa et al., 2022), which can then be
                    readily used for political analysis without burdening the researcher with the
                    considerable effort required for text processing (Gkoumas et al., 2018).</p>
            <p>The development of a machine-readable corpus
                    of the proceedings of the Greek parliament for the years before 1989 has not
                    been attempted, to the best of our knowledge. The potential of unlocking this
                    material for computational studies, however, is great not only for historians
                    but also for political and social scientists. The period following WWII is
                    exceptional, starting with the Greek Civil War that broke out after the end of
                    the Nazi occupation, and then encompassing decades in which the state evolved
                    and gradually created a very particular identity. The main political
                    characteristic of the state that emerged in the post-WWII period was its
                    “sickly” democracy (Νικολακόπουλος [Nikolakopoulos], 2001).</p>
            <p>One feature of this sickly democracy was its anticommunist nature. Anticommunism
                    was espoused not only by politicians from the right (and influenced their
                    political decisions, (Χατζηβασιλείου [Chatzivasiliou], 2011)) but was also embraced by a
                    wider part of the political spectrum and of society at large. It can be traced
                    to the persecution of communists and suspected fellow travellers whose acts were
                    designated “crimes against the Nation” (Μπουρνάζος [Bournazos], 2009). The communist party was illegal and suspected
                    members or supporters were sent to prison or exile. The blending of communism
                    into antinationalist ideologies was part of the jingoistic climate that also
                        characterised the period. This leads to a
                    second feature of the Greek polity of the time, irredentism regarding regions
                    near the borders of Greece, like Northern Epirus and Cyprus (Stefanidis,
                    2009).</p>
            <p>The exploration of these two issues, anticommunism and irredentism, cannot be
                    complete without the investigation of the parliamentary proceedings of that
                    period. The proceedings provide critical information about the expressed views
                    of the parties on the topics being discussed. The attentive studying of this
                    evidence can reveal both quantitativelyquantitively and qualitatively, based on
                    actual data, the ways that anticommunist and irredentist discourse gradually
                    evolved and became a feature of the state’s identity.</p>

            <head>3 Data Challenges</head>
            <p>A challenge in the corpus of the Greek parliamentary proceedings is the language
                    itself. In Greece, until 1976 there were two versions of the Greek language:
                        Katharevousa and Demotic. Katharevousa was an
                    artificial form of Greek, created in the 18th century by combining features of
                    Ancient Greek and the modern vernacular, the idea being to have a linguistic
                    vehicle free from impurities that had accumulated in Greek over the centuries
                        (Katharevousa means “purifying”). It was used
                    in formal occasions and official documents, and less frequently in literature.
                    Demotic was the vernacular, spoken by the people in everyday life, and the
                    primary means of artistic expression. In the texts of the parliamentary
                    proceedings those two versions coexist. Not only do the Members of Parliament
                    (MPs) speak both Katharevousa and Demotic, but also in many cases a text (of a
                    bill, or a letter, which can be written in either Katharevousa or Demoticof
                    them) is read out aloud in the house. Apart from Greek, in its two guises, in
                    several cases, pages in French or English can be found in the corpus.</p>
            <p>Another challenge concerns the script. The text is written in Greek polytonic,
                    which was the way of writing Greek until 1982. This writing system includes a
                    variety of diacritics (accents, aspirants, and subscripts) and thus is more
                    similar to late antiquity’s Ancient or Byzantine Greek than Modern Greek
                    writing. It was the official Greek spelling of the era and, consequently, the
                    spelling used in the parliamentary proceedings.</p>

            <p>We downloaded 1,589 images (3,178 book pages) of parliamentary proceedings from
                    the website of the Greek Parliament’s library.<note>
                            https://library.parliament.gr/.</note> The images are in PDF format.
                    Each PDF file contains a scanned picture of two book pages (recto and verso, see
                    Figure 2 1). Each scanned image is an A4 size page scanned vertically; the image
                    is in JPEG format, stored inside the PDF document. Images came in three
                    resolutions: <mml:math>

               </mml:math> (570
                    images). For each image, we automatically cropped the part of the image that
                    included text, such as the upper half of Figure 21(a). No other manual
                    processing methods (e.g., de-skewing or contrast adjusting) were employed.
                    Images were then split into two parts so that each instance in our dataset is a
                    two-column page in JPEG format, as is shown in Figure 21(b).<note> All our
                                code and data will be publicly released.</note>
            </p>
            <p>To recognise the text, we experimented with
                    eScriptorium (Kiessling, et al., 2019) and Transkribus (Kahle, et al., 2017), and selected the latter as we found it
                    superior in preliminary experiments. Specifically, when trained on the same six
                    pages, Transkribus achieved a CER of 9% (Table 1, first row) while the reported
                    error rate of eScriptorium was 26.9%.<note> We used the evaluation results returned by the platforms and
                            only the Accuracy is reported by eScriptorium, which in this case was
                            73.1%.</note> A manual evaluation of the recognised text by the two
                    platforms verified the superiority of Transkribus, which was better at capturing the two-column layout and was
                    overall more accurate in recognition. Transkribus is the most commonly used text
                    recognition tool in the cultural heritage space (Nockels, et al., 2022) and
                    provides free credits until a paid subscription is required. Its architecture,
                    as far as we know, has not been published, but we could infer from information
                    on the tool’s website that it uses a neural network with three convolutional
                    layers (combined with two max pooling layers), followed by three stacked
                    bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) layers and one convolutional layer
                    on top to produce the output.<note>https://readcoop.eu/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/LEIFERT-CITLAB.pdf.</note>
                    In our experiments, using text transcribed from 16 pages, we achieved a CER of
                    1.5% (Table 1, third row). The additionadddition of more training pages (up to
                    12 more, 4th row in Table 1), broughtwe observed no improvement, which might be
                    related to the curvaturecurve of the added pages. Therefore, we used the wellthe
                    well-performing model trained on the 16 pages to recognise the text from 3,1789 pages.<note> For the layout
                            analysis the CITlab Advanced Method was used with the “Add estimated
                            word coordinates” and “Do polygon simplification” features added. No
                            baseline model was created, as this specific feature was released during
                            our study. No other manual processing methods, such as deskewing or
                            contrast adjusting, were used.</note>

               <head>Quality Assessment</head>
               <p>We found that 24 out of 3,1789 recognised
                        texts were empty and were therefore discarded. Some of the remaining 3,154
                        recognised texts, however, will likely comprise noisy output, due to images
                        of bent pages, as in the left column of Figure 21(b), or due to content that
                        is hard to transcribe (e.g., pages with tables or with text in a foreign
                        language). In these cases, the recognised text consists of a scrambled
                        meaningless text, characters one next to the other as in “Ἐἀξμξζ,λ,βθλΗξζλΕζ (ΕΥ ΙΚΚῳ ν8Υ ψπυ”. This noisy text, however, hinders
                        search and information extraction for the historian. Therefore, in order to
                        discard low-quality texts from our corpus, we built a language model to
                        assess the quality of each of our recognised texts. Language models are
                        suitable for this task, as they can assess the quality of the recognised text and can be used for the
                        evaluation of the output of text recognition (Ströbel, et al., 2022).</p>
               <p>We used a statistical language model of character trigrams, following work on
                        authorship analysis (Pavlopoulos &amp; Konstantinidou, 2022), using text
                        from our transcriptions to train the model. The transcribed text comprises
                        1,707 lines that add up to 81,965 character tokens and 135 unique
                        characters. Then, we used the language model <mml:math>
                     <mml:mi>M</mml:mi>
                  </mml:math>m that
                        was trained on transcribed text to compute the average cross-entropy of the
                            <mml:math>
                     <mml:mi>N</mml:mi>

                        scores for the beginnings of the recognised
                        texts.</p>
               <p>We used BPC as a quality indicator, with lower values indicating recognition
                        of high quality. As can be seen in Figure 32, the score is normally
                        distributed around 4.2 (st.d. 0.78) with
                        outliers on the right side. These are mainly texts with many recognition
                        errors, which occur across our corpus (Figure 43) and are meaningless to the
                        rest of our study. Hence, we discarded any text with a BPC that was greater
                        than two units of the standard deviation above the mean, resulting in 3010
                        texts that we used for information extraction and analysis. To the best of
                        our knowledge, language modelling has not been used before in published
                        studies to filter out low-quality recognition, but our study shows that this
                        could be a promising direction.</p>

            <head>5 Information Extraction</head>
            <p>To extract historical information from the corpus resulting from the recognition,
                    we should be able to detect occurrences of dates and names. This is a Named
                    Entity Recognition (NER) problem that is often addressed with supervised
                    learning. Existing solutions, however, are not trained on noisy text and do not
                    perform well. For instance, spaCy<note> https://spacy.io/.</note> found no dates, while names
                    were returned with many false positives. Therefore, we opted for recognising
                    names and dates using regular expressions.</p>
            <p>An exploration of the proceedings revealed patterns capturing named entities of
                    speakers, applause, and dates. For instance, when a speaker started speaking,
                    their name was printed with spaces between the characters, to indicate the
                    beginning of a new speech and to highlight the name. Sittings of the parliament
                    were identified by an enumeration, followed by the date. Furthermore, an
                    annotation (χειροκροτήματα / applause,
                        παρατεταμένα χειροκροτήματα / extended
                    applause) reflected the listeners’ approval, enthusiasm, or positive feedback on
                    a subject or opinion. This annotation can be found at the end of every sentence
                    that was applauded. We encoded these observations into the regular expressions
                    presented in Table 2, which we applied to each text of our corpus.</p>

            <p>Table 2. Regular expressions capturing named entities of
                    applause, speakers, and dates. Example entities captured by the respective
                    expression presented in the middle.</p>
            <p>To verify that the found named entities are valid, we performed a manual
                    investigation of the results. During this investigation, we removed 52 date
                    entities and 36 applause entities that were mistakenly detected. These mistakes
                    were mainly due to OCR mistakes, leading to words that were falsely recognized.
                    For example, “<hi rend="italic">'</hi>
               <hi rend="italic">τοῦ ἀπὸ 13 Μψρόυ 132ῇ'</hi>” matches our RegEx regular
                    expression for the date but it is actually a noisy string (see Subsection:
                    Quality Assessment above). Another frequent mistake type, regarding dates, stems
                    from law codes. Laws are often written in the form of a year followed by a left
                    parenthesis and then a number, yielding terms that can be matched by our date
                    RegExregular expression, especially if OCR mistakes alter the text further.
                    Mistaken detection of applaused concerned mainly words comprising “<hi rend="italic">κροτ</hi>”. On the other hand, we expect to have missed named
                    entities, for example in cases of spelling errors, such as in the following text
                    (Page ID: main22_2): <hi rend="italic">“Δν πρέπει νὰ λγηντειαὐτά εἰς παραμονὰς
                        ἒκλογον καὶ ἀπο εκενους ες τοῦς ὁποίους εἶχεν ἀνατεθῇ ἡ δακυβίρνησῃ τῆς ὑρας
                        (χεροκροήματα)”</hi>. The translation is: “Those words shouldn’t be said in
                    the eve of elections and from the those tasked with governing the country
                    (applause)”. The text in Greek has many spelling errors, including
                    “χειροκροτήματα”, which has been recognised as “χεροκροήματα”. With “τ” missing
                    from the word, regular expressions would not capture it.</p>

                    These mainly refer to the left-wing organisations of the National Liberation
                    Front (E.A.M.), a diverse alliance that fought to liberate Greece from the Axis
                    Occupation, and its military branch, the Greek People’s Liberation Army
                    (E.L.A.S.). It had been created by the Communist Party of Greece (K.K.E.) and at
                    the time they were fighting against the official Greek state in the Civil War.
                    During this war, as well as for the following decades, representatives of the
                    communist party were not present in the parliament.<note> There
                            were no representatives of the official Communist Party (being illegal)
                            until 1974. Nev-ertheless, K.K.E had created the United Democratic
                            Left (E.D.A.), which was its legal rep-resentative in the
                            parliament. In the elections of 1958 E.D.A. became the leading
                            oppositionparty.</note> This situation not only facilitated
                    anticommunist discourse but also embraced the idea that Communism was something
                    hostile to Greece that should be fought. For instance, the MP T. Tourkovasilis
                    was applauded after stating that “The enemies of Greece should know, that our
                    Motherland was the grave of Hitlerism, it was the grave of Mussolinism, our
                    motherland will also be the grave of Communism without doubt”.<note> Page ID: main1367_2.</note>

            <p>The Greek state at that period had a democratic government, but a flimsy one.
                    Mainly due to the Civil War, the state excluded part of its population from
                    political life (i.e., the ones who were believed to be communists were
                    persecuted by the state) and the country was characterised by a climate of White
                    and Red Terror,<note> The “”White Terror” and “”Red Terror” were
                            political purges that took place in Greece after WWII. The “”White
                            Terror” targeted left-wing groups and the “”Red Terror” targeted
                            right-wing groups, leading to a brutal period of violence and
                            repression.</note> which inflamed the political and social status
                    quo (Hatzis, 2016). When a referendum was held in September 1946 for the return
                    of king George II, political and social divisions peaked. K.K.E. abstained from
                    the referendum and the royal right won. The return of the king symbolised the
                    ideological victory of the latter (Gallant, 2016), which can be supported by
                    parliamentary speeches concerning this topic. For example, N. Zervas<note> Ν. Zervas was an important figure for Greece at that period.
                            Before starting his political career, he was the general of the
                            National Republican Greek League (E.D.E.S.), which was the largest
                            right-wing resistance organisation during the Nazi occupation of
                            Greece.</note> received extended applause after stating that the
                    return of George II with the referendum would show that the Greek people were
                    against the communists.<note> Page ID:

            <p>The above-mentioned referendum was a powerful ideological tool for the Greek
                    government. Its outcome would not only be useful for resolving the local
                    political situation, but also for the image of the country abroad. During the
                    Civil War, Greece participated in the Paris Peace Conference (1946). The king’s
                    return showed that Greece had resolved internal issues and was, therefore, ready
                    to lay claims for reparations and for land that Greeks thought rightfully
                    theirs. Greece’s claims, in terms of its borders, mainly referred to four
                    regions: Northern Epirus, Macedonia, Western Thrace, and Cyprus. These four
                    regions, which contained Greek populations, were either part of another country
                    (e.g., Northern Epirus, Cyprus, Macedonia) or were occupied by Bulgaria (i.e.,
                    Western Thrace; Bulgaria was allied to Germany) during the war, after the defeat
                    of Greece.</p>
            <p>At the Paris Peace Conference, the Greek delegation claimed that the borders of
                    Greece should expand to include Northern Epirus, which had a Greek population
                    and had been liberated by the Greek aArmy from the Italian invading army during
                    the Greek-Italian war that brought Greece in WWII (Χριστίδης [Christidis],
                        2007).<note> This claim was later withdrawn.</note> Such
                    claims, then, were deeply integrated into the irredentist speech of Greek
                    politicians. I. Mpatzios’s emotional speech was extensively applauded,<note> Page ID: main5_2.</note> after stating that even the
                    stones of Northern Epirus are willing to rise and say “we are and we will be
                    Greek”. A few pages later,<note> Page ID: main41_1</note> the
                    same MP was once more applauded after suggesting that they should ask for the
                    Great Powers’ compassion for the brothers in Northern Epirus. The speakers were
                    even more passionate after the islands of the Dodecanese were united with
                        Greece.<note> The Dodecanese islands were under Ottoman rule
                            until 1912, when they were occupied by Italy. Italy retained control
                            until the end of WWII, when the islands became a British
                            protectorateand then officially united with Greece in
                        1947.</note> D. Mantouvalos was applauded after (falsely) predicting
                    that since these islands got what they deserved and what they were fighting for
                    (i.e., their unification with Greece), the time would soon come for Northern
                    Epirus that was full of bones and blood of Greek heroes to do the same.<note> Page ID: main180_1.</note>
            </p>
            <p>Greece also had territorial disputes with Bulgaria. The two states had a history
                    of war based on border issues (Second Balkan War of 1913, Greek-Bulgarian War of
                    1925). This time, it was the region of Thrace that was the bone of contention.
                    During the Paris Peace Conference, Bulgaria, supported by the USSR, claimed
                    Western Thrace mainly based on ethnological and historical arguments, but also
                    for economic reasons (Χριστίδης [Christidis], 2007). This infuriated Greece. G.
                    Papandreou was extensively applauded after stating that <hi rend="italic">“Since
                        the shameless leaders of Bulgaria [...] claim Western Thrace, the whole
                        (Greek) Nation revolts and demands from the Allies to bring
                        justice”.</hi>
               <note> Page ID: main14_2.</note> In the
                    irredentist (and nationalistic) crescendo of his speech, P. Kanellopoulos was
                    applauded after stating that the current claims of Greece (Western Thrace) are
                    just a small part of what it could claim: the revival of Eastern Rumelia.<note> Eastern Rumelia was a semi-autonomous province of the
                            Ottoman Empire, with many Greekinhabitants. It was located in the
                            region of today’s Southern BulgariaBulgaria, and it covered the
                            areaamong the Balkan Mountains, the Rhodope Mountain and Northern
                            Thrace.</note>,<note>
                            Page ID: main20_1.</note>T This idea continued to be relevant even
                    when the discussion in the parliament was about the validation of the Peace
                    Treaty with Bulgaria. P. Rozakis gave a speech in order to propose the
                    validation of the Treaty, but he was applauded only after he said that they
                    should take an oath: Never to resign from their claims in Eastern Rumelia.<note> Page ID: main1245_2.</note>

            <p>This study </p>
            <p>presented the text recognition of This study proposed a method for recognising
                    and exploiting text from a challenging corpus, that is based on text
                    recognition, language modeling-based filtering, and information extraction. We
                    then applied thise method to the proceedings of the Greek Parliament after World
                    War II. We used Transkribus to train a text recognition model, which we used to
                    recognise the text from 3,178 scanned double-column pages. W By borrowing a
                    method from authorship analysis, we used a language modeling to discard records
                    with low-quality recognition and . Using information extraction, we annotated
                    the speakers’ names, dates, and indicators of applause. Using the latter, we
                    sampled 50 pages, which we used a sample of 50 pages to analyse the topics that
                    were positively received by the house.</p>
            <p> Since the period of interest was marked by the Greek Civil War and a referendum
                    regarding the nature of the political system (i.e., return of the exiled king
                    versus or a republic), this information can be of great importance for any
                    historian who wants to put into test the dominant historical narrative for these
                    politically complex years. Our analysis led to a quantitative estimation of the
                    topics applauded, which has not been presented before, to the best of the
                    authors’ knowledge. The most applauded topic was anti-communist comments,
                    followed by comments on the government's policies, territorial integrity and
                    comments on Bulgaria’s policies. Without the application of the proposed help of
                    text recognition and NLP, this study would have required an exhaustive manual
                    investigation manual parse of thousands of images. We publicly release our
                    corpus and recognition model.</p>
