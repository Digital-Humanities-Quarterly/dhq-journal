         <dhq:abstract>
            <p>The first post-WWII years in Greece were devastating. After a brutal Nazi occupation, the Greek Civil War (1946–1949) erupted. It 
               wrecked the economy and the country's infrastructure and altered politics and the social fabric for decades to come. A study of the 
               issues discussed in the <name>Greek Parliament</name> during the tense and unstable first years of the conflict (1946-1947) could 
               facilitate our understanding of the society at the time. An obstacle is that parliament proceedings are publicly available in a 
               machine-readable form beginning in 1989; before that only scanned images of the original records exist. We show that text recognition 
               followed by natural language processing can unlock this corpus for historical research. Using Transkribus, we trained a text recogniser 
               (1.5% CER) that we applied to 3,156 images from 1946 and 1947. As low-quality recognition is inevitable, we trained a language model on the 
               transcribed text and applied it to recognised text, discarding records with high average cross-entropy. Using information extraction 
               techniques, we sampled speeches that were applauded and we introduced the first quantification of issues that were thus received.

          <head>1 Introduction</head>
            <p>Parliamentary proceedings are a valuable resource for the historian, facilitating the investigation of the political and social history 
               of a country. The history of post-WWII Greece is full of political instability, ideological conflicts, and social discontinuity, with 
               the proceedings of the <name>Greek Parliament</name> being one of the most valuable sources for the period. Their preservation in digital 
               form is vital, opening access to more researchers and potentially allowing them to work more efficiently with a machine-readable form. In 
               Greece, only the proceedings of the last three decades exist in a machine-readable form. Earlier proceedings are digitised only as scanned 
               images of the original printed records. This hinders the computational exploration of the material and the application of Natural Language 
               Processing (NLP) techniques.
            </p>
            <p>In this study, we introduce a corpus comprising the proceedings from 1946–1947, the first years of the Greek Civil War of 1946–1949. The 
               corpus was developed by recognising scanned files found online on the website of the parliament's library. We trained Transkribus on 16 
               double-column book pages, achieving a Character Error Rate (CER) of 1.5%. We then used the trained model to recognise the text from 1,589 
               images of 3,178 pages (each image contains two pages). That is a large-scale, real-world recognition experiment that contains noisy text, 
               for example from pages that include tables or distorted (bent) pages. Borrowing from authorship analysis 
               <ptr target="#pavlopoulos_konstantinidou_2023"/>, to discard low-quality recognised text, we trained a language model on the 
               transcriptions and applied it to the recognised text, discarding 144 recognised texts with considerably high Bits Per Character 
               (BPC) <ptr target="#graves_2013"/>. The resulting corpus is publicly released.

                    <item>A method for recognising and exploiting text from a challenging corpus. The method is based on text recognition, language 
                          modeling-based filtering, and NLP-assisted quality assurance and information extraction, shown in Figure 1 and explained in 
                          the rest of this work. The method allowed us to focus on a sample of high-quality recognised pages, which we could study 
                          qualitatively, something that would have been infeasible otherwise.</item>

              <head>Our Findings:</head>
                <p>The proposed method unlocks research capabilities for the historian that were not available before. We used NLP to extract useful 
                   information, including dates and speaker names. Furthermore, we extracted indicators of applause, revealing a positive reception of 
                   the issue being discussed and agreement with the speaker. We compiled a set of 800 texts with an applause indicator and the 
                   corresponding speaker's name. From this set, we sampled 50 texts, which were qualitatively studied further by a historian (part of 
                   our team). The historical analysis revealed an estimation of the distribution of the topics being discussed at the time, with the 
                   most frequent one (23.56%) being anticommunist speeches, followed by comments on government policies (16.67%) and issues of 
                   territorial integrity (7.78%). 
                </p>
                <p>Although statistical analysis is not the main tool of modern approaches to historical research, its results will always provide a 
                   solid foundation for the acceptance or rejection of existing conclusions or advancing new ones. For instance, our method can help 
                   historians approach a large corpus of historical evidence to review or construct a narrative, in this case the dominant narrative of 
                   Greece's political history after WWII. Also, although broad estimates, our findings provide the first quantification of the issues 
                   supported by the political system of that era in Greece.
                </p>
                <p>In what follows, we outline the related work and the historical context of our corpus in Section 2. The challenges are presented in 
                   Section 3. We then proceed to the method we devised regarding text recognition in Section 4, and regarding information extraction in 
                   Section 5. We present our historical analysis of the extracted material in Section 6 and round up with conclusions in Section 7.

            <head>2 Related Work and Context</head>
            <p>The analysis of parliamentary proceedings as historical evidence with the help of NLP is not novel. Related work has drawn conclusions 
               using text analysis <ptr target="#walter_et_al_2021"/> and has provided tools to serve the work of researchers and historians 
               <ptr target="#puren_et_al_2022"/>. The development of language technology helps historians who are faced with an increasing amount of 
               information. For instance, in a study of the Slovenian parliamentary data, Named Entity Recognition (NER) was suggested as a tool to 
               extract information automatically from large collections <ptr target="#pancur_sorn_2016"/>. The authors, however, noted that precision for 
               the recognition of persons was not perfect (85%), calling for awareness of reliability. In this work, we suggest that NLP can be used to 
               <q>screen</q> parliamentary data, allowing the historian to search and focus on targeted records. Other work attempts to access and 
               analyze the potential of Parliamentary Markup Language (PML) for enabling contextualization of linguistic data in parliamentary 
               proceedings and facilitating large-scale studies in this area <ptr target="#gartner_2018"/>. 
            </p>
            <p>The computational study of the <name>Greek Parliament</name> proceedings dates to 2008 when document classification was applied to detect 
               the topics being discussed <ptr target="#nikolaos_george_2008"/>. Such studies, however, use records after 1989 because only these exist 
               in a machine-readable form on the website of the <name>Greek Parliament</name>'s library. Even in machine-readable data, extensive 
               preprocessing, followed by NLP, is required to create a structured dataset <ptr target="#dritsa_et_al_2022"/>, which can then be readily 
               used for political analysis without burdening the researcher with the considerable effort required for text processing 
               <ptr target="#gkoumas_et_al_2018"/>.
            </p>
            <p>The development of a machine-readable corpus of the proceedings of the <name>Greek Parliament</name> for the years before 1989 has not 
               been attempted, to the best of our knowledge. The potential of unlocking this material for computational studies, however, is great not 
               only for historians but also for political and social scientists. The period following WWII is exceptional, starting with the Greek Civil 
               War that broke out after the end of the Nazi occupation, and then encompassing decades in which the state evolved and gradually created a 
               very particular identity. The main political characteristic of the state that emerged in the post-WWII period was its <q>sickly</q> 
               democracy <ptr target="#nikolakopoulos_2001"/>.
            </p>
            <p>One feature of this sickly democracy was its anticommunist nature. Anticommunism was espoused not only by politicians from the right (and 
               influenced their political decisions <ptr target="#chatzivasiliou_2011"/>, but was also embraced by a wider part of the political spectrum 
               and of society at large. It can be traced to the persecution of communists and suspected fellow travellers whose acts were designated 
               <quote rend="inline">crimes against the Nation</quote> <ptr target="#bournazos_2009"/>. The communist party was illegal and suspected 
               members or supporters were sent to prison or exile. The blending of communism into antinationalist ideologies was part of the jingoistic 
               climate that also characterised the period. This leads to a second feature of the Greek polity of the time, irredentism regarding regions 
               near the borders of Greece, like Northern Epirus and Cyprus <ptr target="#stefanidis_2016"/>.
            </p>
            <p>The exploration of these two issues, anticommunism and irredentism, cannot be complete without the investigation of the parliamentary 
               proceedings of that period. The proceedings provide critical information about the expressed views of the parties on the topics being 
               discussed. The attentive studying of this evidence can reveal both quantitatively and qualitatively, based on actual data, the ways that 
               anticommunist and irredentist discourse gradually evolved and became a feature of the state's identity.

          <head>3 Data Challenges</head>
            <p>A challenge in the corpus of the Greek parliamentary proceedings is the language itself. In Greece, until 1976 there were two versions 
               of the Greek language: Katharevousa and Demotic. Katharevousa was an artificial form of Greek, created in the 18th century by combining 
               features of Ancient Greek and the modern vernacular, the idea being to have a linguistic vehicle free from impurities that had accumulated 
               in Greek over the centuries (Katharevousa means <quote rend="inline">purifying</quote>). It was used in formal occasions and official 
               documents, and less frequently in literature. Demotic was the vernacular, spoken by the people in everyday life, and the primary means of 
               artistic expression. In the texts of the parliamentary proceedings those two versions coexist. Not only do the Members of Parliament (MPs) 
               speak both Katharevousa and Demotic, but also in many cases a text (of a bill, or a letter, which can be written in either of them) is read 
               out aloud in the house. Apart from Greek, in its two guises, in several cases, pages in French or English can be found in the corpus.
            </p>
            <p>Another challenge concerns the script. The text is written in Greek polytonic, which was the way of writing Greek until 1982. This writing 
               system includes a variety of diacritics (accents, aspirants, and subscripts) and thus is more similar to late antiquity's Ancient or 
               Byzantine Greek than Modern Greek writing. It was the official Greek spelling of the era and, consequently, the spelling used in the 
               parliamentary proceedings.

          <head>4 Text Recognition</head>
            <p>We downloaded 1,589 images (3,178 book pages) of parliamentary proceedings from the website of the <name>Greek Parliament</name>'s 
               library.<note>See <ref target="https://library.parliament.gr/">https://library.parliament.gr/</ref>.</note> The images are in PDF format. 
               Each PDF file contains a scanned picture of two book pages (recto and verso, see Figure 2). Each scanned image is an A4 size page scanned 
               vertically; the image is in JPEG format, stored inside the PDF document. Images came in three resolutions: 850 X 1170 (2038 images), 
               1213 X 1750 (570 images), 1288 X 1750 (570 images). For each image, we automatically cropped the part of the image that included text, 
               such as the upper half of Figure 2(a). No other manual processing methods (e.g., de-skewing or contrast adjusting) were employed. Images 
               were then split into two parts so that each instance in our dataset is a two-column page in JPEG format, as is shown in Figure 2(b).
               <note>All our code and data will be publicly released.</note>
            </p>
            <p>To recognise the text, we experimented with eScriptorium <ptr target="#kiessling_et_al_2019"/> and Transkribus 
               <ptr target="#kahle_et_al_2017"/>, and selected the latter as we found it superior in preliminary experiments. Specifically, when trained 
               on the same six pages, Transkribus achieved a CER of 9% (Table 1, first row) while the reported error rate of eScriptorium was 26.9%.
               <note>We used the evaluation results returned by the platforms and only the accuracy is reported by eScriptorium, which in this case was 
               73.1%.</note> A manual evaluation of the recognised text by the two platforms verified the superiority of Transkribus, which was better 
               at capturing the two-column layout and was overall more accurate in recognition. Transkribus is the most commonly used text recognition 
               tool in the cultural heritage space <ptr target="#nockels_et_al_2022"/> and provides free credits until a paid subscription is required. 
               Its architecture, as far as we know, has not been published, but we could infer from information on the tool's website that it uses a 
               neural network with three convolutional layers (combined with two max pooling layers), followed by three stacked bidirectional Long 
               Short-Term Memory (LSTM) layers and one convolutional layer on top to produce the output.

               we achieved a CER of 1.5% (Table 1, third row). The addition of more training pages (up to 12 more, 4th row in Table 1), brought no 
               improvement, which might be related to the curvature of the added pages. Therefore, we used the well-performing model trained on the 16 
               pages to recognise the text from 3,178 pages.<note> For the layout analysis the CITlab Advanced Method was used with the <q>Add 
               estimated word coordinates</q> and <q>Do polygon simplification</q> features added. No baseline model was created, as this specific 
               feature was released during our study. No other manual processing methods, such as deskewing or contrast adjusting, were used.</note>

              <head>Quality Assessment</head>
                <p>We found that 24 out of 3,178 recognised texts were empty and were therefore discarded. Some of the remaining 3,154 recognised texts, 
                   however, will likely comprise noisy output, due to images of bent pages, as in the left column of Figure 2(b), or due to content that 
                   is hard to transcribe (e.g., pages with tables or with text in a foreign language). In these cases, the recognised text consists of 
                   scrambled meaningless text, characters one next to the other as in <q xml:lang="gre">Ἐἀξμξζ,λ,βθλΗξζλΕζ (ΕΥ ΙΚΚῳ ν8Υ ψπυ</q>. This 
                   noisy text, however, hinders search and information extraction for the historian. Therefore, in order to discard low-quality texts 
                   from our corpus, we built a language model to assess the quality of each of our recognised texts. Language models are suitable for 
                   this task, as they can assess the quality of the recognised text and can be used for the evaluation of the output of text recognition

                <p>We used a statistical language model of character trigrams, following work on authorship analysis 
                   <ptr target="#pavlopoulos_konstantinidou_2023"/>, using text from our transcriptions to train the model. The transcribed text comprises 1,707 lines that add up to 81,965 character tokens and 135 unique characters. Then, we used the language model

                <p>We used BPC as a quality
                            indicator, with lower values indicating recognition of high quality. As
                            can be seen in Figure 3, the score is normally distributed around 4.2
                            (st.d.
                            0.78) with outliers on the right side. These are mainly texts with many
                            recognition errors, which occur across our corpus (Figure 4) and are
                            meaningless to the rest of our study. Hence, we discarded any text with
                            a BPC that was greater than two units of the standard deviation above
                            the mean, resulting in 3010 texts that we used for information
                            extraction and analysis. To the best of our knowledge, language
                            modelling has not been used before in published studies to filter out
                            low-quality recognition, but our study shows that this could be a
                            promising direction.

          <head>5 Information Extraction</head>
            <p>To extract historical information from the corpus resulting from the recognition, we should be able to detect occurrences of dates and names. This is a Named Entity Recognition (NER) problem that is often addressed with supervised learning. Existing solutions, however, are not trained on noisy text and do not perform well. For instance, spaCy<note> https://spacy.io/.</note> found no dates, while names were returned with many false positives. Therefore, we opted for recognising names and dates using regular expressions.</p>
            <p>An exploration of the
                        proceedings revealed patterns capturing named entities of speakers,
                        applause, and dates. For instance, when a speaker started speaking, their
                        name was printed with spaces between the characters, to indicate the
                        beginning of a new speech and to highlight the name. Sittings of the
                        parliament were identified by an enumeration, followed by the date.
                        Furthermore, an annotation (χειροκροτήματα / applause, παρατεταμένα χειροκροτήματα /
                        extended applause) reflected the listeners’ approval, enthusiasm, or
                        positive feedback on a subject or opinion. This annotation can be found at
                        the end of every sentence that was applauded. We encoded these observations
                        into the regular expressions presented in Table 2, which we applied to each
                        text of our corpus.</p>

                    2. Regular expressions capturing named entities of applause, speakers, and dates. Example entities captured by the respective expression presented in the middle.</p>
            <p>To verify that the found
                        named entities are valid, we performed a manual investigation of the
                        results. During this investigation, we removed 52 date entities and 36
                        applause entities that were mistakenly detected. These mistakes were mainly
                        due to OCR mistakes, leading to words that were falsely recognized. For
                        example, “<hi rend="italic">'</hi>
               <hi rend="italic">τοῦ ἀπὸ 13
                        Μψρόυ 132ῇ'</hi>” matches our regular expression
                        for the date but it is actually a noisy string (see Subsection: Quality
                        Assessment above). Another frequent mistake type, regarding dates, stems
                        from law codes. Laws are often written in the form of a year followed by a
                        left parenthesis and then a number, yielding terms that can be matched by
                        our date regular expression, especially if OCR mistakes alter the text
                        further. Mistaken detection of applause concerned mainly words comprising
                        “<hi rend="italic">κροτ</hi>”. On the other hand, we expect to have missed named entities, for example in cases of spelling errors, such as in the following text (Page ID: main22_2): <hi rend="italic">“Δν πρέπει νὰ λγηντειαὐτά εἰς παραμονὰς
                        ἒκλογον καὶ ἀπο εκενους ες τοῦς ὁποίους εἶχεν ἀνατεθῇ ἡ δακυβίρνησῃ τῆς ὑρας
                        (χεροκροήματα)”</hi>. The translation is: “Those
                        words shouldn’t be said in the eve of elections and from the those tasked
                        with governing the country (applause)”. The text in Greek has many spelling
                        errors, including “χειροκροτήματα”, which has been recognised as
                        “χεροκροήματα”. With “τ” missing from the word, regular expressions would
                        not capture it.</p>

            <p>The extracted information
                        can unlock historical analysis of the political status quo of Greece in the
                        studied period. The topics that were more often applauded, as these were
                        identified by manual inspection by a historian that was part of the team,
                        revolved around anticommunist speech and comments (Figure 5). These mainly
                        refer to the left-wing organisations of the National Liberation Front
                        (E.A.M.), a diverse alliance that fought to liberate Greece from the Axis
                        Occupation, and its military branch, the Greek People’s Liberation Army
                        (E.L.A.S.). It had been created by the Communist Party of Greece (K.K.E.)
                        and at the time they were fighting against the official Greek state in the
                        Civil War. During this war, as well as for the following decades,
                        representatives of the communist party were not present in the
                        parliament.<note> There were
                                no representatives of the official Communist Party (being illegal)
                                until 1974. Nevertheless, K.K.E had created the United Democratic
                                Left (E.D.A.), which was its legal representative in the parliament.
                                In the elections of 1958 E.D.A. became the leading
                                oppositionparty.</note> This situation not only facilitated anticommunist discourse but also embraced the idea that Communism was something hostile to Greece that should be fought. For instance, the MP T. Tourkovasilis was applauded after stating that “The enemies of Greece should know, that our Motherland was the grave of Hitlerism, it was the grave of Mussolinism, our motherland will also be the grave of Communism without doubt”.<note> Page ID: main1367_2.</note>

            <p>The Greek state at that
                        period had a democratic government, but a flimsy one. Mainly due to the
                        Civil War, the state excluded part of its population from political life
                        (i.e., the ones who were believed to be communists were persecuted by the
                        state) and the country was characterised by a climate of White and Red
                        Terror,<note> The “White Terror” and “Red Terror” were political purges that took place in Greece after WWII. The “White Terror” targeted left-wing groups and the “Red Terror” targeted right-wing groups, leading to a brutal period of violence and repression.</note> which inflamed the political and social status quo (Hatzis, 2016). When a referendum was held in September 1946 for the return of king George II, political and social divisions peaked. K.K.E. abstained from the referendum and the royal right won. The return of the king symbolised the ideological victory of the latter (Gallant, 2016), which can be supported by parliamentary speeches concerning this topic. For example, N. Zervas<note> Ν.

            <p>The above-mentioned
                        referendum was a powerful ideological tool for the Greek government. Its
                        outcome would not only be useful for resolving the local political
                        situation, but also for the image of the country abroad. During the Civil
                        War, Greece participated in the Paris Peace Conference (1946). The king’s
                        return showed that Greece had resolved internal issues and was, therefore,
                        ready to lay claims for reparations and for land that Greeks thought
                        rightfully theirs. Greece’s claims, in terms of its borders, mainly referred
                        to four regions: Northern Epirus, Macedonia, Western Thrace, and Cyprus.
                        These four regions, which contained Greek populations, were either part of
                        another country (e.g., Northern Epirus, Cyprus, Macedonia) or were occupied
                        by Bulgaria (i.e., Western Thrace; Bulgaria was allied to Germany) during
                        the war, after the defeat of Greece.</p>
            <p>At the Paris Peace
                        Conference, the Greek delegation claimed that the borders of Greece should
                        expand to include Northern Epirus, which had a Greek population and had been
                        liberated by the Greek army from the Italian invading army during the
                        Greek-Italian war that brought Greece in WWII (Χριστίδης [Christidis],
                        2007).<note> This claim was later withdrawn.</note> Such claims, then, were deeply integrated into the irredentist speech of Greek politicians. I. Mpatzios’s emotional speech was extensively applauded,<note> Page ID: main5_2.</note> after stating that even the stones of Northern Epirus are willing to rise and say “we are and we will be Greek”. A few pages later,<note> Page ID: main41_1</note> the same MP was once more applauded after suggesting that they should ask for the Great Powers’ compassion for the brothers in Northern Epirus. The speakers were even more passionate after the islands of the Dodecanese were united with Greece.<note> The Dodecanese islands were under
                                Ottoman rule until 1912, when they were occupied by Italy. Italy
                                retained control until the end of WWII, when the islands became a
                                British protectorateand then officially united with Greece in
                                1947.</note> D. Mantouvalos was applauded after (falsely) predicting that since these islands got what they deserved and what they were fighting for (i.e., their unification with Greece), the time would soon come for Northern Epirus that was full of bones and blood of Greek heroes to do the same.<note> Page ID: main180_1.</note>
            </p>
            <p>Greece also had territorial disputes with Bulgaria. The two states had a history of war based on border issues (Second Balkan War of 1913, Greek-Bulgarian War of 1925). This time, it was the region of Thrace that was the bone of contention. During the Paris Peace Conference, Bulgaria, supported by the USSR, claimed Western Thrace mainly based on ethnological and historical arguments, but also for economic reasons (Χριστίδης [Christidis], 2007). This infuriated Greece. G. Papandreou was extensively applauded after stating that <hi rend="italic">“Since the shameless leaders of
                        Bulgaria [...] claim Western Thrace, the whole (Greek) Nation revolts and
                        demands from the Allies to bring justice”.</hi>
               <note> Page ID: main14_2.</note> In the irredentist (and nationalistic) crescendo of his speech, P. Kanellopoulos was applauded after stating that the current claims of Greece (Western Thrace) are just a small part of what it could claim: the revival of Eastern Rumelia.<note> Eastern Rumelia was a
                                semi-autonomous province of the Ottoman Empire, with many
                                Greekinhabitants. It was located in the region of today’s
                                Southern Bulgaria, and it covered the areaamong the Balkan
                                Mountains, the Rhodope Mountain and Northern
                        Thrace.</note>,<note> Page ID: main20_1.</note> This idea continued to be relevant even when the discussion in the parliament was about the validation of the Peace Treaty with Bulgaria. P. Rozakis gave a speech in order to propose the validation of the Treaty, but he was applauded only after he said that they should take an oath: Never to resign from their claims in Eastern Rumelia.<note> Page ID: main1245_2.</note>

            <p> This study proposed a method for recognising and exploiting text from a challenging corpus, that is based on text recognition, language modeling-based filtering, and information extraction. We then applied this method to the proceedings of the Greek Parliament after World War II. We used Transkribus to train a text recognition model, which we used to recognise the text from 3,178 scanned double-column pages. We used language modeling to discard records with low-quality recognition and information extraction annotate the speakers’ names, dates, and indicators of applause. Using the latter, we used a sample of 50 pages to analyse the topics that were positively received by the house.

            <p>Since the period of interest
                        was marked by the Greek Civil War and a referendum regarding the nature of
                        the political system (i.e., return of the exiled king versus a republic),
                        this information can be of great importance for any historian who wants to
                        put into test the dominant historical narrative for these politically
