                  <p>The first post-WWII years in Greece were devastating. After a brutal Nazi occupation,
                     the Greek Civil War (1946–1949) erupted. It 
                     wrecked the economy and the country's infrastructure and altered politics and the
                     social fabric for decades to come. A study of the 
                     issues discussed in the Greek Parliament during the tense and unstable first years of the conflict (1946-1947) could 
                     facilitate our understanding of the society at the time. An obstacle is that parliament
                     proceedings are publicly available in a 
                     machine-readable form beginning in 1989; before that only scanned images of the original
                     records exist. We show that text recognition 
                     followed by natural language processing can unlock this corpus for historical research.
                     Using Transkribus, we trained a text recogniser 
                     (1.5% CER) that we applied to 3,156 images from 1946 and 1947. As low-quality recognition
                     is inevitable, we trained a language model on the 
                     transcribed text and applied it to recognised text, discarding records with high average
                     cross-entropy. Using information extraction 
                     techniques, we sampled speeches that were applauded and we introduced the first quantification
                     of issues that were thus received.

                  <div class="ptext" id="p1">Parliamentary proceedings are a valuable resource for the historian, facilitating
                     the investigation of the political and social history 
                     of a country. The history of post-WWII Greece is full of political instability, ideological
                     conflicts, and social discontinuity, with 
                     the proceedings of the Greek Parliament being one of the most valuable sources for the period. Their preservation in digital
                     
                     form is vital, opening access to more researchers and potentially allowing them to
                     work more efficiently with a machine-readable form. In 
                     Greece, only the proceedings of the last three decades exist in a machine-readable
                     form. Earlier proceedings are digitised only as scanned 
                     images of the original printed records. This hinders the computational exploration
                     of the material and the application of Natural Language 
                     Processing (NLP) techniques.

                  <div class="ptext" id="p2">In this study, we introduce a corpus comprising the proceedings from 1946–1947, the
                     first years of the Greek Civil War of 1946–1949. The 
                     corpus was developed by recognising scanned files found online on the website of the
                     parliament's library. We trained Transkribus on 16 
                     double-column book pages, achieving a Character Error Rate (CER) of 1.5%. We then
                     used the trained model to recognise the text from 1,589 
                     images of 3,178 pages (each image contains two pages). That is a large-scale, real-world
                     recognition experiment that contains noisy text, 
                     for example from pages that include tables or distorted (bent) pages. Borrowing from

                     transcriptions and applied it to the recognised text, discarding 144 recognised texts
                     with considerably high Bits Per Character 
                     (BPC) [<a class="ref" href="#graves_2013">Graves 2013</a>]. The resulting corpus is publicly released.

                        of applause, revealing a positive reception of

                        studied further by a historian (part of

                     [<a class="ref" href="#puren_et_al_2022">Puren et al. 2022</a>]. The development of language technology helps historians who are faced with an increasing
                     amount of 
                     information. For instance, in a study of the Slovenian parliamentary data, Named Entity
                     Recognition (NER) was suggested as a tool to 
                     extract information automatically from large collections [<a class="ref" href="#pancur_sorn_2016">Pančur and Šorn 2016</a>]. The authors, however, noted that precision for 
                     the recognition of persons was not perfect (85%), calling for awareness of reliability.
                     In this work, we suggest that NLP can be used to 
                     “screen” parliamentary data, allowing the historian to search and focus on targeted records.

                     for computational studies, however, is great not 
                     only for historians but also for political and social scientists. The period following
                     WWII is exceptional, starting with the Greek Civil 
                     War that broke out after the end of the Nazi occupation, and then encompassing decades
                     in which the state evolved and gradually created a 
                     very particular identity. The main political characteristic of the state that emerged
                     in the post-WWII period was its “sickly” 
                     democracy [<a class="ref" href="#nikolakopoulos_2001">Νικολακόπουλος [Nikolakopoulos] 2009</a>].

                  <div class="ptext" id="p10">One feature of this sickly democracy was its anticommunist nature. Anticommunism was
                     espoused not only by politicians from the right (and 
                     influenced their political decisions [<a class="ref" href="#chatzivasiliou_2011">Χατζηβασιλείου [Chatzivasiliou] 2011</a>], but was also embraced by a wider part of the political spectrum 
                     and of society at large. It can be traced to the persecution of communists and suspected
                     fellow travellers whose acts were designated 
                     “crimes against the Nation” [<a class="ref" href="#bournazos_2009">Μπουρνάζος [Bournazos] 2009</a>]. The communist party was illegal and suspected 
                     members or supporters were sent to prison or exile. The blending of communism into
                     antinationalist ideologies was part of the jingoistic 
                     climate that also characterised the period. This leads to a second feature of the
                     Greek polity of the time, irredentism regarding regions 
                     near the borders of Greece, like Northern Epirus and Cyprus [<a class="ref" href="#stefanidis_2016">Stefanidis 2016</a>].

                     discussed. The attentive studying of this evidence can reveal both quantitatively
                     and qualitatively, based on actual data, the ways that 
                     anticommunist and irredentist discourse gradually evolved and became a feature of

                  <div class="ptext" id="p12">A challenge in the corpus of the Greek parliamentary proceedings is the language itself.
                     In Greece, until 1976 there were two versions 
                     of the Greek language: Katharevousa and Demotic. Katharevousa was an artificial form
                     of Greek, created in the 18th century by combining 
                     features of Ancient Greek and the modern vernacular, the idea being to have a linguistic
                     vehicle free from impurities that had accumulated 
                     in Greek over the centuries (Katharevousa means “purifying”). It was used in formal occasions and official 
                     documents, and less frequently in literature. Demotic was the vernacular, spoken by
                     the people in everyday life, and the primary means of 
                     artistic expression. In the texts of the parliamentary proceedings those two versions
                     coexist. Not only do the Members of Parliament (MPs) 
                     speak both Katharevousa and Demotic, but also in many cases a text (of a bill, or
                     a letter, which can be written in either of them) is read 
                     out aloud in the house. Apart from Greek, in its two guises, in several cases, pages
                     in French or English can be found in the corpus.

                  <div class="ptext" id="p13">Another challenge concerns the script. The text is written in Greek polytonic, which
                     was the way of writing Greek until 1982. This writing 
                     system includes a variety of diacritics (accents, aspirants, and subscripts) and thus
                     is more similar to late antiquity's Ancient or 
                     Byzantine Greek than Modern Greek writing. It was the official Greek spelling of the
                     era and, consequently, the spelling used in the 
                     parliamentary proceedings.

                     Each PDF file contains a scanned picture of two book pages (recto and verso, see Figure

                     such as the upper half of Figure 2(a). No other manual processing methods (e.g., de-skewing

                     when trained 
                     on the same six pages, Transkribus achieved a CER of 9% (Table 1, first row) while
                     the reported error rate of eScriptorium was 26.9%.
                     <a class="noteRef" href="#d4e401">[3]</a> A manual evaluation of the recognised text by the two platforms verified the superiority
                     of Transkribus, which was better 
                     at capturing the two-column layout and was overall more accurate in recognition. Transkribus
                     is the most commonly used text recognition 
                     tool in the cultural heritage space [<a class="ref" href="#nockels_et_al_2022">Nockels et al. 2022</a>] and provides free credits until a paid subscription is required. 
                     Its architecture, as far as we know, has not been published, but we could infer from
                     information on the tool's website that it uses a 
                     neural network with three convolutional layers (combined with two max pooling layers),
                     followed by three stacked bidirectional Long 
                     Short-Term Memory (LSTM) layers and one convolutional layer on top to produce the
                     output.
                     <a class="noteRef" href="#d4e405">[4]</a> In our experiments, using text transcribed from 16 pages, 
                     we achieved a CER of 1.5% (Table 1, third row). The addition of more training pages
                     (up to 12 more, 4th row in Table 1), brought no 
                     improvement, which might be related to the curvature of the added pages. Therefore,
                     we used the well-performing model trained on the 16 
                     pages to recognise the text from 3,178 pages.<a class="noteRef" href="#d4e412">[5]</a>

                        \(M\) that was trained on transcribed text to compute the average cross-entropy of 
                        the \(N\) starting characters from each of our recognised texts, where
                        \(N = 500\). Also known as Bits Per Character (BPC), this is the average negative 
                        base two log probability that \(M\) will generate character 
                        \(c_{t+1}\) if the preceding characters were 
                        \(c_{1}...c_{t}\). More formally, BPC can be defined as: 
                        $$BPC = -\frac{1}{N}\sum_{t=1}^{N}log_{2}P(c_{t+1}; M; c_{1}...c_{t})$$

                        is normally distributed around 4.2 (st.d. 0.78) with outliers on the right side. These
                        are mainly texts with many recognition errors, 
                        which occur across our corpus (Figure 4) and are meaningless to the rest of our study.
                        Hence, we discarded any text with a BPC that 
                        was greater than two units of the standard deviation above the mean, resulting in

                        low-quality recognition, but our study shows that this could be a promising direction.

                     to indicate the beginning of a new speech and to 
                     highlight the name. Sittings of the parliament were identified by an enumeration,
                     followed by the date. Furthermore, an annotation

                     reflected the listeners' approval, enthusiasm, or positive feedback on a subject or

                     removed 52 date entities and 36 applause entities that were mistakenly detected. These
                     mistakes were mainly due to OCR mistakes, leading 
                     to words that were falsely recognized. For example, “τοῦ ἀπὸ 13 Μψρόυ 132ῇ'” matches our regular expression for the 
                     date but it is actually a noisy string (see Subsection: Quality Assessment above).
                     Another frequent mistake type, regarding dates, stems 
                     from law codes. Laws are often written in the form of a year followed by a left parenthesis
                     and then a number, yielding terms that can be 
                     matched by our date regular expression, especially if OCR mistakes alter the text
                     further. Mistaken detection of applause concerned 
                     mainly words comprising “κροτ”. On the other hand, we expect to have missed named entities, for example in cases
                     of 
                     spelling errors, such as in the following text (Page ID: main22_2): “Δν πρέπει νὰ λγηντειαὐτά εἰς παραμονὰς ἒκλογον καὶ 
                     ἀπο εκενους ες τοῦς ὁποίους εἶχεν ἀνατεθῇ ἡ δακυβίρνησῃ τῆς ὑρας (χεροκροήματα)”. The translation is: “Those 
                     words shouldn't be said in the eve of elections and from the those tasked with governing
                     the country (applause)”. The text in 
                     Greek has many spelling errors, including “χειροκροτήματα”, which has been recognised as 
                     “χεροκροήματα”. With “τ” missing from the word, regular expressions would not capture it.

                     anticommunist speech and comments (Figure 5). These mainly refer to the left-wing
                     organisations of the 
                     National Liberation Front (E.A.M.), a diverse alliance that fought to liberate Greece from the

                     been created by the Communist Party of Greece (K.K.E.) and at the time they were fighting against the 
                     official Greek state in the Civil War. During this war, as well as for the following

                     Its outcome would not only be useful for 
                     resolving the local political situation, but also for the image of the country abroad.
                     During the Civil War, Greece participated in the 
                     Paris Peace Conference (1946). The king's return showed that Greece had resolved internal
                     issues and was, therefore, ready to lay claims 
                     for reparations and for land that Greeks thought rightfully theirs. Greece's claims,
                     in terms of its borders, mainly referred to four 
                     regions: Northern Epirus, Macedonia, Western Thrace, and Cyprus. These four regions,
                     which contained Greek populations, were either part 
                     of another country (e.g., Northern Epirus, Cyprus, Macedonia) or were occupied by
                     Bulgaria (i.e., Western Thrace; Bulgaria was allied to 
                     Germany) during the war, after the defeat of Greece.

                     a Greek population and had been liberated by the Greek army from the Italian invading
                     army during the Greek-Italian war that brought

                     they should ask for the Great Powers' compassion for the brothers in Northern Epirus.
                     The speakers were even more passionate after the

                     time would soon come for Northern Epirus that was

                     1913, Greek-Bulgarian War of 1925). This time, it was the region of Thrace that was
                     the bone of contention. During the Paris Peace 
                     Conference, Bulgaria, supported by the USSR, claimed Western Thrace mainly based on
                     ethnological and historical arguments, but also for 
                     economic reasons [<a class="ref" href="#christidis_2007">Χριστίδης [Christidis] 2007</a>]. This infuriated Greece. G. Papandreou was extensively applauded after 
                     stating, “Since the shameless leaders of Bulgaria [...] claim Western Thrace, the whole [Greek]
                     Nation revolts and 
                     demands from the Allies to bring justice.”<a class="noteRef" href="#d4e1021">[17]</a> In the irredentist (and nationalistic) crescendo of his 
                     speech, P. Kanellopoulos was applauded after stating that the current claims of Greece (Western Thrace) are
                     just a small part 
                     of what it could claim: the revival of Eastern Rumelia.<a class="noteRef" href="#d4e1025">[18]</a><a class="noteRef" href="#d4e1027">[19]</a> This idea continued to be relevant even when the discussion in 
                     the parliament was about the validation of the Peace Treaty with Bulgaria. P. Rozakis gave a speech in order to propose the 
                     validation of the Treaty, but he was applauded only after he said that they should
                     take an oath never to resign from their claims in

                     corpus that is based on text recognition, language

                     to the proceedings of the Greek Parliament 
                     after World War II. We used Transkribus to train a text recognition model, which we
                     used to recognise the text from 3,178 scanned 
                     double-column pages. We used language modeling to discard records with low-quality
                     recognition and information extraction annotate the 
                     speakers' names, dates, and indicators of applause. Using the latter, we used a sample

                     positively received by the house.

                     the nature of the political system (i.e., return

                     for any historian who wants to put into test the 
                     dominant historical narrative for these politically complex years. Our analysis led
                     to a quantitative estimation of the topics applauded, 
                     which has not been presented before, to the best of the authors' knowledge. The most
                     applauded topic was anti-communist comments, followed 
                     by comments on the government's policies, territorial integrity and comments on Bulgaria's
                     policies. Without the application of the
