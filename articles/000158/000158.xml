                        <p> Jimmy Butts teaches writing to university students, but he likes to do
                            it in strange, new ways. He has worked with students in Charleston, at
                            Winthrop University, at Clemson University, and most recently at Wake
                            Forest University in Winston-Salem, NC. He received his PhD from the
                            transdisciplinary program known as Rhetorics, Communication, and
                            Information Design at Clemson University. His research interests include
                            modern and postmodern composition strategies, new media, rhetorical
                            criticism, defamiliarization, and writing pedagogy. He has begun
                            exploring in the kinds of writing that we will inevitably compose in

                    rend="italic">Beautiful Circuits</title>
            </head>
            <p>In his book <title rend="italic">Beautiful Circuits</title>, Mark Goble explores an
                exceptional connection between modernism and media studies, particularly in the
                period from the beginning of the twentieth century to the Second World War. The
                period, often unexplored in terms of media studies, considers modernism’s media
                innovations at the beginning of the last century. Goble’s historical perspective is
                often juxtaposed with current theories of media reading back into the serious
                formalist works of the modernists, which — by Goble’s careful observation — <cit><quote
                    rend="inline" source="#goble2010">nobody has much championed for years</quote>
                <ptr target="#goble2010" loc="10"/></cit>. The difference in perspectives on media looking
                backward, as opposed to the excitement of looking forward to the next killer app,
                reflects something that affected the modernist period of arts, literature, and music
                through the lens of contemporary theories of media. Instead of new media, we get
                what-was-once-new media and how it influenced the works of major modernist figures
                including Henry James, F. Scott Fitzgerald, Ezra Pound, and T. S. Eliot, among
                others whom you might expect. Although some figures appear whom you may not expect,
                as Goble shifts into different media, considering, for example, the theoretical work
                of art critic, Clement Greenberg. Goble’s critical work here feels like a nostalgic
                perspective on early developments of digital humanities, as we ourselves currently
                facing a fierce obligation to study the impact of new media innovations on our
                culture, and on past cultures.</p>
            <p>The Barthean erotic pleasure of reading different media is a major expediency for
                Goble’s book. The content emphasizes connection, love, romance, communication,
                intimacy, and social connections that are available through media as humans use
                them. I only offer this last qualifier because of the strong movement in media
                studies of late to return to sheer materiality, to media as a privileged object.
                Goble’s book resists this reduction of the field of media studies and raises up the
                influence on the aesthetics and culture developed through the use of particular
                media during the particular period of the early 1900s.</p>
            <p>Goble directs us as readers: <cit><quote rend="inline" source="#goble2010">This is a
                    book about relationships made possible <emph>by</emph> technology that are
                    experienced as equally satisfying, if not more intense and affecting, as
                    relationships <emph>with</emph> technology. In modernism, these relationships
                    depend on the materiality of mediums</quote>
                <ptr target="#goble2010" loc="12"/></cit>. With this enthusiasm, Goble offers a healthy
                awareness of his own subject’s seemingly dated nature, and not simply of what seems
                arcane now about modernism; as he puts it, <cit><quote rend="inline"
                    source="#goble2010">The very notion of the <soCalled>medium</soCalled> and its
                    aesthetic epistemology is no more bleeding edge than Betamax</quote>
                <ptr target="#goble2010" loc="9"/></cit>. To this, he adds later: <cit><quote rend="inline"
                    source="#goble2010">though I am wary of the nostalgia for bygone avant-gardes
                    of the McLuhanist devotion to whatever once was new, I would hope this book pays
                    tribute to some of the better forms of thinking about — and thinking in —
                    mediums from the first decades of the twentieth century</quote>
                <ptr target="#goble2010" loc="17"/></cit>. The approach has an acute sense of the
                historic, and Goble dances through the minefields of new historicism as an
                impressive scholar of modernism by comparing periods, suggesting, <cit><quote
                    rend="inline" source="#goble2010">mediated life, which this book explores as a
                    historical phenomenon, as central to the early twentieth century as to a later
                    culture of new media</quote>
                <ptr target="#goble2010" loc="11"/></cit>. One then wonders how our relationship to
                mediated life will be read nostalgically by future scholars of the humanities in
                particular, surprised at certain authors’ use of certain technologies. One
                experimental sampling of such fiction-on-the-edge may be found in the collection
                    <title rend="italic">We Tell Stories</title> by Penguin: the publication of six
                narratives, remediated into various forms, such as <title rend="italic">The 39
                    Steps</title> being rewritten into Google Maps.</p>
            <p>The first chapter of Goble’s work opens with Henry James sending a telegraph. Goble
                focuses on James’s later novels to emphasize the influence of technologies like the
                telegraph on James’s writing. Goble seems to expose a secret influence upon James’s
                quintessential indirect style, and how he communicated passion and emotion
                exquisitely. The connection between James’s perfect unwillingness to come out and
                say the matter of his writing plainly and the telegram’s inability to do say
                everything as well is a brilliant theoretical connection between medium and writing
                process. The telegram necessarily condenses the message, and, of course, many
                telegrams perfectly and directly say what they need to say, but the conceptual
                framework is what grounds this text and reifies the modernist literary sensibility.
                Goble asks, <cit><quote rend="inline" source="#goble2010">How does James incorporate
                    the telegram — short, direct, and shockingly imperative — into a world where
                    communication is imagined as prodigious, convoluted, and decidedly
                    circuitous?</quote>
                <ptr target="#goble2010" loc="75"/></cit>. While Goble’s choices lean toward the
                unexpected and are almost sentimental, certainly questions like this may be asked of
                still other writers. It has been suggested to me that we may now consider current
                writers cleverly using Twitter. Or, albeit in a footnote, Goble considers the work
                of the contemporary science fiction writer, Cory Doctorow, who has published his
                work online for free using an open publishing model in the form of downloadable
                PDFs, and maintained a degree of success as an author. </p>
            <p>The title of Goble’s book, he tells us in the deft introduction, comes from James who
                had something to say about circuits — to one’s surprise — in his preface to <title
                    rend="italic">The American</title>. The careful consideration of James’s writing
                style reminds me of scenes of James reading out his novels to a transcriptionist in
                Colm Tóibín’s biographic novel <title rend="italic">The Master.</title> Again,
                Goble’s surreptitious connection between these early Modernist writers and their
                influences from particularly specific technologies is eye opening.</p>
            <p> Goble then shifts into the second chapter with a second medium, the telephone, and a
                second key modernist: Gertrude Stein. Here, again, the artifacts and connections
                that Goble makes from the period are impressive. While setting up the telephone as
                the medium for the chapter, Goble then moves into a comparison of telephonic
                appearance in Stein’s <title rend="italic">Everybody’s Autobiography </title>and
                Greta Garbo’s seductive handling of a phone in <title rend="italic">Grand Hotel
                </title>(1932). The shifts are alluring for those interested in these cacophonic
                formalisms, which begin the book as <cit><quote rend="inline" source="#goble2010"
                    >constellated in turn around the telegraph and the telephone</quote>
                <ptr target="#goble2010" loc="19"/></cit>. The constellation of media networks affecting
                the poetics of the early 20th century in peculiar ways are only reverberating, Goble
                seems to insinuate, but in ever-shifting ways.</p>
            <p>In the second half of the book, <title rend="italic">Records</title>, Goble looks at
                how different media have carried and affected racial, class, gender issues beginning
                with a look at music, namely jazz, and its effect on literature and culture of the
                early 20th century as a formal medium. Goble’s jumps from F. Scott Fitzgerald, to
                Louis Armstrong, to Ralph Ellison, to George Gershwin, to James Weldon Johnson… to
                Thomas Edison and Theodore Adorno, performing for us the jazz exploration of media.
                Goble’s logic comes across as a riffing on harmonies among modernist works, as
                objects and artifacts to consider playfully interconnected. The quick jumps and
                linkages remind one of the discursive thinking suggested by conductive logics that
                Gregory Ulmer offers in <title rend="italic">Applied Grammatology</title> or the
                relations found in Michael Jarrat’s <title rend="italic">Drifting on a Read</title>,
                particularly because of the connections to early jazz reason. Jazz reason, or jazz
                logic, perhaps offers a potential means of navigating the noisy cultural apparatuses
                of modernism, and later the noisier wake of postmodernity. By the freeform illogic
                of jazz, one may be able to negotiate the blurring rules that new media expect from
                us as both readers and writers.</p>
            <p>The second half of Goble’s book then takes up photography and questions of the
                archive from the beginning of the twentieth century and different fetishes with
                materiality and physical mementos. The modernist works that Goble explores <cit><quote
                    rend="inline" source="#goble2010">manifest a shared commitment to the more
                    sensuous and visceral experiences of other mediums that communicate somehow
                    outside the competence of verbal expression, or, in more contemporary terms, in
                    excess of its narrow bandwidth</quote>
                <ptr target="#goble2010" loc="16"/></cit>. What Goble truly gives us is a keen reader’s
                eye, one that pays particular attention to the materiality of text.</p>
            <p>The choices for both the media and the personalities that comprise the subject here
                are very particular, and seem to represent Goble’s own interests and strengths.
                Still, this kind of book offers an approach to thinking through media scholarship
                that might be expanded to still others working within the field. The logic is
                focused by a kind of close reading of both subject matter and form itself, and
                offers this analysis to artifacts that might be otherwise ignored, such as old
                phonograph print advertisements. In this way, Goble manages to analyze media within
                other media, contexts on contexts — nicely layering his thesis as it may be situated
                within several different places. One version of the thesis may be that <cit><quote
                    rend="inline" source="#goble2010">Modernism encouraged a unique structure of
                    feeling toward the technologies of art and literature — in all the specificity
                    of their material aesthetics</quote>
                <ptr target="#goble2010" loc="25"/></cit>, but also, <cit><quote rend="inline"
                    source="#goble2010">If media now are love, we should know why</quote>
                <ptr target="#goble2010" loc="25"/></cit>. And after reading Goble’s book, we begin to
                have a sense of the relationship between media and love, communicability and the
                careful formalism of modernism.</p>
            <p>The book is also a testament to the willingness of Berkeley’s English department —
                where Goble may be found — to become more interdisciplinary. After all, connecting
                Henry James to Friedrich Kittler is no small feat. However, I expect we’ll find this
                kind of methodology increasingly prominent as English scholars learn to think within
                the context of media themselves. The containers of meaning, alongside content, offer
                an area of study which a select few — notably Katherine Hayles — have been helping
                to lead the charge on for some years now.</p>

                    we know it is not going to return. But the digital technologies that are the
                    future also look a lot like history, and maybe there is still modernism enough
                    to hunt us back to mediums that we have left behind. What we do with them next

                <ptr target="#goble2010" loc="318"/></cit>. Goble’s book is itself beautiful — the
                symmetry of thought and organization in <title rend="italic">Beautiful Circuits
                </title>has an alluring aesthetic that is carefully tied to the book’s shimmering
                criticism. In its subject matter, a heightened sense of glamour saturates the
                decadence with which Goble envisions communication occurring — there is no plain,
                everyday talk here — this is modernism and form explored with
                    <foreign>jouissance</foreign>, not just pleasure.</p>
