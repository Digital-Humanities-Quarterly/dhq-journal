                <!-- Include a brief abstract of the article -->
                <p>The need for organising and digitally processing the vast amount of Cultural
                    Heritage (CH) information has recently led to the development of formal
                    knowledge representation models (ontologies) for the CH domain. Existing models,
                    however, do not capture gender-related concepts. This article presents an effort
                    to fill this gap by developing a new ontology for the representation of gendered
                    concepts in CH resources. The new ontology, named <title rend="quotes"
                        >GenderedCHContents</title> resulted from combined research in women’s
                    studies, gender theory, and computer science. Its primary aim is to draw
                    attention to the presence of women within CH artefacts. The proposed ontology
                    extends the Europeana Data Model (EDM) with twenty-two new classes, sixteen
                    object properties and seven datatype properties. The article presents a
                    demonstration of the <title rend="quotes">GenderedCHContents</title> ontology’s
                    use in five different representation tasks, which describe five resources
                    related to Pandora’s myth. Lastly, the study stresses the benefits of reasoning
                    support (i.e. enabling computers to infer further information from a set of
                    asserted facts) in revealing different gender ideals and inferred relationships
                    between metaphorical concepts, along with the benefits of the Semantic Web in
                    making information about gendered contents more easily retrievable to the
                    users.</p>

                <head>Introduction</head>
                <p>The <title rend="quotes">GenderedCHContents</title> ontology is a formal model
                    for semantically describing gendered aspects of the content of Cultural Heritage
                    (CH) resources. It has been designed by extracting relevant concepts from five
                    different artefacts (two textual resources and three digital images) depicting
                    Pandora. We chose Pandora’s myth because it forms a representative sample of
                    ancient beliefs about the creation of the first woman and an example which
                    displays a variety of metaphors regarding women’s roles and characteristics.
                    Further, by using resources from different periods (8th-7th and 5th centuries
                    BC, and 16th and 19th centuries AD), which are inspired by the same myth and
                    thus, by representing different implementations of the same myth, the ontology
                    enables users to compare and obtain insights about the historical backgrounds
                    and the gendered ideas that each resource entails. Therefore, this study aims to
                    evoke a critical representation of gender ideals in a historical perspective
                    (see Section Scope and Overview of the Ontology). </p>
                <p>With this ontology, we aim to open the way to bridge the gap of querying and
                    accessing semantic data on the Web related to gender concepts (i.e.
                        <term>GenderRoles</term>, <term>GenderIdentity, GenderedTraits</term>, etc.)
                    through a semantics-based representation of the content of CH artefacts: that is
                    focusing on the description of graphic or literal representation of entities
                    within the CH artefacts. The ontology is extensible so that further
                    gender-related concepts can be added as extensions (e.g. subclasses) to its
                    current structure.</p>
                <p>This study is focused on women but at the same time the designed ontology enables
                    the representation of figures of all genders and statuses. The focus on women is
                    justified as an attempt to underline the importance of combining Semantic Web
                    applications and gender studies in order to reduce the gap between online
                    historical representations of women on the Semantic Web. We approach gender as a
                    mode of social construct which represents roles, norms, and meanings that
                    different societies assign to men and women. Thus, we chose to use the term
                    gender in the <title rend="quotes">GenderedCHContents</title> ontology, since
                    gender is what societies make of the biological differences between males and
                    females and the things associated with them <cit>
                        <quote rend="inline" source="#anderson2015">on account of their real or
                            imagined sexual characteristics</quote>
                        <ptr target="#anderson2015"/>
                    </cit>. As Kirkup notes, gender is seen as <cit>
                        <quote rend="inline" source="#kirkup2000">a property of individuals, social
                            structures and symbolic systems. Gender relations are at the same time
                            power relations which lead to unequal access to material
                            resources</quote>
                        <ptr target="#kirkup2000" loc="3"/>
                    </cit>. In this framework, the ontology can be seen as a semantic tool for
                    organising and accessing gender-related concepts, but also as a means to enable
                    semantics-based search over the Web (e.g. such as in <ref
                        target="http://collection.britishmuseum.org/"
                        >http://collection.britishmuseum.org/</ref>). This is a more efficient and
                    effective way to retrieve CH artefacts in relation to gender, compared to
                    traditional keyword-based search. </p>
                <p>In order to represent the gendered contents of CH artefacts so that this
                    information can be more accessible on the Web, we used technologies from the
                    Semantic Web. To develop the <title rend="quotes">GenderedCHContents</title> we
                    extended the Europeana Data Model (EDM), which acts as an integration medium for
                    collecting, connecting and enriching descriptions of Europe’s CH data <ptr
                        target="#europeana2014" loc="8"/>. We took into consideration the
                    restrictions and capabilities of the Web Ontology Language (OWL) and the
                    feminist criticism of ontologies and Artificial intelligence (AI).<note>For
                        further information related to feminist critiques of logic, languages and
                        organisation of information see Olson <ptr target="#olson2007"/> who
                        examines traditional/Aristotelian logic and its feminist critiques; and
                        Bath’s remarks on formalisation <ptr target="#bath2009"/>.</note> The main
                    reasons for choosing OWL as the ontology language were its compliance with the
                    Resource Description Framework (RDF), which is the standard metadata model for
                    the Web; its ability to express complex semantic relationships among the objects
                    represented in CH artefacts; and its support for inference, which makes it
                    possible to deduce further ontological knowledge, not explicit in the code.
                    Finally, we used the Protégé ontology editor to implement and validate the
                            ontology.<note><ref target="http://protege.stanford.edu"

                <p>We first present the theoretical and technical background of our work. We then
                    present the “GenderedCHContents” ontology and a demonstration of its use in five
                    different representation tasks related to Pandora’s myth. Finally, we summarise
                    and discuss our plans for further validation of the ontology.</p>

                    <p>Feminist theories of gender and technology, as Wajcman points out, have
                        changed perspectives over the years. In the 1960s, early second-wave
                        feminism generated a fatalism, which focused on the role of technology in
                        reproducing patriarchy. On the other hand, during the 1990s, cyberfeminism
                        approached digital technologies as <cit>

                            <ptr target="#wajcman2007" loc="287"/>
                        </cit>. Recently, feminist scholars such as Faulkner <ptr
                            target="#faulkner2001"/>, Oudshoorn et al. <ptr target="#oudshoorn2004"
                        /> and Wajcman <ptr target="#wajcman2004"/> have followed a co-construction
                        approach to gender and technology, criticising technological determinism
                            <ptr target="#wajcman2007" loc="287–288"/>. This determinism, as
                        Björkman discusses, was detected in feminist/gender works regarding computer
                        science (CS), where research focused on gender equality aspects and CS was
                        seen as neutral and objective <ptr target="#bjorkman2005" loc="179"/>.
                        Contrary to this belief, our study approaches the relationship between
                        gender and technology as one of mutual shaping, <cit>
                            <quote rend="inline" source="#wajcman2007">where neither gender nor
                                technology is taken to be pre-existing, nor is the relationship
                                between them immutable</quote>
                            <ptr target="#wajcman2007" loc="288"/>
                        </cit>. Therefore, we do not approach CS as neutral; on the contrary, we
                        chose a gendered vocabulary when designing the <title rend="quotes"
                            >GenderedCHContents</title> ontology in order to fill the gap of
                        representing gendered concepts on the Semantic Web (see Section The <title
                            rend="quotes">GenderedCHContents</title> Ontology).</p>
                    <p>We acknowledge that the task of combining feminist theories and computer
                        science is epistemologically challenging. On the one hand, feminists have
                        criticised universal categorical distinctions. On the other hand, ontologies
                        use abstract sets of elements, called classes, to group together specific
                        objects with shared properties to represent a domain. Despite this
                        contradiction, we chose to create a structured representation of gendered
                        information to describe CH contents and demonstrate the socially constructed
                        nature of categorical distinctions. By making this information available and
                        retrievable, we aim to enable users to analyse the historically and socially
                        constructed views on gender as found in CH artefacts. We took into
                        consideration Lorber’s call for a feminist de-gendering movement in order to

                        retrieval of gendered contents. Secondly, it opens the path for a
                        de-gendered methodology in annotating CH objects by firstly acknowledging
                        and representing the gendered norms found within artefacts.</p>
                    <p>The study takes into account the feminist epistemological approach of the

                        </cit>. Specifically, we focus on the Content of CH artefacts and attribute
                        situatedness within the class <term>Entity</term>, which is a subclass of
                            <term>Content</term>. <term>Entity</term> (<term>Person</term> /
                            <term>Animal</term> / <term>Object</term> / <term>Demigod</term> /
                            <term>Deity</term>) represents a figure/character depicted on a CH
                        artefact which has specific emotions, posture, identity, roles,
                        characteristics etc. within a given space, time and activity. Therefore, in
                        this study, <term>Entity</term> is perceived as a carrier of gender ideals
                        and the ontology provides the vocabulary to describe <term>Entity</term> and
                        its gender connotations. </p>
                    <p>In order to provide a description of an <term>Entity</term> we focus firstly
                        on the information found in the primary source and then on the secondary
                        sources which provide an analysis of the primary sources in terms of
                        content, symbolisms and meanings (e.g. to describe Pandora as found in
                        Rossetti’s Victorian oil painting, we consulted Pandora’s description from
                        the book <title rend="italic">Pandora’s box</title>
                        <ptr target="#panofsky1956" loc="108–110"/> and the Rossetti Archive
                        website) (see Section Ontology Validation and Demonstration). We are aware
                        that the same content can have multiple subjective
                            <soCalled>readings</soCalled>. However, we believe that by providing
                        access to different interpretations of the same <term>Entity</term>, the
                        user can obtain a more complete and coherent idea of the complexities of the
                        contents of CH artefacts, i.e. Pandora might be seen as a symbol of goodness
                        or evilness, and both interpretations can be represented with the ontology.
                        This may lead to the retrieval of contradictory information, which will
                        enable users to do their own analysis and interpretation of the entities’
                        roles and significations. </p>
                    <p>Furthermore, we underline the importance of expressing semantic relationships
                        among the objects represented in CH artefacts by using RDF in line with
                        Olson’s view of the <q>web</q> and <q>connecting knowing</q> rather than
                        following a linear and hierarchical structure as practised in catalogues,
                        indexing and databases. In this spec, Olson presents three approaches: <cit>

                        the current study aims at demonstrating entities’ roles and relations with
                        other classes within CH artefacts. </p>

                            representation of information on the Web in a structured,
                            machine-interpretable format, thereby allowing automated reasoning, i.e.
                            enabling computers to detect inconsistencies or infer new information
                            from a set of asserted facts, and advanced added-value services on the
                            uploaded data. The Semantic Web and related semantic technologies build
                            on ontologies, which provide a means to formally define the basic terms
                            and relations that comprise the vocabulary of a certain domain of
                            interest. As such, they essentially represent the schema that the
                            associated data descriptions should follow. To be usable in the
                            uncontrolled Web environment, ontologies, as well as their associated
                            data, need to be represented in a uniform, platform-independent,
                            machine-interpretable and semantically-enriched format, using a generic
                            language. This need is covered by the standard data model for
                            representing information in the Semantic Web, RDF, which models data
                            using triples (s, p, o), denoting that a <term>subject</term> (s) is
                            associated with an <term>object</term> (o) via a <term>property</term>

                            domain-specific semantics, using simple constructs (classes, properties
                            and individuals) and relationships (class and property subsumption).
                            RDFS also supports some basic types of reasoning, via the transitivity
                            of the subsumption hierarchies, and its propagation to the
                            classification of individuals into classes/properties. For even more
                            sophisticated semantics and reasoning, OWL and its more recent version,

                            have become dominant. These allow more expressive semantics, such as the
                            specification of custom properties for relations (e.g. transitivity or
                            symmetry), existential or universal quantifiers, operations among
                            classes (union, intersection, complement) and others. These languages
                            have been widely used to model information in different domains,

                        the fact that in contemporary culture, material objects are not perceived as
                        social agents but on the contrary, they are perceived as socially neutral,
                        and thus, they empower and maintain their embodied social relations <ptr

                        relations. In other words, technologies can influence the ways in which

                    <p>These considerations made, the current study aims to identify and

                        there are some issues with regard to simplistic <q>identification</q> of
                        such relations, i.e. assuming transparency of these relations within
                        objects. The study aims to avoid simplifications by consulting secondary

                        the specific technology must be made in order to identify gendering
                        processes and find design methodologies that enable the modelling of the
                        de-gendered technology <ptr target="#bath"/>. The study takes the above into
                        account, but rather than de-gendering technology, the proposed gendered
                        vocabulary in the <title rend="quotes">GenderedCHContents</title> ontology
                        is intended to open the way of identifying gendering processes in CH
                        artefacts. It does so by making gendered contents accessible in order to
                        enable users to gain insights into inscribed cultural norms and gender
                        beliefs in different historical periods. </p>
                    <p>Moreover, our study aligns with Mulvey’s view on representations of women in
                        art, as presented in the <title rend="italic">Encyclopedia of Gender and
                            Society</title>. Specifically, Mulvey, as cited in O’Brien <ptr
                            target="#obrien2009"/>, pointed out that, since art and virtual culture <cit>
                            <quote rend="inline" source="#obrien2009">are not merely reflections but
                                also sites of construction of gender identities, they make an apt
                                site for feminist and queer interventions through the production of
                                alternative representations</quote>
                            <ptr target="#obrien2009" loc="44"/>
                        </cit>. Thus, by acknowledging that CH artefacts are reflections of views of
                        different societies, the focus of the ontology on metaphors aims to reveal
                        these social reflections. It is also acknowledged that <q>woman</q> is not a
                        solid and unchanged concept but is connected to ideas of specific periods,
                        places and societies. </p>

                            builds upon the EDM, which collects, connects and enriches the
                            descriptions provided by Europeana content providers. EDM is aligned to
                            CIDOC-CRM in its definition of an event-centric model. In order to
                            implement its tasks, the EDM uses two main categories. Firstly, it
                            re-uses elements from other namespaces; specifically, from the RDF and
                            the RDFS namespaces, the Open Archives Initiative Object Reuse and
                            Exchange (OAI-ORE) namespace, the Simple Knowledge Organization System
                            (SKOS) namespace, the Dublin Core namespaces for properties from the
                            elements, terms and types namespaces, the W3C Data Catalog Vocabulary
                            (DCAT) namespace, and the Creative Commons (CC) namespace.<note><ref

                            Secondly, it uses the elements introduced by EDM <ptr
                                target="#europeana2014" loc="8"/>.</p>
                        <p>Despite the development of these ontologies, as Doerr comments, museums
                            do not show an interest in using discrete schema elements to analyse
                            iconographic representations <ptr target="#doerr2009" loc="474"/>.
                            Similarly, Damiano and Lieto underline that there is a contradiction
                            between the huge quantity of resources published on the Web in recent
                            years, and the inadequate way that these resources are described. As
                            they note: <quote rend="block" source="#damiano2013">the way they are
                                described is far from meeting the requirements of content-based
                                access required by the general public: neither their description in
                                terms of editorial metadata nor the tags added by users seem
                                adequate to describe the content of media resources, and fall short
                                of providing an effective access to digital media. <ptr
                                    target="#damiano2013" loc="76"/></quote></p>
                        <p>By developing the <title rend="quotes">GenderedCHContents</title>
                            ontology, we suggest that a content-based description of artefacts is
                            essential, especially in the field of CH, in order to facilitate the
                            retrieval of gender-related concepts and encourage different
                            interpretations of CH artefacts. As Damiano and Lieto further mention,
                            media studies show that users, when tagging artworks, tend to describe
                            the content of the artworks <ptr target="#damiano2013" loc="76"
                            />. Therefore, a description of the content of CH artefacts could be
                            useful to users in order for them to obtain a more holistic idea of the
                            represented artworks or even question and rethink represented gender
                            norms and beliefs. </p>
                        <p>Different story ontologies have also been developed recently, aiming to
                            model narrative concepts. For example, the BBC’s <title rend="quotes"
                                >News Storyline</title> Ontology is a generic model that describes
                            and organises the stories that news organisations present, but it is
                            focused on the representation of news rather than on CH artwork
                                    stories.<note><ref

                                >OntoMedia</title> ontology was developed in order to represent
                            heterogeneous media by semantically describing their content. Thus, its
                            scope is to enable users <cit>

                        <p>Another example, the Labyrinth system, which is targeted at CH
                            dissemination and digital publishing, focuses on the notion of <quote

                            is based on the <title rend="quotes">Archetype ontology</title>
                            <ptr target="#damiano2013" loc="77"/>. This ontology has been designed
                            to support reasoning <cit>

                            </cit>. Its role-based schema is closer to the aims of this study, since
                            the focus of the <title rend="quotes">GenderedCHContents</title>
                            ontology is centred on the concept <term>Entity</term>
                                (<term>Person</term> / <term>Animal</term> / <term>Object</term> /
                                <term>Demigod</term> / <term>Deity</term>). The current study,
                            therefore, was influenced by Archetype’s aim but did not follow the same
                            developing strategies in defining the basic concepts and properties
                            because the central role here is found within entities and their gender
                            relations rather than on the stories. </p>

                    <p>The <title rend="quotes">GenderedCHContents</title> ontology (see Figure 1)
                        was developed as an extension of the EDM to semantically describe gendered
                        CH contents. Since EDM does not provide the capability for representing
                        gendered concepts, we focused on filling this gap. EDM uses Dublin Core’s
                        property, <term>dc:description</term>, which <cit>
                            <quote rend="inline" source="#dcmi">may include but is not limited to:
                                an abstract, a table of contents, a graphical representation, or a
                                free-text account of the resource</quote>
                            <ptr target="#dcmi"/>
                        </cit>. Since EDM specifies that it is mandatory to supply either a
                            <term>dc:description</term> or a <term>dc:title</term>
                        <ptr target="#europeana2014" loc="51"/> for a resource, it is evident that
                        limited information about the content of the resource is provided to the
                        user, and, when provided, it is in a free-text form. Currently, users can
                        search the Europeana website using keywords (search terms); they can also
                        browse its material using facets for collections, media, terms of use,
                        providing country, language, aggregator and institution. There is no facet,
                        however, related to the content of artefacts (see Figure 2). </p>

                        <head>Graphical Representation of the <q>GenderedCHContents</q> Ontology.
                            The code of the ontology is available at: <ref
                                target="https://github.com/ucldis/dh/blob/master/GenderedCHContents.owl"

                    </figure>

                    <p>Moreover, the description of a resource is represented (by the underlying
                        ontology) via an annotation property, and therefore has the form of <q>flat
                            text</q>. As a result, to retrieve a resource based on the description
                        of its content, the user has to use the exact keywords from the description
                        of the resource, which makes the task even more difficult. This is because
                        annotation properties do not carry any meaning under the direct semantics of
                        the ontology language <ptr target="#antoniou2012" loc="104"/>. In the <title
                            rend="quotes">GenderedCHContents</title> ontology we represent gendered
                        concepts and their relationships using classes, object and datatype rather
                        than annotation properties, enabling a semantics-based description of
                        gendered contents. </p>

                    <head>Procedure</head>
                    <p>The general steps we followed for the creation of the ontology were the
                        following: first, we represented the relevant concepts as ontology classes
                        by choosing the gendered vocabulary and its definitions as found in the
                            <title rend="italic">Encyclopedia of Gender and Society</title>
                        <ptr target="#obrien2009"/> while investigating and extracting relevant
                        concepts from the textual and pictorial representations of Pandora in five
                        resources. Specifically, we used information from two textual resources:
                        Hesiod’s <title rend="italic">Theogony</title> and <title rend="italic">Work
                            and Days</title> (8th–7th century BC). We also used three digital images
                        of Pandora, from respectively the red-figured wine bowl (calyx-krater) vase
                        of the classical period attributed to the Niobid Painter, the 16<hi
                            rend="superscript">th</hi> century Pieter Serwouter’s engraving, and
                        Rossetti’s Victorian oil painting (1871) (see Figures 3a, b, c). By
                        semantically describing the figure of Pandora as expressed in resources from
                        different periods, we aimed to explore the different implementations of the
                        myth and enable a comparative representation of the notion of woman over
                        place and time. The <title rend="quotes">GenderedCHContents</title> ontology
                        provides abstract classes to describe individual objects, as found in the
                        resources. Even if we use universal/abstract terms to describe a set of
                        elements (i.e. <term>Content</term>, <term>Entity</term>,
                            <term>Person</term>), we focus on the individual, partial and locatable
                        information that each artefact entails. </p>

                        Rossetti’s oil painting for Victorian period. We based our semantic

                    </p>
                    <p>The second step consisted of defining the ontology properties that relate the
                        ontology classes, specifying the property characteristics and constraints
                        over the elements of the ontology. We then instantiated the ontology with
                        individuals (or instances of the classes), which are the basic, <q>ground
                            level</q> components of an ontology, and with property assertions
                        (statements) to describe Pandora in the five resources. </p>
                    <p>The benefit of providing a structure of abstract classes and their
                        relationships with the classes to which the individual objects belong, is
                        that it enables the formation of semantic annotations and, as a result, the
                        semantics-based retrieval and access to that specific information. For
                        example, Pandora is an instance of the class <term>Person</term> and is also
                        related to other classes in that it has specific <term>GenderRoles</term>,
                            <term>GenderIdentity</term>, <term>GenderedTraits</term> (see Section
                        Main Classes). By semantically annotating her description in different CH
                        artefacts, the user can obtain insights about her depiction and her roles
                        within a primary source and compare that representation with other sources
                        of different periods. Thus, the ontology provides the schema to represent
                        gendered descriptions of CH artefacts. This, however, does not mean that all
                        classes or properties need to be used when describing an artefact, since for
                        each individual artefact this description may vary (i.e. correspond to
                        multiple classes and relationships) or some classes and properties might not
                        always be applicable for certain instances. </p>

                        <p>We extended the EDM with a new class named <term>Content</term> (see
                            Figure 4), which we defined as a subclass of
                                <term>E89_Propositional_Object</term>, for it provides a description
                            of the content of CH artefacts. This new class represents the thematic
                            topics that each resource is related with. In the case of literary
                            resources <term>Content</term> refers to <cit>
                                <quote rend="inline" source="#baldick2008">what is said in a

                            </cit>; and in the case of visual resources, to describe what is
                            depicted on them. The thematic topics are usually the results of an
                            interpretation of the meaning of CH artefacts, which takes into account
                            their historical and cultural context.</p>
                        <p>Although each content consists of a narrative, we decided not to include
                            the term <q>narrative</q> in the class <term>Content</term> in order to
                            emphasise that content contains a narrative which is expressed through
                            some medium, in this case an image or a text. Thus, by using the term
                                <term>Content</term>, we applied the more general concept, which
                            denotes the connection with the form and context of CH artefacts.</p>
                        <p>We added three new classes, <term>Non-representationalContent</term>,
                                <term>RepresentationalContent</term> and
                                <term>SignifiedConcepts</term>, as subclasses of
                                <term>Content</term> (see Figure 4). The first two are used to
                            distinguish artefacts based on the structure of their contents.
                                <term>Non-representationalContent</term> refers to abstract and
                            non-figurative art or literary description which does not aim to
                            reference reality, whereas <term>RepresentationalContent</term> refers
                            to depictions of figures, etc. This distinction is not absolute, in the
                            sense that an artefact may be associated to more than one of the
                            subtypes of content.</p>
                        <p>The class <term>SignifiedConcepts</term> borrows the <q>term</q>
                            signified from Semiotics <ptr target="#saussure1986"/> and is used to
                            connote meanings that entities may carry and, in this case, meanings
                            related to gender symbolisms. We defined this class as a subclass of
                                <term>Content</term> to show that every <term>Entity</term>, which
                            is a subclass of <term>Content</term>, can potentially refer or stand
                            for something other than itself (see Figure 5). This class enables the
                            representation of metaphors related to women and, thus, an illustration
                            of these symbolisms through the meanings that the concepts convey. For
                            example, <term>HesiodsTheogonyPandora</term> isAssociatedWith
                                <term>Laziness</term> (see Section Ontology Validation and
                            Demonstration, Metaphors). We declared all other classes of our ontology
                            (e.g. <term>Entity</term>, <term>Body</term>,
                                <term>EmbodiedActivity</term> etc.) as subclasses of
                                <term>RepresentationalContent</term>, since this superclass contains
                            all the representational entities which convey descriptive
                            characteristics about gender. </p>

                        <p>The core concept of this ontology is the class <term>Entity</term>, which
                            is the <q>starting point</q> for detecting, describing and accessing
                            figures of women within a content. <term>Entity</term> includes the
                            subclass <term>Person</term>, which represents all women’s figures.
                                <term>Entity</term> contains all entities that have distinct and
                            independent existence, being and form. Therefore, <term>Animal</term>,
                                <term>Object</term>, <term>Deity</term> and <term>Demigod</term> are
                            also subclasses of this class. We declared <term>Person</term> as

                        <p>Unlike FOAF, our ontology differentiates between real and imaginary
                            people by using two subclasses of <term>Person: RealPerson</term> and
                                <term>UnrealPerson</term>. The first refers to people who lived in
                            real life – there is historical evidence of their existence – whereas
                                <term>UnrealPerson</term> refers to all characters and figures that
                            are fictional, mythological and imaginary. With this grouping we aim to
                            reveal different ideas about characteristics and roles that historical
                            and imaginary entities represent in specific contents. The ontology can
                            be further extended in the future by adding properties which can
                            demonstrate similarities and differences between the two classes. We
                            acknowledge that the categorisation of CH artefacts can be a complex
                            process, in that for example, it is not historically clear if the
                            ancient Greeks believed in their myths <ptr target="#veyne1988"/> and if
                            Pandora was seen as a historical or as a mythological figure in Hesiod’s
                            period, or even, whether she was perceived as a mythological figure in
                            the classical period. The ontology offers the flexibility to support all
                            these different presumptions by enabling an individual (e.g. Pandora) to
                            belong to one of or both subclasses of <term>Person</term>
                                (<term>RealPerson</term> and <term>UnrealPerson</term>),
                            demonstrating the complexity of interpreting the content of CH

                        <p><term>Deity</term> class refers to supernatural beings and conveys ideas
                            about the sacred. Since <quote rend="inline" source="#obrien2009"
                                >images of deities reflect and shape understandings of sexual
                                difference and the cultural meanings attached to biological

                            one can either directly associate it to the main class

                            described by or as performed in the resources. By creating the class
                                <term>GenderIdentity</term> we aimed to include all categorisations
                            that have been historically made and, based on these, to represent all

                            to stereotypically gendered activities that genders may perform (such as

                        </figure>

                        <p>All properties except <term>isAssociatedWith</term>,
                                <term>isSymbolFor</term> and <term>symbolises</term>, have
                                <term>Entity</term> as their domain. This choice underlines the
                            focus on the <term>Entity</term> class to represent the gendered
                            characteristics, roles, emotions, etc., which this class relates with.
                            In order to represent the appearance of an entity, we added the
                                <term>hasAppearance</term> property with
                                <term>EmbodiedAppearance</term> as range. The
                                <term>hasAppearance</term> has two subproperties:
                                <term>hasHairstyle</term> and <term>wears</term>, with ranges
                                <term>Hairstyle</term> and <term>Dress</term> respectively, to
                            demonstrate the physical characteristics and appearance of the figure.
                            The <term>bears</term> property also contributes to the descriptive
                            representation of the entity, since it has <term>Accessory</term> or
                                <term>Entity</term> as range, describing any accessories (e.g. bags)
                            or living beings (e.g. babies) that someone may <term>bear</term>. The
                                <term>poses</term> property, with <term>Posture</term> as range
                            denotes movements of the body, gestures, body position and attitudes
                            connected to the body. To describe an activity that an entity is engaged
                            in, we added the property <term>performsActivity</term> with
                                <term>EmbodiedActivity</term> as range. We also added the
                                <term>hasGenderRoleOf</term> property, with <term>GenderRoles</term>
                            as range, to describe an entity’s social role. To demonstrate the
                            different <term>GenderedSkills</term>, <term>GenderedEmotions</term>,
                                <term>GenderedTraits</term> and <term>GenderIdentity</term> of an
                            entity we added the four following properties (which respectively have
                            the above classes as their ranges): <term>HasSkills</term>,
                                <term>hasEmotions</term>, <term>isCharacterisedAs</term>,
                                <term>hasGenderIdentity</term>. The relation between different
                            entities can be described using the <term>relatesWith</term> property,
                            which we defined as symmetric since it is equivalent to its inverse <ptr
                                target="#antoniou2012" loc="106"/>.</p>
                        <p>In order to represent the symbolisms that concepts entail, we created the
                                <term>symbolises</term> property with <term>Content</term> as domain
                            and <term>SignifiedConcepts</term> as range. This means that each entity
                            that is part of a content potentially denotes a specific meaning.
                            Further, in order to connect the symbol/signifier to the signified
                            idea/meaning, we added two more properties which are inverse to each
                            other: <term>isSymbolFor</term> and <term>isSymbolisedBy</term>. The
                            latter has <term>Entity</term> as domain and <term>Content</term> as
                            range (and vice versa for <term>isSymbolFor</term>). With this model,
                            entities that have the role of symbols in specific contents and entities
                            that are described by symbols are equally represented. In order to
                            connect an entity that has a symbolic/metaphorical meaning with a
                            concept that is related with the same meaning, we defined the
                                <term>isAssociatedWith</term> property with
                                <term>SignifiedConcepts</term> as domain and <term>Entity</term> as
                            range. The ontology also reuses some of EDM’s object properties in order
                            to demonstrate the subject of the resource and to relate it with other
                            similar resources.</p>
                        <p>In addition to the object properties, we also added seven datatype
                            properties (see Figure 7) that associate instances of the class
                                <term>Entity</term> to certain data values (e.g. numbers, strings,
                            or dates). The domain of all these properties is, therefore,
                                <term>Entity</term> and the range is rdfs:Literal, which is a
                            built-in RDF class. </p>

                        <p>Specifically, <term>hasRelationToGenderNorms</term> denotes whether a
                            certain entity, through its embodied activity, appearance and role,
                            complies with the gender norms ascribed to the individual’s gender
                            within its historical framework. This categorisation can be made by
                            consulting secondary sources which analyse stereotypical behaviours and
                            gender norms in the period in which an entity is presented (e.g. for
                            women’s roles in the ancient world, James and Dillon’s <ptr
                                target="#james2015"/> and Cohen’s <ptr target="#cohen1994"/> works
                            can be consulted). This property enables a representation of women’s
                            figures that repudiate specific norms and roles. It takes either
                                <q>complied</q> or <q>not complied</q> as its value. In this way,
                            the ontology can be seen as a research resource for identifying the
                            changes between following or changing the ascribed gender norms in
                            different CH artefacts. </p>
                        <p>Another important aspect that we attempt to implement with this ontology
                            is the association of a figure with its social circumstances in order to
                            show the link between social, economical and political factors that may
                            influence and partially determine a figure. For this reason, we added
                            the properties <term>hasSocialStatus</term> and
                                <term>hasSocialClass</term>, which describe an individual’s social
                            position and reflect the roles, activities and identities that an
                            individual holds within a social system. The acceptable values for
                                <term>hasSocialStatus</term> are: <q>has status</q>, <q>no
                                status</q>. This simplified model aims to be as inclusive as
                            possible. Therefore, by denoting whether an entity has a status or not,
                            we can group entities based on this characteristic. We acknowledge that
                            in some situations this is not applicable or may be seen as an absolute
                            classification. However, as a first step it would be interesting to
                            gather figures that apply to this model and, as a second step,
                            reconsider the use and naming of the specified values. The same applies
                            to the property <term>hasSocialClass</term> since the only values it
                            accepts are: <q>lower</q>, <q>middle</q>, <q>upper</q>, and <q>not
                                applicable</q>. The limitation of this design is that these values
                            classify an individual with values that represent social systems from
                            the eighteenth century onwards, reflecting capitalist societies, whereas
                            structures of earlier societies are not represented.<note>See Delle et
                                al. <ptr target="#delle2000"/> for a presentation of material
                                culture as an active agent in the negotiation of social
                                difference.</note> For this reason, we included <q>not
                                applicable</q> as an acceptable value, to demonstrate that this is
                            not the only hierarchical classification, and that it cannot be
                            universally applied. </p>
                        <p>Another aspect captured by the ontology is the way that an entity is
                            associated with health. We made this design choice because there is a
                            broad literature referring to women and health, and how women are
                            connected to mental disorders like hysteria, etc. in different
                            historical periods (see, e.g. <ptr target="#annandale2008"/>, <ptr
                                target="#tasca2012"/>, <ptr target="#gilman1993"/>, <ptr
                                target="#king1998"/>, and <ptr target="#king2009"/>). The property
                                <term>hasStateOfHealth</term> with acceptable values <q>healthy</q>,
                                <q>mentioned illness</q>, <q>not mentioned</q> and <q>unhealthy</q>,
                            aims to classify each individual according to a specific state of health
                            as represented within the resource. Therefore, it enables the retrieval
                            of cases where mentioned/recognisable illness or representations of
                            women in unhealthy states are displayed. This will make it possible for
                            researchers to identify the kind of illness that a figure is illustrated
                            with and reflect on ideas about health and body. </p>

                            </cit>. In order to represent the space-time in which a character/entity
                            exists, as presented in the sources, we added two datatype properties:
                                <term>actsWithinSpace</term> and <term>performsWithinTime</term>.
                            The former enables the semantic annotation of space and has rdfs:Literal
                            as its range. It, therefore, accepts any used-defined values that denote
                            space. Some possible values are: <q>abstract</q>, to represent a
                            non-representational space/place; <q>indoors</q> or <q>outdoors</q>;
                                <q>private</q> or <q>public</q>; and <q>specified</q> or
                                <q>non-specified</q> to denote whether there is a recognisable named
                            place. The use of terms <q>public</q> and <q>private</q> aims to
                            incorporate gendering theories of spaces<note>See <ptr
                                    target="#gieseking2014"/> for the ways in which space and place
                                are produced through large- and small-scale social, political, and
                                economic practices.</note> – when this information is transparent –
                            and map the spaces where entities are presented. This is not an
                            exhaustive list; depending of the content, new values can be added to
                            describe space efficiently. Moreover, <term>actsWithinSpace</term> has
                                <term>actsWithinGenderedSpace</term> as a subproperty to allow the
                            semantic annotation of gendered spaces (i.e. women’s quarters in
                            households, gender-specific restrictions in baths and temples, etc.)
                            where this information is transparent within the artefact. Currently,
                                <term>performsWithinTime</term> accepts the following values:
                                <q>abstract</q>, when time is not specified; <q>ancient period</q>
                            (3600 BC – 500 AD), <q>medieval period</q> (500 – 1500), <q>early modern
                                period</q> (1500 – 1750) and <q>modern period</q> (1500 – present)
                            to specify the historical time period in which an entity is presented;
                                <q>day</q> and <q>night</q>; <q>narrative past</q>, <q>narrative
                                present</q> and <q>narrative future</q> to represent cases where an
                            entity is clearly presented within a narrative and her/his actions,
                            descriptions etc. refer to an explicit past, present or future of
                            narrative time. The ontology provides the flexibility to add new values
                            for representing more fine-grained dates. </p>

                    <p>The third step of ontology development was to define restrictions on the
                        classes and properties of the ontology. Aiming to develop a generic
                        ontology, which enables the representation of as many different resources as
                        possible, we only added a small number of restrictions. For example,
                        although declaring <term>RealPerson</term> and <term>UnrealPerson</term> as
                        disjointed or as complementary to each other seemed to be a reasonable
                        choice, we decided not to declare the distinction, considering that some
                        resources may represent figures of uncertain historical status. </p>
                    <p>We defined one pair of inverse properties: <term>isSymbolisedBy</term> and
                            <term>isSymbolFor</term>, as mentioned in the previous section, to
                        underline the reciprocal relationship between signifier and signified. </p>
                    <p>We also defined a property chain, as shown below (see Figure 8).</p>

                    </figure>


                    <p>We defined <term>isAssociatedWith</term> as a property chain of
                            <term>isSymbolisedBy</term> and <term>symbolises</term>. This means that
                        if an individual of <term>Entity</term> class <term>isSymbolisedBy</term> a
                        specific content, and the content <emph>symbolises</emph> an individual of
                            <term>SignifiedConcepts</term> class, then it is inferred that the same
                            <term>Entity</term>
                        <term>isAssociatedwith</term> the individual of
                            <term>SignifiedConcepts</term>.</p>
                    <p>We added a class equivalence axiom to denote that <term>Person</term> is
                        equivalent to <term>foaf:Person</term>, which EDM reuses, since both classes
                        contain exactly the same set of individuals. </p>
                    <p>We defined <term>Demigod</term> as the intersection of <term>Deity</term> and
                            <term>UnrealPerson</term>. This means that every member of
                            <term>Demigod</term> is also a member of the <term>Deity</term> and
                            <term>UnrealPerson</term>. </p>

                    <p>The verification and validation of the ontology has two goals <ptr
                            target="#vrandecic2009" loc="295"/>: to verify its correctness with
                        respect to the syntax and semantics of the ontology language – OWL in our
                        case – and to assess its representational capabilities for modelling the
                        domain it was designed for – in our case, the gendered concepts in the CH
                        domain. To achieve the first goal, we used the HermiT OWL
                                Reasoner,<note><ref target="http://hermit-reasoner.com "
                                >http://hermit-reasoner.com</ref></note> which is pre-installed in
                        Protégé. HermiT can check the logical consistency of an ontology; but it can
                        also make inferences, e.g. deduce subsumption relationships between classes,
                        based on the semantics of OWL. We conducted the verification while we were
                        developing the ontology, so that we could identify and correct errors early
                        in the development process.</p>
                    <p>For our second goal, we instantiated the ontology with RDF descriptions of
                        the five resources, related to the myth of Pandora (see Section Procedure).

                            (<term>performsActivity</term>) stands in the centre of an abstract

                        wreaths; her appearance is represented by means of the clothes she
                            <term>wears</term> and her hairstyle. Ιndividuals like
                            <q>LongHairWithADottedFillet</q>, <q>Apoptygma</q> and
                            <q>DoricChiton</q> – which we added as values of the

                            <term>hasHairstyle</term> – are also directly associated to the

                        relationships are in yellow in Figure 9).</p>

                    <head>Metaphors</head>
                    <p>An important feature of the proposed ontology is the representation of
                        metaphors related to gendered contents. Examples of metaphors can be
                        detected in Hesiod’s <title rend="italic">Theogony</title> (see Figure 10)
                        in <title rend="italic">Works and Days</title> (see Figure 11) and in
                        Rossetti’s Pandora (see Figure 15). In these cases, inferences can be made
                        in terms of symbolic concepts. Specifically, Figure 10 depicts the inference
                        that <title rend="italic">Theogony’s</title> Pandora
                            <term>isAssociatedWith</term>
                        <q>Laziness</q>; Figure 11 that Pandora <term>isAssociatedWith</term>
                        <q>PlagueToMen</q>; and Figure 15 that she <term>isAssociatedWith</term>
                        <q>Evils</q>. This is achieved by the application of the property chain
                        discussed in the previous section.</p>

                    <p>We also attempted to represent the mythological figures of Vice and Virtues,
                        which are referred to in Serwouter’s accompanying poem and in the engraving
                        (see Figures 3b,13). According to the poem, Jupiter filled Pandora’s box
                        with good and evil to ensure a balanced state of affairs <ptr
                            target="#panofsky1956" loc="82"/>.</p>

                    <figure>
                        <head>Example of Serwouter’s Pandora Property Assertions</head>
                        <graphic url="resources/images/figure13.png"/>
                    </figure>

                    <p>When Pandora opens the box, the Virtues, that symbolise <q>good</q>, escape
                        into the air and Vice spreads all over the earth. Thus, as depicted in
                        Figure 14, <q>Vice</q> and <q>Virtues</q> are connected to the box through
                        the <term>relatesWith</term> property, and the concepts that they symbolise
                        appear as values of the property <term>symbolises</term>. It is, therefore,
                        inferred that <q>Evils</q> are associated with Vice and the signified
                        concept of evil. Also, Rossetti’s Pandora (see Figure 15) associates with
                        the evils that come out of the box, but in this case <q>Evils</q> have the
                        form of smoke and not an anthropomorphic form, which is stated as follows:
                        Pandora <term>poses</term>
                        <q>EnvelopedBySmokeOfEvils</q>.</p>

                    <p>In the above examples, we also demonstrate the symmetry of
                            <term>relatesWith</term>. Another example, which demonstrates this
                        feature, is this: Pandora in Serwouter’s engraving <term>relatesWith</term>
                        Epimetheus since she is his future wife, and therefore it is inferred that
                        Epimetheus relates to Pandora (see Figure 16).</p>

                    <p>We classified <q>Virtues</q> using a specific gender identification (see
                        Figure 14). We decided to represent them as <q>women</q> to enable the
                        description of their anthropomorphic characteristics, but also to capture
                        gendered notions related to women, for example the notions of good and evil,
                        as traits inherited in woman’s <q>nature</q>. However, although
                            <q>Virtues</q> may appear to have a female bodily figure (see Figure
                        3b), they still have non-human characteristics such as the ability to fly.
                        Therefore, we additionally classified them as <term>UnrealPerson</term>.
                        Thus, by simultaneously representing <q>Virtues</q> as
                            <term>RealPerson</term> and <term>UnrealPerson</term>, the ontology
                        enables the description of this instance using characteristics of both
                        classes. </p>
                    <p>Lastly, similarities in appearance like long dress, wreath/crown and beauty,
                        as expressed in different periods, are aspects that our ontology can also
                        capture. Accordingly, by using, for example, the
                            <term>edm:isSimilarTo</term> property to connect Niobid’s Pandora to the
                        other two digital artworks of Pandora, and considering that this property is
                        a subproperty of <term>dc:relation</term>, it can be inferred that Niobid’s
                        Pandora is related to those artworks. The benefit of extending the EDM is
                        evident in the last example, where our ontology enables us to interrelate
                        all resources that share the same or relevant topic and contents (see Figure
                        17).</p>

                    <p>We conclude that interpretations about the box and the goods and evils that
                        Pandora and the box as gifts to men entail, are represented differently in
                        the five examples. The emotions, activities, skills and postures are also
                        depicted differently: from an emotionless Niobid’s Pandora represented as a
                        wooden statue to Rossetti’s Pandora where the first woman is transformed to
                        a femme fatale figure <ptr target="#panofsky1956" loc="109"/> (see Figure
                        15).</p>

                    <head>Further Validation</head>
                    <p>We acknowledge that the specific instantiation of the ontology was only a
                        first step towards its validation. As Vrandecic notes, <cit>
                            <quote rend="inline" source="#vrandecic2009">most validation approaches
                                require the close cooperation of domain and ontology engineering

                        </cit>. Therefore, as a further step, we suggest a more concrete and
                        complete validation in collaboration with experts from the CH domain, who
                        will evaluate different aspects of the ontology such as its vocabulary and
                            semantics.<note>See <ptr target="#vrandecic2009"/> for a description of
                            different evaluation approaches. </note>
                    </p>
                    <p>Simultaneously, in order to evaluate the effectiveness of the ontology in the
                        context of its application, we propose as a next step, a task-based approach
                        to ontology evaluation. That is to tag ontological relations from a broader
                        range of artefacts, including Psyche’s, Persephone’s, Atalanta’s and Helen’s
                        representations in CH artefacts. More specifically, we suggest using a
                        larger subset of study, including these myths, in order to test further how
                        the ontology can be applied to semantically represent women and their
                        relation to symbolic objects, such as the box in Psyche’s myth <ptr
                            target="#apuleius1922"/>, and the symbolic role of the golden apple in
                        Atalanta’s and Helen’s myths. </p>
                    <p>This task-based evaluation can follow the same procedure we used to represent
                        Pandora in the five CH artefacts (see Section Procedure) and will describe

                <head>Summary and Future Work</head>
                <p>In this article we propose the <title rend="quotes">GenderedCHContents</title>
                    ontology as an attempt to investigate ways in which different historical
                    artefacts, when interpreted today, can create a gendered conceptual map of
                    women’s representations. The development of the ontology is a first step in
                    bringing closer gender studies and Semantic Web technologies, aiming to
                    represent semantically gendered contents on the Web. We are aware of the
                    possible objections, epistemological debate or controversy inherent in any
                    attempt to combine feminism and ontology engineering. Nevertheless, we consider
                    it vital to pursue and find a way to reconcile – even if via compromise – these
                    fields in order to semantically represent gendered concepts within CH artefacts. </p>
                <p>Taking into account the expressive power of OWL, the proposed ontology captures
                    different types of relationships between gendered concepts and their contexts.
                    For example, object and datatype properties provide a means to describe certain
                    attributes of CH artefacts and their contents, as well as ways in which they may
                    relate to each other. The subsumption relation of OWL enables a taxonomic
                    representation of the relevant concepts and their relationships; property
                    characteristics (e.g. symmetry) and axioms (e.g. inverse properties and property
                    chains) enable inferring further relationships among the individuals; and
                    restrictions on the classes and properties (e.g. value restrictions) were used
                    to impose constraints on the range of semantic descriptions that one can create
                    with the ontology. Our aim was to create a model which is generic enough to
                    capture most relevant concepts and their relationships, concise so that it is
                    easy for users to understand and create their own semantic descriptions, but
                    also extensible to further types of information, which are not currently
                    captured. </p>
                <p>Finally, we suggest a further validation of the ontology by applying a task-based
                    evaluation, in which the ontology will be tested with other sources.</p>
