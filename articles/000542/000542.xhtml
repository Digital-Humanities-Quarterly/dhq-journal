                     Yet,
                     how did the SIG come into formation? The following is an interview about why and how
                     the
                     AVinDH SIG was founded. The interview was conducted on June 20th 2020 via the online

                     of DH?

                  <div class="counter"><a href="#p4">4</a></div>
                  <div class="ptext" id="p4"><span class="hi bold">Franciska:</span> We were interested in a form of dialogue with scholars
                     working with audiovisual data and computational methods. As a linguist who had built
                     up
                     expertise in search technology to open up spoken word archives, I had already expanded
                     my
                     focus from data related to the study of language to audio and video collections that
                     are
                     part of the cultural heritage domain. Both Erasmus University Rotterdam and the
                     Netherlands Institute for Sound and Vision were keen on presenting their work stemming
                     from two international projects, AXES and Post-Yugoslav Voices. The best way to engage
                     with peers, in our view, was to organise a workshop for the audience that we envisioned.
                     However, the overwhelming interest and enthusiasm from the side of the presenters
                     and the
                     audience was a surprise to us. We were clearly filling a gap. After having heard about
                     the
                     possibility to set-up a Special Interest Group that could be endorsed by ADHO (Alliance
                     of
                     Digital Humanities Organisations), we immediately took action and submitted a <a href="https://avindhsig.wordpress.com/background" onclick="window.open('https://avindhsig.wordpress.com/background'); return false" class="ref">proposal</a>.
                  </div>
                  
                  <div class="counter"><a href="#p5">5</a></div>
                  <div class="ptext" id="p5"><span class="hi bold">Stefania:</span> I specifically recall how one of the presenters involved
                     in research on sound archives confided to the audience that "at last she did not feel
                     as
                     the odd one out at a DH conference". Does it mean that DH approaches to audiovisual
                     data
                     had a backlog compared to textual data?
                  </div>
                  
                  <div class="counter"><a href="#p6">6</a></div>
                  <div class="ptext" id="p6"><span class="hi bold">Franciska:</span> I don't think so. I think they operated in different
                     circles. They presented their work at conferences on media studies, sound studies,
                     oral
                     history, and computer science. They published their work in journals that stemmed
                     from
                     these specific networks. If I think of the first projects that were set up in the
                     Netherlands to apply state-of-the-art software to open up cultural heritage archives,
                     we
                     published in proceedings of conferences about software development for the study of
                     language, or journals about digitisation.
                  </div>
                  
                  <div class="counter"><a href="#p7">7</a></div>
                  <div class="ptext" id="p7"><span class="hi bold">Max</span>: I agree, but at the same time, when compared to the tools that
                     existed at the time to search for patterns in massive amounts of text, the audiovisual
                     realm did have a backlog. In the workshop proposal that we put together for DH2014,
                     we
                     claimed that it was a matter of urgency to develop new tools for extracting information
                     from audiovisual archives in the same way as could be done with text, particularly
                     given
                     the prospect of the exponential growth of (moving) images on the web that was envisioned
                     in 2014. We could, at the time, still refer to the audiovisual as a "blind" medium
                     for
                     retrieval, quoting Sandom and Enser, because of the need for sequential viewing to
                     extract
                     knowledge from the source (Sandom and Enser, 2001). It is remarkable how in only six
                     years
                     time this claim seems no longer valid given the progress in Computer Vision and Speech
                     Retrieval.

                  <div class="ptext" id="p8"><span class="hi bold">Stefania:</span> The central themes of the subsequent workshops seem to
                     reflect this progress. We tackled obstacles for the integration of AV in DH at DH2014
                     in
                     Lausanne, formally installed the SIG in DH 2015 in Sydney, discussed multimodality
                     at
                     DH016 in Krakow, explored computer vision at DH2017 in Montreal, hosted a tutorial
                     on
                     Distant Viewing at DH2018 in Mexico City, and set-up hands-on sessions with audiovisual
                     research infrastructures at DH2019 in Utrecht. Could you say that the SIG had a
                     considerable role in this progress?

                  <div class="ptext" id="p9"><span class="hi bold">Martijn:</span> I think that gives too much credit to the SIG, as if we had
                     formulated specific objectives from the start and were consciously selecting topics
                     and
                     papers that reflected the state-of-the-art. Our approach was actually quite pragmatic.
                     We
                     wanted to create a structure for people with similar research interests to meet, either
                     through the mailing list, or via the yearly conference. I think what was key for the
                     role
                     of the SIG, was its institutional embedding. Being endorsed by ADHO meant a secured
                     slot
                     in each pre-DH conference program that could draw the attention of scholars who would
                     otherwise primarily share their work within their traditional mono-disciplinary scholarly
                     realm.

                     momentum around that time. You could say that the SIG presented itself at the optimal
                     moment, in contingency with other important developments, such as national and cross
                     national funding for opening up audiovisual heritage for the general audience and
                     scholars.

                  <div class="ptext" id="p12"><span class="hi bold">Martijn:</span> Well the first key lecture was given by prof. Andreas
                     Fickers, who was already a central figure in the EU project on cultural heritage of
                     television, EU Screen, and now runs the Centre for Contemporary and Digital History
                     (C2DH)
                     in Luxemburg. Scholars working on building up the large scale research infrastructure
                     for
                     humanities research such as CLARIAH in the Netherlands, including professor of Digital
                     Culture Heritage Julia Noordegraaf, were well represented at all the SIG's workshops.
                     This
                     applies also for the Media Ecology Project of Mark Williams from Dartmouth, and for
                     Lauren
                     Tilton and Taylor Arnold's work on Distant Viewing. Yet, there is no way of telling
                     whether our program really reflected the state-of-the-art in this field. I recall
                     that at
                     some point at DH2017 in Montreal I approached a researcher who I expected would have
                     had
                     an interest in presenting at our SIG pre-conference workshop, but the reply was that
                     he
                     preferred to present at a slot within the conference. This gave me food for thought
                     about
                     whether our SIG served as a kind of incubator, for scholars that in a next stage moved
                     on
                     to a slot in the main conference.

                  <div class="ptext" id="p13"><span class="hi bold">Stefania:</span> With regard to representativeness, you are right that we
                     cannot make any claim, but I can offer a rough sketch of the contributions from 2014
                     until
                     now, based on a review of the workshops at the annual DH conference. What I see is
                     that
                     most papers or short talks were about innovations in technologies to extract visual
                     or
                     aural features either from a single collection, from a homogenous archive, or from
                     an
                     archive with collections in different formats. Next in line was the topic of annotation
                     in
                     music and audiovisual collections. The innovation in these types of papers were
                     represented by the possibility to automatically enrich manual annotations with computer
                     generated links by applying the principles of Linked Open Data. There were some papers
                     that focused less on tool development and more on the analysis of content, like the
                     study
                     of changes in voices in news coverage or the use of colours in film. Specifically
                     at the
                     workshop in Krakow, the theme of multimodality featured contributions that evolved
                     around
                     education and pedagogy. There was also some interest in restoration, preservation,
                     and
                     loss of data on the web. Other topics across the workshops included copyright, oral
                     history, art, metadata and interface design. The most striking shift in the programme
                     of
                     the SIG, that in a way reflects the increasing maturity of the field, is from a space
                     with
                     papers presentation to hands-on tutorials. In Mexico 2018 and Utrecht 2019, the workshop
                     followed more closely a traditional workshop format and offered opportunities to try
                     out
                     the tools that had been envisioned in talks in the previous workshops.

                     but when you step out of our AVinDH bubble and look at the statistics that Scott Weingart
                     collected of the previous DH conferences, you can see that it is still a niche, well
                     established, but with an abundance of alternatives to present work on computational
                     approaches to AV. There are a lot of factors that play a role in determining the interest
                     of scholars working with audiovisual data to profile themselves as digital humanists.

                  <div class="ptext" id="p15">It would really be worthwhile to conduct a more detailed study about the type of
                     contributions, the affiliations, the platforms where work is published, and the
                     professional trajectories of scholars involved in this type of DH work to get a better
                     sense of how AV in DH researchers are advancing the field.

                  <div class="ptext" id="p16"><span class="hi bold">Stefania:</span> To conclude, I would like to pay tribute to our late
                     Canadian colleague Clara Henderson, an ethnomusicologist working at Indiana University,
                     who joined the SIG as a representative of the American hemisphere in Sydney DH 2015.
                     This
                     was where the SIG AvinDH was formally approved by ADHO. Her background in ethnomusicology
                     helped widen the scope of the SIG beyond the realm of media studies. We were deeply
                     saddened when we received the news in Autumn 2016 that Clara had passed away after
                     a short
                     illness. Thinking of all the plans with the SIG that she had in mind and tasks that
                     she
                     was willing to take up, I would like to dedicate this little thread in the immense
                     tapestry of DH scholarship that brings people together across the continents to her
                     memory
