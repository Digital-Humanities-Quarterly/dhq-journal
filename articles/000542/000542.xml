        <head>Introduction</head>
        <p>The special issue was initiated by the <ref target="https://avindhsig.wordpress.com"
            >Special Interest Group Audio/Visual</ref> in Digital Humanities, a group that brings
          together community participants who share an interest in audio and/or visual data. Yet,
          how did the SIG come into formation? The following is an interview about why and how the
          AVinDH SIG was founded. The interview was conducted on June 20th 2020 via the online
          application Microsoft Teams.</p>
        <p><hi rend="bold">Stefania:</hi> How did you sense the need for such a SIG in the context
          of DH?</p>
        <p><hi rend="bold">Franciska:</hi> We were interested in a form of dialogue with scholars
          working with audiovisual data and computational methods. As a linguist who had built up
          expertise in search technology to open up spoken word archives, I had already expanded my
          focus from data related to the study of language to audio and video collections that are
          part of the cultural heritage domain. Both Erasmus University Rotterdam and the
          Netherlands Institute for Sound and Vision were keen on presenting their work stemming
          from two international projects, AXES and Post-Yugoslav Voices. The best way to engage
          with peers, in our view, was to organise a workshop for the audience that we envisioned.
          However, the overwhelming interest and enthusiasm from the side of the presenters and the
          audience was a surprise to us. We were clearly filling a gap. After having heard about the
          possibility to set-up a Special Interest Group that could be endorsed by ADHO (Alliance of
          Digital Humanities Organisations), we immediately took action and submitted a <ref
            target="https://avindhsig.wordpress.com/background">proposal</ref>.</p>
        <p><hi rend="bold">Stefania:</hi> I specifically recall how one of the presenters involved
          in research on sound archives confided to the audience that "at last she did not feel as
          the odd one out at a DH conference". Does it mean that DH approaches to audiovisual data
          had a backlog compared to textual data?</p>
        <p><hi rend="bold">Franciska:</hi> I don't think so. I think they operated in different
          circles. They presented their work at conferences on media studies, sound studies, oral
          history, and computer science. They published their work in journals that stemmed from
          these specific networks. If I think of the first projects that were set up in the
          Netherlands to apply state-of-the-art software to open up cultural heritage archives, we
          published in proceedings of conferences about software development for the study of
          language, or journals about digitisation.</p>
        <p><hi rend="bold">Max</hi>: I agree, but at the same time, when compared to the tools that
          existed at the time to search for patterns in massive amounts of text, the audiovisual
          realm did have a backlog. In the workshop proposal that we put together for DH2014, we
          claimed that it was a matter of urgency to develop new tools for extracting information
          from audiovisual archives in the same way as could be done with text, particularly given
          the prospect of the exponential growth of (moving) images on the web that was envisioned
          in 2014. We could, at the time, still refer to the audiovisual as a "blind" medium for
          retrieval, quoting Sandom and Enser, because of the need for sequential viewing to extract
          knowledge from the source (Sandom and Enser, 2001). It is remarkable how in only six years
          time this claim seems no longer valid given the progress in Computer Vision and Speech
          Retrieval.</p>
        <p><hi rend="bold">Stefania:</hi> The central themes of the subsequent workshops seem to
          reflect this progress. We tackled obstacles for the integration of AV in DH at DH2014 in
          Lausanne, formally installed the SIG in DH 2015 in Sydney, discussed multimodality at
          DH016 in Krakow, explored computer vision at DH2017 in Montreal, hosted a tutorial on
          Distant Viewing at DH2018 in Mexico City, and set-up hands-on sessions with audiovisual
          research infrastructures at DH2019 in Utrecht. Could you say that the SIG had a
          considerable role in this progress?</p>

          <graphic url="resources/images/figure01.png"/>
        </figure>
        <p><hi rend="bold">Martijn:</hi> I think that gives too much credit to the SIG, as if we had
          formulated specific objectives from the start and were consciously selecting topics and
          papers that reflected the state-of-the-art. Our approach was actually quite pragmatic. We
          wanted to create a structure for people with similar research interests to meet, either
          through the mailing list, or via the yearly conference. I think what was key for the role
          of the SIG, was its institutional embedding. Being endorsed by ADHO meant a secured slot
          in each pre-DH conference program that could draw the attention of scholars who would
          otherwise primarily share their work within their traditional mono-disciplinary scholarly
          realm.</p>
        <p><hi rend="bold">Franciska:</hi> Computational approaches to audiovisual data were gaining
          momentum around that time. You could say that the SIG presented itself at the optimal
          moment, in contingency with other important developments, such as national and cross
          national funding for opening up audiovisual heritage for the general audience and
          scholars.</p>
        <p><hi rend="bold">Stefania:</hi> Could you give some examples of these initiatives, and
          were key people in these projects involved in our workshops?</p>
        <p><hi rend="bold">Martijn:</hi> Well the first key lecture was given by prof. Andreas
          Fickers, who was already a central figure in the EU project on cultural heritage of
          television, EU Screen, and now runs the Centre for Contemporary and Digital History (C2DH)
          in Luxemburg. Scholars working on building up the large scale research infrastructure for
          humanities research such as CLARIAH in the Netherlands, including professor of Digital
          Culture Heritage Julia Noordegraaf, were well represented at all the SIG's workshops. This
          applies also for the Media Ecology Project of Mark Williams from Dartmouth, and for Lauren
          Tilton and Taylor Arnold's work on Distant Viewing. Yet, there is no way of telling
          whether our program really reflected the state-of-the-art in this field. I recall that at
          some point at DH2017 in Montreal I approached a researcher who I expected would have had
          an interest in presenting at our SIG pre-conference workshop, but the reply was that he
          preferred to present at a slot within the conference. This gave me food for thought about
          whether our SIG served as a kind of incubator, for scholars that in a next stage moved on
          to a slot in the main conference.</p>
        <p><hi rend="bold">Stefania:</hi> With regard to representativeness, you are right that we
          cannot make any claim, but I can offer a rough sketch of the contributions from 2014 until
          now, based on a review of the workshops at the annual DH conference. What I see is that
          most papers or short talks were about innovations in technologies to extract visual or
          aural features either from a single collection, from a homogenous archive, or from an
          archive with collections in different formats. Next in line was the topic of annotation in
          music and audiovisual collections. The innovation in these types of papers were
          represented by the possibility to automatically enrich manual annotations with computer
          generated links by applying the principles of Linked Open Data. There were some papers
          that focused less on tool development and more on the analysis of content, like the study
          of changes in voices in news coverage or the use of colours in film. Specifically at the
          workshop in Krakow, the theme of multimodality featured contributions that evolved around
          education and pedagogy. There was also some interest in restoration, preservation, and
          loss of data on the web. Other topics across the workshops included copyright, oral
          history, art, metadata and interface design. The most striking shift in the programme of
          the SIG, that in a way reflects the increasing maturity of the field, is from a space with
          papers presentation to hands-on tutorials. In Mexico 2018 and Utrecht 2019, the workshop
          followed more closely a traditional workshop format and offered opportunities to try out
          the tools that had been envisioned in talks in the previous workshops.</p>
        <p><hi rend="bold">Max:</hi> This may sound like the field is constantly growing within DH,
          but when you step out of our AVinDH bubble and look at the statistics that Scott Weingart
          collected of the previous DH conferences, you can see that it is still a niche, well
          established, but with an abundance of alternatives to present work on computational
          approaches to AV. There are a lot of factors that play a role in determining the interest
          of scholars working with audiovisual data to profile themselves as digital humanists.</p>
        <p>It would really be worthwhile to conduct a more detailed study about the type of
          contributions, the affiliations, the platforms where work is published, and the
          professional trajectories of scholars involved in this type of DH work to get a better
          sense of how AV in DH researchers are advancing the field.</p>
        <p><hi rend="bold">Stefania:</hi> To conclude, I would like to pay tribute to our late
          Canadian colleague Clara Henderson, an ethnomusicologist working at Indiana University,
          who joined the SIG as a representative of the American hemisphere in Sydney DH 2015. This
          was where the SIG AvinDH was formally approved by ADHO. Her background in ethnomusicology
          helped widen the scope of the SIG beyond the realm of media studies. We were deeply
          saddened when we received the news in Autumn 2016 that Clara had passed away after a short
          illness. Thinking of all the plans with the SIG that she had in mind and tasks that she
          was willing to take up, I would like to dedicate this little thread in the immense
          tapestry of DH scholarship that brings people together across the continents to her
          memory.</p>

            visualisation of AV in DH conferences and to the members of the former Steering Group
            who were willing to share their memories and insights.</emph></p>
