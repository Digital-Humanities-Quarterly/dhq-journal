                  <p>In this paper, we present our preliminary reflections on whether minimal computing
                     as
                     a practice can extend beyond “computing done under some
                     technological constraints” to served as a common ground between different
                     digital humanities research dynamics in the Global North and South. We explore this
                     question by commenting on our experience in developing and teaching an undergraduate
                     course to students enrolled from both the University of Maryland, College Park in
                     the
                     United States and Universidad del Salvador in Buenos Aires, Argentina. The class was
                     delivered for its first iteration in September–November 2020 and introduced students
                     to digital publishing and textual scholarship of bilingual Spanish and English texts,
                     presenting minimal computing as a shared set of values including: use of open
                     technologies, ownership of data and code, and reduction in computing
                     infrastructure.</p>

                     technological constraints” [<a class="ref" href="#workinggroup2021">Minimal Computing Working Group</a>], but also were at
                     the core of a global digital humanities commons? Could this commons model a set of
                     shared principles and technologies to empower students and scholars to work
                     autonomously on their own projects? With these questions in mind, researchers from
                     the University of Maryland, College Park in the United States and the National Scientific
                     and Technical Research Council (Consejo Nacional de Investigaciones Científicas y
                     Técnicas, CONICET) in Argentina designed a joint course, delivered for the first time
                     from
                     September–November 2020, to teach minimal computing approaches to North and South
                     American students. The class introduced students to digital publishing and textual
                     scholarship with minimal computing presented as a shared set of values: use of open
                     technologies, ownership of data and code, reduction in computing infrastructure and,

                     course, which will continue through 2022 at minimum, positions minimal computing as
                     an approach that can bring together students from the North and the South in the same

                     graduate and postgraduate programs, summer schools, centers, labs, books, and
                     journals, the Latin American and Spanish humanidades digitales is still defining
                     itself and pondering how to devise a curriculum of its own [<a class="ref" href="#delrioriande2015">del Rio Riande 2015</a>].
                     However, both share a defining feature: their continuous growth as part of our
                     contemporary digital and digitized world. This shared feature has led many
                     scholars to redefine their work under the impact of the digital and to consider
                     the consequences of a “global turn” that has put into question many aspects of

                     considerable shift in 2013 when the Global Outlook Digital Humanities (GO::DH)
                     Special Interest Group of the Alliance for the Digital Humanities Organizations
                     (ADHO) was founded. GO::DH pointed out the importance of problematizing digital
                     humanities as a field built and understood from multiple perspectives [<a class="ref" href="#gil2016b">Gil and Ortega 2016</a>],
                     something that the Alliance for Digital Humanities Organizations (ADHO)
                     addressed both in DH2015 in Australia — named <cite class="title italic">Global Digital

                     humanities at DH2016 in Kraków [<a class="ref" href="#odonnell2016">O’Donnell et al. 2016</a>]. This trend is also
                     confirmed by the annual Global Digital Humanities Symposium that has been taking
                     place at Michigan State University since 2016 and in initiatives such as the IFLA

                     event that proves how the global dimension of digital humanities has had an impact

                     changing the governance and the financial model of ADHO, expanding its boundaries

                     humanities, it is crucial to remember that the concept of the “global” is complex
                     and even contradictory, especially when related to technology in all its facets.
                     In the context of global digital humanities, “technology” includes: <em class="term">software architecture</em>, or the availability and cost of
                     software solutions and the expertise to develop and adopt them; <em class="term">infrastructure as hardware</em>, or the availability and cost of computers,
                     peripherals, and other instruments capable of supporting the research software and
                     approaches a digital humanities project may need; and <em class="term">infrastructure as long-term preservation</em>, or the strategies, data
                     management plans, and institutional support needed for guaranteeing the
                     availability of digital humanities research outputs in the future. This technology,
                     as Anne Cong-Huyen argues, is never “neutral” or truly “global”:</div>
                  
                  <blockquote>
                     <p class="ptext">[D]igital and electronic technologies are of particular importance because they
                        are often perceived as being neutral, without any intrinsic ethics of their own,
                        when they are the result of material inequalities that play out along racial,
                        gendered, national, and hemispheric lines. Not only are these technologies the
                        result of such inequity, but they also reproduce and reinscribe that inequity
                        through their very proliferation and use, which is dependent upon the perpetuation
                        of global networks of economic and social disparity and exploitation.  [<a class="ref" href="#conghuyen2013">Cong-Huyen 2013</a>]</p>

                  <div class="ptext" id="p8">The term
                     “global” moreover, is itself a paradox: global impacts are perceived differently
                     at local and regional levels, and there is no single and unique process of
                     globalization, but rather a set of different processes with global dimensions. For
                     example, while Global North digital humanities scholars have focused on
                     understanding diversity and awareness of linguistic privilege, interrogating the
                     degree to which global technological practices can exclude participation in the

                     Undoubtedly, even though Spain and many countries in Latin America and the
                     Caribbean share a language, their social, cultural, epistemic, and economic
                     contexts are completely different. Spain is a country in the European Union, while
                     Latin America is the most unequal region in the world that groups more than twenty
                     countries that have been experiencing the impact of labor-saving technologies
                     since the beginning of the century [<a class="ref" href="#krull2016">Krull 2016</a>]. Also, it is important to note
                     that in Latin America the free, public dissemination of research has long been
                     understood primarily as a public good managed by the academic community. Scielo, the
                     largest open access harvesting platform in the
                     region, was founded in 1997, five years before the 2002 meetings in Budapest,
                     Bethesda, and Berlin that produced the first open access declarations [<a class="ref" href="#budapest2002">Budapest 2002</a>] [<a class="ref" href="#bethesda2003">Bethesda 2003</a>] [<a class="ref" href="#berlin2003">Berlin 2003</a>].

                     these have been part of manifestos and debates in the last ten years but have
                     rarely been systemized. Todd Presner made the first emphatic assertion: “The digital is
                     the realm of the open: open source, open resources [...]. Anything that attempts
                     to close this space should be recognized for what it is: the enemy” [<a class="ref" href="#presner2009">Presner 2009</a>].
                     One year later, the Paris Manifesto focused on the technical aspects of
                     what “open” means in digital humanities: “[W]e call for open access to data and

                     wanted to have more control over the software that they and their governments
                     used. The Latin American Free and Open Source Software (FOSS) movement is aligned
                     with
                     the Latin American Open Science movement. Both share a strong sense of common
                     ownership for the common good. Based on this, many networks like reGOSH have
                     highlighted how the region could benefit from the development of open scientific
                     tools, as a way of overcoming dependence on equipment suppliers in the Global
                     North and increasing its digital autonomy.<a class="noteRef" href="#d4e514">[11]</a> However, as we discussed above, Latin American countries have the most
                     unequal income distribution in the world which results in research inequalities
                     across the region [<a class="ref" href="#amarante2016">Amarante et al. 2016</a>]. As a result, the allocation of resources
                     for research in Latin America is in great disproportion to those in developed
                     countries. This is the case of HD CAICYT Lab, the digital humanities laboratory at
                     Argentinian CONICET, which has been doing digital humanities research with very

                     America. HD CAICYT Lab has been creating minimal editions via a workflow built
                     around Recogito, an open source semantic annotation software developed by Pelagios

                     led a minimal computing workshop at the Second International Conference of the

                     [<a class="ref" href="#allestorrent2016">Allés-Torrent 2016</a>]. Scholars who attended the event felt empowered by the
                     possibility of working autonomously on their own editions, and minimal computing
                     was understood as a solution for the development of projects where access to
                     infrastructure such as web hosting or even reliable and affordable Internet access
                     is limited for humanities students and faculty. For our lab, HD CAICYT, minimal
                     computing turned into the solution for computing done under technological

                     Digital Publishing with Minimal Computing. Our combined experiences present our
                     students with a perspective on minimal computing that is not entirely dependent on
                     digital humanities practices in the Global North, but rather one that is based on
                     a shared digital commons. Focusing on minimal computing allows us to teach the
                     fundamentals of scholarly editing and digital publishing through free and open
                     tools while engaging with issues of content ownership on the web that extend
                     beyond textual scholarship. Our course challenges students to publish without

                     the fate of the resources they create.</div>

                  <div class="ptext" id="p22">In December 2019, we proposed a course titled Digital Publishing with Minimal
                     Computing: Humanities at a Global Scale<a class="noteRef" href="#d4e609">[18]</a> to the Global Classroom Initiative (GCI) program at the University of
                     Maryland. This program offers support for the development of courses to be taught
                     in collaboration with a higher education institution outside of the United States,
                     with the goal of establishing courses that expose students to work that is
                     cross-cultural, project-based, and virtual; the GCI argues that these courses
                     mirror the work students will encounter throughout their lives. While this outcome
                     is somewhat dependent on the students’ career choices and opportunities, it is
                     evident that “globalization shrinks the world, bringing a wider range of cultures
                     into closer contact than ever before ” [<a class="ref" href="#unesco2013">UNESCO et al. 2013</a>]. Thus, preparing students to
                     participate in a globalized world is a worthwhile goal, particularly if this can
                     be done in a way that fosters intercultural competences.<a class="noteRef" href="#d4e620">[19]</a> The COVID-19 pandemic also exacerbated the virtual nature of this
                     contact, as we adapted to rely even more heavily on technological links to
                     collaborate both locally and globally.</div>

                     given that digital humanities research itself tends to be scaffolded through
                     project work that results in the development of artifacts such as tools or digital
                     publications [<a class="ref" href="#burdick2012">Burdick et al. 2012</a>, 124]. It is also connected to a multiliteracies
                     approach, which brings together linguistic diversity and multimodal forms of
                     expression and representation in response to changes in globalized technological
                     environments such as the Internet, and the growing linguistic and cultural

                     Teaching through a minimal computing lens,
                     moreover, greatly benefits from projects that exhort students to think both
                     globally and locally by recognizing the technological affordances they have access
                     to (as well as why and how) and by confronting the limitations and constraints
                     that work against them, whether in hardware, software, education, network
                     capacity, power, or indeed self-imposed limitations for pedagogical purposes. In
                     other words, we train our students to recognize the privileges of having access to
                     state-of-the-art computational resources as well as to devise strategies to
                     circumvent limitations they may encounter by adopting minimal computing
                     techniques. Students (and experts) from both cultural contexts are likely to
                     encounter such limitations to varying degrees. Even those who have access to
                     infrastructure through their institutions or future employers will encounter
                     issues with preservation and portability of the digital publication projects that
                     they have created. Learning to deploy minimal approaches can contribute to the
                     viability of a digital humanities project and give students greater control over
                     the future of their own work. This mimics and models to our students the role, as
                     we have discussed above, that minimal computing can play in establishing open and
                     global approaches for digital humanities research and pedagogy that willfully
                     reduce the gap between Global South and Global North contributions.</div>

                     the first to explore the applicability of this approach to humanities disciplines
                     through an National Endowment for the Humanities grant. The final white paper
                     reports on the twenty-four courses taught as part of the project and summarizes
                     the surveys completed by instructors and students [<a class="ref" href="#guth2013">Guth 2013</a>]. The results
                     highlighted how COIL courses offer a form of internationalization at home and a
                     “low-cost” alternative to study abroad exchange programs, which are typically
                     accessible to a very limited number of students, at least in the United States [<a class="ref" href="#li2013">Li 2013</a>].
                     More importantly, the study identified clear merits of a project-based,

                        helped students be more willing to see ideas, texts, works of art, etc. from
                        different perspectives. In some ways it was as if the students felt they had to
                        perform better because they saw their partner class as a new audience particularly
                        during synchronous audio/video sessions and in asynchronous discussion forums.

                     the lens of minimal computing, which, in itself, is an instrument for fostering

                     global digital humanities practice. Creating a course of this kind is necessarily
                     a collaborative process that takes time and requires exchange of ideas among
                     instructors. Over the seven months between first developing our GCI project and
                     the first iteration of the course in September 2020, we discussed our pedagogical
                     priorities, developed the syllabus, and created multilingual student resources
                     such as slides, tutorials, and guidelines.<a class="noteRef" href="#d4e712">[23]</a> English is
                     typically assumed to be the language of global communication, playing an important
                     role in both disseminating and seeking out information. As Ana Balula and Delfim
                     Leão argue, “In terms of information availability, which underpins the
                     co-construction of knowledge, the use of English as lingua franca promotes the
                     dissemination of research outputs and breakthroughs” [<a class="ref" href="#balula2019">Balula and Leão 2019</a>, 4].
                     Nonetheless, Ángela Giglia highlights the more localized nature of humanities
                     discourse: “SSH [Social Sciences and Humanities] research is often grounded in
                     specific cultural or geographical areas, hence the persistence of native languages
                     opposed to English as lingua franca in STEM [science, technology, engineering, and
                     mathematics]” [<a class="ref" href="#giglia2019">Giglia 2019</a>, 143]. Multilingualism and bibliodiversity, or the
                     diversity of academic content, are essential both at the national and
                     international levels to preserve research in a wide range of global and local
                     topics, studied from different epistemic and methodological approaches and

                     project-based learning (PBL), we conclude this section by describing how we
                     scaffolded the course activities through Joseph Krajcik and Phyllis Blumenfeld’s
                     five key features of project-based learning [<a class="ref" href="#krajcik2005">Krajcik and Blumenfeld 2005</a>]. The
                     first feature is identifying a driving question that relates to authentic
                     activities undertaken by researchers in digital humanities (more specifically in
                     digital textual scholarship), such as, “How do websites help us give new life to
                     historical texts?” Second, we explore the driving question via “situated learning”
                     [<a class="ref" href="#lave1991">Lave and Wenger 1991</a>] — that is, by working in a real-world context. Minimal
                     technologies for building websites allow our students to learn by doing with tools
                     that make it feasible to engage with the driving question, but that are also used
                     by professionals to develop open digital humanities artifacts. The third feature
                     is engaging in collaborative activities to solve problems; students tackle the
                     question and learn skills in groups made of individuals from both institutions,
                     which, as explained above, is essential to the development of intercultural
                     competences. The fourth feature recommends that PBL be “scaffolded with learning
                     technologies that help [students] participate in activities normally beyond their
                     ability” [<a class="ref" href="#krajcik2005">Krajcik and Blumenfeld 2005</a>, 318]. In our case these technologies
                     include bilingual learning materials and online collaboration channels that we
                     establish together with the students’ input. While minimal computing technologies
                     should, by definition, be within the students’ ability, our goal is to have the
                     students leverage these technologies to answer the driving question and engage
                     with textual scholarship work that will likely be unfamiliar to them. Finally, the
                     fifth feature is that students create artifacts that address the driving question
                     and that are “publicly accessible representations of the class’s learning”
                     [<a class="ref" href="#krajcik2005">Krajcik and Blumenfeld 2005</a>, 318]. Through structured assignments, each group
                     creates a bilingual public website containing the encoded and edited text,
                     together with paratextual content documenting their collaborative process and
                     their engagement with the driving question.</div>

                     but rather as an intentional methodological stance, strikes us as fundamental for
                     building a shared commons that is both open and global. Moreover, we are building
                     a bilingual syllabus (readings, tools, and project-based learning activities)
                     centered on minimal computing as a way of countering epistemic and knowledge
                     inequity [<a class="ref" href="#chan2019">Chan et al 2019</a>]. Our work purposely moves beyond a North-to-South
                     approach to curriculum and knowledge exchange to a synergetic North-and-South one,
                     aimed at empowering knowledge creation in the language(s) in which an individual
                     is most comfortable.</div>

                  <div class="ptext" id="p33">We are aware that minimal computing, and to some extent project-based learning,
                     are approaches developed in the North, and adopting them under the guise of an
                     internationalization agenda brings risks, such as overlooking local practices when
                     building and sharing knowledge in the classroom. We are also conscious that while
                     technology can increase access to knowledge, it may entrench cultural imperialism.
                     Nonetheless, we envision a middle ground by adapting tutorials and educational
                     materials, as well as balancing Spanish and Anglophone authors in the
                     bibliographies students should be reading. In this sense, our course emphasizes a

                     Rande note of TEI materials, “It is not enough for the Spanish-speaking
                     community to translate [these texts], since it is necessary to re-create the
                     problems and adapt existing materials to their own needs and examples”
