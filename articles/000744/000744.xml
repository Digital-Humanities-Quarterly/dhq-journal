         </p>
         <p>Cadastral maps, produced with meticulous quality standards from the early 19th centuryonwardsforlargepartsofEurope,offerauniqueandcomplexrepresentation of knowledge (W. T. Göderle 2017; W. Göderle 2023; Wheeler 2023; Femenia- Ribera, Mora-Navarro, and Pérez 2022). In the case of Habsburg Central Europe, where cadastral mapping occurred between 1816 and 1861, these maps provide detailed information on individual houses at a scale ranging from 1:720 to 1:5760, with a standard scale of 1:2880. They also document land use, contemporary roads and pathways, land boundaries, and other relevant data (N.N. 1824; Bundesamt für Eich- und Vermessungswesen 2017: 44).Apart from their historical significance, cadastral maps are valuable for contemporary spatial analysis, including environmental and transport history, building history, economic and social history, as well as questions related to land use and landscape transformation in the Anthropocene era, and resource extraction during the time of their creation (Ståhland Weimann 2022).</p>

         <p>They constitute a key resource for historical research into this region, as they enable the spatialization of historical processes, contexts and interdependencies. However, accessing and processing cadastral data pose challenges due to their multimodal structure and primary focus on image and geodata. This presents difficulties fordigitalhumanities,whichprimarilyoperateinthetextualdomain(Champion2017;Van Noord 2022). We are convinced that recent advances in the field of deep neural networks in particular open up opportunities for multimodal analysis of historical sources (Smits and Wevers 2020). This would open up entirely new opportunities in thefieldofanalyzingthosenon-writtensourcesthatemergedespecially(butnotonly) in Europe in the long 19th century. Sources such as the cadastre are unique and central representations of knowledge from this period, but have so far been insufficiently analyzed, especially in social and economic history research (Hosseini et al. 2021).</p>
         <p>Digitization has made cadastres more accessible to a wider audience, although accessingthephysicalvolumesstoredinarchivesremainschallengingforhistorians and researchers (Bundesamt für Eich- und Vermessungswesen 2017; Femenia- Ribera, Mora-Navarro, and Pérez 2022; Hagemans et al. 2022; McDonough 2024). Despite digitization efforts, the comprehensive evaluation of cadastral data, particularly in Habsburg Central Europe where 300,000 square kilometers were surveyed between 1816 and 1861, remains labor-intensive due to the sheer volume of individual map sheets documenting every aspect of land use and property(Bundesamt für Eich- und Vermessungswesen 2017).</p>
         <p>The FWF project RePaSE – Reading the Past from the Surface of the Earth – 2022 aimed to use AI-assisted extraction to identify historical building outlines and locations from geo-referenced map sheets of the Franziszeische Kataster (Franciscean Cadastre). This involved training an AI model for building extraction from both historical maps and modern high-resolution aerial and satellite images. By overlaying the extracted historical and present building information, the project soughttoidentifypotentialarchaeologicalsites,facilitatinglarge-scalearchaeological remote sensing. The hypothesis driving RePaSE is that by combining historical cadastral map data with modern satellite imagery, it's possible to identify regions where buildings once stood, aiding in the discovery of vanished structures and potentially significant archaeological sites.</p>
         <p>In addition to the cadastre, we worked with current spatial images in our study. We were supported by the relevant department of the Province of Styria, which provided us with high-resolution aerial photographs fromdifferent flight periods and two digital terrain models. It has been shown that even the transfer of information from georeferenced historical map images to different spatial representations of the present has enormous cognitive potential. We were able to draw on high-resolution aerialphotographsfrom1952,imagesfromthe1970s,1980sand1990s,andcurrent and extremely accurate images from recent years.</p>
         <p>TheresultsofRePaSE,andthetoolsthatemergefromit,shouldcreateopportunities for the digital humanities to deal analytically with the information contained in historicalmaps.Possibilitiesforautomatedsegmentationoftheinformationcontained therein would open up opportunities for us to further process data contained in maps quantitatively, or to utilize new possibilities for qualitative analysis (Hosseini et al.</p>
         <p>2021). In HGIS systems that contain georeferenced historical maps, it is already possible to calculate areas; automated segmentation would significantly advance historical analysis (Baeten and Lave 2020). Furthermore, new feature complexes could be defined and searched for automatically, extending the logics of distant reading to map analysis (Arnold and Tilton 2019). For example, mills not explicitly identifiedintheFrenchcadastrecouldbeautomaticallyidentified,whichwouldallow a profound analysis of hydropower use in Central Europe in the early 19th century and enable the investigation of local or regional differences.</p>
         <p>We consider neither cadastre nor satellite and high-resolution aerial photography authentic representations of reality, but as high-profile sources providing us with severallayersofresearchdata (Gil-FournierandParikka2021;Hosseinietal.2021).</p>

            <head>StateofResearch</head>
            <p>Despite the accessibility challenges mentioned above, there is substantial historical research that deals either with the construction of cadastral maps, or with the information stored in them(Dolejš and Forejt 2019).Already prior to digitization, cadastral maps have played an important role in historical and particularly archeologicalresearchonmicro-level(PetekandUrbanc2004).Cadastralmapshave been a research resource with regard to genealogical research for a very long time, they were used as sources in agricultural and environmental history and further environmental studies, in archeological remote sensing, in social and economic</p>
            <p>history, and with regard to the development of a broader understanding of the evolution of landscapes (Drobesch 2013; Rumpler 2013; Scharr 2024; Rumpler, Scharr, and Ungureanu 2015; Hohensinner et al. 2021). Their value, however, has frequentlybeendelimitatedby thedifficultaccessibilityofthedataandthedifficulties regarding the extension of analysis beyond relatively limited borders.</p>
            <p>Access to historical cadastral maps in Central Europe became publicly available relativelylate,withdatanowaccessiblethroughprojectslike<ref target="http://www.mapire.eu/">www.mapire.eu</ref>.Inmost cases, the digitization of cadastral maps is accompanied by georeferencing.</p>
            <p>However, these repositories often lack comprehensive metadata and may require payment for research use. Public authorities have increasingly made parts of the Franziszeische Kataster available online for research purposes, offering data at various quality levels for free (Pivac et al. 2021).Exploration of historical map data, including cadastral maps, has accelerated due to recent advancements in machine learning(Chiang et al. 2020; Budig 2017). Deep learning technologies, in particular (L.-C. Chen et al. 2016), have revolutionized feature extraction, focusing on streets (Ekim, Sertel, and Kabadayı 2021; Can, Gerrits, and Kabadayi 2021; Jiao, Heitzler, and Hurni 2021; Uhl et al. 2022; Jiao, Heitzler, and Hurni 2022) and buildings (Heitzler and Hurni 2020; Uhl et al. 2020) among other applications (Wu et al. 2023; RémiPetitpierre,Kaplan,andDiLenardo2021a;Garcia-Molsosaetal.2021).These advancements offer new possibilities for researchers in history, archaeology, and historical geography. Recent research has focused on feature extraction from cadastral maps, particularly in the context of the Venetian cadastre and the 1900 Atlas of Paris(Oliveira et al. 2019; Remi Petitpierre and Guhennec 2023).As Petitpierre and Guhennec pointout, consistentannotation is the main challenge with regard to automatized vectorization.</p>
            <p>However, the bulk of current research is directed towards the analysis of aerial and satellite imagery (Jiao, Heitzler, and Hurni 2022).This research spans a wide range of objectives and interests, with stakeholders including municipal and urban administrations, as well as archaeological remote sensing missions.Additionally, significantattentionhasbeengiventoLIDARdataandresearch onurbanlandscape transformation, as well as real-time surveillance tasks involving UAVs (J. Li et al.</p>

            <p>TheFrancisceanCadastre,coveringanextensiveareaofHabsburgCentralEurope spanningaround300,000squarekilometers,standsoutasanexceptionalhistorical source. Its nearly half-century production period and stringent quality standards provide historians, archaeologists, and environmental scientists with privileged insights into 19th-century land use and spatial organization (Feucht 2008).</p>
            <p>Nevertheless, the cadastre also contains inaccuracies and errors, which are magnified by the size of the operation. It represents a historical primary source and as such requires meticulous and thorough critical reading. Werner Drobesch has recently provided the first comprehensive analysis of the economics of the cadastre, and from this, and from the savings constraints he has pointed out, there are also comprehensive indications ofthe weaknesses ofthis source(Scharr 2024).Further,a greatdeal depended on the quality ofthe individual's work;the scale ofthe recording varied considerably (high level ofdetail in urbanareas,medium level ofdetail in rural areas, very coarse details in exposed terrain and high mountains). Many of the weaknessesencounteredindealingwiththeFranziszeischeKataster resemblethose that Hosseini et al. describe and scrutinize in detail with regard to the Ordnance Survey (Hosseini et al. 2021)</p>

            <head>Task</head>
            <p>The objective of RePaSE was twofold: RePaSE should provide a proof-of-concept thatAI-assisted extraction of large amounts of data – in our use case: the location and the form of buildings – from the cadastre is already possible with existing resourcesand,inthebestcase,identifysuitablemodels tothatpurpose.The second step was to make RePaSE fit for future multimodal applications, and to identify and test models that could be used to extract the location and the form of buildings also from current aerial and satellite imagery that is already available (Smits and Wevers2023).</p>

On the one hand, we see potential for a quantitative economic and social history.Structuring and classifying the information encoded in cadastres would make it possible to analyze land use at regional or</p>

Ontheotherhand,ourtoolwouldalsomakeitpossibletoextendthearchaeological view to larger spatial units with relatively little effortand to better visualize translocal or regional contexts for experts.</p>
            <p>Our research strategy involved two main sub-tasks: task 1 focused on detecting buildings in scans of historical cadastral map data, while task 2 aimed to detect buildings in current satellite and aerial imagery. We then superimposed the output layers ofboth tasks,specifically targeting places where buildings were presentin the cadastre but absent in the present. This overlay combined historical cadastral map datawithcurrentsatelliteimagery,allowingustoidentifyrelevantlocationsforfurther analysis. These locations were then utilized for analyzing different spatial representations, including satellite and aerial imagery.</p>

            <p>Weusedthesoftwaretoolcvattoannotatethemappatches<ref target="http://www.cvat.ai/">(“www.cvat.ai,</ref>”n.d.).</p>
            <p>The first task to be addressed was an image segmentation problem, in order to be abletosuccessfullyextracthousesfromcadastralmapmaterial. Inourfirstattempt, we followed a low-key approach and tried clustering algorithms to tackle this challenge, which turned out unsuccessful. In line with the fail-fast approach of our proof-of-concept study, we subsequently turned to a completely different method.</p>
            <p>When it comes to deep neural networks in this area of application, convolutional neural networks (CNN) have outperformed other architectures in the last years(Rawat and Wang 2017; O’Shea and Nash 2015).ACNN is a type of deep learningalgorithmthatiswell-suitedforanalyzingvisualdata.Itusesprinciplesfrom linear algebra, especially convolution operations, to extract features and identify patterns within images.CNNs use a series oflayers,each ofwhich detects different features of an input image. Depending on the complexity of its intended purpose, a</p>
            <p>CNN can contain dozens, hundreds, or even thousands of layers. As building extraction can be considered a computer vision problem,fully convolutional networks are considered the most widespread state-of-the-art solution to this kind of problem (K. Chen et al. 2021). We therefore chose the Google DeeplabV3 model (L.-C. Chen et al. 2017), which is considered to be very efficient in dealing with the multi-scale problem featured in this context, due to its atrous convolution layer (L.-C. Chen et al. 2016).WefinetunedDeepLabV3with50annotatedexampleimagesthatwesplitinto 6 squares each to give 300 images in total. The images were split into training,testing and validation set according to the following scheme:</p>

               <graphic url="media/image2.png"/>
            </figure>
            <p>Figure2:FinetuningtheDeeplabV3model,colorcode:blue–validationdata;red–trainingdata;green–testdata.</p>
            <p>The validation set was automatically populated with squares lacking buildings to teachthemodeltheabsenceofstructuresinsomemappatches,explainingitslarger size compared to the test and train sets. Each dataset (train, test, val) contained unique images without duplication across sets. Finetuning utilized a repository designed for transfer learning in semantic segmentation (Singh and Popescu 2021), building upon DeeplabV3 with resnet 101. Finetuning spanned 20 epochs on various computing platforms until achieving satisfactory results(“Https://Pytorch.Org/Vision/Stable/Models/Generated/Torchvision.Models.Segmentat ion.Deeplabv3_resnet101.Html#torchvision.Models.Segmentation.Deeplabv3_resnet101” 2017).</p>
            <p>The second task to be addressed was another image segmentation problem, the extraction of buildings from high-resolution aerial and satellite data.As the quality of satellite imagery freely available has once more increased in the two years between thesetupoftheprojectideaandtheprojectexecution,wecouldusesatelliteimagery in better quality than originally expected, yet we could also add very-high-resolution aerial photography and LiDAR data to the research data under scrutiny. Unlike the 19thcentury cadastral map data that we were dealing with in task 1, we were addressing an entirely different problem here, as buildings in ortho- and satellite</p>
            <p>imagery can take on a wide range of very different appearances. Due to the significantly different challenge, we chose an adapted approach. Vision transformers break down input images into patches, convert each patch into a vector, and then process these vectors using a transformer encoder. This allows the model to understand the content of the image and has been used for various computer vision tasks such as image recognition, image segmentation, and object detection. Vision transformers are considered to feature relatively economic computational overhead and memory consumption, while they can achieve state-of-the-art accuracy (K. Chen et al. 2021). We therefore trained a sparse token transformer (STTnet) from scratch, using a GPU. STTnet is a state-of-the-art vision transformer with very promising resultsincomparabletasks(K.Chenetal.2021).BuildingonResnet50asbackbone, we selected 2.657 labelled images from theAIRS dataset. This was so that we could avoidlabellinghousesinthesatelliteimagesourselves.Theeffortforthiswouldhave been considerable, because for training from scratch we need substantially more training examples than for finetuning. All images resembled the Alpine topography and the landscape characteristicsof ourtargetregion Styria.We finallyused imagery that was taken inAustin, Chicago, Kitsap (Washington State),Tyrol and Vienna.The training took place over 98 epochs, once the loss rate and the F1 score did not feature significant changes anymore, the training was considered completed. The model was then tested with 224 labelled images.</p>
            <p>Subsequently,theextractedlayersweresuperimposedandnegativeprofileswere created. The negative profiles contain archaeologically potentially interesting locations, which once saw buildings, yet that are not overbuilt at present.</p>

These were, however, minor issues, which we believe that we could deal with quite simply by labelling more training examples and retraining the model. Further finetuning could teach the model to recognize further structures, particularlyyellowhouses(woodenbuildings)andstreets,whichwillbeourpriorityin a follow-up project.</p>
            <p>The situation with task 2 was slightly different. The achieved IoUs of 0.537755 (macro) and 0.795838 (micro) proved to be satisfactory in this context from a pragmatical perspective, as we were well able to work with the obtained results. Although these are significantly below the values achieved for task 1, we consider this task successfully solved. The building outlines contained in the negative layer must be kept more generous anyway, as it is evident, especially in the terrain model, thattheterrainisaffectedbythedevelopmentbeyondtheactualbuildingboundaries, through the levelling of the built-over area.The red markings in the upper layer mark false positives (a house was detected, where there was no house in reality), the green markings false negatives (the model failed to detect the house). White indicates a correct identification. The model sometimes displays difficulties correctly identifying houses at the margins of the detection area. Furthermore, it was difficult for the model to achieve good results outside a certain (optimal) zoom range. This problem could be circumvented by properly addressing the issue in the data</p>
            <p>preprocessing.As a rule, the model tended to minimally enlarge the recognized buildings,which,however,wasquiteconvenientforourwork,asalreadynoted. From an academic perspective, we see some possibilities to optimize the model. We are certain that additional training, i.e. adding more epochs, would yield a substantial improvement of the performance.</p>

            <p>RePaSE provided proof-of-concept with regard to AI driven data extraction from historicalmapmaterial andextremelyvaluableexperienceintermsofawayforward. The most important finding is that structures can be extracted from historical cadastral map material well and economically in very high quality. This opens up a wide range of new possibilities for us. Therefore, this is a field, in which we plan on engaging further, building on the experience we gathered in RePaSE and further in cooperation with several other groups working in this field of research. We expect that particularly the highly relevant findings of colleagues concerning the synthetic</p>
            <p>productionofsuitabletrainingdata (Jiao,Heitzler,andHurni2022)willallowfora significant breakthrough in extracting relevant data from historical maps at scale.</p>
            <p>In view of the rapid progress in the extraction of graphic structures from high- resolution satellite and aerial photographs, it seems sensible to orientate on the current state of research instead of investing own resources in improving the technology. Nevertheless, we consider it important to keep an eye on this field, as digital humanities and humanities data science struggle to access state-of-the-art technologies,modelsanddatasetstoprocessinformationexplainable. Weconsider the solution we identified in the context of RePaSE – STTnet – viable and expandable,though itwill require a substantialeffortto toughen up our outputs to a level, at which the quality of results will be robust enough to qualify for positive profiles. The STTnet we trained is perfectly working in a project context such as RePaSE, it will however require some adjustments to make it work in a different context where a higher IoU metric might be required.</p>
            <p>We have identified structures that can be detected very well when using computer vision, and which bear important time signatures, thus, which actually promise to render the past that is hidden in the surface of the Earth visible to the eyes of researchers.Further,aswemadepromisingandencouragingexperienceswithother object detectors on related tasks recently, we believe to have identified promising paths of development in this field.</p>
            <p>Our study has shown us that, in principle, our models would also be suitable for recognising and reporting structural changes over time in a more finely graduated manner.Bychoosing a differentmodel -experimentswithYOLOv5 were promising - building outlines in the cadastral material could be recognised even more finely and, theoretically,buildingsthatmaynothaveundergoneanystructuralchangescouldbe detected automatically.Even ifRePaSE was notaimed atfinding outwhatwas used to replace historical buildings, the models could also contribute to clarifying such questions with a manageable adaptation effort.</p>

            <head>Conclusion</head>
            <p>RePaSE provides a wide variety of stakeholders, from municipal authorities over political decision makers at the local and regional level to historians and archeologistswithapowerfultool todetectsitesofpotentialarcheologicalrelevance, as is shown on the following two figures:</p>

            <p>Figure7:Therespectivemappatchinthecadastre,thebuildingsthathavesincedisappearedfeatureintheboundingboxes.</p>
            <p>Based on our findings, we are convinced that the results of RePaSE will be an important support for various stakeholders in Central Europe in many areas: Our model is likely to be used in the field of construction management when archaeologically and historically sensitive areas are to be identified in advance of major construction and infrastructure projects. It can help to identify relevant structuresinculturalheritagemanagementandmakethemmorecomprehensively visible,forexample in existing GISand HGISsystems.Primarily,however,we see RePaSE as the basis for a research tool designed to support digital humanists in identifying and extracting relevant research data from mapped sources.</p>
            <p>ByarchaeologicallyrelevantinthecontextofRePaSE,wemeansitesthat featured historic buildings and may require archaeological investigation in the course of construction activities or currentland use.RePaSE can supportthe identification of such sites in advance and thus help to prevent so-called emergency excavations,</p>
            <p>e.g.bychangingtherouteorplannedarchaeologicalinterventionbeforeconstructionbegins.</p>
            <p>The question arises to what extent neural networks can also be trained to detect visually relevant anomalies in different dimensions of surface representations (digital terrain model, different high-resolution aerial photographs) without having to rely on concreteknowledgefromahistoricalknowledgerepresentation. Suchdetectioncould be achieved by a neural network, for example by identifying complex feature clusters in multimodal visual input signals - such as the superimposition of DTM and high- resolution aerial images from different aerial surveys.</p>
            <p>TheRePaSE-teamiscurrentlyworkingtosetupaservertoprovidefullaccesstothe above-mentioned group to the entire dataset processed in the project runtime.</p>
            <p>RePaSE is currently working for the entire region of Styria, we expect that it could easily be expanded for the adjoining regions of Carinthia, LowerAustria, Salzburg andSlovenia.AsCroatiaandBurgenlandwerepartoftheTransleithaniancadastre, which features slightly differentoptical features,we expectto meetsome difficulties there, yet the system would probably be working with another round of finetuning.</p>
            <p>RePaSEclearlyshowedtheenormouspotentialof machinelearning,particularlywith regard to computer vision, image segmentation and object detection to scale up analysis of historical map material and to combine these insights with (AI harvested) data gained from current high-resolution imagery of the surface of the Earth. Models</p>
            <p>ofthelatestgenerationfeatureoutstandingusabilityandrequiremanageableeffortto successfully extract data from large-scale knowledge representations.Itturned outin the context of this project, though, that domain knowledge plays an increasingly important role.</p>
            <p>Whereas image segmentation must be regarded a standard technology with regardto this type of sources now, due to its good availability, usability and accessibility, possibly the most relevant result of RePaSE with regard to the question, what digital humanists’tools will be for working with these data in the near future, is: Based on our results, what we learnt is essentially that object detection bears enormous potentialformanycrucialtasks,particularlywhenitcomestotheanalysisofhistorical map data at scale.The object detectors we have been working with so far display a wide range of possible applications, which reach far beyond the purpose they were developed for. The fact that many object identification models combine excellent object recognition with relatively manageable hardware requirements makes them eminently suitable tools for use in the DH context.</p>
            <p>However, the most relevant potential of the tools that we were working with in this project,istheircapacitytobringspatialanalysisinahistoricalcontexttoscale. What is more, a large set of different tools meanwhile exists to visualize such changes, whichwillhelphistoriansandfellowhumanists todevelopadeeperunderstandingof how space transforms over time.</p>

            <p>ABSTRACT</p>
            <p>Cadastres from the 19th century are a complex as well as rich source for historians and archaeologists, whose use presents them with great challenges. For archaeologicalandhistoricalremotesensing,wehavetrainedseveralDeepLearning models, CNNs as well as Vision Transformers, to extract large-scale data from this knowledge representation. We present the principle results of our work here and we present a the demonstrator of our browser-based tool that allows researchers and public stakeholders to quickly identify spots thatfeatured buildings in the 19thcentury Franciscean Cadastre.The tool not only supports scholars and fellow researchers in building a betterunderstanding ofthe settlementhistoryofthe region ofStyria,it also helps public administration and fellow citizens to swiftly identify areas of heightened sensibility with regard to the cultural heritage of the region.</p>
