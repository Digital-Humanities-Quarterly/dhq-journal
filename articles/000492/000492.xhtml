                  <div class="ptext" id="p1">Dialogue and its failure underpin Samuel Beckett’s (1906–1989) oeuvre not only as
                     a narrative or as a dramatic
                     					structure, but also as an epistemological approach. In the Irish artist’s practice,
                     verbal dialogue is often
                     					reworked to generate non-anthropocentric interactions. Amongst the agents that
                     are put into conversation, one can
                     					think of a number of everyday-life objects, technological devices, dust or even
                     mud. It is in the radio plays that
                     					Beckett achieved intermedial dialogue to the most powerful effect with <span class="hi italic">Words and Music</span>
                     					(1961) and <span class="hi italic">Cascando</span> (1962). The experimenters – respectively Croak and Opener – attempt to
                     					tease out a theme or to tell a story by regulating dialogue between two media:
                     words (in <span class="hi italic">Words
                        						and Music</span>) / voice (in <span class="hi italic">Cascando</span>) and music (in the two plays). In both cases, the
                     					result is not the one anticipated by the experimenters, whose control is challenged
                     by the agency of the non-human
                     					characters. The dialogue orchestrated by James Little between <span class="hi italic">The Making of Samuel Beckett’s
                        					</span>Not I <span class="hi italic">/</span> Pas moi<span class="hi italic">, </span>That Time <span class="hi italic">/</span> Cette

                     					on the Beckett Digital Manuscript Project is a well-mastered and productive one,
                     but beware: both the book and the
                     					original manuscripts may take you off the prescribed track.</div>

                  <div class="ptext" id="p2">Over the past eleven years, the Samuel Beckett Digital Manuscript Project (BDMP) –
                     <a href="https://www.beckettarchive.org/" onclick="window.open('https://www.beckettarchive.org/'); return false" class="ref">https://www.beckettarchive.org/</a> – led by Dirk Van Hulle and Mark
                     					Nixon – has transformed the approach to Samuel Beckett’s oeuvre by publishing
                     digitised facsimiles of the
                     					manuscripts that led to the publication of texts both in English and in French.
                     The digital archive is extended by
                     					an array of features that facilitate the reading of the manuscripts and their
                     comparison. This contribution has
                     					been so potent that it has been acknowledged as the genetic turn in Beckett studies,
                     influencing the ways in which
                     					Beckett’s texts are received, researched and reused. <a class="noteRef" href="#d3e247">[1]</a> In 2018, the BDMP was awarded the eleventh Modern
                     					Language Association of America (MLA) Prize for a Bibliography, Archive, or Digital
                     Project, thereby gaining formal
                     					recognition for its transformative impact beyond Beckett studies as a digital
                     practice that: tackles the problem of
                     					accessibility to archival material, challenges the ontological status of text
                     itself as fixed, and augments the
                     					epistemology of literary studies. </div>

                     					While it follows <span class="hi italic">The Making of</span> series’ traditions, it also innovates by ambitiously
                     					reconstructing the genesis of three texts in the same volume: other series monographs
                     focus solely on a single
                     					text, with the exception of Dirk Van Hulle’s <span class="hi italic">The Making of Samuel Beckett’s </span>Stirrings
                     						Still<span class="hi italic"> / </span>Soubresauts<span class="hi italic"> and </span>Comment dire<span class="hi italic"> / </span>what
                     					is the word (2016) – which examines the genesis of Beckett’s penultimate text
                     and his last poem – and Olga
                     					Beloborodova’s <span class="hi italic">The Making of Samuel Beckett’s </span>Play <span class="hi italic">/</span> Comédie<span class="hi italic"> and </span>Film (2019) – which studies the genesis of the theatre and television plays and
                     					illustrates best how Beckett had become a multimedial artist. When working with
                     <span class="hi italic">Not I </span>(1973)
                     					and <span class="hi italic">Footfalls</span> (1976), critics and artists alike have often included <span class="hi italic">Rockaby</span> (1982) in the grouping of texts or performances. Little’s genetic edition hence reconfigures
                     the
                     					triad by leaving out <span class="hi italic">Rockaby</span> and instead including <span class="hi italic">That Time</span> (1976).
                     					While the former association has proven useful to explore gender, embodiment
                     and space, Little’s innovative
                     					combination spotlights Beckett’s cognition-based dramaturgy in this cluster of
                     plays. The volume then can be read
                     					in line with Dirk Van Hulle’s <span class="hi italic">The Making of Samuel Beckett’s </span>Krapp’s Last Tape<span class="hi italic"> / </span>La Dernière Bande (2017) which unveils how Beckett’s thinking of the mind informed
                     the
                     					composition of this poignant dramatic piece staging “the [decaying] workings
                     of a person’s mind” [Van Hulle, 21]. </div>

                  <div class="counter"><a href="#p6">6</a></div>
                  <div class="ptext" id="p6">The general introduction locates Beckett’s artistic creation of the three plays within
                     the scope of his life-long
                     					interest in cognition, mind theory, psychology, psychoanalysis and neuroscience.
                     Little argues that Beckett’s
                     					research into, and critical engagement with, those areas not only nourished his
                     aesthetic, but also informed his
                     					thinking of the “breakdown between subject and object” [Little 2021, 28], as
                     Beckett initially formulated it in the
                     					1934 essay “Recent Irish Poetry.” The author therefore delineates his own intervention
                     in Beckett Studies as
                     					bridge-building between Beckett’s early philosophical and aesthetic statement
                     and his late dramaturgical practice
                     					in the triad <span class="hi italic">Not I</span> / <span class="hi italic">Pas moi</span>, <span class="hi italic">That Time</span> / <span class="hi italic">Cette fois</span> and <span class="hi italic">Footfalls</span> / <span class="hi italic">Pas</span>. A short case
                     					study of <span class="hi italic">Footfalls</span> operates as an effective demonstration of the value of genetic criticism
                     					to uncover Beckett’s staging of the “breakdown” through psychological images,
                     such as May’s enactive mind in this
                     					case. </div>
                  				
                  <div class="counter"><a href="#p7">7</a></div>
                  <div class="ptext" id="p7">Drawing on past research around Beckett’s creative process and by analogy with archaeological
                     discoveries that led
                     					to the reframing of the mind as an interactive process between the subject, their
                     environment and objects
                     					populating it, Little simultaneously demonstrates how the study of manuscripts
                     – and therefore of the creative
                     					process – bears witness to Beckett’s own enactive mind. In other words, Beckett’s
                     texts must be understood as the
                     					product of a multi-layered process that is embodied and situated. This point
                     is transformative for practice, since
                     					the performance of these texts then needs to function as a synaptic space between
                     Beckett’s creative spaces (that
                     					of when he created the play and that for which he created the play) and the audiences’
                     own environments. </div>

                  <div class="ptext" id="p8">In a surprising move towards performance theory and theatre history, Little proceeds
                     to argue that this effect can
                     					only be achieved in Cartesian Theatres with a proscenium arch framing the action
                     (aesthetic object) and separating
                     					it from the observing spectator (subject), such as the Royal Court Theatre in
                     London, where Beckett directed the
                     					three plays. This separation is challenged in performance, Little explains, by
                     the aesthetic of the stage image
                     					that emerges out of darkness. The restrained use of light generates metaphysical
                     uncertainty as to the material
                     					conditions of the agent onstage and consequently epistemological uncertainty
                     for the spectator. Little contends
                     					that it is in the planned failure to seize the onstage mind that the breakdown
                     between subject and object occurs. </div>

The first English manuscript that qualifies as <span class="hi italic">avant-texte</span> towards <span class="hi italic">Not I</span> is dated from March 1972, and the last English typescript
                     					was produced in January 1973. That text was translated into French between 1973
                     and 1974. However, some of the
                     					dramaturgical and thematic ideas underpinning the play emerged as early as 1963

                     					Little’s narrative of the genesis of <span class="hi italic">Not I</span> / <span class="hi italic">Pas moi</span> effectively
                     					segregates the study of those abandoned works from that of the versions and drafts
                     of <span class="hi italic">Not I</span>,
                     					highlighting their connection – particularly that of “Kilcool” – to the oeuvre
                     as a whole rather than to <span class="hi italic">Not I</span> alone. Little’s vision, which appears as a slight stretch, still shows that those
                     					abandoned texts function as experiments both fertilised by the previous works
                     and fertilising the ones to follow.
                     					In other words, the rhizomatic structure of Beckett’s oeuvre is dynamically mapped
                     out by Little’s genetic
                     					criticism of “Kilcool” and the “Petit Odéon” fragments. </div>

                     (rehearsals, directing,
                     					translation, etc.), his creative engagement with other media and genres (mostly
                     film, mime, and prose in those

                     so to speak – and the omnipresence of
                     					cognition at thematic and structural levels. Little adopts Beckett’s outline
                     as a guide for his own archaeological
                     					journey through the English drafts of Not I. The strategy proves efficient to
                     dig through most of the main furrows
                     					opened by Beckett and to unearth the underlying systems on, and against which,
                     the cognitive environment of the

                     path to follow for a steady
                     					journey through the making of Not I / Pas moi. Working from the Éditions de Minuit’s
                     2014 publication of Pour finir
                     					encore et autres foirades, Little aptly defines darkness as a Beckettian topos
                     of memory and imagination, but also
                     					as a mechanistic cognitive space. He traces the creation of Mouth’s automatic
                     mind in the darkness of the stage by
                     					contrast with the evolving role of the light as an inquisitor reminiscent of
                     the spotlight in Play. By focusing on
                     					Beckett’s addition of the verb “flash” in the second English typescript onwards
                     – to express the mode of appearance
                     					of Mouth’s thoughts – Little argues that thoughts operate as disruptions of the
                     darkened mind space. Turning to
                     					language, sounds, rhythms and silences, he brilliantly analyses the function
                     of the ellipses in the script and the
                     					discarding of certain words as Beckett’s boring of holes in language and therefore
                     as the painting of
                     					epistemological darkness at a linguistic level. The analysis of the French documents
                     moves away from darkness, but
                     					it explores related processes such as dehumanizing, vaguening, syllabic un- and
                     re-doing and unending. Little’s

                     By
                     					exploring time both at thematic and structural level in this play, Beckett goes
                     back to one of his early
                     					metaphysical interests and necessarily to some of his classics: Marcel Proust
                     and Dante Alighieri. However, as
                     					Little demonstrates, Beckett’s focus on consciousness and memory is also informed
                     by past readings of, or about,
                     					Friedrich Hölderlin, Rank, Lao Tzu, George Berkeley and Henri Bergson and by
                     Beckett’s own work on those notions in
                     					pieces such as <span class="hi italic">Krapp’s Last Tape</span> (1958), <span class="hi italic">Comment c’est</span> (1961), and
                     						<span class="hi italic">Lessness</span> (1970). In particular, Little’s identification and analysis of the potential
                     					intertextual links with Proust’s work and Proust’s own composition process is
                     a <span class="hi italic">tour de
                        						force</span> that enables the reader, on the one hand, to trace the lexical, conceptual, dramaturgical
                     and
                     					translational connections between <span class="hi italic">That time</span>, <span class="hi italic">Cette fois</span> and <span class="hi italic">À la recherche du temps perdu</span> (1913–1927), unlocking new potential interpretations of the
                     					nexus of memory/time in the playscript and in the stage image of the play. On
                     the other hand, it exemplifies once
                     					more Beckett’s rhizomatic and palimpsestic creative process and his strategy
                     of “vaguening,” supplemented with
                     					elements of serialism and imagism in the creation of <span class="hi italic">That Time</span>, which rather illustrate
                     					Beckett’s intermedial practice, as Little convincingly argues. The originality
                     of Little’s approach also lies in
                     					his study of autotextual connections, as a means to show how the sonic quality
                     of the text takes precedence over
                     					references in the creation process, hence reinforcing the thesis that Beckett
                     wrote his play text for performance. </div>

                  <div class="ptext" id="p17">The study of the breakdown in <span class="hi italic">That Time</span> is multi-layered and goes from strength to
                     					strength: starting from processes in common with <span class="hi italic">Not I</span>, Little moves to the specificity of
                     					the breakdown in <span class="hi italic">That Time</span> that pertains to memory. It is through the intertextual link with
                     					several of Hölderlin’s texts that Little first traces how memory is enacted as
                     a process of self-fragmentation in
                     					the play. Little supports the reader’s exploration of this argument by featuring
                     the hyperlinks to the digitised
                     					facsimile of Beckett’s copy of Hölderlin’s <span class="hi italic">Sämtliche Werke</span> (Leipzig: Insel Verlag, 1926)
                     					that can be consulted on the Beckett Digital Library, another section of the
                     BDMP. Little then interprets Beckett’s
                     					division of A, B and C’s monologues (the three voices that Listener hears) into
                     smaller units (lexia), their
                     					sequencing and their reordering during the composition of the play both as a
                     process of entanglement of the three
                     					voices and as a thematization of the breakdown, simultaneously making it visible
                     on the page. Additionally, the
                     					author highlights how the play articulates a breakdown between subject and object
                     through the failure of
                     					communication. Most importantly, Little’s analysis of the lexical field of business
                     in lexia C10 reveals that the
                     					subject-object breakdown is not purely psychological but also social. After studying
                     the ossification of the
                     					remembered self, Little shifts his attention to the contrasting narratives of
                     the same memory by the three voices,
                     					which buttresses the thesis according to which the subject breakdown also happens
                     in the foregrounding of the
                     					constructiveness of memory and of the remembered self. Little’s inquiry into
                     the subject/memory breakdown through a
                     					reworked version of Beckett’s own analytic structure is most effective to create
                     a clear picture of the mechanisms,
                     					themes and structures of the breakdown in <span class="hi italic">That Time</span>, providing an unprecedented and
                     					near-exhaustive study of this Beckettian trope and aesthetic quest in the play

                     of manuscripts and Beckett’s extended
                     					mind. Little concludes the genetic criticism of <span class="hi italic">Cette fois</span> with a list of the orthographic,
                     					conjugational and grammatical errors that Beckett made in the process of translation.

                     					discrepancy between <span class="hi italic">Cette fois</span> and other plays. Little suggests that the significantly
                     					higher number of errors in that manuscript could be another indication of Beckett’s
                     translation struggles, but he
                     					warns the reader against the temptation of drawing any further conclusion and
                     instead advocates for the

                  <div class="ptext" id="p19">As one makes their way through the third section of the book (the genetic criticism
                     of <span class="hi italic">Footfalls/Pas</span>), they encounter several salient concepts to categorise the play – a play about ageing,
                     a
                     					play about birth, a pacing play, a painkiller play, a wintery play – thematically
                     linking this text to other works
                     					in Beckett’s oeuvre, while singularly articulating “revolving,” the core dynamic
                     in <span class="hi italic">Footfalls</span>. But it is perhaps the label “complex play” that may summarise best the composition
                     process and
                     					the practical aspects of performance for this text, since Little emphasises the
                     complexity of the foliation system,
                     					the play’s structure, its title, the naming of characters, the number of voices,
                     the calculations of May’s pacing,
                     					the width of the strip, subplots, and instrumentation. Little shows that <span class="hi italic">Footfalls </span>kept
                     					evolving significantly even post-publication, and he kindly points the reader
                     toward the “Compare Sentences” tool
                     					on the BDMP, to trace the changes in the texts and navigate the complexity of
                     the creation process. This function
                     					enables the user to track variants across the composition process and in the
                     various editions of the text, and in
                     					this case, it can be used not for the sole purpose of genetic criticism, but
                     also for practitioners to understand
                     					how both pacing and voicing operate, especially since the stage directions related
                     to pacing are more specific in
                     					the French text, being enriched by Beckett’s experience of directing the play.</div>
                  				
                  <div class="counter"><a href="#p20">20</a></div>
                  <div class="ptext" id="p20">While the play’s filiation with others of Beckett is highlighted through themes, Little
                     rather suggests to view
                     						<span class="hi italic">Footfalls</span> as a “textual orphan” by comparison with W. B. Yeats’ <span class="hi italic">At the
                        						Hawk’s Well </span>[Little 2021, 401]. The scholar argues that the former explores the ungraspable nature
                     of
                     					theatre, a vision also traceable in the latter, the illusive dramaturgy of <span class="hi italic">Footfalls</span> then
                     					setting the play in sharp contrast with the clear tableaux of <span class="hi italic">Not I </span>and <span class="hi italic">Footfalls</span>. Instead of reassessing Beckett’s conflicted relationship to Yeats’ theatre, Little
                     sticks to the
                     					compositional process: he uses this intertextual instance as a means to dig further
                     into Beckett’s own
                     					understanding of the mechanics of writing and the role of memory in the composition
                     and translation processes,
                     					which is further investigated in the section “The Genesis of Pas” with the analysis
                     of “Fatalement” (a replacement
                     					for “Inévitablement”), as a potential reference to Beckett’s interest in Atropos.
                     Such focus is an opportunity to
                     					articulate how the play intrinsically queries the relationship between textuality
                     and performance, but Little also
                     					pays attention to the deeply collaborative nature of the creation of this play;
                     his narrative and analysis of
                     					Beckett and Billie Whitelaw working through posture and pacing in a Parisian
                     restaurant is one of the highlights of
                     					the book. Additionally, through the study of the initial stage direction, Little
                     demonstrates that the composition
                     					of the play was driven by pacing, Beckett presenting text as only secondary.
                     But as far as text is concerned, one
                     					of the main achievements of Little’s analysis of Beckett’s compositional process
                     is to go beyond “vaguening” or
                     					“undoing” alone by suggesting that it is only possible to achieve a “vaguened”
                     stage image with precise stage
                     					directions, and Little introduces other compositional practices, such as correction
                     as improvisation, the presence
                     					of textual scars or weakening. Such strategies, Little contends, exemplify how
                     Beckett’s creation process had
                     					evolved towards an approach that is both text-oriented and stage-oriented. So
                     what steps, after all, is Beckett
                     					asking his audiences to take with this play? </div>
                  				
                  <div class="counter"><a href="#p21">21</a></div>
                  <div class="ptext" id="p21">As Little demonstrates, the spectator is again thrown into the pit of the subject-object
                     breakdown, but this time
                     					through revolving. Indeed, the intertextuality with Yeats’ play is also a locus
                     for the breakdown: Little
                     					identifies that, while Beckett was working on <span class="hi italic">Footfalls</span>, he also attempted to write the
                     					prose piece “Long Observation of the Ray,” in which Beckett referenced the eye
                     and mind of <span class="hi italic">The
                        						Hawk’s Well</span> and explored the themes of self-observation and self-perception without a subject.
                     In <span class="hi italic">Footfalls</span>, however, it is the clear separation between subjects that is at stake, whether it
                     					is at the plot or linguistic level. Furthermore, Little shows that Beckett edited
                     woman’s voice’s (V) text to
                     					augment the seemingly endless revolution of May’s thoughts without locating them
                     in the mind, as it is the case in
                     						<span class="hi italic">Not I</span>. And in so doing, Beckett extended May’s mind to her environment, hence challenging
                     					the subject-world divide. In translation, Beckett heightened the sense of breakdown
                     with the polysemous French word
                     					“pas” as the title for the piece. “Pas” operates both as the signifier for steps
                     and the marker of negation in
                     					French grammar. As a result, it negates subjectivity, and as Little demonstrates,
                     it enhances the breakdown of the
                     					subject onstage, while presenting Beckett’s oeuvre as “work in regress” [Beckett,
                     quoted in Little 2021, 462]. That
                     					entropic movement is reinforced by what Little identifies as the weakening of
                     dialogues and stage directions,
                     					which, he argues, intensifies the breakdown of the character’s subjectivity.
                     In short, Little’s genetic criticism
                     					of <span class="hi italic">Footfalls</span> reveals how the breakdown had become inherent to Beckett’s experimental
                     					theatre, not only as an exploration of changing modes of subjectivity and new
                     cognitive paradigms, but also – and
                     					even more fundamentally – as a performance practice and ethics, challenging the
                     role (and place) of spectators.</div>

                     					translation, and publication processes over the span of a dozen years. Little’s
                     book represents a significant
                     					addition to the branches of Beckett studies looking at the mind and cognitive
                     processes on their own and in/for
                     					performance, but it also operates as a fast track to research the digitised facsimile
                     of those three plays on the

                     to theatre historians of

                     of those demanding pieces
                     					and provides invaluable tools to reimagine those plays in twenty-first century
