                  <div class="ptext" id="p1">Dialogue and its failure underpin Samuel Beckett’s (1906–1989) oeuvre not only as
                     a narrative or as a dramatic
                     					structure, but also as an epistemological approach. In the Irish artist’s practice,
                     verbal dialogue is often
                     					reworked to generate non-anthropocentric interactions. Amongst the agents that
                     are put into conversation, one can
                     					think of a number of everyday-life objects, technological devices, dust or even
                     mud. It is in the radio plays that
                     					Beckett achieved intermedial dialogue to the most powerful effect with <cite class="title italic">Words and Music</cite>
                     					(1961) and <cite class="title italic">Cascando</cite> (1962). The experimenters – respectively Croak and Opener –
                     					attempt to tease out a theme or to tell a story by regulating dialogue between
                     two media: words (in <cite class="title italic">Words and Music</cite>) / voice (in <cite class="title italic">Cascando</cite>) and music (in the two
                     					plays). In both cases, the result is not the one anticipated by the experimenters,
                     whose control is challenged by
                     					the agency of the non-human characters. The dialogue orchestrated by James Little

                  <div class="ptext" id="p2">Over the past eleven years, the Samuel Beckett Digital Manuscript Project (BDMP) –
                     <a href="https://www.beckettarchive.org/" onclick="window.open('https://www.beckettarchive.org/'); return false" class="ref">https://www.beckettarchive.org/</a> – led by Dirk Van Hulle and Mark
                     					Nixon – has transformed the approach to Samuel Beckett’s oeuvre by publishing
                     digitised facsimiles of the
                     					manuscripts that led to the publication of texts both in English and in French.
                     The digital archive is extended by
                     					an array of features that facilitate the reading of the manuscripts and their
                     comparison. This contribution has
                     					been so potent that it has been acknowledged as the genetic turn in Beckett studies,
                     influencing the ways in which
                     					Beckett’s texts are received, researched and reused.<a class="noteRef" href="#d3e368">[2]</a> In 2018, the BDMP was awarded the eleventh
                     					Modern Language Association of America (MLA) Prize for a Bibliography, Archive,
                     or Digital Project, thereby gaining
                     					formal recognition for its transformative impact beyond Beckett studies as a
                     digital practice that: tackles the
                     					problem of accessibility to archival material, challenges the ontological status
                     of text itself as fixed, and
                     					augments the epistemology of literary studies. </div>

                        						Footfalls / Pas</cite> represents a landmark in the history of the BDMP, for it is their tenth genetic edition.
                     					While it follows <cite class="title italic">The Making of</cite> series’ traditions, it also innovates by ambitiously
                     					reconstructing the genesis of three texts in the same volume: other series monographs
                     focus solely on a single
                     					text, with the exception of Dirk Van Hulle’s <cite class="title italic">The Making of Samuel Beckett’s Stirrings Still /
                        						Soubresauts and Comment dire / what is the word</cite> (2016) – which examines the genesis of Beckett’s
                     					penultimate text and his last poem – and Olga Beloborodova’s <cite class="title italic">The Making of Samuel Beckett’s
                        						Play / Comédie and Film</cite> (2019) – which studies the genesis of the theatre and television plays and
                     					illustrates best how Beckett had become a multimedial artist. When working with
                     <cite class="title italic">Not I</cite>
                     					(1973) and <cite class="title italic">Footfalls</cite> (1976), critics and artists alike have often included <cite class="title italic">Rockaby</cite> (1982) in the grouping of texts or performances. Little’s genetic edition hence
                     					reconfigures the triad by leaving out <cite class="title italic">Rockaby</cite> and instead including <cite class="title italic">That Time</cite> (1976). While the former association has proven useful to explore gender,
                     					embodiment and space, Little’s innovative combination spotlights Beckett’s cognition-based
                     dramaturgy in this
                     					cluster of plays. The volume then can be read in line with Dirk Van Hulle’s <cite class="title italic">The Making of
                        						Samuel Beckett’s Krapp’s Last Tape / La Dernière Bande</cite> (2017) which unveils how Beckett’s thinking of the
                     					mind informed the composition of this poignant dramatic piece staging “the [decaying] workings
                     						of a person’s mind”

                  <div class="counter"><a href="#p6">6</a></div>
                  <div class="ptext" id="p6">The general introduction locates Beckett’s artistic creation of the three plays within
                     the scope of his life-long
                     					interest in cognition, mind theory, psychology, psychoanalysis and neuroscience.
                     Little argues that Beckett’s
                     					research into, and critical engagement with, those areas not only nourished his
                     aesthetic, but also informed his
                     					thinking of the “breakdown between subject and object”
                     					[<a class="ref" href="#little2021">Little 2021</a>, 28], as Beckett initially formulated it in the 1934 essay “Recent Irish Poetry.” The author therefore delineates his own intervention in Beckett Studies as
                     					bridge-building between Beckett’s early philosophical and aesthetic statement
                     and his late dramaturgical practice
                     					in the triad <cite class="title italic">Not I / Pas moi</cite>, <cite class="title italic">That Time / Cette fois</cite> and
                     						<cite class="title italic">Footfalls / Pas</cite>. A short case study of <cite class="title italic">Footfalls</cite>
                     					operates as an effective demonstration of the value of genetic criticism to uncover
                     Beckett’s staging of the
                     						“breakdown” through psychological images, such as May’s enactive mind in this case. </div>

                  <div class="ptext" id="p7">Drawing on past research around Beckett’s creative process and by analogy with archaeological
                     discoveries that led
                     					to the reframing of the mind as an interactive process between the subject, their
                     environment and objects
                     					populating it, Little simultaneously demonstrates how the study of manuscripts
                     – and therefore of the creative
                     					process – bears witness to Beckett’s own enactive mind. In other words, Beckett’s
                     texts must be understood as the
                     					product of a multi-layered process that is embodied and situated. This point
                     is transformative for practice, since
                     					the performance of these texts then needs to function as a synaptic space between
                     Beckett’s creative spaces (that
                     					of when he created the play and that for which he created the play) and the audiences’
                     own environments. </div>

                  <div class="ptext" id="p8">In a surprising move towards performance theory and theatre history, Little proceeds
                     to argue that this effect can
                     					only be achieved in Cartesian Theatres with a proscenium arch framing the action
                     (aesthetic object) and separating
                     					it from the observing spectator (subject), such as the Royal Court Theatre in
                     London, where Beckett directed the
                     					three plays. This separation is challenged in performance, Little explains, by
                     the aesthetic of the stage image
                     					that emerges out of darkness. The restrained use of light generates metaphysical
                     uncertainty as to the material
                     					conditions of the agent onstage and consequently epistemological uncertainty
                     for the spectator. Little contends
                     					that it is in the planned failure to seize the onstage mind that the breakdown
                     between subject and object occurs.

                     					editions are the top layers of a stratified maturation process that compares
                     to that of <cite class="title italic">Endgame / Fin de partie</cite>, due to the nature of its <em class="term">avant-texte</em>, split between texts written
                     					before <cite class="title italic">Not I</cite> (which are not versions of the play, but experiments that paved the way
                     					to <cite class="title italic">Not I</cite>) and those written towards <cite class="title italic">Not I</cite> (as versions of
                     					play). The first English manuscript that qualifies as <em class="term">avant-texte</em> towards <cite class="title italic">Not
                        						I</cite> is dated from March 1972, and the last English typescript was produced in January
                     1973. That text was
                     					translated into French between 1973 and 1974. However, some of the dramaturgical
                     and thematic ideas underpinning
                     					the play emerged as early as 1963 with “J. M. Mime” and the “Kilcool” drafts, and others four years later in the “Petit Odéon” fragments
                     					written between April 1967 and April 1968. Little’s narrative of the genesis
                     of <cite class="title italic">Not I / Pas
                        						moi</cite> effectively segregates the study of those abandoned works from that of the versions
                     and drafts of
                     						<cite class="title italic">Not I</cite>, highlighting their connection – particularly that of “Kilcool” – to the oeuvre as a whole rather than to <cite class="title italic">Not I</cite> alone. Little’s
                     					vision, which appears as a slight stretch, still shows that those abandoned texts
                     function as experiments both
                     					fertilised by the previous works and fertilising the ones to follow. In other
                     words, the rhizomatic structure of
                     					Beckett’s oeuvre is dynamically mapped out by Little’s genetic criticism of “Kilcool”
                     					and the “Petit Odéon” fragments. </div>

                     etc.), his creative engagement with
                     					other media and genres (mostly film, mime, and prose in those instances), his

                     					on the page, the chronology of ideas and textual edits or their interaction with
                     his correspondence. While the
                     					playwright himself questioned his own abilities as a theatre practitioner, Little
                     demonstrates that by the time
                     					Beckett wrote Not I, the stage image and the script were profoundly shaped by
                     his experience of being physically in

                     					from the eighth English typescript, illustrates the structure that Beckett had
                     in mind for the play – so to speak –
                     					and the omnipresence of cognition at thematic and structural levels. Little adopts
                     Beckett’s outline as a guide for
                     					his own archaeological journey through the English drafts of Not I. The strategy
                     proves efficient to dig through
                     					most of the main furrows opened by Beckett and to unearth the underlying systems
                     on, and against which, the
                     					cognitive environment of the play is built from Otto Rank and Ernest Jones to
                     Sigmund Freud and Max Nordeau, from
                     					Gestalt psychology and behaviourist theories to the significance of William James’

                     					Beckett for narrative and rehearsal purposes pulls the reader in many directions,

                     path to follow for a steady
                     					journey through the making of Not I / Pas moi. Working from the Éditions de Minuit’s
                     2014 publication of Pour finir
                     					encore et autres foirades, Little aptly defines darkness as a Beckettian topos
                     of memory and imagination, but also
                     					as a mechanistic cognitive space. He traces the creation of Mouth’s automatic
                     mind in the darkness of the stage by
                     					contrast with the evolving role of the light as an inquisitor reminiscent of
                     the spotlight in Play. By focusing on
                     					Beckett’s addition of the verb <em class="word">flash</em> in the second English typescript onwards – to express the mode of
                     					appearance of Mouth’s thoughts – Little argues that thoughts operate as disruptions
                     of the darkened mind space.
                     					Turning to language, sounds, rhythms and silences, he brilliantly analyses the
                     function of the ellipses in the
                     					script and the discarding of certain words as Beckett’s boring of holes in language
                     and therefore as the painting
                     					of epistemological darkness at a linguistic level. The analysis of the French
                     documents moves away from darkness,
                     					but it explores related processes such as dehumanizing, vaguening, syllabic un-
                     and re-doing and unending. Little’s
                     					genetic criticism of Not I / Pas moi will undoubtedly bear considerable influence
                     on future performances of both
                     					Mouth and Auditor alike and on the scenography of future stagings of Not I.</div>

                     					reader to follow him in a fascinating intertextual and autotextual journey. By
                     exploring time both at thematic and
                     					structural level in this play, Beckett goes back to one of his early metaphysical
                     interests and necessarily to some
                     					of his classics: Marcel Proust and Dante Alighieri. However, as Little demonstrates,
                     Beckett’s focus on
                     					consciousness and memory is also informed by past readings of, or about, Friedrich
                     Hölderlin, Rank, Lao Tzu, George
                     					Berkeley and Henri Bergson and by Beckett’s own work on those notions in pieces
                     such as <cite class="title italic">Krapp’s Last Tape</cite> (1958), <cite class="title italic">Comment c’est</cite> (1961), and <cite class="title italic">Lessness</cite> (1970). In particular, Little’s identification and analysis of the potential intertextual
                     links
                     					with Proust’s work and Proust’s own composition process is a tour de force that
                     enables the reader, on the one
                     					hand, to trace the lexical, conceptual, dramaturgical and translational connections
                     between <cite class="title italic">That time</cite>, <cite class="title italic">Cette fois</cite> and <cite class="title italic">À la recherche du temps
                        						perdu</cite> (1913–1927), unlocking new potential interpretations of the nexus of memory/time
                     in the playscript
                     					and in the stage image of the play. On the other hand, it exemplifies once more
                     Beckett’s rhizomatic and
                     					palimpsestic creative process and his strategy of “vaguening,” supplemented with elements of serialism and
                     					imagism in the creation of <cite class="title italic">That Time</cite>, which rather illustrate Beckett’s intermedial
                     					practice, as Little convincingly argues. The originality of Little’s approach
                     also lies in his study of autotextual
                     					connections, as a means to show how the sonic quality of the text takes precedence
                     over references in the creation
                     					process, hence reinforcing the thesis that Beckett wrote his play text for performance.

                     					strength: starting from processes in common with <cite class="title italic">Not I</cite>, Little moves to the
                     					specificity of the breakdown in <cite class="title italic">That Time</cite> that pertains to memory. It is through the
                     					intertextual link with several of Hölderlin’s texts that Little first traces
                     how memory is enacted as a process of
                     					self-fragmentation in the play. Little supports the reader’s exploration of this
                     argument by featuring the
                     					hyperlinks to the digitised facsimile of Beckett’s copy of Hölderlin’s <cite class="title italic">Sämtliche Werke</cite>
                     					(Leipzig: Insel Verlag, 1926) that can be consulted on the Beckett Digital Library,
                     another section of the BDMP.
                     					Little then interprets Beckett’s division of A, B and C’s monologues (the three
                     voices that Listener hears) into
                     					smaller units (lexia), their sequencing and their reordering during the composition
                     of the play both as a process
                     					of entanglement of the three voices and as a thematization of the breakdown,
                     simultaneously making it visible on
                     					the page. Additionally, the author highlights how the play articulates a breakdown
                     between subject and object
                     					through the failure of communication. Most importantly, Little’s analysis of
                     the lexical field of business in lexia
                     					C10 reveals that the subject-object breakdown is not purely psychological but
                     also social. After studying the
                     					ossification of the remembered self, Little shifts his attention to the contrasting
                     narratives of the same memory
                     					by the three voices, which buttresses the thesis according to which the subject
                     breakdown also happens in the
                     					foregrounding of the constructiveness of memory and of the remembered self. Little’s
                     inquiry into the
                     					subject/memory breakdown through a reworked version of Beckett’s own analytic
                     structure is most effective to create
                     					a clear picture of the mechanisms, themes and structures of the breakdown in

                     					orthographic, conjugational and grammatical errors that Beckett made in the process
                     of translation. A short
                     					quantitative analysis of the errors in the first full handwritten manuscripts
                     of <cite class="title italic">Not

                        						fois</cite> and <cite class="title italic">Footfalls</cite> (a footnote indicates that this document is missing for
                     						<cite class="title italic">Pas</cite>) reveals the discrepancy between <cite class="title italic">Cette fois</cite> and
                     					other plays. Little suggests that the significantly higher number of errors in
                     that manuscript could be another
                     					indication of Beckett’s translation struggles, but he warns the reader against
                     the temptation of drawing any
                     					further conclusion and instead advocates for the “perform[ance of] an act of
                     							<em class="emph">recovery</em> by publishing Beckett’s play in a bilingual critical edition”
                     					[<a class="ref" href="#little2021">Little 2021</a>, 347]. This final gesture speaks for the integrity and generosity with which Little
                     					disseminates his research, acknowledging all colleagues who helped him during
                     the research and writing process,
                     					facilitating access to the most minute, hidden or intricate details of the documents
                     under study and overtly
                     					sharing ideas for further research into the three texts and their translations.
                     The book then is not only a
                     					precious resource for experts, but it is an ethical model and a source of inspiration
                     for undergraduate and

                     of <cite class="title italic">Footfalls/Pas</cite>), they encounter several salient concepts to categorise the play – a play about ageing,
                     a
                     					play about birth, a pacing play, a painkiller play, a wintery play – thematically
                     linking this text to other works
                     					in Beckett’s oeuvre, while singularly articulating “revolving,” the core dynamic in <cite class="title italic">Footfalls</cite>. But it is perhaps the label <em class="term">complex play</em> that may summarise best the composition
                     					process and the practical aspects of performance for this text, since Little
                     emphasises the complexity of the
                     					foliation system, the play’s structure, its title, the naming of characters,
                     the number of voices, the calculations
                     					of May’s pacing, the width of the strip, subplots, and instrumentation. Little
                     shows that <cite class="title italic">Footfalls</cite> kept evolving significantly even post-publication, and he kindly points the reader
                     toward the
                     						“Compare Sentences” tool on the BDMP, to trace the changes in the texts and navigate the complexity
                     					of the creation process. This function enables the user to track variants across
                     the composition process and in the
                     					various editions of the text, and in this case, it can be used not for the sole
                     purpose of genetic criticism, but
                     					also for practitioners to understand how both pacing and voicing operate, especially
                     since the stage directions
                     					related to pacing are more specific in the French text, being enriched by Beckett’s
                     experience of directing the
                     					play.</div>

                  <div class="ptext" id="p19">While the play’s filiation with others of Beckett is highlighted through themes, Little
                     rather suggests to view
                     						<cite class="title italic">Footfalls</cite> as a “textual orphan” by comparison with W. B.
                     					Yeats’ <cite class="title italic">At the Hawk’s Well</cite>
                     					[<a class="ref" href="#little2021">Little 2021</a>, 401]. The scholar argues that the former explores the ungraspable nature of
                     					theatre, a vision also traceable in the latter, the illusive dramaturgy of <cite class="title italic">Footfalls</cite>
                     					then setting the play in sharp contrast with the clear tableaux of <cite class="title italic">Not I</cite> and <cite class="title italic">Footfalls</cite>. Instead of reassessing Beckett’s conflicted relationship to Yeats’ theatre,
                     					Little sticks to the compositional process: he uses this intertextual instance
                     as a means to dig further into
                     					Beckett’s own understanding of the mechanics of writing and the role of memory
                     in the composition and translation
                     					processes, which is further investigated in the section “The Genesis of Pas” with the
                     					analysis of <em class="word">Fatalement</em> (a replacement for <em class="word">Inévitablement</em>), as
                     					a potential reference to Beckett’s interest in Atropos. Such focus is an opportunity
                     to articulate how the play
                     					intrinsically queries the relationship between textuality and performance, but
                     Little also pays attention to the
                     					deeply collaborative nature of the creation of this play; his narrative and analysis
                     of Beckett and Billie Whitelaw
                     					working through posture and pacing in a Parisian restaurant is one of the highlights
                     of the book. Additionally,
                     					through the study of the initial stage direction, Little demonstrates that the
                     composition of the play was driven
                     					by pacing, Beckett presenting text as only secondary. But as far as text is concerned,
                     one of the main achievements
                     					of Little’s analysis of Beckett’s compositional process is to go beyond “vaguening” or “undoing” alone by
                     					suggesting that it is only possible to achieve a “vaguened” stage image with precise stage directions, and
                     					Little introduces other compositional practices, such as correction as improvisation,
                     the presence of textual scars
                     					or weakening. Such strategies, Little contends, exemplify how Beckett’s creation
                     process had evolved towards an
                     					approach that is both text-oriented and stage-oriented. So what steps, after
                     all, is Beckett asking his audiences
                     					to take with this play? </div>
                  				
                  <div class="counter"><a href="#p20">20</a></div>
                  <div class="ptext" id="p20">As Little demonstrates, the spectator is again thrown into the pit of the subject-object
                     breakdown, but this time
                     					through revolving. Indeed, the intertextuality with Yeats’ play is also a locus
                     for the breakdown: Little
                     					identifies that, while Beckett was working on <cite class="title italic">Footfalls</cite>, he also attempted to write
                     					the prose piece “Long Observation of the Ray,” in which Beckett referenced the eye and
                     					mind of <cite class="title italic">The Hawk’s Well</cite> and explored the themes of self-observation and
                     					self-perception without a subject. In <cite class="title italic">Footfalls</cite>, however, it is the clear separation
                     					between subjects that is at stake, whether it is at the plot or linguistic level.
                     Furthermore, Little shows that
                     					Beckett edited woman’s voice’s (V) text to augment the seemingly endless revolution
                     of May’s thoughts without
                     					locating them in the mind, as it is the case in <cite class="title italic">Not I</cite>. And in so doing, Beckett
                     					extended May’s mind to her environment, hence challenging the subject-world divide.
                     In translation, Beckett
                     					heightened the sense of breakdown with the polysemous French word <em class="word">pas</em> as the title for
                     					the piece. <em class="word">Pas</em> operates both as the signifier for steps and the marker of negation in
                     					French grammar. As a result, it negates subjectivity, and as Little demonstrates,
                     it enhances the breakdown of the
                     					subject onstage, while presenting Beckett’s oeuvre as “work in regress” [Beckett, quoted
                     					in <a href="#little2021">Little 2021</a>, 462]. That entropic movement is reinforced by what Little
                     					identifies as the weakening of dialogues and stage directions, which, he argues,
                     intensifies the breakdown of the
                     					character’s subjectivity. In short, Little’s genetic criticism of <cite class="title italic">Footfalls</cite> reveals
                     					how the breakdown had become inherent to Beckett’s experimental theatre, not
                     only as an exploration of changing
                     					modes of subjectivity and new cognitive paradigms, but also – and even more fundamentally
                     – as a performance
                     					practice and ethics, challenging the role (and place) of spectators.</div>

                     translation, and publication
                     					processes over the span of a dozen years. Little’s book represents a significant
                     addition to the branches of
                     					Beckett studies looking at the mind and cognitive processes on their own and
                     in/for performance, but it also
                     					operates as a fast track to research the digitised facsimile of those three plays
                     on the BDMP. For optimal study,
                     					it is preferable to have access to both the book and the BDMP; however, the book
                     also functions as a stand-alone
                     					piece, and it contains numerous visuals of the archival documents, which provide
                     readers with useful insights into
                     					the manuscripts. Beyond the field, it is a key publication for interdisciplinary
                     research that puts performance and
                     					epistemology in dialogue, and it will also be of interest to theatre historians
                     of modernism. The spotlight that it
                     					directs at this set of plays calls for new performances of those demanding pieces
                     and provides invaluable tools to
                     					reimagine those plays in twenty-first century ecosystems. The final product of
                     this hybrid research therefore
                     					invites more academic and creative work on the same material, as the author clearly
                     states in the introduction. The
                     					editors also acknowledge that manuscript edition is an open process, and readers

                     affordances of genetic criticism and
                     					digital humanities combined at the service of other disciplines and practices.
