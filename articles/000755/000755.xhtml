                  <p>This article examines the ethical considerations and broader issues around access
                     to digitised historical medical 
                     images. These illustrations and, later, photographs are often extremely sensitive,
                     representing disability, disease, 
                     gender, and race in potentially harmful and problematic ways. In particular, the original
                     metadata for such images can 
                     include demeaning and sometimes racist terms. Some of these images show sexually explicit
                     and violent content, as well 
                     as content that was obtained without informed consent. Hiding these sensitive images
                     can be tempting, and yet, archives 
                     are meant to be used, not locked away. Through a series of interviews with 10 archivists,
                     librarians, and researchers 
                     based in the UK and US, the authors show that improved access to medical illustrations is 
                     essential to produce new knowledge in the humanities and medical research, as well
                     as to bridge the gap between 
                     historical and modern understandings of the human body. Improving access to medical
                     illustration can also help to 
                     address the “gender data gap”, which has acquired mainstream visibility thanks to the work of activists such as
                     
                     Caroline Criado-Perez, the author of <cite class="title italic">Invisible Women: Data Bias in a World Designed 
                        for Men</cite>. Users of historical medical archives are therefore a diverse group, which includes
                     researchers in 
                     medicine, history, and medical and digital humanities, as well as artists, journalists,
                     and activists.
                     </p>
                  
                  <p>In order to improve discoverability and facilitate access to these archives in an
                     ethical way, this article highlights 
                     the importance of appropriate metadata, which can be enhanced through the use of artificial
                     intelligence (AI) tools. 
                     Indeed, AI can be used to create new metadata when original information is incomplete
                     or is missing altogether, or 
                     when it includes problematic language. AI can also help with the disaggregation of
                     data by gender and/or 
                     racial ethnicity. Moreover, it can recommend similar images to allow users to explore
                     other parts of the collections. 
                     However, AI can also pose issues, for example when it suggests inappropriate metadata
                     or similarity search results. 
                     Keeping humans in the loop is therefore essential when applying AI to sensitive medical
                     images. Ultimately, this article 
                     argues that access to sensitive images cannot be separated from responsibility. Recommendations
                     are made to help 
                     cultural heritage institutions find the right balance, to provide access for research
                     and education, and to also protect 
                     children and other vulnerable audiences from encountering images that can be described
                     as shocking and even 
                     traumatising.

                  <div class="ptext" id="p1">Digitisation has profoundly changed the way we conduct humanities research. The ability
                     to search through library 
                     catalogues, archival databases, and online collections has opened new horizons of
                     research by improving the 
                     discoverability of records (including visual records), thereby allowing them to be
                     used as data. However, in this sea 
                     of accessible data, there is a growing issue of representation. As cultural heritage
                     organisations continue to deal with 
                     challenges regarding gender and race, the sector is still looking for best practices
                     to enhance diversity and make their 
                     digital collections more representative. When images are potentially harmful, or pose
                     ethical challenges (for example, 
                     when they show images of colonialised populations described in racist terms), it is
                     often easier to keep them hidden 
                     away and inaccessible. The vast digitisation efforts of the past two decades have
                     therefore led to divergent outcomes: 
                     visual archival images have become more accessible, and yet, vast troves of images
                     are difficult to discover and use –– 
                     particularly when search engines largely rely on text-based metadata.

                  <div class="counter"><a href="#p2">2</a></div>
                  <div class="ptext" id="p2">In this article, we look at the specific case of archival medical images (taken in
                     a broad sense, to include images 
                     used by medical professionals from ancient times to the present day, but also images
                     documenting people who were judged 
                     as “abnormal” because of their skin colour, disability, and/or other physical characteristics).
                     Lying somewhere 
                     between knowledge and curiosity, medical images of human bodies throughout history
                     have been sources of health 
                     information, sociocultural beliefs, and sites of intrigue and taboo. From the highly
                     detailed anatomical drawings in 
                     Andreas Vesalius's <cite class="title italic">De humani corporis fabrica</cite> (1543) and the pregnant bellies 
                     depicted in midwifery manuals, to images of the “monstrous” physiognomies of criminals, illustrations of dissected, 
                     diseased, pathologized, atypical, and disabled bodies have been in circulation for
                     centuries. In their complex and 
                     varied forms, historical medical images present a wide corpus for medical humanities
                     researchers, as well as other 
                     medical disciplines. However, these records can create serious ethical challenges
                     in terms of their online accessibility, 
                     particularly when illustrations move into photographs of patients or bodies that may
                     be exploitative or of an 
                     insensitive nature. Even when these images are over a century old, with increased
                     ethical considerations and the 
                     difficulty in categorising a diverse range of collections, historical medical images
                     present one of the most difficult 
                     types of records to manage within the heritage sector.

                  <div class="ptext" id="p3">Medical images can be sensitive in multiple ways. Health-related data and data concerning
                     a person's sex life or sexual 
                     orientation are classified as sensitive in legislations such as the European GDPR
                     (General Data Protection 
                     Regulation).<a class="noteRef" href="#d4e250">[1]</a> These 
                     data are subject to specific processing conditions. However, the GDPR only protects
                     personal data of living persons. 
                     It does not apply to the personal data of deceased persons. Archival medical images
                     — especially those produced more 
                     than 100 years ago — can be digitised and made available with a public domain licence.
                     These medical photographs, 
                     drawings, and illustrations are not sensitive in a narrow, legal sense, and yet they
                     contain sensitivities, including 
                     representations of disabilities and diseases (including sexually transmitted diseases
                     and other stigmatized conditions). 
                     Bodies that were once considered as abnormal (such as those with different skin colours
                     or people with tattoos, 
                     scarification, or other physical characteristics) are frequently featured in medical
                     collections. In the case of more 
                     recent collections, the data rights of living people represented in pictures are not
                     the only considerations that 
                     archives need to consider. Some of these images can be challenging for other reasons.
                     For example, campaigns against 
                     AIDS frequently represented explicit sex scenes to encourage people to use condoms
                     and adopt safer sexual 
                     practices.<a class="noteRef" href="#d4e252">[2]</a> Once digitised and put online, these images 
                     can be accessed by anyone — including children and other vulnerable users.<a class="noteRef" href="#d4e277">[3]</a> Archival 
                     repositories therefore face a dilemma of whether to show or not show sensitive medical
                     images — and how to decide what 
                     is or is not considered sensitive.

                  <div class="ptext" id="p4">While this article focuses mainly on the case of <em class="emph">viewers</em> of sensitive archival images, the digitisation of 
                     such images can also be harmful for the people depicted in them. For example, images
                     of naked children originally taken 
                     in a medical context can, once digitised, be accessed and shared without context by
                     anyone, including sexual criminals. 
                     In the case of archival documents created in the past 100 years, individuals could
                     still be alive, and (in theory) their 
                     consent must be obtained prior to digitisation and public release to comply with the
                     GDPR and other data protection 
                     legislation. In practice, many libraries and archives have “take down” policies, which rely on an “opt out” 
                     basis (rather than the “opt in” requirement mandated by the law). In the past few years, this approach has been 
                     criticised on ethical grounds, with a strong emphasis on privacy and consent.<a class="noteRef" href="#d4e306">[4]</a>

                     and ethical implications in 
                     making historical medical records accessible in the digital age.<a class="noteRef" href="#d4e323">[5]</a> Artificial intelligence (AI) can and is being used to improve 
                     access to historical medical illustrations, for example by automatically creating
                     metadata, when original metadata 
                     contains problematic language or is missing altogether. AI can also help with the
                     disaggregation of data by gender and/or 
                     race or ethnicity, where such information is known. Furthermore, AI can be used to
                     suggest similar images through 
                     computer vision and machine learning. The objective of such use is to encourage users
                     to explore other parts of these 
                     collections and to discover additional materials without typing new keywords. However,
                     AI can also pose challenges, 
                     for example by suggesting inappropriate metadata or search results, or by isolating
                     an image from its original context.

                     UK-based interviewees). However, our in-depth interviews have revealed key information
                     that will be useful

                     in historical medical records can be key to discussing broader issues of representation
                     across the galleries, libraries, 
                     archives, and museums (GLAM) sector.

                     widespread and

                     studying the history of particular 
                     diseases. As one interviewee told us: 
                     <blockquote>
                        <p>Maybe it's for diseases which people no longer get, but 
                           actually in terms of symptoms and in terms of diagnosis and just understanding how
                           diseases have developed, that picture 
                           can tell them an awful lot about [another] disease present 200 years ago that maybe
                           doesn't exist now or doesn't exist 
                           in that form now.<a class="noteRef" href="#d4e413">[7]</a></p>
                     </blockquote> Issues such as copyright on 
                     modern images in medical textbooks mean that education providers are experiencing
                     an increase in litigation cases for 
                     unauthorized use of copyrighted medical materials, particularly in the increasing
                     uses of online resources in medical 
                     training [<a class="ref" href="#gutman_2011">Gutman 2011</a>] [<a class="ref" href="#dmytriw_sadler_neumann_2015">Dmytriw, Sadler, and Neumann 2015</a>]. But, as 
                     [<a class="ref" href="#dmytriw_sadler_neumann_2015">Dmytriw, Sadler, and Neumann 2015</a>] suggest, older, out-of-copyright images and those licensed through Creative 
                     Commons could be updated using digital tools, thus improving access to anatomical
                     illustration for educational purposes. 
                     Indeed, many medical illustrations from the earlier twentieth century are highly accurate
                     and suitable for training 
                     modern medical practitioners, with a little updating.

                  <div class="ptext" id="p10">Many of these older illustrations are openly accessible. There are large collections
                     of global historical medical images

                  <div class="ptext" id="p11">These large, digitized collections are often supplemented by a series of funded projects,
                     which allow smaller 
                     institutions to make their collections accessible. As storage and digital interfaces
                     can be important practical issues, 
                     especially for smaller institutions, this is one way to help provide access and limit
                     the disparity of archival 
                     materials. Katie Birkwood, Rare Books and Special Collections Librarian at the Royal College of 
                     Physicians (RCP), told us that “in 2015 and 2016, [they] were part of the 
                     UK Medical Heritage Library project that Wellcome ran with the Internet Archive” and that the RCP 
                     “digitised about 4,100 of our nineteenth-century books, across the theme of medicine” for the 
                     site.<a class="noteRef" href="#d4e493">[14]</a> Although the RCP 
                     does not have the capacity to host its own digital database, the Internet Archive
                     has allowed the college to host some 
                     of their digitised materials online. While these types of digitisation initiatives
                     are helping to make archival 
                     collections more accessible, they still come with limitations and compromises due
                     to funding, metadata, and the 
                     practicalities of digitising potentially fragile materials. For all the visibility
                     of the bodily forms in these 
                     historical records, many medical image collections remain inaccessible online, or
                     else siloed within individual 
                     catalogues, often with thin metadata, out-dated terminologies, or missing contextual
                     records. Many items are lacking 
                     the machine-readable data necessary to create meaningful connections between records.
                     In this way, visual materials 
                     continue to pose considerable problems for institutions when it comes to cataloguing
                     and discoverability, as well as 
                     display and dissemination [<a class="ref" href="#tsafrir_ohry_2001">Tsafrir and Ohry 2001</a>]. Entire collections are locked away when they are 
                     considered too sensitive (for example, images of skulls and bodies of the deceased,
                     taken during the colonial period). 
                     Paradoxically, in the age of mass digitisation initiatives, researchers often face
                     challenges in discovering, sourcing, 
                     and contextualising medical illustrations, which have played a significant role in
                     our understanding of medical and 
                     social history.

                  <div class="ptext" id="p12">The lack of metadata and the sensitivity of records are not the only obstacles to
                     access. The format of the materials 
                     can also make digitisation complicated. From cheaply printed health books to fully
                     illustrated anatomical atlases, 
                     these visual and often multimodal records vary in size and quality, featuring different
                     types of images — from woodcuts 
                     and black-and-white prints to coloured illustrations and photographs. Medical atlases,
                     for example, are often very large 
                     in size, are used as teaching resources, and are difficult to digitise without specialist
                     equipment. These types of 
                     records can also require manual appraisals to make them accessible for online databases,
                     which is often beyond the 
                     capacity of many institutions. Additionally, the formal diversity of these records
                     poses challenges for existing 
                     automation tools trained on photographic images, such as CAMPI (Computer-Aided Metadata
                     Generation for Photo Archives 
                     Initiative), which struggle with illustrated images.

                  <div class="ptext" id="p13">Due to their size and fragility, non-bound illustrations are often not a priority
                     or at times even an option for 
                     digitisation, meaning that many visual medical records are restricted to in-person
                     reading room tables. Due to the ease 
                     of scanning and the availability of host-sites, such as the Internet Archive, it is
                     bound books, both published and 
                     non-published, which are predominantly the items selected for digitisation. Katie Birkwood 
                     (RCP) told us that in the case of the Medical Heritage Library project, small books could
                     easily fit on a 
                     regular scanner. Other formats were less likely to be selected for digitisation: “Anything that had 
                     to go on an oversized scanner, we had to be very picky about and so fewer of those
                     got sent. And if something's in bad 
                     physical condition, you're less likely to send it.”<a class="noteRef" href="#d4e514">[15]</a> The RCP has a collection of 250 large-scale anatomical illustrations, which are not 
                     bound and are not available online. “We can't use the Internet Archive and access portal because 
                     it's not really what it's for”, said one archivist. <a class="noteRef" href="#d4e524">[16]</a> Items that have been selected for digitisation in part due to their format become
                     more accessible, but 
                     also risk being seen as more valuable than others. And when items prioritised for
                     digitisation, and even for 
                     preservation, are imbibed with the impression of value, it perpetuates further issues
                     in diversity and 
                     representation.

                  <div class="ptext" id="p14">In addition to format, external funding has an impact on the decisions to digitise
                     some images and not others. As 
                     Daryl Green, Library and Information professional for the University of Edinburgh told us, 
                     “what's getting prioritised for digitisation is what's getting funded externally, which
                     is not how 
                     an institution should do these things”.<a class="noteRef" href="#d4e536">[17]</a> The impracticalities that surround the digitisation for many institutions across
                     the GLAM sector — often 
                     involving external project remits or limitations due to cost and specialist equipment
                     — mean that there is a risk of 
                     false representation happening across the sector, which can affect the types of research
                     being undertaken.

                  <div class="ptext" id="p15">In short, online image collections, although vast, represent records prioritised for
                     digitisation — items that are 
                     often selected for their potential interest to database users, their suitability for
                     digitisation, or for specific, 
                     funded and themed projects. While images of a medical nature are only one relatively
                     small aspect on a much broader 
                     spectrum, they continue to underpin current research in the humanities and other fields.

                     [<a class="ref" href="#nikolaidou_et_al_2022">Nikolaidou et al. 2022</a>] note, the “growth of digital libraries has contributed to 
                     the research on historical documents by providing high-quality digitised images to
                     researchers to process and 
                     analyse”, meaning the availability of online records has a direct impact on what is being
                     researched.

                  <div class="ptext" id="p16">Access to historical medical illustrations is essential to understand current issues
                     such as ableism (i.e., 
                     discrimination and social prejudice against people with disabilities). Medical illustrations
                     have reinforced ableist 
                     standards of the human form in medicine and popular culture throughout history. As
                     literacy rates and printing 
                     technologies improved across the globe, and as medical texts became more available
                     to public users, the fascination with 
                     physical and medical anomalies increased. Interest in racial and cultural differences,
                     disabilities and physical 
                     differences, diseases, and injuries expanded throughout the sixteenth, seventeenth,
                     and eighteenth centuries, continuing 
                     well into the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. These periods saw a huge increase
                     in the production of medical 
                     illustrations and images, including depictions of bodies labelled as “monstrous”. The depiction of 
                     “monstrous” births in reproductive manuals, for example, is indicative of the increasing public
                     fascination in 
                     anomalies from an increasingly connected world, and, while unsympathetic and stigmatizing,
                     do demonstrate a move away 
                     from a “standard” representation of the body in historical medical works. Several of these types of
                     images are 
                     available on the Wellcome Collection online image catalogue, for example. However,
                     the image database also demonstrates 
                     some of the issues this article wishes to address.

                  <div class="ptext" id="p17">When searching on the Wellcome's image collection for the keyword “monstrosity”, a common phrase used to describe a 
                     discriminatory facet of historical medical literature, there are image results that
                     have been entirely removed from their 
                     original context, including photographs, and some that lack any further description.
                     Similar results occur when searching 
                     the word “abnormalities”. Examples include a black-and-white printed image of baby twins conjoined at the

                     and another similar image of adult conjoined twins titled “Two human figures with abnormalities” 
                     and assigned the following subject keywords: “monsters; abnormalities; abnormality; Siamese; conjoined 
                     twins.”<a class="noteRef" href="#d4e600">[19]</a> 
                     Although these images have clearly been taken from illustrated medical texts, their
                     tags and keywords have been generated 
                     using AI tools based on very little data. While the Wellcome Collection continues
                     to make improvements to their image 
                     collection, their database is supplemented with an image similarity search that utilizes
                     machine learning, which, 
                     unfortunately, can present further mis-association and misinterpretation of sensitive
                     medical images. With such thin 
                     metadata available and the evident inadequacies of similarity searches, particularly
                     for sensitive materials, these 
                     digitised illustrations are difficult to contextualise without further research and
                     investigation. Moreover, the limitations 
                     of historically relevant keywords present ethical considerations in the balancing
                     of historically accurate terminology and 
                     record discoverability.

                     original contexts could also help 
                     researchers to understand the ongoing gender data gap in healthcare. Historians such
                     as Ludmilla Jordanova 
                     have argued that medical texts and images reinforced the idea that the white, male,
                     able body was the standard of the human 
                     form, with the only real difference in female bodies being their reproductive systems
                     [<a class="ref" href="#jordanova_1989">Jordanova 1989</a>]. This 
                     androcentric view has been perpetuated by the availability of digital records and
                     anatomical images. Indeed, most 
                     figure-based images included in medical literature from the fifteenth to early-twentieth
                     century largely show explicitly 
                     female anatomy only to demonstrate pregnancy and birth, or to distinguish female genitalia.
                     As Elinor Cleghorn 
                     has argued, the perception of the female body throughout history was, medically, socially,
                     and culturally speaking, dictated 
                     by the possession of a uterus [<a class="ref" href="#cleghorn_2021">Cleghorn 2021</a>]. The trend in depicting mostly male bodies in historical 
                     medical materials is often put down to the lack of female test subjects. The subsequent
                     medical studies that have developed 
                     based on male bodies are underlined as one of the major reasons why women's diseases
                     are still being misdiagnosed

                     also feature some diversity. As highlighted by Keren Rosa Hammerschlag's investigation into 
                     Friedrich Tiedemann's <cite class="title italic">Tabulae arteriarum corporis humani</cite> (1822), translated into 
                     English in 1829 as <cite class="title italic">Plates of the Arteries of the Human Body</cite>, some medical atlases did feature 
                     a diverse range of anatomy from males and females [<a class="ref" href="#hammerschlag_2021a">Hammerschlag 2021a</a>]. Indeed, according to 
                     William Schupbach (Research Developer, Wellcome Collection) a “smaller number of works, 
                     mostly eighteenth or nineteenth century, which concentrate on viscera, show men and
                     women”, and the decision to 
                     represent different bodies “really all depends what the purpose of the illustration 
                     is”.<a class="noteRef" href="#d4e720">[21]</a> While the purpose of an 
                     image can draw many interpretations, taking an example from nineteenth-century surgeon
                     Joseph Maclise's more 
                     inclusive work, <cite class="title italic">Surgical Anatomy</cite> (1851), Hammerschlag has drawn attention to the 
                     representation of a black male subject in the London edition, as well as the deliberate
                     removal of the same figure in the

                     Archival medical images can therefore offer a broad spectrum of social and cultural
                     attitudes towards gender, race, and 
                     ability, representing key sources in tracing the dissemination of medical knowledge

                     and historians established new 
                     archival collections needed to write women's history. In this study, we want to highlight

                     searches are often unable to 
                     distinguish medical records produced by or featuring women, or other under-represented
                     contributors. A staff member at the

                     illuminate under-represented groups is a central reason for including gender in material

                     complexities. Indeed, disaggregating data based on gender is more challenging than

                     identify with a binary gender — at the 
                     same time, the decision to not disaggregate data (and a lack of guidance on how to
                     effectively disaggregate data, 
                     particularly around gender), is disguising under-represented contributors, not least

                     racism of the time?”<a class="noteRef" href="#d4e792">[26]</a>

                  <div class="ptext" id="p26">One approach, as Lois Hendrickson (Curator, Wangensteen Historical Library of Biology and Medicine, 
                     University of Minnesota) discussed, is to recover marginalised groups and individuals in catalogue data.
                     In a 
                     new initiative, the library is focussing on three topics — women, disability, and
                     black history — to help improve 
                     representation within their special collections and rare books. Hendrickson is working to address gender  
                     with a colleague who took common women's names in French and English from the nineteenth
                     and twentieth centuries and ran 
                     that against the catalogue to create a Python script to improve the records, using

                     the discussion of disaggregating data by gender, suggested that relevant materials
                     are “difficult to 
                     locate . . . , especially if you are relatively inexperienced in terms of searching
                     in library catalogues, and we want to 
                     make sure that people are able to study the history of voices that are not necessarily
                     raised up very frequently in the 
                     historiography”.<a class="noteRef" href="#d4e815">[28]</a> Beck and 
                     Hendrickson advocated that the Wangensteen Library are doing what they can to ensure that the
                     collection is 
                     “a more robust representation of a global history of 
                     medicine”.<a class="noteRef" href="#d4e826">[29]</a> While there is a 
                     willingness to approach these prominent issues in representation, many of the potential
                     solutions are currently siloed 
                     within individual institutions.

                     <blockquote>
                        <p>“Rodent 
                           disease” to mean cancer is a common nineteenth-century term. So, the original catalogue record
                           reflects terminology 
                           of the date of the portrait. The new description is not contemporary with the portrait,
                           but it doesn't distort — it doesn't 
                           say, “He's got cancer”, or, “He's got syphilis”. It just puts into 
                           plain language of the twenty-first century, and indeed twentieth century, by saying,
                           “It appears to eat 
                           away part of his nose”. Eating away is what “rodent” means, so it's simply replacing the 
                           Latin medical term with an English vernacular term.<a class="noteRef" href="#d4e885">[30]</a>

                     the phrase “rodent 
                     disease”, yet the term is still searchable. The original title inscribed on the verso of the
                     painting 
                     (“Cancer of the nose”) was considered inexact by the cataloguer, who added the following 
                     metadata: “[H]e seems to have ‘Hutchinson's teeth’, a symptom of 
                     congenital syphilis, the inscription may be a euphemism”.

                     to more challenges. As another staff 
                     member at the Wellcome Collection told us: 
                     <blockquote>
                        <p>I've gone back to look at all these Leeds 
                           portraits and there's not been a uniform decision around the language. So that's one
                           of the challenges I think we have, 
                           that there are so many of these scenarios, when do we stop and what do we do?<a class="noteRef" href="#d4e912">[31]</a></p>
                     </blockquote> In making these decisions, while aligning with current equality, diversity, and inclusion
                     
                     initiatives, there is a significant lack of guidance and best practices in dealing
                     with visual records, particularly those 
                     of a potentially sensitive nature. Often the decisions to change or alter records
                     are being done in house, and those 
                     decisions, without explicit best policy guidance, are a serious challenge. As Emily Beck told us, 
                     “[T]hinking about what happens when we change the language to make it more appropriate
                     — does that 
                     actually make it harder to locate those materials?”<a class="noteRef" href="#d4e918">[32]</a> In updating metadata and terminology, there are “huge red flags and warning signs that 
                     come up when you start trying to explicitly tag images”, as one professional at the Wellcome Collection told us.

                  <div class="ptext" id="p31">Changing metadata is problematic, but leaving outdated terms can be an even bigger
                     issue. “We know that 
                     every computer vision system out there is full of biases that we don't necessarily
                     want to perpetuate within the 
                     collection”, said the same Wellcome professional. They continued, “But equally the data set that 
                     we have is historical, [and] does contain all sorts of biases itself that we don’t
                     want to project forwards out into the 
                     world and the future”.<a class="noteRef" href="#d4e934">[33]</a> With growing awareness that AI 
                     systems are trained using all kinds of data (including metadata from digital archives),
                     GLAM professionals are increasingly 
                     reluctant to leave outdated metadata unchanged. In doing so, they are departing from
                     traditional archival thinking, which 
                     views the role of the archivist as neutral, committed only to preserving the fonds
                     without changing anything in the records 
                     or their original classification. This thinking, which finds its origins in the nineteenth
                     century, is increasingly being 
                     challenged by a new vision of the archivist as an activist who actively intervenes
                     in the collection.

                  <div class="ptext" id="p32">This change is, arguably, a necessary one in the digital age. Once online, images
                     are continuously copied, adapted, updated, 
                     and reused — just as the earlier printed versions were, although on a far greater
                     and more immediate scale. The Europeana 
                     database, for example, provides search results from the Wellcome Collection image
                     database. So even when records are updated 
                     with more appropriate data, other versions can continue to carry outdated language.
                     As one interviewee at the Wellcome 
                     Collection told us:

                           — on Twitter, on Wikimedia — lots of different places. . . . Well, should we take
                           them down? Should we restrict access if 
                           we know that they're already out there? Or do we try and sort of improve what we have
                           and try and improve the accuracy by 
                           updating our record?<a class="noteRef" href="#d4e942">[34]</a></p>
                     </blockquote> This issue highlights the ongoing 
                     complexities of accessibility and responsibility, particularly for images that can
                     appear without their original contexts.

                     However, the application of AI within the cultural heritage and information management
                     sectors is still associated with 
                     challenges and criticisms, and many of our interviewees suggested that manual processing
                     remains the preferred technique, 
                     particularly when dealing with ethical issues and problems in representation. Daryl Green

                           your immense backlog of archival 
                           material or you can put that towards fooling around with AI technology”, and ten times out of ten I'm going to say 
                           backlog, because that's what's needed.<a class="noteRef" href="#d4e975">[36]</a></p>
                     </blockquote> 
                     In this perspective, AI is not seen as a priority when there are more urgent tasks
                     to complete — such as cataloguing 
                     collections that are currently inaccessible.

                  <div class="ptext" id="p34">While there is some resistance to applying AI to collections, cataloguing and manually
                     adding metadata to huge numbers of 
                     digital images is often not possible and can inadvertently create a larger backlog.
                     In order to automate the process, AI 
                     can be used to create new metadata when original information is incomplete or missing
                     altogether, or when it includes 
                     potentially harmful or outdated language. Using computer vision, it is possible to
                     identify people featured in images, in 
                     order to enrich the metadata and humanise individuals who were frequently described
                     with generic, discriminatory, and 
                     sometimes racist language. AI can also serve to disaggregate data by gender and/or
                     race or ethnicity, and it can provide 
                     sensitivity reviews. Following recommendations on gendered metadata [<a class="ref" href="#havens_et_al_2022">Havens et al. 2022</a>]

                     data categorisation is crucial to 
                     furthering medical humanities research in the digital age. Such improvements would
                     allow the cultural heritage sector and 
                     researchers to engage more readily with concerns in the representation of disability,

                        <p>When you type in the word “skeleton”, the search engine doesn’t look at the images at all. It

                           ours. . . The example at the front of my mind is that there was a very kind of tight
                           cluster of words that related to food, 
                           and in the visual features that we extracted from images, it was hard for the computer
                           vision algorithm to differentiate 
                           between pictures of meat and pictures of gory surgery. An algorithm doesn't necessarily
                           know how to differentiate that

                     metadata for the breastfeeding poster. The visual aspects of the two pictures are
                     also dissimilar, with two women and a baby 
                     on the one side, and a young man on the other side. And yet, these two images are
                     presented as “visually 
                     similar”. A disclaimer states: “We use machine learning to find images in our collection with 
                     similar shape and features”. Users are invited to get in touch if “something doesn’t look

                     with the archival

                     Ethical issues regarding digital 
                     medical images are often associated with the changing audience for these images —
                     from a restricted readership to anyone who 
                     has access to the internet. When records are made openly available online, they can
                     be accessed by viewers who might be 
                     shocked by what they see. Explicit images of surgery or of sexual practices are clearly
                     not suitable for children, and yet, 
                     they are widely available. According to the sociologist Deborah Lupton, medical illustrations have 
                     
                     <blockquote>
                        <p>moved from being exclusively the preserve of medical students and surgeons to being
                           open to the gaze of 
                           all. Online technologies now allow anyone with access to a computer to view highly
                           detailed visual images of the inside of 
                           the body. Although these images may have been produced for medical students and medical
                           practitioners and other healthcare 
                           workers, they are readily available to the general public. [<a class="ref" href="#lupton_2014">Lupton 2014</a>, 172]</p>
                     </blockquote>
                     Digitisation of medical images therefore comes with a number of serious ethical considerations
                     considering what should and 
                     should not, be made available to the public.

                     insensitive records and the decolonisation of archives are at the forefront of current
                     policy changes across institutions, 
                     as decolonisation statements are being made available to users of online archival
                     databases across the UK, 
                     US, and Europe. These policies address the use of outdated language, insensitive terminology, and
                     
                     the cultural prejudices prevalent at the time of record production, acting as a pre-warning
                     for database users. Moreover, 
                     informed consent doctrines have guided data collection endeavours for several decades,
                     particularly in the medical and 
                     science sectors concerning human subjects. However, according to Vinay Uday Prabhu and Abeba 
                     Birhane, the age of big data has gradually eroded issues of consent, privacy, and agency.
                     Large-scale image datasets, 
                     like ImageNet, have troublesome labelling, as well as a lack of sources or context.
                     Yet such datasets are being widely used 
                     to train machine learning and computer vision models [<a class="ref" href="#odumosu_2020">Odumosu 2020</a>].

                     representative of only a few. Computer vision has indeed faced challenges in its poor
                     performance regarding underrepresented 
                     groups. For example, it is notoriously bad at accurately identifying non-white faces.
                     This is because most computer vision 
                     and machine learning tools are trained using images from internet-based sources, containing
                     high quality, colourised 
                     images with a clear subject focus, but often lacking diversity.

                     such automation leaves images of

                     largely invisible on online archival 
                     databases, even where visual image searches are enabled. Such medical images therefore
                     provide serious ethical and practical 
                     challenges for archival record managers. As Tsyng-Yi Lin et al. acknowledged in an influential essay published 
                     in 2014, recognition systems perform fairly well on iconic views of objects (profile,
                     centralised, and unobstructed), but 
                     struggle to recognise objects otherwise [<a class="ref" href="#lin_et_al_2014">Lin et al. 2014</a>]. Much progress has been made in the field of 
                     computer vision since then, but the tools remain imperfect. Moreover, as [<a class="ref" href="#wang_et_al_2019">Wang et al. 2019</a>] have discovered, 
                     even when datasets are balanced, for example in terms of gender, trained models can
                     significantly amplify the association 
                     between labels and gender, even to the same extent as if the data had not been balanced.
                     A biased dataset, according to 
                     [<a class="ref" href="#deviyani_2022">Deviyani 2022</a>], is one that generally has attributes with an uneven class distribution, meaning
                     that tools 
                     trained on these datasets perform badly for minority classes. In the case of computer
                     vision and image recognition software 
                     for images of persons, the distribution of racially and gender-diverse images, as
                     well as the types of images, will have a 
                     direct effect on the efficiency of the tool.

                     [<a class="ref" href="#zhang_et_al_2017">Zhang et al. 2017</a>]. When facial-recognition algorithms are trained on large, existing datasets such
                     as 
                     IMDB-WIKI, the largest dataset of human faces with age and gender tags, the bias towards
                     conventionally attractive, 
                     “celebrity” faces directly informs the effectiveness of the tool. According to Luke Stark and 
                     Jevan Hutson, the use of such facial recognition datasets is “a matter of urgent 
                     concern”. The automated reading of a human's bodily composition, gender, race, expression,
                     and physical 
                     characteristics mirrors the ancient and unequivocally ableist practice of physiognomy,

                     Hutson deem to be “oppressive and unjust” [<a class="ref" href="#stark_hutson_2022">Stark and Hutson 2022</a>]. The 
                     diversity of human figures in medical image collections may therefore help to address
                     this current imbalance. If more images 
                     of the human body in all its varied forms were available as machine-readable datasets,
                     automated visual identification

                     although the subject demands further 
                     discussion and communication between researchers and professionals in data and record
                     management. Keeping entire collections 
                     hidden because they contain potentially harmful or outdated metadata, or because they
                     represent scenes that we find 
                     disturbing, is not sustainable. There is no point keeping archival materials that
                     are never used. Moreover, the reliance of 
                     AI systems on high-quality data means that it is risky to restrict the sources used
                     to train these systems. Without diverse 
                     sources, the risk is that AI relies too much on similar datasets (for example, images
                     of male, able bodies). In turn, this 
                     can lead to unsatisfactory outcomes when AI is used to add metadata, in the case of
                     missing or incomplete data. Likewise, 
                     when AI is used to improve search functionalities based on image similarity, it produces
                     better results when it has been 
                     trained on large and diverse datasets. Well-trained AI systems can lead users to discover

                     problematic language. They are again 
                     left on their own when it comes to displaying sensitive images. Releasing vast amounts
                     of sensitive content without any 
                     oversight could lead to unintended consequences, the severity of which for vulnerable
                     users cannot be underestimated.

                  <div class="ptext" id="p47">Following Gaia Bernstein's example, we would like to offer these <span class="hi bold">takeaway points</span> to 
                     encourage further discussion and research in the topic of access to sensitive images:
                     
                     <ul class="list">
                        <li class="item">Hiding sensitive medical images is not a viable option for several reasons: archives
                           are meant to be used, not locked 
                           away; having more images available would diversify datasets, potentially leading to
                           social good — including addressing 
                           ableism and decreasing the gender data gap.
                           </li>
                        <li class="item">AI can be used to make images — including sensitive images — more discoverable and
                           accessible. For example, AI can 
                           be used to add a new layer of metadata, or to suggest similar images in other parts
                           of the collection, and to offer users 
                           content warnings.
                           </li>
                        <li class="item">However, access cannot be separated from responsibility. It is not responsible to
                           release sensitive images without 
                           any oversight, or to push sensitive content to users who have viewed images considered
                           similar.
                           </li>
                        <li class="item">More national regulations and professional guidelines are needed to prevent children
