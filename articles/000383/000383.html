                  <p>This article provides an overview of some of the complex issues involved in
                     reconstructing and visualizing past landscapes. It discusses the importance of
                     empirical data and introduces some of the terminology necessary for
                     understanding methods which are often considered more in the domain of the
                     natural sciences than humanities. Current methods and practices are put in the
                     context of environmental archaeology, archaeological theory and heritage
                     management as well as related, briefly, to the broader context of archaeological
                     theory, practice and research data infrastructure. Finally, some examples and
                     pointers for the future are given in the hope that the article may provide a
                     point of reference for those looking to gain an entry point into the study of
                     past landscapes, and understand their relevance in archaeological
                     visualisation.

                     pragmatism into what we see as an increasingly abstract and theoretically
                     orientated Digital Humanities (DH). We will present a critical perspective on
                     some of the problems and potentials relating to the visualisation of past
                     (primarily non-urban) landscapes, with particular emphasis on the use of
                     empirical evidence, from a combined environmental and archaeological point of
                     view. We will outline some of the major challenges associated with
                     reconstructing past landscapes from data, and give some examples of recent
                     attempts to create platforms for addressing some of these issues. We will also
                     briefly discuss the importance of landscape visualisation in the context of
                     heritage management.

                  <div class="ptext" id="p2">Visualization can mean many things to many people. Here we choose to limit
                     ourselves to the Oxford English Dictionary [<a class="ref" href="#oed2016">OED 2016</a>] definition
                     of “[t]he action or fact of visualizing;
                     the power or process of forming a mental picture or vision of something not
                     actually present to the sight; a picture thus formed”. For
                     archaeologists, the only things “present to the sight” are
                     the remains or results of past human activities and natural processes; any
                     modern day landscape is the product of its history and geology. It could be said
                     that what archaeologists are most often trying to understand - (loosely
                     speaking) the nature of past human activities and their contexts - are
                     <em class="emph">never</em>
                     “actually present to the sight”, and thus that visualization
                     is an intrinsic part of archaeology. In this paper, we focus primarily on the
                     visualization of prehistoric, non-urban landscapes, rather than archaeological
                     sites or structures, and the prerequisites for being able to do this. We use the
                     term “environmental reconstruction” almost synonymously with visualization,
                     the former being the more common expression for any form of quantitative or
                     qualitative expression of an understanding of a past landscape, or
                     archaeological site context. Whilst there is an increasing interest in the
                     incorporation of multi-sensorial experiences in archaeological reconstructions
                     (especially sound, see e.g. [<a class="ref" href="#d%C3%ADaz-andreu2015">Díaz-Andreu and Mattioli 2015</a>]), we will limit the
                     discussion to the more established visual attributes which are more easily
                     quantifiable through palaeoenvironmental data. Although yet to be verified
                     scientifically, it is the opinion of the authors that the word
                     “reconstruction” has, perhaps through misunderstanding, become a
                     somewhat loaded word in DH discussions, and we would like to emphasise that we
                     in no way advocate the recreation of static, absolute and fully accurate
                     reproductions of the past. Our use of the term implies a more diachronic (2D or
                     3D) simulation of archaeological and environmental interpretations based on the
                     interrelationships between the different (and often few) materials studied by
                     the archaeologists and palaeoecologists. Absolute certainty is against the
                     nature of the scientific method, and any form of reconstruction is always
                     accompanied by an implicit set of error margins and notions of transience (see,
                     however, [<a class="ref" href="#oldfield2014">Oldfield and Steffen 2014</a>] for a discussion of problems with this
                     approach in relation to Earth Systems science and climate change). In this
                     respect, our “environmental reconstructions” are close to
                     those commonly employed in Quaternary Science (see [<a class="ref" href="#lowe2015">Lowe and Walker 2015</a>]).

                  <div class="ptext" id="p3">We use the term archaeology also in its broadest meaning - as a holistic science
                     incorporating all of its various sub-disciplines, but also any methods
                     incorporated to enable it to answer complex questions on the nature of the past.
                     We therefore refer to <em class="emph">archaeologists</em> as practitioners of this
                     holistic science, and maintain naïve oblivion to the tendency of real world
                     archaeologists to label themselves within often highly specific sub-fields
                     (although we will name some of these affiliations for the purpose of
                     illustration; for an overview of archaeology as a discipline, see [<a class="ref" href="#trigger2006">Trigger 2006</a>]). Similarly, we somewhat provocatively lump
                     palaeoecologists (Quaternary scientists) involved in environmental
                     reconstruction into this super-discipline, as they essentially undertake the
                     same work as environmental archaeologists, but tend to be less reluctant to
                     investigate times and places which lack any evidence of human activity.
                     Palaeoecologists are those who collect data on past landscapes, using methods
                     which study a variety of sources, from the properties of the sediments
                     themselves to fossil pollen and insects. These sources, which some find
                     analogous to artefacts and other archaeological materials (i.e. ecofacts; <span class="error"><a class="ref" href="#bindford1964">#bindford1964</a></span>), are commonly referred to as <em class="emph">proxy data
                        sources</em>, due to their use as proxies for past environmental change.

                  <div class="ptext" id="p4">There have been numerous attempts to inject a post-structural approach to
                     visualizing past landscapes into archaeology, often as a reaction to the
                     tendency to present single graphical images based on the interpretation of
                     limited, equivocal data. In the early 1990s, a number of archaeologists began
                     emphasizing the importance of subjective experience in the process of
                     understanding the existence of prehistoric peoples in their landscape contexts
                     (e.g. [<a class="ref" href="#tilley1994">Tilley 1994</a>]). These authors were undoubtedly influenced by
                     the perceptual geographers of the previous decades (e.g. [<a class="ref" href="#tuan1977">Tuan 1977</a>], [<a class="ref" href="#tuan1979">Tuan 1979</a>]; [<a class="ref" href="#pocock1989">Pocock 1989</a>]) as much as their
                     contemporaries in archaeology and anthropology (e.g. [<a class="ref" href="#ingold1993">Ingold 1993</a>]) and geography (e.g. [<a class="ref" href="#simmons1993">Simmons 1993</a>]), and characterized a
                     rising tide of post-modern landscape archaeology riding in the sea of
                     post-processual archaeology (see [<a class="ref" href="#trigger2006">Trigger 2006</a>]). Although perhaps
                     not intentionally, such work spurred on a habitual partitioning of academic
                     practitioners of archaeology into the schools of <em class="emph">the theorist</em> and
                     <em class="emph">the scientist</em>; the latter denoting specialists in the
                     objective, empirically orientated archaeological sciences<a class="noteRef" href="#d4e316">[1]</a> and the former
                     tending away from this into the use of more conjectural arguments to describe
                     the past (see [<a class="ref" href="#yoffee1993">Yoffee and Sherratt 1993</a>] for a collection of contemporary
                     narratives and [<a class="ref" href="#johnson2006">Johnson 2006</a>] for further discussion). Despite
                     this dichotomy, a large number of archaeologists, including a large and
                     fundamentally pragmatic body residing outside of academia<a class="noteRef" href="#d4e324">[2]</a>,
                     have maintained the archaeological tradition of acquiring and using whichever
                     theories and methods were most appropriate or accessible for solving the
                     questions at hand (but see [<a class="ref" href="#bradley2006">Bradley 2006</a>] for some thoughts on
                     potential problems and possibilities resulting from the separation of academic
                     and commercial archaeology). As a result, there are now increasingly large
                     amounts of empirical data available, in a vast array of archives, from which
                     past environments can be modelled (see e.g. [<a class="ref" href="#kintigh2015">Kintigh et al 2015</a>]).

                     over, these discussions (e.g. [<a class="ref" href="#evans2003">Evans 2003</a>]), but many more
                     continued to work in the tradition of the natural sciences, follow in
                     hypo-deductive or inductive methodologies. Having theoretical frameworks for the
                     interpretation of evidence from the past is, of course, extremely important, and
                     concepts such as modern analogues, taphonomy, representivity and statistical
                     significance are just examples of the multiple aspects of these. When it comes
                     to populating landscapes with human actions, cultures and societies there are
                     naturally other requirements, including social theory, agency, supply and demand
                     and many other concepts, but these are outside the scope of this paper.

                     archaeology and heritage studies have begun to consider the environment not

                     artefact in itself <span class="error"><a class="ref" href="#fairclough2002">#fairclough2002</a></span>. This is a conceptualization
                     that converges with the generally more spatially orientated, yet less
                     anthropocentric, approach to landscapes expressed in Quaternary science. The
                     Anthropocene concept of the geological age of humanity is perhaps a culmination
                     of these, and more, perspectives on the importance of humans as active parts of
                     a landscape (see both [<a class="ref" href="#foley2013">Foley et al. 2013</a>] and [<a class="ref" href="#braje2014">Braje et al. 2014</a>]

                     under sustained criticism in the past two decades (see, for instance, [<a class="ref" href="#hicks2007">Hicks et al 2007</a>] for an overview of these critiques). The notion that
                     cultural activity only took place where traces of cultural activity are present
                     misses the point that being in the landscape is an all-encompassing engagement
                     with the environment, and that traces of this engagement extend beyond
                     recognizably anthropogenic features. The points, in a sense, can be thought of
                     as spatially scattered fragments lacking a conjoining context. Depending on the
                     nature of the evidence preserved at these points, environmental archaeology may
                     provide the potential to reveal certain aspects of this landscape context
                     through proxy data sources. The landscape itself also tells a different story to
                     that found in historical archives [<a class="ref" href="#clark2003">Clark et al 2003</a>]. Clark, Darlington
                     and Fairclough (<span class="foreign i">ibid.</span>) have argued that
                     landscape is a medium of understanding the past, a “pathway into our memories”
                      [<a class="ref" href="#clark2003">Clark et al 2003</a>, 1]. It is also seen as a medium to manage issues “where people and land come

                     and continued to develop throughout the 1990s, led by the initiative of English
                     Heritage (now known as Historic England). The agency acknowledged the
                     theoretical issues in protecting only sites on a list such as the Historic
                     Environment Record (HER) and began to argue for approaches moving beyond the
                     site itself. Initially, the focus was still on monuments (now in their landscape
                     context), but then moved to the historic and archaeological dimension of the
                     entire landscape, whether site-based or not <span class="error"><a class="ref" href="#fairclough2002">#fairclough2002</a></span>.

                     some of the ambiguities and entanglements of landscape. As Bender notes, “landscapes refuse to be disciplined. They
                     make a mockery of the oppositions that we create between time (History) and
                     space (Geography), or between nature (Science) and culture (Social

                     particular consider ways to address multiple perceptions and valuations of
                     landscape, as well as providing affordances for multiple – and contesting -
                     interpretations of landscape. Finally, inherent in this way of seeing landscape
                     is the key element of uncertainty arising from perceptions from multiple
                     perspectives, incomplete data sources and the degree of uncertainty ever-present

                     archaeology has only access to snapshots of time, as made available through
                     sampling or excavation. These samples may contain traces of the past in the form
                     of organic remains (fossils), chemical or physical properties which in some way
                     reflect the nature of the environment in which they were deposited: proxy data
                     sources. For example, pollen from a tree may be blown into a lake and, as time
                     passes, subsequently be covered by more sediment (<a href="#figure01">Figure
                        1</a>). If sampled, the presence of this tree’s pollen will allow us to
                     deduce the presence of the particular tree species in the past environment of
                     the lake. By analysing and dating multiple sediment layers, the palynologist
                     (pollen analyst) can start to build a picture of changes in the prominence of
                     different species of plant in the landscape around the lake over time. The
                     proportion of pollen from different plants is, however, dependent on a large
                     number of factors (e.g. number and density of plants, plant age and health,
                     hydrology, human activity) and it is a far from simple task to create a
                     visualisation of the “most probable landscape” from these
                     data. By using multiple proxies, such as fossil insects and soil properties, we
                     can enhance the complexity of the picture beyond just the vegetation, but we can
                     never escape from a plurality of possible reconstructions.

                     pieces of information to construct a whole. Variation in theory and methodology,
                     as well as implicit variability catered for in a methodology, will allow for
                     these pieces to be put together in practically innumerable combinations.
                     Deciding which combinations produce the more probable reconstructions is not
                     easy, and has led to disagreements between ecologists and palaeoecologists, and
                     even between different groups of palaeoecologists on how the evidence represents
                     different aspects of the landscape. This is particularly well illustrated by the
                     continuing debate on the nature of mid-Holocene (roughly 6000 years ago)
                     woodlands, regarded by many as representing the last woodlands truly unaffected
                     by human activity. Until recently, the majority of palynologists agreed on these
                     having been closed canopy woodland, and more or less continuous over much of
                     Europe (see e.g. [<a class="ref" href="#mitchell2005">Mitchell 2005</a>]), an interpretation which has had
                     much influence on “natural”/pre-industrial baseline
                     orientated conservation strategies. The ecologist Franz Vera (2000) hypothesized
                     an alternative landscape history, with a more dynamic cycle of open and closed
                     forests driven by large grazing animals, and challenged the representivity of
                     the pollen data. The evidence from palaeoentomology (fossil beetle analyses) is,
                     however, inconclusive, and there is much debate on how the fossil remains of
                     woodland insects should be interpreted [<a class="ref" href="#alexander2012">Alexander 2012</a>]. Problems
                     of representivity are common to the use of all proxy data sources, and methods
                     have been developed for mathematically translating raw data counts into broader
                     implications. In palynology (pollen analysis), there are algorithms for
                     translating fossil pollen data, through the use of modern calibration data, into
                     landscapes of probable vegetation (e.g. [<a class="ref" href="#bunting2009">Bunting and Middleton 2009</a>]; [<a class="ref" href="#sugita2007">Sugita 2007</a>]). These methods are complex, reflecting the
                     difficulty of the task, and have the capacity to provide multiple outcomes with
                     an indication of their relative probability of being close to the truth.

                     is one of the most serious threats to cultural heritage today [<a class="ref" href="#blankholm2009">Blankholm 2009</a>]. Sites are simply disappearing as they are washed
                     into the sea or eroded from river banks globally<a class="noteRef" href="#d4e547">[3]</a> (see [<a class="ref" href="#adams2015">Adams 2015</a>] for a broad summary of the implications of climate
                     change for cultural heritage). Erosion, and the resultant deposition, are
                     physical processes that have been active throughout the history of the Earth.
                     They are, however, an often neglected component of landscape change over
                     archaeological timescales, despite having significant implications for changes
                     in the value of land and water over time. There is evidence that many areas of
                     the world have experienced major episodes of sediment movement in prehistory,
                     most likely associated with cultural activities such as deforestation, the
                     introduction of slash and burn agriculture or the deep cutting ploughs. As a
                     consequence, many potential upland archaeological sites have been lost, and many
                     lowland sites buried under metres of sediment. Similarly, the geomorphology of
                     landscapes has changed as sediments have been eroded from higher areas and
                     deposited in lowlands or water bodies. Using modern day Digital Elevation Models
                     (DEM’s) as the basis for landscape reconstructions can therefore be misleading.
                     If one is to understand the archaeology in its contemporary landscape context, a
                     more specific understanding of past sediment movements is essential. At the time
                     of writing, no significant models incorporating sediment fluxes have been
                     produced and integrated into archaeological landscape models. However, we now
                     have the technology to facilitate this, and are on the verge of creating the
                     transdisciplinary sciences necessary to integrate the full range of skills
