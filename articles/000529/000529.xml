                        <p>Moisés García Guzmán was born in Tlacochahuaya, Oaxaca, Mexico and is a
                            native speaker of Valley Zapotec. He teaches English to high school
                            students at CETIs #124 in Tlacolula. His education from primary school
                            through University was in his home state of Oaxaca. His dad was an
                            immigrant to the U.S. and they reunited in the U.S. after many years of
                            not seeing each other. After that, he lived in California for 14 years,
                            during which time he earned his certification to teach English back
                            home. It was during this time that he became a Zapotec activist and his
                            work includes a documentary web series (<title rend="italic">Dizhsa

                            Dictionary (Lillehaugen 2019). He hopes to raise awareness on the
                            importance of language preservation as an element of cultural identity
                            in the state of Oaxaca. He serves as a board member to the Ticha

                            age 16, speaking no English and little Spanish. By 2007 he had earned
                            his Ph.D. from UCLA in urban planning. It was there that he began
                            working with linguists to document his language, resulting in a
                            trilingual Zapotec-Spanish-English dictionary (Munro and Lopez et al.,
                            1999). He is a Zapotec writer and poet and his work has been published

                <p>There are hundreds of alphabetic texts in Zapotec languages dating back to the
                    16th century. Today, however, Zapotec speakers are generally unable to read
                    these texts, due to lack of access to the texts and an unfamiliarity with the
                    orthographic practices. Moreover, significant changes have taken place in the
                    grammar in the intervening centuries. This results in a situation where Zapotec
                    people may not have access to history in their own language. Ticha is an online
                    digital text explorer that provides access to images, transcriptions, analysis,
                    and translations of the Colonial Zapotec texts. The Ticha project includes
                    in-person workshops with Zapotec community members as part of an iterative
                    development process. Feedback from these interactions inform design decisions
                    for the project. Here we reflect on transnational collaboration with
                    stakeholders in building a digital scholarship project that seeks to use the
                    power of digital humanities to democratize access to materials and resources
                    which were previously the exclusive domain of a few experts. When community
                    members have access to important documents from their own history, archiving,
                    scholarship, and community engagement can be brought together in a powerful
                    synthesis.</p>

                <p>Resumen. Hay cientos de textos alfabéticos en lenguas zapotecas desde el siglo
                    dieciséis. No obstante, hoy en día los zapoteco-hablantes generalmente no pueden
                    leer estos textos, debido a una falta de acceso a los textos como también por
                    falta de familiaridad con las prácticas ortográficas. Además, la gramática ha
                    cambiado mucho en los siglos intermedios. Por consiguiente, muchos zapotecos no
                    tienen acceso a su historia escrita en su propia lengua. Ticha es un explorador
                    digital de texto que brinda acceso en línea a las imágenes, transcripciones,
                    análisis y traducciones de los textos en zapoteco colonial. El proyecto de Ticha
                    incluye talleres con miembros de la comunidad zapoteca como parte de un proceso
                    de desarrollo interactivo. Los comentarios y reacciones que resultan de estas

                <p>Around 1675, Sebastiana de Mendoza, a prominent woman in the Zapotec community of
                    Tlacochahuaya, Oaxaca, created her last will and testament <ptr
                        target="#floresmarcial2015"/>
                    <ptr target="#munro2018"/>. In this document, she tells her descendants and
                    executors her wishes for the final disposition of her belongings. As
                    Flores-Marcial [<ref target="#floresmarcial2015">2015</ref>, 52] writes,
                    Sebastiana de Mendoza <quote rend="block"> bequeathed to her daughters, Gerónima
                        and Lorenza, and her granddaughter named Sebastiana, an array of belongings
                        that included religious paraphernalia, valuable agricultural goods, and
                        finished goods and money. She divided her property in the following manner:
                        ten magueys, a wool skirt, a cotton huipil, and ten pesos went to her
                        daughter Gerónima. She gave her granddaughter Sebastiana five magueys and a
                        picture of Saint Sebastian. She did not bequeath her house to anyone
                        specifically, but she gave her daughter Lorenza a total of thirty-five
                        magueys and declared that, as the oldest, she should be in charge of the
                        house and its affairs.</quote></p>
                <p>Sebastiana was careful to distribute her property, but also scrupulous in noting
                    her debts and obligations to others in the community as well as the debts and
                    obligations owed to her. This complex system of interconnected social and fiscal
                    responsibilities is known as <foreign>guelaguetza</foreign> in Zapotec. In the
                    Zapotec inheritance system, her heirs inherited her
                        <foreign>guelaguetza</foreign> assets and liabilities. Her last will and
                    testament states: <quote rend="block"><foreign>chela tini pea nasaui quela queza

                </p>
                <p>For an understanding of the social relationships and networks of colonial Oaxaca,
                    there are few sources as rich as testaments like that of Sebastiana de Mendoza.
                    Documents like these are of potential interest to many, particularly those with
                    personal and / or academic interests in the histories, cultures, and languages
                    of the Indigenous people of Mesoamerica. This document is of particular interest
                    to the Zapotec people of Tlacochahuaya. Yet this remarkable text — and many
                    others like it — are practically unknown to a large group of potential
                    readers.</p>
                <p>Why have vital manuscripts like these not been accessible to members of
                    Indigenous communities who would like to read them? As we explain below, they
                    have mostly been held in physical archives where they are accessible primarily
                    to scholars with sufficient resources and privilege to use them. That these
                    archival resources are little known to Zapotec stakeholders aligns with the
                    analysis that <quote rend="inline">archives have functioned as mechanisms of
                        colonialism</quote>
                    <ptr target="#gauthereau2018"/>. For example, as pointed out by Stoler [<ref
                        target="#stoler2002">2002</ref>, 87], <quote rend="inline">What constitutes
                        the archive, what form it takes, and what systems of classification and
                        epistemology signal at specific times are (and reflect) critical features of
                        colonial politics and state power.</quote> Ticha seeks to use the power of
                    digital humanities to democratize access to materials and resources which
                    previously were almost exclusively the domain of scholars. Archiving,
                    scholarship, and community engagement can be brought together in a powerful
                    synthesis when community members have access to important documents from their
                    own history.</p>

                <head>Background and corpus</head>
                <p>Zapotec is a language family indigenous to southern Mexico, and is the third
                    largest Indigenous language family in Mexico. Today, there are over 50 different
                    Zapotec languages, most endangered, spoken primarily in what is now the state of
                    Oaxaca, Mexico, by a total of approximately 450,000 people within a much larger
                    Zapotec ethnic community. The Zapotec language family, which belongs to the
                    Otomanguean stock, is on par with the Romance language family in terms of time
                    depth and diversity of member languages. The Zapotecs are one of the major
                    civilizations of Mesoamerica, with cultural traditions going back to 500 B.C.
                    and distinct from the better-known Nahua (Aztec) and Maya.</p>
                <p>With the arrival of the Spanish in 1519, alphabetic writing was introduced and
                    adopted by Indigenous peoples. McDonough [<ref target="#mcdonough2014"
                        >2014</ref>, 199] points out that, <quote rend="inline">as opposed to being
                        passive receivers of an imposed European technology, Nahuas have
                        appropriated and adapted alphabetic writing for their own purposes.</quote>
                    The same can be said of speakers of Zapotec, who quickly put this new technology
                    to use. Zapotec has one of the longest records of alphabetic written documents
                    for any Indigenous language of the Americas <ptr target="#romero2003"/>. Over
                    900 documents in Zapotec language written by Zapotec scribes have been
                    identified, the earliest from 1565 <ptr target="#oudijk2008" loc="230"/>. The
                    richest variety of colonial Zapotec documents are those composed in the kind of
                    Zapotec spoken in and around Oaxaca City, known as Valley Zapotec. The Colonial
                    Valley Zapotec corpus includes an extensive dictionary <ptr
                        target="#cordova1578b"/>, grammar <ptr target="#cordova1578a"/>, and
                    doctrine <ptr target="#feria1567"/>, and over 200 administrative documents
                    (mostly wills).</p>
                <p>These documents hold invaluable information for a wide range of interested
                    parties. They provide insight into the ethnic diversity, religious history, and
                    familial, social, and economic structures of Mexico for a 500-year period. They
                    create a bridge across multiple cultural borders: a link between modern
                    scholars, colonial priests, and Zapotec people throughout time. The large corpus
                    of Colonial Nahuatl language material has proven useful to scholars across many
                    disciplines (e.g. <ptr target="#lockhart1992"/>; <ptr target="#madajczak2016"/>;
                        <ptr target="#matthew2020"/>). As Colonial Zapotec is less studied and is
                    understood by far fewer people, linguistic analysis is particularly needed to
                    help users understand the texts and to allow them to critically evaluate any
                    translations of the original text. Because of the difficulty in using the
                    original manuscripts and in understanding the language, this corpus of documents
                    written in Colonial Valley Zapotec has not been easily accessible outside of a
                    small circle of specialists <ptr target="#broadwell2013"/>.</p>

                <head>Difficulties of access to colonial materials</head>
                <p>Reading and translating these Colonial Valley Zapotec documents can be extremely
                    difficult. Physical access alone can be a barrier to reading the documents, as
                    these texts are housed in various archives not only throughout Oaxaca and other
                    parts of Mexico, but also in archives in the United States and Europe. One must
                    know which archive to visit and how to request a document, and sometimes that is
                    insufficient. For example, the Archivo General del Poder Ejecutivo del Estado de
                    Oaxaca has changed their archival numbering system, and now reference numbers
                    like those published in Smith Stark et al. (<ref target="#smithstark2008"
                        >2008</ref>) are no longer accurate. Moreover, discrimination against people
                    perceived to be Indigenous means that some employees at an archive, including
                    guards, may discourage and intimidate some potential users from entering the
                    archives, as we have ourselves witnessed on more than one occasion.</p>
                <p>Even if one has physical access to the texts, many aspects of the documents
                    themselves can be a barrier to access. The writing and printing conventions for
                    colonial documents can be opaque to contemporary users. Reading handwriting from
                    this period often requires special training, and printed texts often use
                    extensive abbreviations and may also contain printing errors (such as reversed
                    letters and broken type) and handwritten corrections.</p>
                <p>The Zapotec language poses additional challenges in understanding the texts.
                    Knowledge of (or fluency in) a modern Zapotec language is not enough to
                    translate the colonial documents due to variation in orthographic choices and
                    regular processes of language change. The orthography in the texts is highly
                    variable and inconsistent throughout the corpus, and there is as of yet no fully
                    adequate Zapotec-to-Spanish or Zapotec-to-English dictionary that reflects the
                    full range of orthographic variation found in the corpus <ptr
                        target="#broadwell2013"/>. Beyond orthography, the Zapotec language has
                    undergone language change over the last 500 years, including significant
                    phonological and morphosyntactic alterations. Thus the grammar of these
                    documents is also different from that of modern Zapotec languages. Potential
                    users of such documents cannot read them without training, and, as a result,
                    only a very small number of people use them — typically linguists and
                    ethnohistorians with special interest in Zapotec language materials and a
                    handful of other dedicated specialists. Other stakeholders, including most
                    speakers of modern Zapotec languages, have no easy way to discover or read the
                    texts that document the histories of their communities.</p>
                <p>In addition to these more tangible obstacles, discriminatory linguistic
                    ideologies pose systemic challenges to the access of Zapotec language materials.
                    In Mexico, Zapotec is viewed as something less than a real language, and
                    knowledge of Zapotec language is devalued. There are pervasive false beliefs
                    that Zapotec has never been written, cannot be written, and perhaps even should
                    not be written. Janet Chávez Santiago, a native Zapotec speaker and language
                    activist, reflects (in English) on the impact of such beliefs: <quote
                        rend="block">When I was in elementary school in the 90s, I remember children
                        speaking Zapotec in many contexts: playing in the streets, at parties, and
                        during town celebrations — but never at school. Instead, we had to
                            <soCalled>behave</soCalled> ourselves by not speaking Zapotec, otherwise
                        teachers could punish us by giving us extra homework or by not letting us
                        eat lunch or even beating us. Teachers made us believe that speaking Zapotec
                        was disrespectful, something to be ashamed of. They devalued our language by
                        calling it a <soCalled>dialect</soCalled>. As a child, I never saw anything
                        written in Zapotec. All my books and books that my parents bought me were in
                        Spanish, so at some point I thought teachers were right, that Zapotec was a
                        language with no value so nobody wanted to write books in my language. By
                        the end of the 90s there was no need to prohibit children speaking Zapotec
                        in the school, because in order to avoid their children being punished,
                        parents had switched to speaking in Spanish to their children at home. These
                        days, there are very few children who speak Zapotec in my town. <ptr
                            target="#mannix2016"/></quote>
                </p>
                <p>These ideologies about the value of Zapotec language certainly impact access in
                    multiple ways, but they also create a space for projects such as ours to
                    intervene in larger questions of social justice. In the following sections we
                    describe how Ticha addresses inequities of access in an effort to make the
                    Colonial Valley Zapotec corpus available to the widest possible audiences.
                    Moreover, we discuss how the creation and evolution of Ticha is done in
                    consultation and collaboration with Zapotec-speaking community members such that
                    both the methodology and <soCalled>result</soCalled> are spaces for
                    collaboration with stake-holding community members. We consider how creating
                    access to a corpus of historical texts in Valley Zapotec can be a form of
                    resistance to such false ideologies, both in its form as a resource and through
                    the collaborative methods in which we create and grow the project.</p>

                    Colonial Valley Zapotec corpus in a way that mitigates the systemic language
                    devalorization described above. In regards to the corpus itself, we practice
                    post-custodial archiving <ptr target="#ham1981"/>
                    <ptr target="#cook1994"/>, using existing digital images of the documents when
                    available, and by creating our own high-resolution digital images when not. As
                    Alpert-Abrams points out, <quote rend="inline">In the United States, we have a
                        long history of removing historical records from the communities that
                        created them, often in the name of preservation… The post-custodial model of
                        archival practice uses digital technology in pursuit of a more collaborative
                        approach to multinational archival work</quote> [<ref
                        target="#alpertabrams2018">2018</ref>, n.p.]. Post-custodial practices are
                    usually discussed in relation to institutions that are capable of taking
                    possession of materials — like libraries and archives. Ticha is not a library or
                    a physical archive, nor is it an institution that seeks to assume possession of
                    archival texts. The creation of digital surrogates and the maintenance of
                    collaborative partnerships with stake-holding communities allow us, however, to
                    curate a collection of texts digitally.</p>
                <p>The Ticha interface, built in the Django framework, allows users to browse and
                    search the corpus of Colonial Valley Zapotec texts, including the images and
                    metadata. Given the sociolinguistic context around this language and these
                    texts, we make any resources we have available as soon as possible, borrowing
                    from the idea of progressive archiving <ptr target="#nathan2013"/>. This means
                    that for some texts, we may just have images and metadata. For others we may
                    have first pass transcriptions. Yet others may have polished transcriptions and
                    translations. We invite corrections and collaboration and view the resource as a
                    living document and a space for collaboration.</p>
                <p>Ticha allows users to navigate a corpus that is otherwise physically dispersed.
                    Figure 1 illustrates one interface for browsing the corpus, which can be
                    searched or filtered along several fields, including date of document, town of
                    origin, archival home, genre, and language of the text. The corpus can also be
                    navigated through a timeline and a map, the latter of which is shown in Figure
                    2.</p>

                <p>In order to make Ticha more accessible to a wide range of users, we present the
                    texts not as flat objects but as dynamic resources. Other scholars have
                    published translations and annotations of colonial-era linguistic materials in
                    print form; Lockhart’s translation of a Colonial Nahuatl grammar is a notable
                    example <ptr target="#carochi2001"/>. However, print editions are generally
                    aimed at academic audiences and often present readers with too much detail for
                    the interested non-academic. Presenting this material as a digital resource
                    allows readers to view or hide different levels of analysis, depending on their
                    needs and interests.</p>
                <p>Figure 3 shows a page from the <title rend="italic">Arte en lengua
                        zapoteca</title>, a colonial-era grammar of Valley Zapotec which is credited
                    to Fray Juan de Cordova, though undoubtedly many (uncredited) Zapotec
                    individuals were involved in its creation <ptr target="#cordova1578a"/>. At the
                    most basic level, visitors may view the scanned images of the original document
                    side-by-side with a diplomatic transcription. As the colonial Spanish text
                    contains abbreviations and spelling inconsistencies which may be difficult for
                    some users to understand, a modernized Spanish version is also available. This
                    was created in response to a request from Zapotec community members who noted
                    that the Early Modern Spanish was a barrier to understanding the text. The
                    modernized Spanish version updates spelling and word boundaries, but does not
                    alter lexical choice or syntax. Feedback from speakers of modern Mexican Spanish
                    has been clear that this type of modernization has been helpful in reading the
                    text.</p>

                </figure>
                <p>Layers of accessible linguistic information are also used to communicate more
                    about the Zapotec language in these texts. As the <title rend="italic"
                        >Arte</title> is a meta-linguistic document, the text itself is an analysis
                    of the Zapotec language. As is to be expected from the time period, this grammar
                    is structured following the Latin model. For example, in the passage in Figure 2
                    describes the <soCalled>declensions</soCalled> of Zapotec nouns, a concept that
                    only serves to obscure the grammar of Valley Zapotec, which has no grammatical
                    case. While the framework is rather unhelpful in understanding the language, the
                    Zapotec language examples themselves are invaluable. Ticha can facilitate
                    accessibility to understanding the Zapotec here, by providing access to modern
                    linguists’ understanding of the Zapotec language. As shown in Figure 2, clicking
                    on a Zapotec word or phrase in the text brings up a pop-up containing a complete
                    morphological analysis and translation of the Zapotec, which may or may not be
                    consistent with the explanation in the original text. The interested reader,
                    then, can compare the analysis in the <title rend="italic">Arte</title> with
                    that of a modern linguist.</p>
                <p>As we considered what kind of access and collaboration could mitigate the type of
                    language devalorization described above, we also wanted to be careful that a
                    project on a historical corpus of Zapotec texts did not reinforce another
                    harmful false ideology — that Zapotec language and people are only of the past,
                    frozen in time. This type of thinking regarding Indigenous people, culture, and
                    language is ubiquitous. We wanted Zapotec people and modern language to be
                    clearly visible in the Ticha Project.</p>
                <p>One way we addressed this was by bringing Zapotec voices to the site. Figure 4
                    shows one of the resources available on Ticha: a vocabulary of the most common
                    words found in the corpus, along with their definitions and alternative
                    spellings. Wherever possible, we connect these lexical entries for historical
                    forms of words with their modern counterparts, by linking entries in Ticha’s
                    Vocabulary with entries in online Talking Dictionaries for several Valley
                    Zapotec language varieties (described in <ptr target="#harrison2019"/>),
                    including those from Teotitlán del Valle <ptr target="#lillehaugenchavez2019"/>,
                    San Jerónimo Tlacochahuaya <ptr target="#lillehaugenguzman2019"/>, and San Lucas
                    Quiaviní <ptr target="#lillehaugen2019"/>. The design came out of one of the
                    in-person workshops in Oaxaca. As the room full of Zapotec speakers from
                    different communities in the Valley of Oaxaca worked through understanding one
                    of the colonial-era texts together, a pattern of practice emerged. For each
                    word, speakers would go around the table, saying the modern cognate in their
                    variety of Zapotec. The text was read, performed — even echoed — in a multitude
                    of modern Zapotec languages. The Vocabulary on Ticha is our attempt to realize
                    this in a digital format.</p>

                </figure>
                <p>Connecting these modern lexical resources with this historical vocabulary not
                    only allowed us to resist a reading of these materials that excludes the modern
                    Zapotec community, but also allowed us to incorporate a Zapotec designed
                    engagement with the texts. As described further in the section that follows, our
                    iterative methodology includes regular trips to Oaxaca, where we not only
                    solicit feedback and suggestions from Zapotec speakers with interest in the
                    corpus but also spend time looking at Colonial Zapotec language texts
                    together.</p>

                <p>In this section, we turn to directly examining the structure and methodology
                    surrounding our development process, and in particular the role of stakeholding
                    communities in our project design. Thorpe and Galassi note that long-term
                    engagement with stakeholding communities requires libraries to challenge their
                    traditional workflows and <quote rend="inline">establish new ways of practice
                        that allow Indigenous people and communities to guide and control the
                        process</quote> [<ref target="#thorpe2014">2014</ref>, 91–92]. These ideas
                    are echoed in the literature on community-based linguistic research, where
                    scholars have recently emphasized community collaboration and sharing control of
                    research project design <ptr target="#czaykowska2009"/>
                    <ptr target="#rice2011"/>. Ticha prioritizes community engaged methods not only
                    as a goal, but as a means throughout the project; as Ortega notes in her review
                    of Ticha, <quote rend="inline">the engaging of a community of Zapotec speakers
                        is very clearly the backbone of the project and, through recurrent
                        workshops, has given shape to its other components</quote> [<ref
                        target="#ticha2019">2019</ref>].</p>
                <p>Our project benefits from other digital scholarship projects working with
                    Indigenous languages, corpora of manuscripts, and community engaged projects
                    generally, especially those working with marginalized communities and languages.
                    We are aware of one other project that also makes Zapotec language texts
                    publicly accessible: Satnu: Repositorio Filológico Mesoamericano (<ref
                        target="https://satnu.mx/">https://satnu.mx/</ref>), which as the name
                    suggests is a repository and digital archive for texts in Mesoamerican
                    languages, including — but not limited to — Zapotec language texts. The Early
                    Nahuatl Library (<ref target="http://enl.uoregon.edu/"
                        >http://enl.uoregon.edu/</ref>), for example, gathers together 16th- through
                    19th-century Nahuatl-language manuscripts with transcriptions, translations, and
                    historical context. In this issue, Matthew and Bannister describe NECA:
                    Nahuatl/Nawat in Central America (<ref target="https://nahuatl-nawat.org/"
                        >https://nahuatl-nawat.org/</ref>), a digital project that makes a corpus of
                    Nahuan-language documents produced in Spanish Central America publicly
                    available. Olko (2019) describes a community-engaged approach in which archival
                    work on Nahuatl language texts is fused with ethnolinguistic fieldwork in a
                    project that seeks to <quote rend="inline">combine Western/academic and
                        Indigenous methodologies</quote> [<ref target="#olko2019">2019</ref>, 7].
                    Moving beyond Nahuatl, the Proyecto Oralidad Modernidad (<ref
                        target="https://oralidadmodernidad.wixsite.com/oralidad"
                        >https://oralidadmodernidad.wixsite.com/oralidad</ref>) uses a
                    community-engaged approach to language documentation that encourages Indigenous
                    Ecuadorians to connect with their history through language as they document the
                    knowledge of elders <ptr target="#haboud2019"/>. Far outside of Latin America,
                    The Notebooks of William Dawes (<ref target="https://www.williamdawes.org/"
                        >https://www.williamdawes.org/</ref>; <ptr target="#nathan2007"/>) makes
                    accessible threatened language documentation from the century on Darug/Dharuk, a
                    language of Sydney, Australia, through images, transcriptions, and connections
                    to modern speakers. Originally located at the SOAS and now a free-standing
                    resource, the Notebooks of William Dawes brings archival texts, commentary, and
                    modern language together online and through a companion print version <ptr
                        target="#nathan2009"/>. Ticha combines elements of many of these projects —
                    and especially that of the Notebook of William Dawes — connecting stakeholding
                    communities to Zapotec history through colonial-era documents while
                    acknowledging and engaging with the social-political power of Zapotec writing,
                    spoken Zapotec language, and Zapotec communities.</p>
                <p>Ticha extends the traditional user-centered approach to design by defining user
                    groups as communities. Each community brings its own skill sets and experiences
                    to the project, which shapes the technology and workflows that make up the
                    project. The array of communities that make up Ticha include the Zapotec
                    community members, Haverford College linguistics and computer science students,
                    scholars in linguistics and ethnohistory, and librarians, though membership in
                    these categories may overlap. Each community is both a user and a participant in
                    their engagement with the project web site. Access to the materials includes
                    traditional methods of discovery, but also engagement with and close reading of
                    the materials through features like transcription, text encoding, and audio
                    recording. The artifacts of this engagement become part of the Ticha workflow
                    (e.g. manuscripts transcribed by Zapotec community members or Haverford
                    linguistics students, recordings for the Talking Dictionary by Zapotec community
                    members, or morphological analysis of Zapotec words by linguists), and emerge as
                    additional points of engagement for the project’s communities. As such, the
                    design of the project accounts for the experiences and needs of each community,
                    is informed by feedback from its communities, and is iterative in its approach.
                    The morphological analysis is done in Fieldworks Language Explorer (FLEx), and
                    discussed in <ref target="#broadwell2013">Broadwell and Lillehaugen, 2013</ref>.
                    This is exported as XML and processed with the TEI (Text Encoding Initiative)
                    encoding of the text by a Python script and XSLT (Extensible Stylesheet Language
                    Transformations) to ultimately produce HTML. This HTML creates the public-facing
                    interface for the encoded texts.</p>
                <p>Our development process has a clear institutional component, as Haverford College
                    Libraries is an active partner in the design and development of the Ticha
                    project site. The Digital Scholarship group, which partners with faculty and
                    students to produce multimodal scholarship through the use of digital tools and
                    methods, has been primarily responsible for web design, web and application
                    development, server administration, archival and preservation workflows, and
                    data curation practices for the project.</p>
                <p>Ticha is a system of tools that fit together in ways that meet the needs of its
                    community members. The skill sets and tools available to each community
                    determines the choices of tools and methods for the project. While the library
                    is responsible for technical development of the project site, digital
                    scholarship librarians and student employees are often developing tools or
                    features for the first time. The library exercises a strong preference for
                    existing tools that meet community needs and standards and prefers to develop
                    custom-made solutions only when the project exceeds the capacity of ready-built
                    tools. The ability to export data in standard formats (e.g. JSON, CSV, XML) is
                    essential for each tool so that future flexibility is built into the project in
                    all areas.</p>
                <p>Existing tools come with their own set of limitations, as they are not developed
                    in the context of a specific project but instead designed to be used broadly.
                    When the needs of a community reach beyond the limits of — or are not being
                    effectively met by — existing tools, it is necessary to built upon existing
                    project features. An open channel for feedback is crucial, and that feedback
                    drives iteration on the features that require it. Feedback comes in two primary
                    forms: workshops and web analytics. Web analytics (Ticha uses Google Analytics)
                    provide meaningful data on site usage and user location, from which we can draw
                    useful conclusions. For example, analytics in late 2017 suggested that users
                    that visited the home page of the project site often moved on quickly, while
                    those who visited specific manuscripts directly (from a link shared on social
                    media or search results) tended to engage with other areas of the site. This
                    data strongly suggested that a redesign of the home page was necessary to
                    provide users with more information on what they can do in the Ticha project
                    site, and such a redesign was implemented during the summer of 2018.</p>
                <p>Some of the most meaningful feedback comes from engagement with members of the
                    Zapotec-speaking community in Oaxaca. Transcription workshops helped the project
                    team see the tools in action on the equipment available to its users (i.e.
                    tablets or computers that aren’t necessarily current, running the latest
                    software, or reliably connected to the Internet). A series of workshops with
                    students at the Centro de Estudios Tecnológicos Industrial y de Servicios No.
                    124 (CETIs #124), a high school in Tlacolula de Matamoros, Oaxaca, was
                    significantly affected by Wifi connectivity issues, highlighting the need to
                    account for access to the manuscripts and some features of the project site when
                    the network connection is unreliable. As a result, the project now features a
                    PDF export option for manuscripts that include high-resolution images of the
                    documents and associated metadata that can be saved to a storage device for
                    offline access.</p>
                <p>The transcription feature for the manuscripts on Ticha is a particularly
                    instructive case study of this iterative approach. In 2015, members of the
                    Zapotec-speaking community expressed a strong desire to transcribe the
                    manuscripts through the project site. While the Haverford College Libraries
                    could have attempted to build a custom transcription interface, the Digital
                    Scholarship team did not have technical capacity to develop such a feature. The
                    project was already using Omeka as a digital collections platform to serve and
                    describe the digitized manuscripts in parallel with the Django project site. The
                    Scripto plugin for Omeka provided a ready-built solution for a transcription
                    feature. Implementation of that feature occurred in the spring of 2016, at which
                    point the project group conducted two workshops with Zapotec-speaking community
                    members in Oaxaca on document transcription. During these workshops, the
                    affordances and limitations of the Scripto interface became apparent. Users of
                    the web site needed to perform three or four clicks to move from the manuscript
                    viewer to the transcription tool, and the interface itself was difficult to
                    customize for language and format. With this feedback, the digital scholarship
                    group developed its own transcription interface in parallel with the
                    already-launched Scripto interface, which then replaced Scripto in the spring of
                    2018. The new transcriber is completely integrated within the existing
                    manuscript viewer interface, accessible by only one click or tap from an input
                    device.</p>
                <p>An interest on the part of academics and/or community members to contribute to
                    online transcriptions and translations should not be assumed, as demonstrated in
                    the context of NECA (Nahuatl/Nawat in Central America) in <ref
                        target="#matthew2020">Matthew and Bannister, this issue</ref>, who also
                    express encountering similar limitations with Scripto in their project.</p>

                <head>Impact and reflections</head>
                <p>As part of our commitment to community-led research, Ticha includes an advisory
                    board of Zapotec community members. While community workshops provide feedback
                    on the functionality of the site, members of the advisory board give ongoing
                    advice to shape the project as a whole. In this section, Moisés García Guzmán
                    and Dr. Felipe H. Lopez, two members of the advisory board, reflect on the
                    impact of Ticha in their community. Their words speak best for themselves and
                    thus are intentionally presented here as they were written by the co-authors.
                    García Guzmán, a Zapotec educator and activist, offers the following reflection:
                        <quote rend="block">Many local communities in Oaxaca were not aware of the
                        existence of documents in Zapotec. Ticha has helped them to see how
                        important their language was in official procedures in the past, but has
                        also helped to create a link with revitalization efforts that are going on,
                        by showing community members that their proposals on contemporary Zapotec
                        can lead to a new standardized written system. García Guzmán, a Zapotec
                        educator and activist, offers the following reflection:</quote>
                    <quote rend="block">As a speaker and activist in my community, Ticha is a great
                        tool in raising awareness on all revitalization efforts. Young kids can see
                        how our language played an important role in some activities of our towns in
                        the past. But also I encourage them not to see the language as only a part
                        of our past, but to also work towards restoring use of our language in many
                        contexts where Zapotec seems to be losing ground. In the end, I hope to
                        instill in them the idea to work towards an official recognition again. I
                        also hope that our efforts will encourage local authorities to give us
                        better access to archives, by showing them all the work that is done. The
                        existence of Ticha makes archival authorities more open and cooperative with
                        these efforts.</quote>
                    <quote rend="block">Overall, it has been a great experience, and as the work
                        progresses, it helps students, speakers and communities to strengthen the
                        sense of identity with our native language.</quote></p>
                <p>Lopez has been key in starting and facilitating the workshops at the high school
                    in Tlacolula. He offers these reflections: <quote rend="block">I have always
                        believed that the youth could be very influential in their communities today
                        and have sought ways to engage with them to promote the Zapotec languages in
                        their pueblos. For the last three years I have had the opportunity to
                        participate in Zapotec workshops at CETIs #124 in collaboration with
                        Haverford College and the Ticha project. These workshops have become pivotal
                        for engaging with students and school officials to rethink the value and
                        importance of Zapotec. In a sense, these workshops have given this school
                        community a different access to the language. In these three years, I have
                        witnessed the way the students involved in these workshops have strengthened
                        their values towards their own language at the same time their
                        identities.</quote>
                    <quote rend="block">At the beginning there was some skepticism about these
                        Zapotec workshops given that only six students participated. However, each
                        year there has been an increase in the number of students participating, and
                        last year there were more than 20 students who signed up for the Colonial
                        Zapotec workshops.</quote>
                    <quote rend="block">This particular workshop gave students an opportunity to
                        understand their language from a historical perspective and to work with
                        Colonial documents. The Zapotec students tried to understand Colonial
                        Zapotec words and to think about the equivalent modern Zapotec words.
                        Through these documents, they understood that Zapotec is a living language
                        which has been written for hundreds of years, dispelling the notion that
                        Zapotec is not a written language. All the students found commonalities
                        between Colonial Zapotec and the various Zapotec languages they spoke.
                        Furthermore, they were pleasantly surprised to learn ways to count in
                        Zapotec. As is the case in my own community of San Lucas Quiaviní, most
                        students can only count up to ten or so and then use Spanish words, and so
                        through these Colonial Zapotec documents they learned something about their
                        own language.</quote>
                    <quote rend="block">The openness of the Principal Dr. Marcos Pereyra Rito and
                        the support of the main advocate of this program, Abisai Aparicio, has given
                        this opportunity to students, despite the absence of a clear precedent in
                        the educational system in Mexico. In fact, historically, schools served as
                        an instrument of assimilation and punished people who spoke their Indigenous
                        language. However, as part of this collaboration at CETIs #124, the
                        vice-principal, who isn’t a native speaker of Zapotec, made an effort to
                        read a message in Zapotec to the participating students in the workshop last
                        year. Also, one of the teachers, Dr. David Velasco, was willing to accept
                        work written in Zapotec in his literature course. I have also witnessed how
                        students have changed their behaviour towards using their language since
                        these workshops have started. I see students talking Zapotec more openly on
                        campus, whereas prior to this project, we were told that students were
                        embarrassed to speak Zapotec on campus or even to admit they spoke it at
                        all. So, the conditions in which these students decide to use their language
                        is being reshaped at this institution, hopefully as well as outside. These
                        efforts, then, are working to reshape the sociolinguistic possibilities at
                        this institution, and potentially even beyond.</quote></p>

                <head>Conclusions</head>
                <p>As Nakata and Langton say, effective community collaboration is not just
                        <soCalled>consultation</soCalled> with the community, but <quote
                        rend="inline">dialogue, conversation, education, and working through things
                        together</quote> [<ref target="#nakata2005">2005</ref>, 5]. Ticha embraces
                    this philosophy by working through an ongoing conversation with user
                    communities. Our iterative approach allows the technical design of the project
                    to continually meet the needs of its communities. Furthermore, it situates the
                    project in dialogue with other digital projects that employ similar tools or
                    methods, and provides a model for doing truly community-engaged digital
                    scholarship. For example, Albert-Abrams et al. describe their work as being
                    practiced <quote rend="inline">not through a static set of methodologies, but
                        rather an ongoing process of learning, unlearning, and restructuring in
                        pursuit of a collective good</quote> [<ref target="#albertabrams2019"
                        >2019</ref>, 1]. We recognize our own practice in this description, as well
                    as in the framing provided by Duff et al, that <quote rend="inline">Social
                        justice is always a process and can never be fully achieved</quote> [<ref
                        target="#duff2013">2013</ref>, 324].</p>
                <p>Our engagement with the Ticha project has yielded many positive results, both for
                    scholars and members of the Zapotec community. The Zapotec language documents in
                    Ticha are a resource for those interested in Zapotec people, their languages,
                    and their history. Ticha’s project design is grounded in well-established
                    theories of cultural and linguistic reclamation and revitalization. Scholars
                    have long discussed the importance of schools in creating positive language
                    ideologies, particularly among youth <ptr target="#lee2007"/>, as well as the
                    complexity surrounding the roles that Indigenous educators can have within these
                    systems, in particular in Mexico <ptr target="#mcdonough2014" loc="160"/>.
                    Researchers have also noted the power of Indigenous community members directly
                    preserving their own histories <ptr target="#hoobler2006"/>. Given this, we
                    think it is likely that similar results might be achieved in other communities
                    following our methods, adapted for local priorities and practices. While a
                    handful of projects exist, as mentioned earlier, we could imagine even more
                    projects like this not only in Oaxaca, but in Latin America more broadly, and
                    world-wide where such historical corpora exist. All of the Ticha encoding and
                    scripting is freely available to anyone who would like to use or adapt it for
                    similar projects.</p>
                <p>As local language ideologies in Mexico favor Spanish over Indigenous languages
                    such as Zapotec, a project like Ticha serves as a resource for local language
                    activists. In particular, Ticha forefronts Indigenous voices and knowledge. As
                    Pratt says: <quote rend="inline">If one studies only what the Europeans saw and
                        said, one reproduces the monopoly on knowledge and interpretation that the
                        imperial enterprise sought</quote> [<ref target="#pratt2007">2007</ref>, 7].
                    Important historical documents, like the testament of Sebastiana de Mendoza,
                    demonstrate in a very concrete way the long literate history of Zapotec people
                    and the importance of the Zapotec language to understanding this history.</p>
                <p>We also take this project to be a clear demonstration of the power of digital
                    humanities projects to democratize access to materials and resources which might
                    otherwise be used primarily by scholars. We seek to practice transformational
                    work as part of a larger interdisciplinary project that we would also classify
                    as engaged scholarship. When community members have access to important
                    documents from their own history, we are able to bring together archiving,
                    scholarship, and community engagement in a powerful synthesis.</p>
