                  <p>There are hundreds of alphabetic texts in Zapotec languages dating back to the
                     16th century. Today, however, Zapotec speakers are generally unable to read
                     these texts, due to lack of access to the texts and an unfamiliarity with the
                     orthographic practices. Moreover, significant changes have taken place in the
                     grammar in the intervening centuries. This results in a situation where Zapotec
                     people may not have access to history in their own language. Ticha is an online
                     digital text explorer that provides access to images, transcriptions, analysis,
                     and translations of the Colonial Zapotec texts. The Ticha project includes
                     in-person workshops with Zapotec community members as part of an iterative
                     development process. Feedback from these interactions inform design decisions
                     for the project. Here we reflect on transnational collaboration with
                     stakeholders in building a digital scholarship project that seeks to use the
                     power of digital humanities to democratize access to materials and resources
                     which were previously the exclusive domain of a few experts. When community
                     members have access to important documents from their own history, archiving,
                     scholarship, and community engagement can be brought together in a powerful
                     synthesis.

                  <p>Resumen. Hay cientos de textos alfabéticos en lenguas zapotecas desde el siglo
                     dieciséis. No obstante, hoy en día los zapoteco-hablantes generalmente no pueden
                     leer estos textos, debido a una falta de acceso a los textos como también por
                     falta de familiaridad con las prácticas ortográficas. Además, la gramática ha
                     cambiado mucho en los siglos intermedios. Por consiguiente, muchos zapotecos no
                     tienen acceso a su historia escrita en su propia lengua. Ticha es un explorador
                     digital de texto que brinda acceso en línea a las imágenes, transcripciones,
                     análisis y traducciones de los textos en zapoteco colonial. El proyecto de Ticha
                     incluye talleres con miembros de la comunidad zapoteca como parte de un proceso
                     de desarrollo interactivo. Los comentarios y reacciones que resultan de estas
                     interacciones informan las decisiones del diseño para el proyecto. Aquí
                     analizamos y reflexionamos sobre la colaboración transnacional con los
                     “stakeholders” en la construcción de un proyecto digital
                     que indaga el uso del poder de las humanidades digitales para democratizar el
                     acceso a los materiales y recursos que previamente habían sido un dominio
                     exclusivo de unos pocos expertos. Cuando los miembros de la comunidad tienen
                     acceso a los documentos importantes de su propia historia, entonces el archivar,
                     la investigación, y el involucramiento con las comunidades pueden crear una
                     síntesis detonante.

                     Tlacochahuaya, Oaxaca, created her last will and testament [<a class="ref" href="#floresmarcial2015">Flores-Marcial 2015</a>]

                           that included religious paraphernalia, valuable agricultural goods, and
                           finished goods and money. She divided her property in the following manner:
                           ten magueys, a wool skirt, a cotton huipil, and ten pesos went to her
                           daughter Gerónima. She gave her granddaughter Sebastiana five magueys and a
                           picture of Saint Sebastian. She did not bequeath her house to anyone
                           specifically, but she gave her daughter Lorenza a total of thirty-five
                           magueys and declared that, as the oldest, she should be in charge of the
                           house and its affairs.

                     there are few sources as rich as testaments like that of Sebastiana de Mendoza.
                     Documents like these are of potential interest to many, particularly those with
                     personal and / or academic interests in the histories, cultures, and languages
                     of the Indigenous people of Mesoamerica. This document is of particular interest
                     to the Zapotec people of Tlacochahuaya. Yet this remarkable text — and many
                     others like it — are practically unknown to a large group of potential

                     Indigenous communities who would like to read them? As we explain below, they
                     have mostly been held in physical archives where they are accessible primarily
                     to scholars with sufficient resources and privilege to use them. That these
                     archival resources are little known to Zapotec stakeholders aligns with the
                     analysis that “archives have functioned as mechanisms of
                     colonialism”
                     [<a class="ref" href="#gauthereau2018">Gauthereau 2018</a>]. For example, as pointed out by Stoler [<a href="#stoler2002">2002</a>, 87], “What constitutes
                     the archive, what form it takes, and what systems of classification and
                     epistemology signal at specific times are (and reflect) critical features of
                     colonial politics and state power.” Ticha seeks to use the power of
                     digital humanities to democratize access to materials and resources which
                     previously were almost exclusively the domain of scholars. Archiving,
                     scholarship, and community engagement can be brought together in a powerful
                     synthesis when community members have access to important documents from their

                     Zapotec languages, most endangered, spoken primarily in what is now the state of
                     Oaxaca, Mexico, by a total of approximately 450,000 people within a much larger
                     Zapotec ethnic community. The Zapotec language family, which belongs to the
                     Otomanguean stock, is on par with the Romance language family in terms of time
                     depth and diversity of member languages. The Zapotecs are one of the major
                     civilizations of Mesoamerica, with cultural traditions going back to 500 B.C.
                     and distinct from the better-known Nahua (Aztec) and Maya.

                  <div class="ptext" id="p6">With the arrival of the Spanish in 1519, alphabetic writing was introduced and
                     adopted by Indigenous peoples. McDonough [<a href="#mcdonough2014">2014</a>, 199] points out that, “as opposed to being
                     passive receivers of an imposed European technology, Nahuas have
                     appropriated and adapted alphabetic writing for their own purposes.”
                     The same can be said of speakers of Zapotec, who quickly put this new technology
                     to use. Zapotec has one of the longest records of alphabetic written documents
                     for any Indigenous language of the Americas [<a class="ref" href="#romero2003">Romero Frizzi 2003</a>]. Over
                     900 documents in Zapotec language written by Zapotec scribes have been
                     identified, the earliest from 1565 [<a class="ref" href="#oudijk2008">Oudijk 2008</a>, 230]. The
                     richest variety of colonial Zapotec documents are those composed in the kind of
                     Zapotec spoken in and around Oaxaca City, known as Valley Zapotec. The Colonial
                     Valley Zapotec corpus includes an extensive dictionary [<a class="ref" href="#cordova1578b">Cordova 1578b</a>], grammar [<a class="ref" href="#cordova1578a">Cordova 1578a</a>], and
                     doctrine [<a class="ref" href="#feria1567">Feria                 1567</a>], and over 200 administrative documents
                     (mostly wills).

                     parties. They provide insight into the ethnic diversity, religious history, and
                     familial, social, and economic structures of Mexico for a 500-year period. They
                     create a bridge across multiple cultural borders: a link between modern
                     scholars, colonial priests, and Zapotec people throughout time. The large corpus
                     of Colonial Nahuatl language material has proven useful to scholars across many
                     disciplines (e.g. [<a class="ref" href="#lockhart1992">Lockhart                 1992</a>]; [<a class="ref" href="#madajczak2016">Madajczak and Hansen 2016</a>];
                     [<a class="ref" href="#matthew2020">Matthew and Bannister 2020</a>]). As Colonial Zapotec is less studied and is
                     understood by far fewer people, linguistic analysis is particularly needed to
                     help users understand the texts and to allow them to critically evaluate any
                     translations of the original text. Because of the difficulty in using the
                     original manuscripts and in understanding the language, this corpus of documents
                     written in Colonial Valley Zapotec has not been easily accessible outside of a
                     small circle of specialists [<a class="ref" href="#broadwell2013">Broadwell and Lillehaugen 2013</a>].

                     these texts are housed in various archives not only throughout Oaxaca and other
                     parts of Mexico, but also in archives in the United States and Europe. One must
                     know which archive to visit and how to request a document, and sometimes that is
                     insufficient. For example, the Archivo General del Poder Ejecutivo del Estado de
                     Oaxaca has changed their archival numbering system, and now reference numbers
                     like those published in Smith Stark et al. (<a href="#smithstark2008">2008</a>) are no longer accurate. Moreover, discrimination against people
                     perceived to be Indigenous means that some employees at an archive, including
                     guards, may discourage and intimidate some potential users from entering the
                     archives, as we have ourselves witnessed on more than one occasion.

                     Knowledge of (or fluency in) a modern Zapotec language is not enough to
                     translate the colonial documents due to variation in orthographic choices and
                     regular processes of language change. The orthography in the texts is highly
                     variable and inconsistent throughout the corpus, and there is as of yet no fully
                     adequate Zapotec-to-Spanish or Zapotec-to-English dictionary that reflects the
                     full range of orthographic variation found in the corpus [<a class="ref" href="#broadwell2013">Broadwell and Lillehaugen 2013</a>]. Beyond orthography, the Zapotec language has
                     undergone language change over the last 500 years, including significant
                     phonological and morphosyntactic alterations. Thus the grammar of these
                     documents is also different from that of modern Zapotec languages. Potential
                     users of such documents cannot read them without training, and, as a result,
                     only a very small number of people use them — typically linguists and
                     ethnohistorians with special interest in Zapotec language materials and a
                     handful of other dedicated specialists. Other stakeholders, including most
                     speakers of modern Zapotec languages, have no easy way to discover or read the
                     texts that document the histories of their communities.

                     ideologies pose systemic challenges to the access of Zapotec language materials.
                     In Mexico, Zapotec is viewed as something less than a real language, and
                     knowledge of Zapotec language is devalued. There are pervasive false beliefs
                     that Zapotec has never been written, cannot be written, and perhaps even should
                     not be written. Janet Chávez Santiago, a native Zapotec speaker and language
                     activist, reflects (in English) on the impact of such beliefs: 
                     <blockquote>
                        <p>When I was in elementary school in the 90s, I remember children
                           speaking Zapotec in many contexts: playing in the streets, at parties, and
                           during town celebrations — but never at school. Instead, we had to
                           “behave” ourselves by not speaking Zapotec, otherwise
                           teachers could punish us by giving us extra homework or by not letting us
                           eat lunch or even beating us. Teachers made us believe that speaking Zapotec
                           was disrespectful, something to be ashamed of. They devalued our language by
                           calling it a “dialect”. As a child, I never saw anything
                           written in Zapotec. All my books and books that my parents bought me were in
                           Spanish, so at some point I thought teachers were right, that Zapotec was a
                           language with no value so nobody wanted to write books in my language. By
                           the end of the 90s there was no need to prohibit children speaking Zapotec
                           in the school, because in order to avoid their children being punished,
                           parents had switched to speaking in Spanish to their children at home. These
                           days, there are very few children who speak Zapotec in my town. [<a class="ref" href="#mannix2016">Mannix et al. 2016</a>]

                     multiple ways, but they also create a space for projects such as ours to
                     intervene in larger questions of social justice. In the following sections we
                     describe how Ticha addresses inequities of access in an effort to make the
                     Colonial Valley Zapotec corpus available to the widest possible audiences.
                     Moreover, we discuss how the creation and evolution of Ticha is done in
                     consultation and collaboration with Zapotec-speaking community members such that
                     both the methodology and “result” are spaces for
                     collaboration with stake-holding community members. We consider how creating
                     access to a corpus of historical texts in Valley Zapotec can be a form of
                     resistance to such false ideologies, both in its form as a resource and through
                     the collaborative methods in which we create and grow the project.

                     post-custodial archiving [<a class="ref" href="#ham1981">Ham 1981</a>]
                     [<a class="ref" href="#cook1994">Cook 1994</a>], using existing digital images of the documents when
                     available, and by creating our own high-resolution digital images when not. As
                     Alpert-Abrams points out, “In the United States, we have a
                     long history of removing historical records from the communities that
                     created them, often in the name of preservation… The post-custodial model of
                     archival practice uses digital technology in pursuit of a more collaborative
                     approach to multinational archival work” [<a href="#alpertabrams2018">2018</a>, n.p.]. Post-custodial practices are
                     usually discussed in relation to institutions that are capable of taking
                     possession of materials — like libraries and archives. Ticha is not a library or
                     a physical archive, nor is it an institution that seeks to assume possession of
                     archival texts. The creation of digital surrogates and the maintenance of
                     collaborative partnerships with stake-holding communities allow us, however, to
                     curate a collection of texts digitally.

                     published translations and annotations of colonial-era linguistic materials in

                     aimed at academic audiences and often present readers with too much detail for
                     the interested non-academic. Presenting this material as a digital resource

                        zapoteca</cite>, a colonial-era grammar of Valley Zapotec which is credited
                     to Fray Juan de Cordova, though undoubtedly many (uncredited) Zapotec
                     individuals were involved in its creation [<a class="ref" href="#cordova1578a">Cordova 1578a</a>]. At the

                     side-by-side with a diplomatic transcription. As the colonial Spanish text
                     contains abbreviations and spelling inconsistencies which may be difficult for
                     some users to understand, a modernized Spanish version is also available. This
                     was created in response to a request from Zapotec community members who noted
                     that the Early Modern Spanish was a barrier to understanding the text. The
                     modernized Spanish version updates spelling and word boundaries, but does not
                     alter lexical choice or syntax. Feedback from speakers of modern Mexican Spanish
                     has been clear that this type of modernization has been helpful in reading the

                     about the Zapotec language in these texts. As the <cite class="title italic">Arte</cite> is a meta-linguistic document, the text itself is an analysis
                     of the Zapotec language. As is to be expected from the time period, this grammar
                     is structured following the Latin model. For example, in the passage in Figure 2
                     describes the “declensions” of Zapotec nouns, a concept that
                     only serves to obscure the grammar of Valley Zapotec, which has no grammatical
                     case. While the framework is rather unhelpful in understanding the language, the
                     Zapotec language examples themselves are invaluable. Ticha can facilitate
                     accessibility to understanding the Zapotec here, by providing access to modern
                     linguists’ understanding of the Zapotec language. As shown in Figure 2, clicking
                     on a Zapotec word or phrase in the text brings up a pop-up containing a complete
                     morphological analysis and translation of the Zapotec, which may or may not be
                     consistent with the explanation in the original text. The interested reader,
                     then, can compare the analysis in the <cite class="title italic">Arte</cite> with
                     that of a modern linguist.

                     project on a historical corpus of Zapotec texts did not reinforce another
                     harmful false ideology — that Zapotec language and people are only of the past,
                     frozen in time. This type of thinking regarding Indigenous people, culture, and
                     language is ubiquitous. We wanted Zapotec people and modern language to be
                     clearly visible in the Ticha Project.

                     shows one of the resources available on Ticha: a vocabulary of the most common
                     words found in the corpus, along with their definitions and alternative
                     spellings. Wherever possible, we connect these lexical entries for historical
                     forms of words with their modern counterparts, by linking entries in Ticha’s
                     Vocabulary with entries in online Talking Dictionaries for several Valley
                     Zapotec language varieties (described in [<a class="ref" href="#harrison2019">Harrison et al. 2019</a>]),
                     including those from Teotitlán del Valle [<a class="ref" href="#lillehaugenchavez2019">Lillehaugen and Chávez, et al. 2019</a>],

                     Quiaviní [<a class="ref" href="#lillehaugen2019">Lillehaugen et al. 2019</a>]. The design came out of one of the
                     in-person workshops in Oaxaca. As the room full of Zapotec speakers from
                     different communities in the Valley of Oaxaca worked through understanding one
                     of the colonial-era texts together, a pattern of practice emerged. For each
                     word, speakers would go around the table, saying the modern cognate in their
                     variety of Zapotec. The text was read, performed — even echoed — in a multitude
                     of modern Zapotec languages. The Vocabulary on Ticha is our attempt to realize
                     this in a digital format.

                     surrounding our development process, and in particular the role of stakeholding
                     communities in our project design. Thorpe and Galassi note that long-term
                     engagement with stakeholding communities requires libraries to challenge their
                     traditional workflows and “establish new ways of practice
                     that allow Indigenous people and communities to guide and control the
                     process” [<a href="#thorpe2014">2014</a>, 91–92]. These ideas
                     are echoed in the literature on community-based linguistic research, where
                     scholars have recently emphasized community collaboration and sharing control of
                     research project design [<a class="ref" href="#czaykowska2009">Czaykowska-Higgins 2009</a>]

                     as a goal, but as a means throughout the project; as Ortega notes in her review
                     of Ticha, “the engaging of a community of Zapotec speakers
                     is very clearly the backbone of the project and, through recurrent
                     workshops, has given shape to its other components” [<span class="error"><a href="#ticha2019">2019</a></span>].

                     We are aware of one other project that also makes Zapotec language texts

                     19th-century Nahuatl-language manuscripts with transcriptions, translations, and
                     historical context. In this issue, Matthew and Bannister describe NECA:

                     Nahuan-language documents produced in Spanish Central America publicly
                     available. Olko (2019) describes a community-engaged approach in which archival
                     work on Nahuatl language texts is fused with ethnolinguistic fieldwork in a
                     project that seeks to “combine Western/academic and

                     Moving beyond Nahuatl, the Proyecto Oralidad Modernidad (<a href="https://oralidadmodernidad.wixsite.com/oralidad" onclick="window.open('https://oralidadmodernidad.wixsite.com/oralidad'); return false" class="ref">https://oralidadmodernidad.wixsite.com/oralidad</a>) uses a

                     to modern speakers. Originally located at the SOAS and now a free-standing
                     resource, the Notebooks of William Dawes brings archival texts, commentary, and

                     and especially that of the Notebook of William Dawes — connecting stakeholding
                     communities to Zapotec history through colonial-era documents while
                     acknowledging and engaging with the social-political power of Zapotec writing,

                     to the project, which shapes the technology and workflows that make up the
                     project. The array of communities that make up Ticha include the Zapotec
                     community members, Haverford College linguistics and computer science students,
                     scholars in linguistics and ethnohistory, and librarians, though membership in
                     these categories may overlap. Each community is both a user and a participant in
                     their engagement with the project web site. Access to the materials includes
                     traditional methods of discovery, but also engagement with and close reading of
                     the materials through features like transcription, text encoding, and audio
                     recording. The artifacts of this engagement become part of the Ticha workflow
                     (e.g. manuscripts transcribed by Zapotec community members or Haverford
                     linguistics students, recordings for the Talking Dictionary by Zapotec community
                     members, or morphological analysis of Zapotec words by linguists), and emerge as
                     additional points of engagement for the project’s communities. As such, the
                     design of the project accounts for the experiences and needs of each community,
                     is informed by feedback from its communities, and is iterative in its approach.
                     The morphological analysis is done in Fieldworks Language Explorer (FLEx), and
                     discussed in <a href="#broadwell2013">Broadwell and Lillehaugen, 2013</a>.
                     This is exported as XML and processed with the TEI (Text Encoding Initiative)

                     Transformations) to ultimately produce HTML. This HTML creates the public-facing

                     in the context of a specific project but instead designed to be used broadly.
                     When the needs of a community reach beyond the limits of — or are not being
                     effectively met by — existing tools, it is necessary to built upon existing
                     project features. An open channel for feedback is crucial, and that feedback
                     drives iteration on the features that require it. Feedback comes in two primary
                     forms: workshops and web analytics. Web analytics (Ticha uses Google Analytics)
                     provide meaningful data on site usage and user location, from which we can draw
                     useful conclusions. For example, analytics in late 2017 suggested that users
                     that visited the home page of the project site often moved on quickly, while
                     those who visited specific manuscripts directly (from a link shared on social
                     media or search results) tended to engage with other areas of the site. This
                     data strongly suggested that a redesign of the home page was necessary to
                     provide users with more information on what they can do in the Ticha project
                     site, and such a redesign was implemented during the summer of 2018.

                     Zapotec-speaking community in Oaxaca. Transcription workshops helped the project
                     team see the tools in action on the equipment available to its users (i.e.
                     tablets or computers that aren’t necessarily current, running the latest
                     software, or reliably connected to the Internet). A series of workshops with

                     124 (CETIs #124), a high school in Tlacolula de Matamoros, Oaxaca, was
                     significantly affected by Wifi connectivity issues, highlighting the need to
                     account for access to the manuscripts and some features of the project site when
                     the network connection is unreliable. As a result, the project now features a
                     PDF export option for manuscripts that include high-resolution images of the
                     documents and associated metadata that can be saved to a storage device for

                     instructive case study of this iterative approach. In 2015, members of the
                     Zapotec-speaking community expressed a strong desire to transcribe the
                     manuscripts through the project site. While the Haverford College Libraries
                     could have attempted to build a custom transcription interface, the Digital
                     Scholarship team did not have technical capacity to develop such a feature. The
                     project was already using Omeka as a digital collections platform to serve and
                     describe the digitized manuscripts in parallel with the Django project site. The
                     Scripto plugin for Omeka provided a ready-built solution for a transcription
                     feature. Implementation of that feature occurred in the spring of 2016, at which
                     point the project group conducted two workshops with Zapotec-speaking community
                     members in Oaxaca on document transcription. During these workshops, the
                     affordances and limitations of the Scripto interface became apparent. Users of
                     the web site needed to perform three or four clicks to move from the manuscript
                     viewer to the transcription tool, and the interface itself was difficult to
                     customize for language and format. With this feedback, the digital scholarship
                     group developed its own transcription interface in parallel with the
                     already-launched Scripto interface, which then replaced Scripto in the spring of
                     2018. The new transcriber is completely integrated within the existing
                     manuscript viewer interface, accessible by only one click or tap from an input
                     device.

                     board of Zapotec community members. While community workshops provide feedback
                     on the functionality of the site, members of the advisory board give ongoing
                     advice to shape the project as a whole. In this section, Moisés García Guzmán
                     and Dr. Felipe H. Lopez, two members of the advisory board, reflect on the
                     impact of Ticha in their community. Their words speak best for themselves and
                     thus are intentionally presented here as they were written by the co-authors.
                     García Guzmán, a Zapotec educator and activist, offers the following reflection:

                        <p>Many local communities in Oaxaca were not aware of the
                           existence of documents in Zapotec. Ticha has helped them to see how
                           important their language was in official procedures in the past, but has
                           also helped to create a link with revitalization efforts that are going on,
                           by showing community members that their proposals on contemporary Zapotec
                           can lead to a new standardized written system. García Guzmán, a Zapotec
                           educator and activist, offers the following reflection:

                     <blockquote>
                        <p>As a speaker and activist in my community, Ticha is a great
                           tool in raising awareness on all revitalization efforts. Young kids can see
                           how our language played an important role in some activities of our towns in
                           the past. But also I encourage them not to see the language as only a part
                           of our past, but to also work towards restoring use of our language in many
                           contexts where Zapotec seems to be losing ground. In the end, I hope to
                           instill in them the idea to work towards an official recognition again. I
                           also hope that our efforts will encourage local authorities to give us
                           better access to archives, by showing them all the work that is done. The
                           existence of Ticha makes archival authorities more open and cooperative with
                           these efforts.

                        <p>I have always
                           believed that the youth could be very influential in their communities today
                           and have sought ways to engage with them to promote the Zapotec languages in
                           their pueblos. For the last three years I have had the opportunity to
                           participate in Zapotec workshops at CETIs #124 in collaboration with
                           Haverford College and the Ticha project. These workshops have become pivotal
                           for engaging with students and school officials to rethink the value and
                           importance of Zapotec. In a sense, these workshops have given this school
                           community a different access to the language. In these three years, I have
                           witnessed the way the students involved in these workshops have strengthened
                           their values towards their own language at the same time their
                           identities.

                           Zapotec workshops given that only six students participated. However, each
                           year there has been an increase in the number of students participating, and
                           last year there were more than 20 students who signed up for the Colonial
                           Zapotec workshops.

                        <p>This particular workshop gave students an opportunity to
                           understand their language from a historical perspective and to work with
                           Colonial documents. The Zapotec students tried to understand Colonial
                           Zapotec words and to think about the equivalent modern Zapotec words.
                           Through these documents, they understood that Zapotec is a living language
                           which has been written for hundreds of years, dispelling the notion that
                           Zapotec is not a written language. All the students found commonalities
                           between Colonial Zapotec and the various Zapotec languages they spoke.
                           Furthermore, they were pleasantly surprised to learn ways to count in
                           Zapotec. As is the case in my own community of San Lucas Quiaviní, most
                           students can only count up to ten or so and then use Spanish words, and so
                           through these Colonial Zapotec documents they learned something about their
                           own language.

                        <p>The openness of the Principal Dr. Marcos Pereyra Rito and
                           the support of the main advocate of this program, Abisai Aparicio, has given
                           this opportunity to students, despite the absence of a clear precedent in
                           the educational system in Mexico. In fact, historically, schools served as
                           an instrument of assimilation and punished people who spoke their Indigenous
                           language. However, as part of this collaboration at CETIs #124, the
                           vice-principal, who isn’t a native speaker of Zapotec, made an effort to
                           read a message in Zapotec to the participating students in the workshop last
                           year. Also, one of the teachers, Dr. David Velasco, was willing to accept
                           work written in Zapotec in his literature course. I have also witnessed how
                           students have changed their behaviour towards using their language since
                           these workshops have started. I see students talking Zapotec more openly on
                           campus, whereas prior to this project, we were told that students were
                           embarrassed to speak Zapotec on campus or even to admit they spoke it at
                           all. So, the conditions in which these students decide to use their language
                           is being reshaped at this institution, hopefully as well as outside. These
                           efforts, then, are working to reshape the sociolinguistic possibilities at
                           this institution, and potentially even beyond.

                     “consultation” with the community, but “dialogue, conversation, education, and working through things
                     together” [<a href="#nakata2005">2005</a>, 5]. Ticha embraces
                     this philosophy by working through an ongoing conversation with user
                     communities. Our iterative approach allows the technical design of the project
                     to continually meet the needs of its communities. Furthermore, it situates the
                     project in dialogue with other digital projects that employ similar tools or
                     methods, and provides a model for doing truly community-engaged digital
                     scholarship. For example, Albert-Abrams et al. describe their work as being
                     practiced “not through a static set of methodologies, but
                     rather an ongoing process of learning, unlearning, and restructuring in
                     pursuit of a collective good” [<span class="error"><a href="#albertabrams2019">2019</a></span>, 1]. We recognize our own practice in this description, as well
                     as in the framing provided by Duff et al, that “Social
                     justice is always a process and can never be fully achieved” [<a href="#duff2013">2013</a>, 324].

                     scholars and members of the Zapotec community. The Zapotec language documents in
                     Ticha are a resource for those interested in Zapotec people, their languages,
                     and their history. Ticha’s project design is grounded in well-established
                     theories of cultural and linguistic reclamation and revitalization. Scholars
                     have long discussed the importance of schools in creating positive language
                     ideologies, particularly among youth [<a class="ref" href="#lee2007">Lee 2007</a>], as well as the
                     complexity surrounding the roles that Indigenous educators can have within these
                     systems, in particular in Mexico [<a class="ref" href="#mcdonough2014">McDonough 2014</a>, 160].
                     Researchers have also noted the power of Indigenous community members directly
                     preserving their own histories [<a class="ref" href="#hoobler2006">Hoobler 2006</a>]. Given this, we
                     think it is likely that similar results might be achieved in other communities
                     following our methods, adapted for local priorities and practices. While a
                     handful of projects exist, as mentioned earlier, we could imagine even more
                     projects like this not only in Oaxaca, but in Latin America more broadly, and
                     world-wide where such historical corpora exist. All of the Ticha encoding and
                     scripting is freely available to anyone who would like to use or adapt it for
                     similar projects.

                  <div class="ptext" id="p36">As local language ideologies in Mexico favor Spanish over Indigenous languages
                     such as Zapotec, a project like Ticha serves as a resource for local language
                     activists. In particular, Ticha forefronts Indigenous voices and knowledge. As
                     Pratt says: “If one studies only what the Europeans saw and
                     said, one reproduces the monopoly on knowledge and interpretation that the
                     imperial enterprise sought” [<a href="#pratt2007">2007</a>, 7].
                     Important historical documents, like the testament of Sebastiana de Mendoza,
                     demonstrate in a very concrete way the long literate history of Zapotec people
                     and the importance of the Zapotec language to understanding this history.

                  <div class="ptext" id="p37">We also take this project to be a clear demonstration of the power of digital
                     humanities projects to democratize access to materials and resources which might
                     otherwise be used primarily by scholars. We seek to practice transformational
                     work as part of a larger interdisciplinary project that we would also classify
                     as engaged scholarship. When community members have access to important
                     documents from their own history, we are able to bring together archiving,
                     scholarship, and community engagement in a powerful synthesis.
