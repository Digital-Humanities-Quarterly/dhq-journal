         <dhq:abstract>
           <p>Historically, the study of the digital has been an amorphous undertaking, spanning multiple fields and disciplines and positioning the 
              digital as a democratic space open to multiple communities and perspectives. Despite this ideology, scholarship, including research on 
              #transformDH to #BlackDH, has demonstrated the need for greater diversity, equity, and inclusion within the digital humanities. 
              Specifically, these hashtags have been used to curate diverse scholarship while demonstrating the need to create a scholarship that 
              focuses on an intersectional understanding of the digital humanities. By drawing on the histories of research and researchers both 
              within and outside of Black studies, this article will illuminate the means and methods of producing scholarship at this critical 
              intersection while speaking to the need for greater inclusion of Black feminist, queer, and justice-oriented perspectives.
           </p>
            <p>Pushing back against the impetus to add identity to the title of a field or framework in name but not practice, this article refines 
               the histories and contributions of multiple disciplines and standpoints that should be included and credited when defining the 
               <q>Black</q> in Black digital humanities. Whether sparking hashtag activism and crowdsourcing digital labor to developing new 
               terminology and fields, Black digital humanities draws on and develops work that is already critically engaged with the intersection 
               of identity and digital studies in theory and praxis. By focusing on the development of the Black digital humanities and its defining 
               characteristics, this article will also articulate how the nexus of digital research, activism, and pedagogy offers key interventions 
               and new directions for both Black studies and the digital humanities.

      <body>
        <div>
          <head></head>
            <p>We are in a critical discursive moment where we can debate the origin story and definition of the Black digital humanities. For 
               scholars who write at the intersection of identity and the internet, the 21st century has presented several opportunities for critical 
               reflection and debates on the role of race in digital scholarship. One such reflection is the introduction to the 2022 
               <title rend="italic">Social Media and Society</title> special issue titled <title rend="quotes">Interrogating Digital Blackness</title> by 
               Meredith Clark and Adam Banks. Drawing on Stuart Hall's essay <title rend="quotes">What is this 
               Black in Black Popular Culture</title>, Clark and Banks provide an overview of the many scholars, fields, and 
               theoretical frameworks that have offered critical perspectives on the role of Black culture and community within the creation of digital 
               content and platforms <ptr target="#clark_etal2022" loc="1"/>.
            </p>
            <p>While many academic disciplines are studying this shift towards the web and virtual environments, the digital humanities are 
               especially well-suited to analyze the impact of technology on culture and communities. In particular, the Black digital humanities 
               combines multiple disciplines, theoretical perspectives, and research methods to analyze the many past, present, and future instances 
               when technology has influenced Black culture. Whether through sparking hashtag activism and crowdsourcing digital labor or developing 
               new theories and terminology, Black digital humanities draws on and develops work critically engaged with the intersection of identity 
               and digital studies.
            </p>
            <p>Therefore, this article starts by defining digital humanities and my introduction to the field by discussing its critical moments, 
               characteristics, and debates, from its origins in the humanities to its shift towards quantitative methods and the effort to 
               #transformDH. Using the research and researchers in Black studies as a reference point, I explore the definition of Black 
               digital humanities by highlighting professors and programs that produce critical scholarship and speculative thinking at the 
               intersection of Black studies and digital humanities. To conclude, I call for more projects and research that acknowledge the role of 
               queer and trans members of the community in discussions of digital culture. Throughout this article, I also cite several examples of 
               digital humanities scholarship and projects to demonstrate a Black queer and femme approach to reading the field and to show 
               how #transformDH and #BlackDH have evolved and developed through multiple versions of the field and debates in the digital 
               humanities.

          <head>Debating the <q>Digital</q> in Digital Humanities</head>
            <p>Before defining <q>Black</q> in the Black digital humanities, it is essential to think critically about debates that define the 
               <q>digital</q> in the digital humanities, which preface the critical transformation of the field. Historically, the study of the 
               digital has been an amorphous undertaking, spanning multiple fields and disciplines and positioning the digital as a democratic space 
               open to multiple communities and perspectives. Consequently, early digital humanities research focused on the potential that comes with 
               new and emerging technology. For example, Matthew Kirschenbaum's article <title rend="quotes">What is Digital Humanities 
               and What is it Doing in English Departments?</title> aims to define the digital humanities and explain how computing is used in 
               disciplines like English. He cites several conferences, organizations, departments, and articles to demonstrate the challenge of 
               defining the digital humanities due to its diverse fields and perspectives <ptr target="#kirschenbaum2016" loc="1–4"/>. However, he 
               notes that the field's defining or unifying characteristic is bringing people together by investing in the public humanities, digital 
               pedagogy, social media, and collaborative work.
            </p>
            <p>Speaking to the project-based nature of the field, Kirschenbaum ends the piece with the assertion that: <quote rend="block">The 
               digital humanities today is about a scholarship (and a pedagogy) that is publicly visible in ways to which we are generally unaccustomed, 
               a scholarship and pedagogy that are bound up with infrastructure in ways that are deeper and more explicit than we are generally 
               accustomed to, a scholarship and pedagogy that are collaborative and depend on networks of people and that live an active 24/7 life 
               online. Isn't that something you want in your English department? <ptr target="#kirschenbaum2016" loc="6"/></quote> 
               Kirschenbaum proffers the importance of production and education by focusing on <quote rend="inline">scholarship and 
               pedagogy</quote> as integral components of the digital humanities. Moreover, it is in this final assertion that Kirschenbaum 
               captures how many digital humanists were introduced to the field and how that introduction influences how we came to define it. At the 
               same time that Kirschenbaum was writing about the role of digital humanities in English departments, I found digital 
               humanities through a college English department. While taking an introductory English course, my knowledge of digital humanities was 
               encompassed by the book <title rend="italic">The New Media Reader</title> and my writing as a Humanities, Arts, Science, and Technology 
               Advanced Collaboratory (HASTAC) scholar.
            </p>
            <p>Therefore, my perspective of the digital humanities focused on the role the field could play within libraries and museums, as many 
               digital humanities projects invested in digitizing historical records, developing interactive art and media, and analyzing large datasets 
               of literary texts. In this sense, the <q>digital</q> in digital humanities encompassed the many ways digital tools and technologies 
               changed humanistic traditions. However, even as my research interests focused on the impact of technology on society, this 
               English-based approach to digital humanities centered less on lived experience and embodiment and more on linguistic and philosophical 
               play with born-digital texts. Consequently, I developed the belief that Black identity and technology were separate studies, and it 
               was not until the publication of the anthology <title rend="italic">Race After the Internet</title> that I began to contemplate the 
               relationship between race and digital media.
            </p>
            <p>This background and introduction also meant that my definition of digital humanities was primarily theoretical and creative. Unlike 
               the methodological understanding of digital humanities that would later unite scholars in the field, I defined the digital humanities 
               as a systematic view or standpoint rather than as a methodological toolkit. Like many scholars in English DH, I saw digital humanities 
               (and being a digital humanist) as taking the perspective that computers and technology could empower people to make critical changes in 
               society or on a smaller scale in their respective fields and disciplines. However, more than a decade later, the way we think about the 
               digital humanities has shifted from theorizing about the power of computers and technology towards a more tangible investment in 
               skills-building. From library and data carpentry to The Humanities and Technology (THAT) Camp, training in digital humanities focuses 
               less on philosophical discussions of the role of computing within media, culture, and society and more on understanding technical 
               language and quantitative methods.
            </p>
            <p>In many ways, the term <q>digital humanist</q> has aligned the digital humanities as a practice with distinct practitioners who possess 
               specific skills. These skills usually include coding and data visualization but rarely focus on humanities theory. Therefore, the field 
               produces <q>DH practitioners</q> who are united in their knowledge of what they can do without a shared epistemology that unites the 
               field around what practitioners think or believe. Although digital humanities is still prevalent in English departments, the focus on 
               methods has shifted, so what was once viewed as the digitization of the humanities is now quite similar to the humanization of the 
               sciences. For example, the recent calls for more ethical artificial intelligence or responsible machine learning echo the concerns 
               digital humanists have always raised, as they focus on the issues and inequalities that can arise from technology adoption and its 
               influence on society. However, these calls also focus on quantitative big data methods, prioritizing the study of algorithms over 
               art and culture.
            </p>
            <p>Numerous digital humanists have engaged in methodological critique in response to this practical turn. In 2012, 
               Kirschenbaum's essay was republished as a chapter in the first edition of <title rend="italic">Debates in the Digital 
               Humanities</title>. This anthology included multiple foundational texts that defined the field and its methods. It also included a 
               section that focused on critiques of the field. A chapter by Tara McPherson titled <title rend="quotes">Why are the 
               Digital Humanities so White? Or Thinking the Histories of Race and Computation</title> anticipated concerns about the oppressive 
               algorithmic systems that undergird technology and the role these systems play within our society and academic silos 
               <ptr target="#mcpherson2012" loc="139–142"/>. McPherson's essay also questioned why studying digital tools and technologies 
               had taken over human-centered inquiry.
            </p>
            <p>Although the digital realm was a place of anonymity and liberation from the social hierarchies and oppressive structures of the 
               physical world, it has become evident that the digital realm has not generated an entirely new and independent world free from societal 
               ills. Instead, it has replicated the offline world's issues within the digital domain. As a reflection of its subject of study, the 
               digital humanities has struggled to address the relationship between identity and inequality in favor of a color-blind approach that 
               privileges the examination of tools and methods. Even after over a decade, these concerns are still significant for digital 
               humanities practitioners, leading to demands for change and transformation in the sector regarding social justice issues and the study 
               of race.

          <head>Black and Brave: On #transformDH and the Era of Critique</head>
            <p><title rend="italic">Debates in the Digital Humanities</title> was not the only publication where critiques of the digital humanities 
               and the presence of oppressive systems within the field remained an important topic and point of contention. Specifically, movements 
               such as #transformDH played a critical role in the recognition of Black digital humanities scholarship, marking a significant moment 
               in the history of the digital humanities.
            </p>
            <p>In the essay <title rend="quotes">The Brave Side of Digital Humanities</title>, Fiona Barnett discusses in-person and 
               online responses to conference panels that question the nature of digital humanities work. Barnett's essay also highlights 
               several unspoken codes and patterns that influence what and who is considered a part of digital humanities scholarship 
               <ptr target="#barnett2014" loc="67–69"/>. Barnett argues that this differentiation between what is included and what is 
               excluded in the digital humanities can be expressed through <quote rend="inline">the conflict between hack versus yack</quote> or making 
               versus theorizing <ptr target="#barnett2014" loc="74"/>. While digital humanities projects showcasing technical skills are well-received 
               in DH spaces, the same acceptance is not given to more critical work. As a result, there is an over-representation of digital 
               humanities projects and practitioners that do not critically engage with social issues, such as the digital divide or online identity 
               performance. Referencing the work of #transformDH, Barnett cites scholars such as Moya Bailey, 
               Amanda Phillips, and Alexis Lothian, who have amplified their critiques of digital humanities scholarship 
               through various forms of digital activism.
            </p>
            <p>In the book <title rend="italic">#HashtagActivism: Networks of Race and Gender Justice</title>, hashtag activism is defined as 
               <quote rend="inline">the creation and proliferation of online activism stamped with a hashtag</quote> 
               <ptr target="#jackson_etal2020" loc="xxxiii"/>. Digital or hashtag activism is often used to raise awareness and mobilize large groups 
               around a cause. In their essay titled <title rend="quotes">Can Digital Humanities Mean Transformative Critique?</title>, 
               Alexis Lothian and Amanda Phillips reflect on the significant contribution of hashtag activism in the 
               development of digital humanities. In the essay, the authors state: <quote rend="block">“#TransformDH was our attempt to turn the 
               digital humanities . . . toward the bodies of critical work in new media studies by Wendy Chun, Lisa Nakamura, 
               Anna Everett, Tara McPherson, and many others, that unpack the politics inherent in the force of the digital, 
               the powers that shape the hardware and software that in turn shape our scholarly work. <ptr target="#lothian_etal2013" loc="3"/></quote>
               The hashtag #transformDH has highlighted the importance of activism and diversity, equity, and inclusion in the field of digital 
               humanities. This movement has shifted the focus from solely methodological and project-based research to theoretical and community-focused 
               research. As a result, digital and physical spaces have been created to host these critical conversations. Moreover, the hashtag has been 
               used to showcase diverse scholarship on various digital platforms, emphasizing the need for an intersectional understanding of the 
               digital humanities.
            </p>
            <p>This intersectional critique of project-based digital humanities work is also explored by Moya Bailey in the essay 
               <title rend="quotes">All the Digital Humanists Are White, All the Nerds Are Men, but Some of Us Are Brave</title>. In this essay, 
               Bailey responds to the lack of diversity in the field by stating: <quote rend="block">The way in which identities both 
               inform theory and practice in digital humanities have been largely overlooked [and]  . . . The move from <q>margin to centre</q> offers 
               the opportunity to engage new sets of theoretical questions that expose implicit assumptions about what and who counts in digital 
               humanities. <ptr target="#bailey2011" loc="1"/></quote> By investigating an otherwise <quote rend="inline">unexamined identity politics 
               of whiteness, masculinity, and able-bodiedness</quote>, Bailey shows how the digital humanities replicate many of the same 
               exclusionary hierarchies as other fields and systems <ptr target="#bailey2011" loc="1"/>. Bailey further suggests that 
               numerous people can be classified as digital humanities practitioners, though their work frequently goes acknowledged within the field. 
               This is because being situated on the fringe of digital humanities work results in less recognition, as does scholarship that does not 
               conform to the traditional digital humanities model. However, Bailey points out that we can make more room for scholarship 
               engaged with identity and digital humanities by looking at the places <quote rend="inline">where people of color, women, [and] people 
               with disabilities are already engaged in digital projects</quote> <ptr target="#bailey2011" loc="2"/>.
            </p>
            <p>While these essays reflect on #transformDH, their recommendations can also be applied to the Black digital humanities or #BlackDH. They 
               suggest that Black digital dumanities scholarship has always been a part of the digital humanities, even when it was not well-received 
               or clearly understood <ptr target="#barnett2014" loc="70–73"/>. However, it was only when more open conversations about intersectionality 
               and inclusion took place that the field began to take visible form. While understanding digital methods is an integral part of the digital 
               humanities, it is crucial to acknowledge that some implicit theoretical beliefs and biases undergird that praxis. Therefore, digital 
               humanities scholars who engage in critical theories of race, gender, sexuality, and many other categories do the work of exploring the 
               importance of developing both theory and praxis.
            </p>
            <p>Movements like #transformDH and #BlackDH highlight the investment in critical digital humanities that worked to locate the digital 
               humanities in fields, disciplines, and institutions that are only sometimes included in the representation and reception of digital 
               humanities work. Consequently, hashtags can also be used to find Black digital humanities projects and practitioners in DH. As a tagging 
               system for scholars within the field, hashtag #BlackDH signal boosts Black digital humanities scholarship online and offline, from 
               live-tweeting at conferences to sharing calls for papers and new projects. Using hashtags and other linking methods is essential in Black 
               digital humanities work because it covers many fields and frameworks that could be included within #BlackDH. Just as scholars within 
               #transformDH have included scholars from communication and new media studies, #BlackDH also includes scholars from fields like Black 
               studies, history, and sociology.
            </p>
            <p>Building on the success of #transformDH and the hashtag activism seen within academic Twitter, hashtags like #BlackDH bring visibility 
               to work that is not commonly represented as part of the digital humanities. For example, when I utilize #BlackDH on platforms like 
               X (formerly Twitter), I can find books like <title rend="italic">Alternative Historiographies of the Digital Humanities,</title> edited by 
               Dorothy Kim and Adeline Koh, which explore the many identities and perspectives that we do not find when 
               telling the story of the digital humanities. Additionally, this hashtag includes references to numerous projects and podcasts and offers 
               recaps and highlights from talks between scholars in the field. The next section of this article therefore focuses on how #BlackDH 
               defines itself through critical essays and a diverse community of digital scholars, the very work we can uncover through hashtag 
               activism.

          <head>By Another Name: Defining and Tracing the Black Digital Humanities</head>
            <p>Drawing on Fiona Barnett's (2014) essay, I use this section to recognize and connect the linkages between several fields of 
               study and perspectives that should be defined as Black digital humanities, as well as the new directions that could be sparked moving 
               forward <ptr target="#barnett2014" loc="76"/>. To define Black digital humanities, we must examine two scholarly works that have played 
               a crucial role in unifying the field and articulating the research and contributions of Black diasporic people in digital humanities. 
               These works are Kim Gallon's <title rend="quotes">Making a Case for the Black Digital Humanities</title> and 
               Safiya Noble's <title rend="quotes">Toward a Critical Black Digital Humanities</title>. These essays provide a framework 
               for scholars to ask relevant questions, identify key areas of research and discussion, and locate relevant literature.
            </p>
            <p>Building on the work of #transformDH, Professor Kim Gallon argues in her essay <title rend="quotes">Making a Case for the 
               Black Digital Humanities</title> that the Black digital humanities can help reveal the racialized power systems underlying the digital 
               humanities field and its associated techniques. Gallon believes the Black digital humanities is valuable due to its 
               standpoint, theories, and methodology. Specifically, Gallon notes that the work of the Black digital humanities is based on 
               a <quote rend="inline">technology of recovery</quote> that uses digital tools and technology to humanize Black diasporic people and 
               recover the artifacts of Black culture <ptr target="#gallon2016" loc="44"/>.
            </p>
            <p>This perspective of Black digital humanities is consistent with the goals of #transformDH and the critical shift in the digital 
               humanities, as it urges scholars to analyze not only the racialized frameworks that support technology but also how the technology of 
               race penetrates every aspect of society, including academic research. By resisting the hidden racism, or what Tara McPherson 
               describes as the <quote rend="inline">lenticular logic</quote> that is the basis of most systems, this essay presents the Black digital 
               humanities as a means of restoring the humanistic perspective of the digital humanities by leveraging the unique viewpoint of Black 
               community members <ptr target="#mcpherson2013" loc="25"/>.
            </p>
            <p>Safiya Noble's essay also discusses the role of Black digital humanities within and outside academia. In the essay, 
               Noble draws from Kim Gallon and Roopika Risam's essays in <title rend="italic">Debates in the 
               Digital Humanities</title> and incorporates Black feminist theories and Black studies scholarship. Specifically, Noble 
               writes that <quote rend="inline">Black studies has a unique role to play in dismembering how we think about humanity and the digital 
               humanities by extension</quote>. Thus, developing a <quote rend="inline">black epistemology will generate questions about the 
               relationship between the racialization of humanity and the digital as power, ultimately fostering new inquiries and deeper understandings 
               about the human condition</quote> <ptr target="#noble2019"/>. The essay then critiques the institutional structures that support digital 
               humanities research within the academy while lacking community engagement and social impact outside of it.
            </p>
            <p>Similar to the work of #transformDH and #BlackDH, Noble calls for <quote rend="inline">DH scholars to engage in the work 
               of African/Black diaspora studies</quote> and for <quote rend="inline">African/Black diaspora studies scholars who do not necessarily 
               align themselves with the digital humanities to contribute to the project of surfacing the intellectual traditions of political economy 
               and race and gender studies in the field</quote> <ptr target="#noble2019" loc="32"/>. In doing so, Noble signals the need 
               for research within the digital humanities that is attentive to issues such as environmental justice and workers' rights, which requires 
               working with communities and organizations outside of higher education.
            </p>
            <p>Overall, these two essays show how the definition of the Black digital humanities has evolved from interventions made in digital 
               humanities research to incorporate the field of Black studies and other disciplines that take a sociocultural perspective on the world. 
               Specifically, Gallon's essay offers a theoretical perspective on the role of Black studies in digital humanities and 
               technology studies. On the other hand, Noble's essay highlights the structural issues that need to be addressed in the 
               digital humanities and the type of work that needs to be done within the academy and society. Nevertheless, both essays demonstrate how 
               the term <q>Black Digital humanities</q> can bring together multiple schools of research and scholarship at the intersection of Black 
               studies and digital studies or ethnic studies and digital humanities.
            </p>
            <p>However, as Moya Bailey writes, there is a need to challenge the <quote rend="inline">add and stir model of diversity</quote> 
               <ptr target="#bailey2011" loc="3"/>. In other words, creating space for the Black digital humanities requires more than simply adding 
               Black (i.e., Black studies or scholars) to the digital humanities, which in turn requires us to acknowledge and resist the trend of 
               <q>black-washing</q> academic fields. <q>Black-washing</q> refers to the superficial use of Black content or related hashtags to signal 
               racial solidarity without actually engaging in anti-racism work. For example, during Black History Month, platforms like YouTube and 
               Netflix create algorithms to recommend Black content to users without addressing how the platform can be complicit in its own racial 
               biases. We must recognize and push back against <q>black-washing</q> in order to truly advance Black digital humanities.</p>
            <p>So the question becomes: What actual work is being produced within the field or discipline to ensure racial justice and equity outside 
               of profiting from hashtag activism and the current sociopolitical moment? For many Black digital humanists, this means doing research 
               that is participatory and attentive to data and design justice issues, as well as the concerns that disproportionately affect Black 
               communities, such as climate change and healthcare equity. Additionally, there is a need for a recuperative recognition of the research 
               and scholarship produced within Black studies that should fall under the auspices of the digital humanities.
            </p>
            <p>For example, several scholars have established institutional spaces at the intersection of Black studies, science and technology Studies 
               (STS), and digital humanities, like Ruha Benjamin's work with the Ida B. Wells Just Data Lab, Marc Anthony Neal's 
               efforts with Left of Black, the Center for Black Digital Research (#DigBlk) at Penn State, the Center for Africana Futures 
               at Texas Southern University, and African American History, Culture and Digital Humanities (AADHum) at the University 
               of Maryland. These institutional spaces each work to forward Black digital humanities research, events, and resources that interact 
               with the public and mobilize the #BlackDH hashtag to build a collaborative network both on and offline.
            </p>
            <p>Additionally, organizations like Data for Black Lives, a group of activists, organizers, and mathematicians, are committed to using data 
               science and technology to create concrete and measurable change in the lives of Black people. This collective hosts conferences around 
               many of the questions that scholars and activists are asking about the relationship between politics and platforms, which I believe is 
               essential to many of the goals of the Black digital humanities framework.
            </p>
            <p>Moving forward, it is crucial to not only trace the lineage of Black digital humanities through the calls for more diverse work within 
               the digital humanities but also to invest in studying the technological advancements of the future that continue to motivate scholars and 
               activists within Black studies. Therefore, the following sections outline moments in the past, present, and future of Black studies 
               research that are important to developing Black digital humanities research while pointing out where and how the field can and could 
               become more inclusive of Black queer and trans histories and narratives.

          <head>On the Past: Afrofuturism, Scholar-Activism, and the History of Black Studies</head>
            <p>Looking to the past, one of the critical areas of study that Black digital humanities scholars bring to the digital humanities is a 
               historicization of technology through the legacy of Black scholarship and activism. From projects focused on digitizing Black History to 
               efforts to recognize the speculative design capabilities of historic Black scholarship, recovering the theory and praxis that motivated 
               abolitionists and academics to imagine a future filled with equity and empowerment is one of the most significant contributions Black 
               studies brings to the digital humanities. As Jessica Marie Johnson writes in her essay <title rend="quotes">"Markup 
               BodiesBlack [Life] Studies and Slavery [Death] Studies at the Digital Crossroads</title>: <quote rend="block">Black digital practice 
               . . . predates digital intervention, drawing on strategies of empowerment, joy, and kinship created out of Black freedom struggles to 
               facilitate the use of digital tools and create new methodologies, practices, and even ethics for their use. 
               <ptr target="#johnson2018" loc="68"/></quote> Instead of positioning Black history as solely in the past and digital practice as present- 
               or future-focused, Johnson complicates our understanding of time and the digital by stating that a <quote rend="inline">Black 
               digital practice</quote> could exist well before <quote rend="inline">digital intervention</quote> <ptr target="#johnson2018"/>.
            </p>
            <p>Understanding time and technology within the context of Black culture is also a key component in exploring the concept of Afrofuturism 
               and its role in the history of Black studies and Black digital humanities projects. In <title rend="italic">#identity: Hashtagging Race, 
               Gender, Sexuality, and Nation</title>, Grace Gipson cites Yotasha Womack in defining Afrofuturism as 
               <quote rend="inline">an intersection of imagination, technology, the future, and liberation</quote> <ptr target="#gipson2019" loc="84"/>. 
               After completing a hashtag analysis of <q>#Afrofuturism</q>, Gipson finds that most tweets on the topic depict Afrofuturism 
               as <quote rend="inline">an artistic aesthetic, as a tool for critical cultural analysis, as a platform for analyzing the impact of 
               modernization on cultural production, and as an exploration of Black identity</quote> <ptr target="#gipson2019" loc="88–89"/>. Therefore, 
               the description of Afrofuturism overlaps with definitions of the Black digital humanities because Afrofuturism and the Black digital 
               humanities are each committed to humanizing Black communities and investigating the socio-cultural dimensions of culture and technology.
            </p>
            <p>In addition, Gipson utilizes the concept of Afrofuturism to discuss <quote rend="inline">flame-keeping</quote>, or 
               <quote rend="inline">acts of preserving cultural productions and a body of knowledge</quote> <ptr target="#gipson2019" loc="86"/>. 
               This method of passing on knowledge is usually seen within historical texts but also in the creation of speculative fiction. Flame-keeping 
               allows Black creatives to share their beliefs about the future, passing on their hopes and dreams for their community to generations that 
               will be more capable or better positioned to accomplish them. Through examples from individuals such as Sojourner Truth and 
               Fannie Lou Hamer, Gipson demonstrates how historical figures and texts envisioned Black futures by passing on 
               the flame of knowledge and intuition. In doing so, Gipson suggests that we should view historical figures and activists of abolition 
               and civil rights movements as Afrofuturists in their own right.
            </p>
            <p>From this standpoint, there are several moments in Black history where activists and scholars engaged in Afrofuturistic thought. As 
               Walidah Imarisha writes in the introduction to the book <title rend="italic">Octavia's Brood: Science Fiction Stories from 
               Social Justice Movements</title>, <quote rend="inline">Whenever we try to envision a world without war, without violence, without prisons, 
               without capitalism, we are engaging in speculative fiction</quote> <ptr target="#imarisha2015" loc="3"/>. Black activists and scholars 
               can be viewed as the prophets and dreamers who imagined futures where Black people were free citizens — which contextualizes why 
               Gallon's definition of the Black digital humanities positions the field as a humanizing project. Flame-keeping is 
               something that activists and Black scholars still do when they imagine and write what Robin Kelley calls 
               <quote rend="inline">freedom dreams</quote> for this current moment and the future <ptr target="#kelley2022"/>.
            </p>
            <p>Kara Keeling's book <title rend="italic">Queer Times, Black Futures</title> further explores the concepts of flame-keeping and 
               freedom dreams by analyzing how speculative imagining has been crucial for Black queer scholars, activists, and creatives. 
               Keeling advances Kelley's concept of freedom dreams by writing that a <quote rend="inline">Black radical 
               imagination recombines the contents of the long arc of Black existence in ways that call forth new relations to all</quote> 
               <ptr target="#keeling2019" loc="32–35"/>. From this perspective, projects that recognize Black queer and trans people in historical 
               records and archives are one example of how radical imagination can shift how we view the lineage of Black existence. Consequently, 
               many galleries, libraries, archives, and museums (GLAMs) utilize speculative imagining to create more inclusive Black digital humanities 
               projects. For example, the National Museum of African-American History and Culture (NMAAC) has developed an 
               in-person and online exhibit focusing on Black LGBTQ+ history during the Harlem Renaissance. Although some artists and creatives openly 
               identified as part of the LGBTQ+ community, archivists and historians have had to speculate about the identity of others 
               <ptr target="#day2023"/> In this sense, Afrofuturist practices like speculative imagining can be used to digitally reconstruct histories 
               that are more inclusive of Black queer and trans community members.
            </p>
            <p>I also saw the potential of radical imagination when writing about my first Black digital studies conference, Black Thought 2.0. In an 
               interview for the 2012 conference at Duke University, Mark Anthony Neal is quoted as saying: 
               <quote rend="block">Given our rich tradition of public intellectuals, dating back to figures like [Frederick] Douglass and 
               Sojourner Truth, it just seems as though new media represents another way for black intellectuals to be in the world. 
               Imagine what W.E.B. [Du Bois] might have done with a Twitter feed? <ptr target="#duketoday2012"/></quote> By imagining 
               W.E.B. Du Bois as a Twitter user, Mark Anthony Neal uses speculative thought to demonstrate how Black 
               intellectuals were invested in sharing information with public audiences through the latest technologies even before the development of 
               the Black digital humanities. In the book <title rend="italic">W.E.B. Du Bois' Data Portraits</title>, Whitney Battle Baptiste 
               and Britt Rusert also write about Du Bois' interest in innovation by describing the infographics created for his 
               sociological work in Atlanta during the 1900 Paris Exhibition. Specifically, the authors write, <quote rend="inline">The 
               infographics look back to a history of data visualization in the 19th century deeply connected to the institution of slavery, and the 
               struggle against it, while looking forward</quote> <ptr target="#battle-baptiste_etal2018" loc="98"/>.
            </p> 
            <p>Du Bois' visualizations are incredibly precise, even for a 21st-century audience. Although the visualizations are 
               hand-drawn, they are vibrant and colorful, reminiscent of 21st-century digital projects like Giorgia Lupi and Stefanie 
               Posavec's <title rend="quotes">Dear Data</title> visualizations or other forms of data storytelling <ptr target="#lupi_etal2016"/>. 
               Therefore, the visualizations anticipated what data and design would look like. Furthermore, they serve as an example of a Black digital 
               practice that existed before the digital era. Du Bois' interest in speculative fiction is also noteworthy, as it allows 
               him to effectively use information from the past and present to envision future possibilities in his research 
               <ptr target="#battle-baptiste_etal2018" loc="6"/>.
            </p>
            <p>This looking back and looking forward is also described as a method of framing that Du Bois used in the publication of 
               his scholarship, <quote rend="inline">[which] presents us with a stunning juxtaposition that points neither to historical progress nor 
               to the overcoming of the slave past but to the ways, slavery continued quite literally to frame the present</quote> 
               <ptr target="#battle-baptiste_etal2018" loc="18"/>. As a result, Du Bois' work can be seen as a precursor, or the academic 
               ancestor, to the type of work we now see in the Black digital humanities. We can follow Du Bois' example by working to 
               uncover the many ways in which the legacy of slavery continues to frame our understanding of data, science, and technology in the 20th 
               and 21st centuries.
            </p>
            <p>Furthermore, as Black scholars work to contextualize the history of slavery within the study of technology, they can also use this 
               understanding of the past to create a progressive account of the present and future. In the essay <title rend="italic">Say It 
               Loud, I'm Black and I'm Proud: African Americans, American Artifactual Culture, and Black Vernacular Technological Creativity</title>, 
               Rayvon Fouché cites the work of Anthony Walton to describe how part of the legacy of slavery is that 
               technology and technological systems have historically been used to oppress Black diasporic people 
               <ptr target="#fouche2006" loc="639–640"/>. Even after slavery, even in moments of social progress or technological advancement, any 
               historical moment in which Black people are framed as data points or as cogs in a machine rather than as individuals is evidence 
               of history repeating itself.
            </p>
            <p>However, Fouché moves past this understanding of digital technology as a means of oppression by asserting that always 
               <quote rend="inline">thinking about the technological control of African Americans . . . strips black people of technological 
               agency</quote> <ptr target="#fouche2006" loc="640"/>. It is essential to acknowledge that Black people have utilized technology to their 
               advantage in various moments throughout history. Although society often considers science and technology as relatively new fields of 
               study, Black digital humanists acknowledge that this work has existed for a long time. They aim to enhance the narrative of Black 
               communities beyond deficit narratives because highlighting instances of empowerment, creativity, and community involvement is as 
               important as addressing histories of oppression.
            </p>
            <p>Fouché uses the term <q>Black vernacular technological creativity</q> to demonstrate that Black history and culture 
               <quote rend="inline">is rich in historical value and replete with rebellion, resistance, assimilation, and appropriation in forms we 
               would often not recognize, and in places, we are not accustomed to looking</quote> <ptr target="#fouche2006" loc="640"/>. 
               In this sense, Fouché's work acts as another critical precursor to the Black digital humanities in American Culture, 
               as the study of Black culture and communities allows scholars to expand on the past and bring light to the ingenuity of Black digital 
               practices across multiple moments in time and in places where we do not usually search for digital scholarship.
            </p>
            <p>Numerous Black Digital Humanities projects and practitioners exist in alternative academic spaces like libraries and public-facing 
               scholarship. While most academic research is available only to those who have access to institutional repositories and academic journals, 
               public projects within alternative academic spaces use the digital realm to ensure that projects are openly accessible to audiences 
               within and outside of academia. For instance, the Council of Library and Information Resources (CLIR) 
               <title rend="italic">Curated Futures Project</title> utilizes the theme of Afrofuturism to compile Black Digital Humanities projects

          <head>In the Present: The <q>Black Studies</q> in Black Digital Humanities</head>
            <p>Moving from the past to the present moment, there are several fields and disciplines from which scholars invested in the Black digital 
               humanities can draw and build. As Safiya Noble writes in <title rend="italic">Debates in Digital Humanities</title>, 
               <quote rend="inline">We need to continue to inquire with a critical DH lens tilted toward Black studies, gender studies, ethnic studies, 
               information studies, media studies, communication, sociology, and science and technology studies</quote> 
               <ptr target="#noble2019" loc="33"/>. While each of these areas is important, we must also recognize that the inherent 
               interdisciplinarity of Black studies means that many of these areas are also practiced by scholars within the discipline.
            </p>
            <p>Throughout the history of Black studies, multiple calls for interventions and new scholarship have demonstrated the discipline's 
               importance within other fields. Although Black studies continues to be positioned as a discipline that prioritizes studying communities 
               and culture without acknowledgement of what the discipline brings to science and technology, there have been several moments where the 
               study of digital tools and technology has gained traction within Black studies and laid the foundation for Black digital humanities.
            </p>
            <p>Therefore, I use this section to outline further the many nodes and edges that make up the Black digital humanities scholarship network 
               by pointing out the moments when the digital converges with Black studies. While this section is not exhaustive, it demonstrates Black 
               studies' role in developing Black digital humanities. It also offers some key examples of where scholars can find Black digital 
               humanities work relevant to the present moment. As Kim Gallon writes, <quote rend="inline">e-Black studies, black code 
               studies, and digital blackness</quote> are all examples of conferences and curations where we can see the overlap between the digital 
               humanities and Black studies <ptr target="#gallon2016" loc="47"/>.
            </p>
            <p>Beginning with e-Black studies, Abdul Alkalimat and Ronald Bailey's essay <title rend="quotes">From Black to 
               eBlack</title> maps the history of Black studies and how that history positions Black studies as a movement, profession, and network 
               committed to social change and institutional transformation <ptr target="#alkalimat_etal2012" loc="10–11"/>. This work is continued in 
               <title rend="italic">The Digital Black Atlantic</title>, an edited collection from 2021 that offers one of the most comprehensive 
               considerations of the intersection of Black studies and the digital humanities. Alkalimat's more recent essay, 
               <title rend="quotes">The Sankofa Principle: From the Drum to the Digital</title> further reflects on the principles underpinning e-Black 
               studies, including cyberdemocracy, collective intelligence, and information freedom. Cyberdemocracy seeks to overcome the digital divide, 
               while collective intelligence involves collecting, analyzing, and utilizing intellectual thought. Information freedom, on the other hand, 
               advocates for unrestricted access to information <ptr target="#alkalimat2021" loc="8"/>. These theoretical principles are also paired with 
               methods that help scholars put e-Black studies into practice. For example, Alkalimat traces the development of e-Black 
               studies from primarily in-person activities, like conferences and courses, to open-access online spaces, including digital projects and 
               virtual communities <ptr target="#alkalimat2021" loc="12–16"/>.
            </p>
            <p>Building on e-Black studies, there has been a surge in researchers, departments, and organizations that have taken up this call to 
               consider Black diasporic communities' role in studying information, data, and digital technologies. For example, the present moment has 
               ushered in several conferences and curations that were explicit in their analysis of the overlap between Black studies and digital 
               humanities. In contrast to most digital humanities conferences, the Black digital humanities tend to exist within conferences that 
               center on the unique challenges of being Black online and researching Black communities during the era of digital media and technology. 
               As I noted in an earlier section of this essay, some notable conferences in the development of the field were Duke 
               University's Black Thought 2.0 in 2012, followed by Rutger's Digital Blackness Conference in 2016, the 
               University of Maryland's 2018 conference titled <title rend="quotes">Intentionally Digital, Intentionally Black</title>, 
               and the 2022 <title rend="quotes">Present Encounters: Digital Humanities Meet Afrofuturism</title> symposium hosted by Temple 
               University Libraries. These conferences were bolstered by digital curations of projects and essays that also spoke to this unique 
               intersection, as well as the creation of virtual spaces where scholars could converse about this work.
            </p> 
            <p>In addition to e-Black studies, digital Blackness, and the <title rend="italic">Digital Black Atlantic</title>, it is essential to note 
               scholars that incorporate the literal and metaphorical study of code in their work. For example, early Black studies and digital 
               humanities scholarship converged in 2017 when <title rend="italic">The Black Scholar</title> published a collection of essays on Black 
               code studies. In the introduction to the collection, <q>Black code studies</q> is defined as <quote rend="inline">queer, femme, fugitive, 
               and radical</quote> <ptr target="#johnson_etal2017" loc="1"/>. Therefore, this collection included essays that addressed the need for 
               work that is queer, feminist, activist, and abolitionist within the digital humanities and Black studies. This wording frames Black code 
               studies as an essential moment in Black studies and Digital Humanities by breaking out of the institutional structures of project-based 
               digital humanities work and traditional academic inquiry.
            </p>
            <p>Similarly, in the essay <title rend="quotes">Catching our breath: Critical Race STS and the Carceral Imagination</title>, 
               Ruja Benjamin utilizes critical race theory and abolitionist ethics to intervene in science and technology studies. Hence, 
               critical race science and technology studies (critical race STS) is closely related to Black code studies and Black digital humanities 
               due to its investment in radical work that speaks truth to power by openly speaking out against social injustice (e.g., gender inequity, 
               police brutality, environmental inequality, disability, and health disparity), as well as demonstrating the importance of intersectional 
               analysis in the study of science and technology <ptr target="#benjamin2016" loc="151"/>.
            </p>
            <p>This investment in scholarship focused on intersectionality is also seen in the number of publications on the intersections of 
               Black feminism and digital studies. Over the years, these publications have focused on the potential of the internet as a space for 
               activism, community building, and fieldwork. Beginning with Anna Everett's (2004) <title rend="quotes">On Cyberfeminism 
               and Cyberwomanism</title>, which combines Black feminism and womanism with feminist science and technology studies. Specifically, 
               Everett writes about how Black women use digital tools and technology for community engagement, organizing, and activism 
               <ptr target="#everett2004" loc="1281–1283"/>. In contrast, scholars like Tressie McMillan Cottom utilize the terminology 
               of Black cyberfeminism as an intervention in the subfield of <quote rend="inline">digital sociology</quote> 
               <ptr target="#mcmillancottom2016"/>. Kishonna Gray also employs the terminology of Black cyberfeminism to study identity 
               performance within video games and virtual communities <ptr target="#gray2018" loc="285–286"/>. Most recently, Catherine Knight 
               Steele's book titled <title rend="italic">Digital Black Feminism</title> encapsulates this history by demonstrating the 
               importance of centering Black voices in the study of the digital realm and, specifically, centering the lived experience and digital 
               praxis of Black women and femmes <ptr target="#steele2021" loc="13–15"/>. However, even as we see more inclusion of Black feminist 
               scholarship in the digital humanities, a few areas remain where the Black digital humanities could be expanded.

          <head>To the Future: Building Black Queer and Femme Digital Praxis</head>
            <p>In their essay titled <title rend="quotes">Black Digital Humanities for the Rising Generation</title>, Alanna Prince and 
               Cara Marta Messina argue that the field's radical politics of inclusivity are fundamental and that citational practices 
               are crucial <ptr target="#prince_etal2022" loc="1–2"/>. In my work, this means citing scholars like Kara Keeling and 
               Shaka McGlotten, who engage in queer politics when writing about digital platforms, performance, and political activism. 
               Scholars in Black queer studies have produced a range of materials, including books, essays, and artwork, that explore the intersections 
               of race, gender, and sexuality. By citing more of this work, we can develop the lineage of Black cyberfeminism toward the digital praxis 
               of Black queer and femme communities.
            </p>
            <p>Specifically, Kara Keeling's article <title rend="quotes">Queer OS</title> draws on the same lineage of new media scholars 
               that launched #transformDH and the critical turn in digital humanities. For Keeling, queer OS disrupts traditional systems, 
               from new and emerging media to academic disciplines, by using computational tools and technologies to subvert power dynamics and the 
               norms of control <ptr target="#keeling2014" loc="152–154"/>. In this sense, queer OS is a theory, method, and framework for doing artistic 
               or academic work that has always existed within fields like film and media studies and the digital humanities. Queer OS is not only a 
               way to <quote rend="inline">help nuance understandings of queer, gender, and technology</quote>. Keeling also references 
               Wendy Chun's and Beth Coleman's writing on <quote rend="inline">race as technology</quote> to think through 
               how queer OS can be viewed as intersectional and interdisciplinary <ptr target="#keeling2014" loc="155–156"/>. Within the Black digital 
               humanities, I view queer OS as a framework that can be used to demonstrate how to incorporate the intersections of race, gender, and 
               sexuality into the study of technology and digital culture and the development of more diverse and inclusive scholarship. By outlining 
               a way to apply the strategies of LGBTQIA+ communities and queer theory to platforms and operating systems, Keeling also uses 
               queer OS as a reading practice that traces the queering of scholarly texts (and fields) over time.
            </p>
            <p>Like version control in Git, utilizing queer OS allows the user to save different copies or versions of the same project, thereby showing 
               how theory develops over time. In the university setting, version control is also about doing your due diligence; it is the archive, 
               the history, or the record of how things were done in the past. Therefore, queer OS helps answer the question of who was involved in 
               completing specific projects and publications by identifying current projects in process and past projects that should be replicated or 
               joined together. By taking on these debates in the Black digital humanities, I use this essay to outline the many versions of the field 
               that have developed over time. From a Black queer and femme perspective, this means noting the spaces where the field leans towards 
               inclusion and diversity and citing the projects and people that should have more visibility.
            </p>
            <p>Additionally, there are many ways in which #BlackDH scholarship always already operates through a queer and femme digital praxis. In 
               contrast to a radical politics of inclusivity, in the article <quote rend="inline">Between Butch/Femme: On the Performance of Race, 
               Gender, and Sexuality in a YouTube Web Series</quote>, I write about what Roderick Ferguson describes as the 
               <quote rend="inline">radical politics of invisibility</quote> that come with queer and femme representations of gender and sexuality 
               <ptr target="#day2018" loc="271"/>. In many ways, Black queer and femme communities are hidden in plain sight within online and offline 
               spaces through their unique uses of language and the reliance on shared recognition, witnessing, and standpoint epistemologies to 
               understand who is and is not included within the community.
            </p>
            <p>This understanding of Black queer and femme politics is also articulated in the book <title rend="italic">The Witch's Flight</title>, 
               where Kara Keeling thinks through the uses of community-based epistemologies by asking: <quote rend="block">How can 
               knowledge be forged and shared without being detected by those with the power to prevent that knowledge from exerting a counter-hegemonic 
               force? In what ways are subjugated knowledge produced, and how do they survive attempts to incorporate them into dominant regimes of 
               knowledge and their modes of production? <ptr target="#keeling2007" loc="7"/></quote> While many scholars have seen the invisibility of 
               Black digital humanities as a problem to be solved within the field, there is also radical potential that comes with being hidden in 
               plain sight within multiple fields, disciplines, and digital projects. For the Black digital humanities in particular, adopting a Black 
               queer and femme digital praxis means exercising a politics of invisibility that can critique the center of digital humanities scholarship 
               from the margins while continuing to build a field that centers itself. This <q>calling out</q> and <q>calling in</q> of the larger 
               digital humanities field (and even Black studies) can also be likened to the Black queer and femme praxis of reading and throwing 
               shade.
            </p>
            <p>In the essay <title rend="quotes">Black Data</title>, Shaka McGlotten defines reading and throwing shade as 
               <quote rend="inline">interpretive and performative black queer practices</quote> <ptr target="#mcglotten2016" loc="279"/>. Within 
               digital spaces, many Black queer and trans folx use the practice of reading to banter with each other and critique societal structures 
               that uphold belief systems that oppress the community. This includes but is not limited to racism, sexism, homophobia, transphobia, 
               ableism, classism, xenophobia, and kink-shaming. Additionally, reading can be general in its directive or aimed at a specific person who 
               has offended the community. Throwing shade can also be viewed as critiquing the corporate and neocolonial norms of digital media platforms 
               or academic institutions.
            </p>
            <p>Both online and offline, a read can be as simple as stating the obvious about someone's appearance or activities, while throwing shade 
               often takes the form of a well-timed insult or quick come-back. Therefore, reading and throwing shade can be viewed as a Black queer and 
               femme digital praxis that offers Black digital humanities scholarship the tools to call out what McGlotten calls the 
               <quote rend="inline">defacement, opacity, and encryption</quote> of technological and institutional systems 
               <ptr target="#mcglotten2016" loc="279"/>. Engaging in a Black queer and femme digital praxis aligns with important principles of Black 
               digital humaninities, including a focus on connecting the community, fostering recognition, and experiencing pleasure while engaging in 
               activism or organizing, and raising awareness through public critique.
            </p>
            <p>Consequently, I use this article to raise awareness about where the Black digital humanities come from and what a more intersectional 
               #BlackDH can be. While there is already a significant body of research on #BlackDH, I started this article by examining canonical digital 
               humanities literature to show how the lack of intersectional scholarship in the larger field led to #transformDH and the recognition 
               and development of Black digital humanities across various disciplines. However, instead of viewing Black digital humanities as existing 
               on the fringes of DH scholarship, we should recognize that it has found ways to represent and acknowledge its community through digital 
               praxis, such as conferences, curation, and hashtags like #BlackDH.
            </p>
            <p>As this outline of the crucial moments in the development of the Black digital humanities has shown, the field continues to receive 
               recognition both within and outside the digital humanities. By analyzing different definitions and debates in #BlackDH, it is evident that 
               it is a field that encompasses the interdisciplinary nature of Black studies and the methodological prowess of digital humanities. 
               Therefore, the Black digital humanities contribute significantly to both Black studies and digital humanities by expanding the 
               possibilities of both fields and promoting more significant investment in data and information science. As a transformative assemblage 
               of critical work, the Black digital humanities will continue growing and spreading through collaboration, scholarship, pedagogy, and 
               social networks.
