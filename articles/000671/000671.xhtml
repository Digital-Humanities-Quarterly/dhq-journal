                     a project is “done” (<a href="#kirschenbaum2009">Kirschenbaum 2009</a>). But DH still has a problem when it comes to
                     project resiliency. As Constance Crompton points out in her contribution to this
                     issue, DH grant funding is disproportionately awarded to new and shiny digital
                     technologies and tools rather than to disciplinary scholarship implemented and
                     published with standard digital tools. Almost no funding is available for
                     maintenance, remediation, upgrading, and remaking, even though technological
                     frameworks will have changed considerably in a five-year funding cycle. The
                     result is a huge maintenance burden for project leads and developers (Holmes
                     &amp; Takeda in this issue) and/or a hosting and storage problem for
                     institutions (Cummings in this issue). </div>

                     practitioners to create accessible, stable, long-lasting resources in the
                     humanities. Unusually for DH, the Endings Project was initiated by developers
                     (see Holmes &amp; Takeda in this issue). It brings together digital humanists
                     and librarians because, as Matthew Kirschenbaum has argued, “Digital humanists need the long-term perspective on data
                     that archivists have”
                      [<a class="ref" href="#kirschenbaum2013">Kirschenbaum 2013</a>]. The
                     Endings team’s HCMC developers (all of them humanists by their first training)

                     facilitating a long-term conversation between the three constituencies
                     responsible for the intellectual generation, building, and long-term

                     200 digital humanities projects since the 1990s. Its history, as described in
                     Holmes &amp; Takeda, clearly shows the problems inherent in current approaches
                     to digital edition projects, particularly projects with short-term or sporadic
                     grant funding. The growing maintenance burden facing the HCMC was ultimately
                     unsustainable, and Project Endings was conceived and convened to address this
                     problem. </div>

                     to achieve their final milestone, what constitutes a good ending, and where best

                  <div class="ptext" id="p5">The Earl of Essex was said to have put his arguments to Queen Elizabeth in sonnet
                     form ([<a class="ref" href="#wotton1672">Wotton 1672</a>, 165]). While
                     sonnets did not save the earl’s neck, we do believe that the answer to the
                     question of how to create long-term, accessible resources is found in
                     cultivating cultures of constraint. We have phrases like “scope creep” and “feature creep” to
                     describe the near-irresistible temptations to act on every good idea a project
                     member may have, but we may also introduce the term “platform creep” to describe easy-to-deploy platforms that facilitate
                     rapid deployment of a new project, but incur technical debt leading to
                     inevitable obsolescence. Project leads, at the end of these types of projects,
                     are often surprised when their institutional library or archive is unable to
                     preserve the bespoke software stack they’ve cobbled together. Instead of trying
                     to preserve what we accidentally made, we should be trying to make what can be
                     preserved. </div>

                     so that developer time can be invested in newer projects coming in. We learned
                     quickly that a “simple” security update could render sites unreadable
                     necessitating constant tending and time. The need for action within very strict
                     constraints (time and funding) forced us to be creative to serve our users. </div>

                  <div class="ptext" id="p7">There are unspoken constraints in the library, as well. Space and human resources
                     force librarians and archivists to make hard decisions on what stays and what
                     goes – weeding the stacks of unused material to make room for new books is one
                     of the less understood aspects of librarians’ jobs. Recently, a member of the
                     Humanist List-Serv asked why librarians can’t preserve digital projects as they
                     do books. It seems like a reasonable request at first glance, but when one
                     considers the vast number of bespoke DH projects that will require continual
                     software updates and rewrites in order to keep running, it quickly becomes an
                     unmanageable task — even with strong documentation created by the project (and
                     good documentation also tends to be something we run out of time to do).
                     Although libraries and archives can’t fire up hundreds or thousands of Wordpress
                     and Drupal sites, they can, certainly, run a server on which flat sites can be
                     stored, accessed, and preserved. That is not a problem. In this way, limitations
                     need to be the drivers of innovation and the DH community should see
                     “constraint” as an admirable feature of a project since it will give
                     the project the best chance of survival. As a community, we need to adopt
                     constraint as an aesthetic, and make it a part of “the
                     stories we tell,” a phrase Claire Battershill explores in this issue,

                     met to describe their work, share their institutional vantage point, and learn

                     deconstructed erroneous assumptions about the roles of our institutional
                     colleagues. For example, the Library’s position on archiving was effectively
                     invisible to researchers and developers; the web subdomain of a project
                     (mapoflondon.uvic.ca, for example) seemed self-evidently crucial to researchers
                     as an extension of the project’s title and “brand,” while to the Library it
                     seemed obvious that the subdomain didn’t matter at all and that an archived
                     project should be delivered through a library-specific domain. </div>

                     surprising: most projects faced exactly the same sorts of problems and

                     host institutions varied widely. From the 125 survey respondents, we identified

                  <div class="ptext" id="p11">We begin with a pair of papers that address two of the key problems in foreseeing
                     an ending to a digital project. In “The Stories We
                     Tell,” Claire Battershill addresses our very human reluctance to
                     imagine our own projects coming to an end. She proposes that if we think about
                     DH projects “in a literary sense, we can analyze and read
                     digital projects as the creative and multifaceted texts that they are and
                     become. We can perhaps approach them with intention and care not only as
                     technical artifacts but also as works that we’ve made, often along with a
                     number of collaborators.” Projects begin in “promise, potential, and excitement”; despite challenges along the
                     way, we keep projects going because the project becomes intrinsic to our purpose
                     and definition, especially for the many digital humanists in precarious
                     employment. Resolving disciplinary and other inequities would go a long way
                     towards helping projects reach their end, she argues, because a team in stable
                     institutional positions may keep collaborating on other projects, large or
                     small. Constance Crompton points out the ways in which funding structures that
                     reward innovation have discouraged sustainable, replicable practices until the
                     “recent turn to sustainability, signalled by the rise of
                     data management plans and data deposit requirements.” Given the
                     self-replicating nature of DH practices through the apprenticeship model whereby
                     students work on large projects, mentorship will be a crucial factor in breaking
                     the cycle of unsustainable, boutique project building. </div>

                        Godwin’s Diary</cite>. Both projects were severely endangered by the lack
                     of legacy planning. When key personnel are lost, and a project has no champion
                     at its host institution, the consequences can be disastrous, especially when the
                     project depends on a technical framework which is not part of the institution’s
                     core infrastructure. Both of these projects would have been completely lost
                     without Cummings’s persistent intervention.</div>

                  <div class="ptext" id="p13">In telling two digital disaster stories, Sara Diamond reminds us that even the
                     most important and socially significant projects are subject to institutional
                     changes, career moves, and shifting priorities. The Banff New Media Institute
                     was deaccessioned after a leadership change, resulting in the overnight
                     disappearance of a vast archive of Indigenous art and history. The Daniel
                     Langlois Foundation archive survived only because of the determined efforts of
                     Jean Gagnon, on whose good will the project is still worryingly dependent.
                     Diamond’s own fonds and sub-collections have been built with the lessons of
                     these two experiences in mind. Ultimately, Diamond suggests that “institutions, creators of archives and their users all bear
                     responsibility for the protection and continuity” of those
                     archives.</div>

                  <div class="ptext" id="p14">Nick Thieberger’s paper, on the monumental PARADISEC project, describes an
                     attempt to thwart the forces of entropy on a massive scale. PARADISEC has
                     rescued over 14,000 hours of field audio tape recordings representing over 1200
                     languages from the Pacific Region, and is hosting them in a public archive, as
                     well as attempting to return them in accessible format to the originating
                     Indigenous communities. This enormous project is itself facing resiliency
                     issues, since it has no stable funding and depends on a small team of dedicated
                     researchers, reminding us that the process of data rescue and retrieval may be
                     cyclical and repetitive without reliable commitments to long-term archiving. </div>

                  <div class="ptext" id="p15">Like Battershill, Jessica Otis is concerned with deconstructing narratives — in
                     this case the funding narratives that suggest, erroneously, that DH projects are
                     either “cash cows” bringing money into the
                     institution via grants or “free” because of donated
                     scholarly labor. Having shown the hidden costs of project maintenance, Otis
                     discusses the prospects of obtaining long-term funding to sustain a project
                     beyond its initial grant-funding, the availability of hard-funded resources from
                     the institution, and the practical realism required to retool projects to fit
                     into sustainable long-term funding models. </div>

                  <div class="ptext" id="p16">There is a traditional assumption that what matters about a digital project is
                     its “data” (however we might define that), rather than its web interface,
                     which is considered ephemeral. However, every session at the symposium touched
                     on the issue of interface, arguably the most recognizable and least preservable
                     part of a digital project. Preserving the look and feel of web-based digital
                     projects continues to be a challenge. Symposium attendees discussed the
                     possibility of doing video captures of website tours and archiving video along
                     with a digital project’s data. Diamond points to emulation as a preservation
                     strategy, and we can undoubtedly learn much from the work of electronic
                     literature scholars as well. Emulation is expensive in terms of hardware,
                     software, and maintenance, and perhaps only works like those described by
                     Diamond will merit such preservation. </div>

                     Takeda, as Endings team members and co-hosts of the symposium, shared their
                     ideas in the discussion. They approach the practical issues of project
                     resiliency from a technical point of view. Their role on the Endings team was to
                     develop the detailed guidelines and recommended practices that would govern the
                     rewriting of many HCMC projects as pure static websites, and then to put the
                     guidelines into practice, rebuilding a dozen or so existing HCMC projects in
                     Endings-compliant form. Along the way, they developed diagnostic tools and an
                     entirely static search engine that can be deployed for any static digital
                     edition. </div>

                     authors were not presenters at our symposium, but their paper is an apt
                     counterpoint to the other work on project resiliency. They examine not the
                     reliability of individual project data and outputs, but the larger web of
                     scholarly referencing within which they live. Their research looks at citations
                     of digital resources from articles in <cite class="title italic">DHQ</cite> itself,
                     to see not just whether links still function, but also whether the resources to

                  <div class="ptext" id="p19">Sometimes things are meant to be ephemeral: there is ephemeral employment and
                     there are ephemeral products of scholarship, which is fine as long as
                     ephemerality is intentional. Yet the majority of DH projects find themselves in
                     the unfortunate position of being unintentionally ephemeral. One of the
                     anonymous reviewers of this issue made the point that we shouldn’t have to keep
                     making the point that digital projects need to be more robust and preservable.
                     The reviewer wondered why we are still having to advocate for what they
                     characterized as common knowledge and common sense. Taken together, the essays
                     in this collection show the difficulty of realizing common sense in practice.
                     The roots of this persistent problem are both social and technological. </div>

                     students, colleagues from across campus, and programmers, as well as librarians
                     and archivists. However, each group brings to the table its own cultural norms
                     and presuppositions, and each group works within existing structures of power,
                     funding, and promotion that are frequently at odds with one another.</div>

                     siren song of “easy to deploy,” which is nearly always at odds with
                     long-term survivability. A hastily-concocted Wordpress or Drupal site, although
                     ready for a promotion file — or replaced with the next big project — will be at
                     the mercy of how much time the scholar actually has to commit to regular updates
                     (usual answer: little to none). The programmer may resist the upfront work of
                     setting up a sustainable long-term platform because they are accustomed to
                     working with specific platform stacks and are tempted to fall back on what they
                     already know, or to pick up whatever library or platform is momentarily newest
                     and most interesting; projects built out of such a mindset will be at the mercy
                     of security vulnerabilities, software obsolescence, and personnel changes.
                     Librarians and archivists are constrained by a scarcity economy of space and
                     funding–it is easy to eschew preserving digital projects when you know it will
                     be impossible to maintain them. Although the dream of a “universal library”
                     is a beautiful ideal, it will nonetheless remain a fiction until we choose
                     universal technologies.</div>

                     conversation among faculty, programmers, and librarians/archivists about
                     expectations, abilities, and sustainability that is agreed upon and documented.
                     This step should happen before the first byte is saved to disk. Normally trained
                     to work in solitude, faculty may need to rely on experts beyond their discipline
                     who work at a different pace. Programmers may have to be open to different ways
                     of programming and take the extra time to design for the eventual flattening of
                     sites even if a dynamic site is preferred for the length of the project (which
                     is perfectly fine, assuming there is funding and time for a complete rewrite at
                     the end). Librarians and archivists need to invest in people, services, and
                     technologies to sustain flat websites — which could simply be a server that is
                     part of the libraries’ long-term preservation plan. As this issue was being
                     created, the <cite class="title italic"><a href="https://graves.uvic.ca" onclick="window.open('https://graves.uvic.ca'); return false" class="ref">Diary of

                     at UVic Libraries, a process which was possible only because the site is Endings
                     compliant. UVic Libraries is committing to preserving flattened,
                     Endings-compliant sites as part of its preservation activities. It has taken
                     some time to reach this point and the process has involved stakeholders from
                     across the institution (Systems, Metadata, Digital Scholarship, and the
                     University Librarian's Office), but we’re here. Hosting a server for static
                     sites is eminently achievable for most university libraries. With collaboration
                     comes compromise in the name of long-term access and discoverability. Everyone
                     on the team needs to understand the needs and limitations of the others, while
                     also mutually agreeing to Endings Principles. </div>

                     consider when starting your project. Moreover, each DH project exists within a
