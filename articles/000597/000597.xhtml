                  <p>“Humanities Collaboration and Research Practices: Exploring
                     Scholarship in the Global Midwest” was funded by a Humanities Without Walls
                     (HWW) Global Midwest award to explore the community of practice engaged in the HWW
                     Global Midwest initiative. Led by Harriett Green, then at the University of Illinois
                     of Urbana-Champaign and Angela Courtney from Indiana University Bloomington, the
                     “Humanities Collaboration and Research Practices”
                     project (hereafter referred to as HCRP) examined the collaborative research practices
                     of HWW Global Midwest awardees to understand how humanities research happens at the
                     level of practice, process, and collaboration. The project team conducted
                     semi-structured interviews between fall 2015 through spring 2016 with twenty-eight
                     researchers who participated in projects funded by the first round of HWW Global
                     Midwest awards. Participants were asked about the aims of their collaborative
                     projects, the processes for developing their collaborations, the types of resources
                     used to support collaboration and project management (and whether additional
                     resources are required), the challenges they encountered, data sharing practices,
                     and
                     how their research approaches and methodologies were influenced by engaging in
                     collaborative research. What emerges from these interviews is a rich portrait of the
                     ongoing evolution of collaborative humanities research and its social and
                     intellectual benefits, both actual and still potential, as well as indications of
                     the
                     institutional and cross-institutional support and development needed to realize that

                     them to advance education and research in the humanities.” The two core HWW initiatives
                     were a series of pre-doctoral workshops for scholars in the humanities interested
                     in
                     exploring alternative academic (alt-ac) career paths and a competitive RFP to fund
                     multi-institutional collaborative teams to conduct projects that explore grand research
                     challenges. The first grand research challenge invited scholars to submit proposals
                     for
                     research projects related to the theme of the “Global Midwest.” The first round of
                     funding awarded $727,000 to fourteen projects to be completed by the end of 2016.

                     in
                     the digital humanities and keenly aware that these were intersecting areas of inquiry.
                     The goal of this inquiry was to help humanities scholars to understand what
                     sociotechnical questions should be addressed in formulating and executing collaborative
                     projects and to increase institutional awareness about what kinds of supporting

                     new to the technologies that enabled that collaboration and self-identified digital

                     support and development needed to realize that potential. The study also suggests
                     a
                     number of questions that might be best addressed in the formative stage of collaborative
                     projects. Humanities scholars new to collaboration need to be aware of issues of
                     assigning credit, of project and budget management and communication of forms and
                     formats for sharing both work in progress and results, as well as navigating the
                     cultures of different disciplines and disciplinary perspectives. Those working in
                     the
                     digital humanities are often accustomed to collaborative work and team dynamics, but
                     may
                     not have fully-articulated the challenges posed by that work. Self-consciously engaging
                     in these questions when embarking upon collaborative projects will help ensure both
                     the

                     groundbreaking report on cyberinfrastructure for the social sciences and humanities
                     that made key recommendations for treating cyberinfrastructure as a strategic
                     priority but also encouraged digital scholarship more generally with an emphasis on
                     collaborative research projects. A few years later, Christine Borgman explored the
                     possibility of “digital scholarship [as] a leading force in humanities research,” and
                     explicitly called upon the humanities community to “invite more social scientists as

                     investigators and eighteen team members, from twelve projects funded in the first
                     round of HWW Global Midwest grant awards. In addition to the HWW Global Midwest
                     project awardees, the team also interviewed one staff member of the overarching
                     Humanities Without Walls administrative team. The initial goal was to interview the
                     principal investigators for each project and at least one project researcher from
                     each collaborating institution. Ultimately, the HCRP team reached one third of the
                     total pool of potential interviewees, falling slightly short of the initial goal.
                     But
                     the team succeeded in ensuring that respondents adequately represented the wide range
                     of disciplinary and institutional affiliations associated with awarded projects, in
                     addition to reaching team members from all but one of the awarded projects (excluding
                     the HCRP project, n = 13). The majority (79 %) of interviewees were tenured faculty,
                     having achieved the rank of associate or full professor at the time of the interview.
                     Only 11 % of interviewees were assistant professors, and the remaining interviewees
                     were in non-tenure-line positions. Compared to the broader pool of HWW Global Midwest
                     awardees, the demographic group most underrepresented among our respondents are
                     non-tenure-line project participants. Tenured professors are slightly
                     overrepresented, due primarily to our emphasis on prioritizing interviews with
                     project PIs (86 % of whom are tenured faculty). While the gender identification among
                     participants is nearly evenly split between male and female (49 and 51 %
                     respectively) across all HWW Global Midwest awardees, interview respondents were
                     slightly skewed. Among respondents, 57 % identified as male and 43 % identified as
                     female.</div>

                     situations that required them to step outside their own research practices, to
                     investigate their methods, and to be open to the unfamiliar techniques of their
                     collaborators. Respondents frequently found themselves working with partners who had
                     widely different research practices, while sharing common topical interests. The
                     researchers coalesced into groups that engaged in sometimes uncomfortable
                     experimentation in order to pursue in-depth research explorations that ranged from
                     movement and dance to water quality in Midwestern communities. The funded projects
                     were diverse in both their areas of investigation and in the people undertaking that
                     investigation. Research topics ranged from Midwest heritage German language speakers
                     to African Immigration and the Production of the Global Futures: Detroit &amp;
                     Berlin, as well as Aggregating Great Lakes Environmental History: Exploring the Value

                     the make-up of the teams of HWW Global Midwest projects. Projects included those that
                     evolved beyond their initial concepts. For example, research that originally focused
                     on waterways came to include “ethnic leisure and labor in the Great Lakes.” Shared
                     interests, rather than common methodologies, frequently brought the groups together.
                     Scholars and performers learnt from each other and sometimes found themselves in
                     unfamiliar territory, such as improvisational dance for one scholar. Teams comprised
                     filmmakers, historians, oral historians, independent scholars, teachers, museum
                     personnel, librarians, and more. </div>

                     interviewees. When reflecting on the nature of collaboration, respondents described
                     their engagement as “a form of collective learning,” “a virtual program,” an effort
                     to “bring people together in a common intellectual space”; and a process that
                     “involves determining shared goals, finding a diversity of resources in the room,
                     figuring out when to work collegially.” </div>

                     study under discussion and those in the ongoing work. Project leaders often mediated
                     group differences. Some projects allocated finding to hire graduate research
                     assistants to provide project management support and found those assistants also
                     mediated the cross-disciplinary encounters, as in one project where the students,
                     in
                     the course of project work, asked “focused questions... to help figure out how their
                     areas of expertise would come together.” Many groups worked very carefully to develop
                     a method of analysis. One respondent noted, “We’ve really been in constant dialogue
                     with a lot of different groups about what the shape of the project should in fact
                     be
                     and what sort of questions we should focus on.” Another respondent characterized a
                     group’s work as having “a lot of cross-fertilization of methodologies … not so much
                     about content” suggesting that disciplinary foci may be less malleable than
                     methodological approaches. An historian explained that s/he started to understand
                     “how a performer uses historical research ...to produce 'amazing things.'” The same
                     respondent’s project planned to employ several methods of analysis, including
                     producing a short film, conducting a series of interviews, investigating precise
                     research questions, and participating in a performance of dancers and scholars
                     rolling around on the floor. This type of development of collaborative methods was
                     described by one group as a process that:</div>

                     emerged throughout the interviews, as participants described shifts in their
                     research, publication, and even pedagogical opportunities. One interviewee described
                     her work as “like a loop. It is not a straight line.” Others placed great value on
                     “working with other scholars,” leading to “discovering different research areas.”
                     Individually, some respondents noted that they now write “stuff that is not very
                     academic, but that is intended for policy makers or community leaders.” Respondents
                     also observed shifts in their pedagogical approaches, as one described: “we might try
                     to produce like a website or something that talked about the curriculum and how we
                     did it.” One respondent shared a visionary project goal to “create a collaborative
                     teaching and education process that would bring in folks from outside the community.”
                     Researchers also sought ways to make more immediate community impacts through shifts
                     in their approaches to research, as scholars applied their humanistic methods “to
                     address important political, cultural and social issues.”</div>

                     popular or specialized tools, the prevailing ethos in the choice and use of
                     research tools is captured in one respondent’s declaration that “we’re using an
                     existing infrastructure and we’re applying it in a quite different way.” </div>

                  <div class="ptext" id="p27">Another important piece of collaborative research infrastructure is storage for
                     backing up and storing recorded data. Several respondents mentioned storage needs
                     for data from interviews and video recordings, especially in regards to archiving
                     and research protocol policies. One participant explained that in order to
                     “protect what we had agreed to for IRB was much, much more complicated than when
                     you’re doing it on your own.” Research policies per the IRB also factored into
                     technical project workflows: Another team became so frustrated with the varying
                     IRB processes among schools that they are trying to create a “kind of gentle IRB”
                     process that would facilitate research and data sharing via “a protocol that could
                     be approved at all of our universities.” </div>

                     their project work: performances, films, websites were among the formats they
                     used, as well as traditional written texts and academic presentations. A number of
                     respondents envisioned using a hybrid of formats to fully express their research
                     products. One respondent described that they intended “to create some kind of
                     interactive map [and] ideally a repository of sounds.” Another discussed their
                     strategies for sharing interview data as a format of dissemination, noting that
                     “we’re still processing the data [and] deciding how to feature it… we’re not
                     tweeting the results or something like that. We made a clear decision, because of
                     the vulnerability of the population, to really wait for the dissemination of the
                     results until we’re able to ensure that we can protect our subjects in how we
                     present the information.” This response also highlights the complex
                     characteristics of humanities data, and the multiplicity of factors that must be
                     considered as part of the processes of data sharing and archiving. The variety of
                     data formats utilized by the interviewed researchers suggests that scholars
                     increasingly may break away from traditional journal articles and monographs to
                     explore the multitude of other ways that their scholarship can be shared.</div>

                     infrastructure that can best support humanities collaboration, the interviews were
                     designed to deepen our collective understanding of the human dimension of such
                     collaboration. In reviewing the interviews in aggregate, the emphasis on the human
                     element of these research partnerships is striking. While those interviewed
                     frequently remarked upon both the challenges and the opportunities of technologically
                     enabled research and communication, they almost inevitably circle back to the role
                     of
                     human actors in the collaborative process. Human action is often called out as an
                     essential component of successful collaborative projects; some member of the team
                     needs to step up and act, whether that’s calling a meeting or writing an important
                     document or any of the myriad actions that advance project work. </div>

                     project team members performed as a sort of social and bureaucratic lubricant,
                     reducing friction between researchers, methods and institutions. Others were
                     connective tissue, creating and sustaining relationships by means as diverse as
                     email, phone calls, budget updates and putting food on dinner tables shared by all

                     and newly developed collaborative teams. Responses among interviewees suggest a
                     difference in motivation for formation of collaborations: Some awardees desired to
                     work with a particular set of colleagues, while others sought to find colleagues as
                     a
                     means of securing funding. The nature of the collaboration varied considerably across
                     the projects of the interviewed respondents. Respondents who were not the principal
                     investigators described collaboration processes in a variety of ways, ranging from
                     full engagement (e.g., a “democracy of participation” and a “real partnership”) to
                     language that suggests removal or distancing (e.g., “I was invited to join into a
                     collaboration which someone else had designed”). Another respondent remarked that
                     different collaborators assumed leadership positions at different times. As discussed
                     above, several respondents also emphasized the interdisciplinary nature of their

                     to devise strategies for managing themselves and their work. The initial round of
                     funding provided a preliminary workshop on forming collaborations and creating
                     proposals. Arising from the findings of the current study as well as the observations
                     and labor of the administrative staff at the Humanities Research Institute at UIUC,
                     later projects have been supported by research workshops, the development of an
                     experts database and explicit guidelines for managing both projects and
                     collaboration. </div>

                     was for project managers — people with responsibilities dedicated to keeping the
                     projects moving forward. In general, there seems to have been a dawning awareness
                     of
                     this need. One participant who had budgeted for a project manager did not immediately
                     find her collaborators to be sympathetic to this budget allocation: “When we were
                     planning this project, that was the big budget item and some of my collaborators were
                     like ‘this is too much for the project manager’ and I was like ‘I think this is a
                     big
                     complicated project and we need somebody who really can deal with logistics’.” The
                     growing sense of need for assistance and dedicated project management engenders a
                     parallel sense of the potential value of and for graduate students participating in
                     the projects. Interviewed respondents repeatedly attested to the value of graduate
                     assistants who shouldered the management burden of the projects or about the
                     (unfulfilled) need for such students.</div>

                     study quickly presented both challenges and opportunities. The HWW initiative clearly
                     presented opportunities for graduate student training and engagement as
                     collaborators, but those opportunities bore with them the possibility of exploiting
                     graduate student labor. Subsequent calls for proposals, including one now open,
                     required formal statements of “plans for graduate partnership and collaboration.” The

                     now include a section on “Graduate Students as Collaborative Partners – Do’s and
                     Don’ts.” Amongst the “do’s” are “include them as equal partners at every step of the
                     planning and execution process — including as co-authors, co-presenters, and/or
                     co-curators.” Don’t: “limit their participation to only tasks that have no
                     intellectual or substantive links to the project work; i.e., do not treat them as
                     go-fers.” </div>

                     explanations, complaints and sometimes confessions. Descriptions of project
                     management strategies were often rueful, even apologetic, in tone: “it’s absolutely
                     [the] Wild West . . . It’s all very loose.” Some scholars had very strong opinions
                     about how project management should work, and argued for “a timeline that’s very
                     clear, weekly updates and regular project meetings.” One participant very
                     self-consciously modeled good project management behavior, as they worked with a
                     research assistant to distribute weekly updates to team members across a number of
                     projects.</div>

                     accelerate success. Along with email and (graduate student) assistance, another
                     common element of successful projects is in-person meetings between remote
                     collaborators. On the negative side, interviewers heard, “One of the challenges is
                     that our project team has not been able to get together and that’s a challenge on
                     many levels,” and, from one team, “nobody has met.” Positive experiences were cited,
                     such as getting together at the coffee shop, and for dinner and going on a field
                     trip. “I really think that the in-person meetings are the most effective. That’s when
                     we’re focused. That’s when we’re engaged. I mean the technology helps, but the
                     in-person interaction is very important to the life of the project.”</div>

                     in order to talk about the project, and preferred face to face conversation. One
                     group had a week-long residency that included dinner meetings, at which they would
                     review what they discovered that day and how it affected their perception of the

                     of both actual and metaphorical coffee machines: Researchers “talk to each other
                     during chance encounters in the search for caffeine and this chitchat can reveal a
                     common interest or excite curiosity. The discovery of affinities fosters personal
                     relationships, which in turn can be helpful if one gets stuck in one’s work or needs

                     to moments of tension within projects. Another respondent observed that “there was a
                     little bit of misunderstanding, and some disagreements […] had to do with who is
                     being acknowledged for what.” These comments and others like them indicate some
                     collective wariness about the readiness of humanities disciplines to acknowledge the
                     legitimacy of co-authored publication. Respondents differed on whether they planned
                     for their collaboration to culminate in co-authored publications. One respondent
                     noted, “I didn’t expect a lot of co-authoring, more of a co-design of the platform.”
                     Another viewed co-authorship as an important “end product collaboration.” While
                     discussion of evaluation for tenure and promotion were present within the interviews,
                     they were not as prevalent as might be expected. One respondent noted that
                     “Humanities have sort of a hard time understanding how to evaluate joint
                     publications.” In an anecdote about a colleague, another respondent described how
                     co-authored publications in a tenure portfolio made the process of evaluation more
                     difficult, but did not ultimately impede the scholar’s promotion. </div>

                  <div class="ptext" id="p42">While the work of this investigation results in a rich set of insights into the
                     grounded practice, challenges and perceived benefits of collaboration in the
                     humanities, this work also clearly reveals that such collaboration is relatively
                     nascent, for scholars, for the institutions that support the and in which they work.
                     Throughout the interviews, respondents were quick to comment on their past
                     experiences with collaboration, or lack thereof. Interviewed researchers who
                     specialized in film and performance cited an existing culture of collaboration within
                     their fields. Others remarked on their prior collaborations as being “unusual.” Still
                     others expressed their own discomfort with the practice of collaboration. One
                     respondent remarked, “what I recall about sitting on the panel in front of the
                     Chicago public to talk about processes of collaboration was that [we] both said we’re
                     terrified.” </div>
                  
                  <div class="counter"><a href="#p43">43</a></div>
                  <div class="ptext" id="p43">In reflecting on implementing and managing collaborative work, one participant summed
                     up the sentiments of many, saying “that was definitely a learning curve for all of
                     us.” A steep learning curve for many, but one that most deemed worth undertaking. One
                     interviewee shared that “this HWW process, which included certain professional
                     development and information for faculty and then the opportunity to work together
                     in
                     teams to develop the proposal, was just priceless.” Perhaps most positively, another
                     respondent reported among their collaborators that “we all agreed that we’d like to
                     do this again.”</div>
                  
                  <div class="counter"><a href="#p44">44</a></div>
                  <div class="ptext" id="p44">Ultimately, the HWW Global Midwest activity seems to have whetted participant
                     interest in collaborative work and spurred many researchers to pursue new interests
                     and work with others both in and outside of their field who they otherwise never
                     would have had met. One participant explained that until she worked on the HWW Global
                     Midwest project, she had never previously considered the opportunity to produce
                     alternative forms of publication outside of those traditional to academia. Another
                     respondent reflected on a bond that formed between herself and others working to
                     produce a public performance: “I thought it was totally unique because...leading
                     these colleagues at different universities definitely deepened my relationship with
                     them.” Another respondent reported that her time doing research on the global Midwest
                     expanded her research interests and led to another regional research opportunity.
                     These reports of these experiences even more strongly underscore how research
                     collaborations can lead to future opportunities for social bonds and deepened
                     professional opportunities. At the same time, they underscore the need for both
                     institutions and individuals to address the challenges posed by collaborative
                     work.</div>

                  <div class="ptext" id="p45">The participants identified many such project challenges with this new model of
                     activity and funding. Reported examples included concerns about the consistency among
                     research group members in following project procedures (e.g., storage locations for
                     project data, research procedures, or use online sharing tools). Many respondents
                     also described major challenges in managing project budgets and personnel
                     administration. Several respondents recalled feelings of frustration about the
                     demanding administrative overhead, which drew time and energy away from been
                     conducting valuable research, highlighting the challenge of coordinating review by
                     multiple IRBs, and having “to coordinate financial arrangements between 3
                     institutions, which are not necessarily used to doing this together.” They also
                     pointed out personnel challenges such as barriers to hiring and funding graduate
                     assistance with their research: Examples of problems and challenges included graduate
                     students’ inability to pay for costly research expenses upfront, and researchers
                     being limited in how much student assistance they had due to students’ limitations
                     on
                     contracted work hours. Other interviewees expressed difficulties collaborating across
                     universities in terms of research protocols, budgets, and policies.</div>
                  
                  <div class="counter"><a href="#p46">46</a></div>
                  <div class="ptext" id="p46">The participants also highlighted some positive models of institutional support for
                     effective project planning and organization, specifically the workshops held at
                     Michigan State “where you could prototype your proposals, you get feedback on your
                     proposals from peers, where you were given presentations by people from outside the
                     university about collaborating with communities, so it’s in a sense, professional
                     development.” Such support for professional development may be one of the ways in
                     which academic institutions can respond to the needs of humanities scholars and to
                     recommendations such as those that emerged at the summit.</div>
                  
                  <div class="counter"><a href="#p47">47</a></div>
                  <div class="ptext" id="p47">Multiple respondents discussed the goal of sustaining collaborative relationships
                     in
                     their project beyond the grant period. The most common approach that respondents
                     pursued was to develop follow-on proposals for financial support from other granting
                     agencies. Where sustaining the outcomes of the project supersedes the continuing
                     collaborative relationship, an alternate approach frequently cited by respondents
                     was
                     to embed project materials in courses. Perhaps the most exciting form of
                     sustainability is respondents’ openness to future collaboration, often stemming from
                     the original HWW Global Midwest projects. </div>
                  
                  <div class="counter"><a href="#p48">48</a></div>
                  <div class="ptext" id="p48">If we are to encourage and support such continuing collaboration, it is clear that
                     there is work to do in developing institutional and, perhaps more importantly,
                     interinstitutional structures of policy, managed relationships and technical support
                     that will maximize the scholarly outcomes of humanities collaboration. There is also
                     a need for a broad swath of research to identify the most effective practices and
                     strategic investments to enable those outcomes and to exploit them most fully.
                     Bendix, Bizer and Noyes assert that “the social framework of interdisciplinary
                     research can be described, planned for and cultivated” [<a class="ref" href="#bendix2017">Bendix, Bizer, and Notes 2017</a>, ix], and
                     there are many questions to ask of those interdisciplinary researchers and many they
                     should ask of themselves.</div>

                  <div class="ptext" id="p49">The work of understanding and building a culture of humanities collaboration has
                     already progressed beyond its state at the time of this study. HWW awarded a second
                     round of funding for ten projects addressing the theme of the global Midwest in 2016.
                     These projects are the work of scholars from eight academic institutions and several
                     of the projects also engage non-academic collaborators such as journalists and
                     artists. In March of 2016, the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation awarded a $4.2 million
                     grant to the Illinois Program for Research in the Humanities at the University of
                     Illinois at Urbana-Champaign to support the work of the <a href="http://www.humanitieswithoutwalls.illinois.edu/news.html" onclick="window.open('http://www.humanitieswithoutwalls.illinois.edu/news.html'); return false" class="ref">Humanities Without Walls
                        consortium</a> to “leverage the strengths of multiple distinctive campuses and create
                     new avenues for collaborative research, teaching, and the production of scholarship
                     in the humanities, forging and sustaining areas of inquiry that cannot be created
                     or
                     maintained without cross-institutional cooperation.” This second award
                     from the foundation has funded fourteen research projects addressing a grand
                     challenge: “what is the work of the humanities in a changing climate?” The 2016 award
                     also includes funding for an extension and expansion of the work discussed in this
                     article. That work is currently in its early stages, and its investigators can
                     anecdotally report than many of the challenges to collaboration remain, but that
                     there also seems to be an increasing ease with collaboration amongst the humanities
                     scholars concerned and an increasing eagerness to engage in such work. If the
                     perception of such an ease is substantiated by continuing data collection, it marks
                     a
                     considerable evolution from the “terrified” scholars of 2015.</div>

                  <div class="ptext" id="p50">In the time that this article was under review and revision, interest in
                     collaboration in the humanities had become so well-established that the National
                     Endowment for the Humanities <a href="https://www.neh.gov/sites/default/files/inline-files/Collaborative%20Research%20Notice%20of%20Funding%20Opportunity%202020.pdf" onclick="window.open('https://www.neh.gov/sites/default/files/inline-files/Collaborative%20Research%20Notice%20of%20Funding%20Opportunity%202020.pdf'); return false" class="ref">announced funding opportunities</a> specifically “to support
                     groups of two or more scholars seeking to increase humanistic knowledge through
                     convenings, research, manuscript preparation for collaborative publications, and the
                     creation of scholarly digital projects.”
                     Of course, in this time, there has been another significant development in scholarly
                     collaboration of all kinds and disciplines. The global pandemic of 2020-2021 prompted
                     perforce remote collaboration, leading many who had formerly been disinclined to
                     engage with collaborative tools and technologies to embrace and sometimes master
                     those tools and technologies. This has a great deal of impact upon the work ahead.
                     Future research upon humanities collaboration will need to investigate and assess
                     how
                     collaborative work has been changed and shaped by the lessons of Covid and to ask

                     striking that at the time of the final edits on this manuscript, in 2021, we
                     cannot help but notice that Zoom, the pandemic-induced dominant remote
                     communication and collaboration tool is not included in the inventory of tools.
                     At the time of this study, Zoom was only emergent (it was mentioned by one
                     respondent as looking promising). Clearly, there is new work ahead
                     investigating the impact of Zoom on humanities collaboration and research
                     practices.</span></div>
