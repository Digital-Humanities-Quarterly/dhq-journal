               (HWW) Global Midwest award to explore the community of practice engaged in the HWW
               Global Midwest initiative. Led by Harriett Green, then at the University of Illinois
               of Urbana-Champaign and Angela Courtney from Indiana University Bloomington, the

               project (hereafter referred to as HCRP) examined the collaborative research practices
               of HWW Global Midwest awardees to understand how humanities research happens at the
               level of practice, process, and collaboration. The project team conducted
               semi-structured interviews between fall 2015 through spring 2016 with twenty-eight
               researchers who participated in projects funded by the first round of HWW Global
               Midwest awards. Participants were asked about the aims of their collaborative
               projects, the processes for developing their collaborations, the types of resources
               used to support collaboration and project management (and whether additional
               resources are required), the challenges they encountered, data sharing practices, and
               how their research approaches and methodologies were influenced by engaging in
               collaborative research. What emerges from these interviews is a rich portrait of the
               ongoing evolution of collaborative humanities research and its social and
               intellectual benefits, both actual and still potential, as well as indications of the

            <p><ref target="http://www.humanitieswithoutwalls.illinois.edu/">Humanities Without
                  Walls</ref> (HWW) is a consortium that links the humanities centers at fifteen
               research universities throughout the Midwest. Informed in part by the decade-long
               work of the <ref target="http://www.syracusehumanities.org/mellon/">Central New York
                  Humanities Corridor</ref>, HWW was first conceived in 2012, and in 2014 the
               consortium was awarded $3,000,000 from the Andrew W. Mellon foundation to launch
                  <quote rend="inline">a set of innovative and experimental initiatives enabling
                  them to advance education and research in the humanities.</quote> The two core HWW
               initiatives were a series of pre-doctoral workshops for scholars in the humanities
               interested in exploring alternative academic (alt-ac) career paths and a competitive
               RFP to fund multi-institutional collaborative teams to conduct projects that explore
               grand research challenges. The first grand research challenge invited scholars to
               submit proposals for research projects related to the theme of the <soCalled>Global
                  Midwest.</soCalled> The first round of funding awarded $727,000 to fourteen
               projects to be completed by the end of 2016. </p>
            <p>At the time of the first call for proposals, a team of librarians and LIS educators
               at the University of Illinois Urbana Champaign and Indiana University had been
               considering questions of how humanities research happens at the level of practice,
               process, and collaboration and were pursuing research in this area under the mantle
               of a project entitled <title rend="quotes">Humanities Collaboration and Research
                  Practices.</title> All members of the team had both humanities and LIS
               backgrounds. They were intent on discovering how libraries and librarians might
               better support humanities collaborations and scholars in the digital humanities and
               keenly aware that these were intersecting areas of inquiry. The goal of this inquiry
               was to help humanities scholars to understand what sociotechnical questions should be
               addressed in formulating and executing collaborative projects and to increase
               institutional awareness about what kinds of supporting infrastructure enables such
               collaborations.</p>
            <p>With its emphasis on multi-institutional, interdisciplinary collaboration, its focus
               on innovative, applied research, and its inclusive approach to recruiting tenure-line
               scholars with varying degrees of experience with digital humanities and with
               collaborative research, the HWW Global Midwest program presented the potential for a
               rich and highly refined set of research cases for the HCRP project to explore the
               evolving nature of humanities research.<note>

               University Bloomington, the <title rend="quotes">Humanities Collaboration and

               collaborative research practices of HWW Global Midwest awardees. The project team
               conducted semi-structured interviews between fall 2015 and spring 2016 with
               twenty-eight researchers who participated in projects funded by the first round of
               HWW Global Midwest awards. Participants were asked about the aims of their
               collaborative projects, the processes for developing their collaborations, the types
               of resources used to support collaboration and project management (and whether
               additional resources are required), the challenges that they encountered, data
               sharing practices, and how their research approaches and methodologies were
               influenced by engaging in collaborative research. Those who participated in the
               interviews were an intriguing mix of scholars who were new to collaboration and often
               new to the technologies that enabled that collaboration and self-identified digital
               humanists seasoned in thinking about scholarship in terms of team-driven
               projects.</p>
            <p>What emerges from these interviews is a rich portrait of the ongoing evolution of
               collaborative humanities research and its social and intellectual benefits, both
               actual and still potential, as well as indications of the institutional and
               cross-institutional support and development needed to realize that potential. The
               study also suggests a number of questions that might be best addressed in the
               formative stage of collaborative projects. Humanities scholars new to collaboration
               need to be aware of issues of assigning credit, of project and budget management and
               communication of forms and formats for sharing both work in progress and results, as
               well as navigating the cultures of different disciplines and disciplinary
               perspectives. Those working in the digital humanities are often accustomed to
               collaborative work and team dynamics, but may not have fully-articulated the
               challenges posed by that work. Self-consciously engaging in these questions when
               embarking upon collaborative projects will help ensure both the success of those
               projects and the continuing functioning of project teams.</p>

            <head>The literature of humanities collaboration</head>
            <p>Tracking shifts in humanities scholarsâ€™ information seeking and other research
               practices has been a recurring topic of study among social scientists. In the
               twenty-first century, most studies have placed particular emphasis on how information
               behavior changes in digital environments <ptr target="#brockman2001"/>

               <ptr target="#bernardou2010"/>
               <ptr target="#bulger2011"/>. In 2006, the American Council for Learned Societiesâ€™
               Commission on Cyberinfrastructure released a groundbreaking report on
               cyberinfrastructure for the social sciences and humanities that made key
               recommendations for treating cyberinfrastructure as a strategic priority but also
               encouraged digital scholarship more generally with an emphasis on collaborative
               research projects. A few years later, Christine Borgman explored the possibility of
                  <quote rend="inline">digital scholarship [as] a leading force in humanities
                  research,</quote> and explicitly called upon the humanities community to <quote
                  rend="inline">invite more social scientists as research partners</quote> and
                  <quote rend="inline">make themselves available as objects of study</quote>
               <ptr target="#borgman2009"/>. Harley et all (2010) conducted intensive investigation
               into <title rend="quotes">Assessing the Future Landscape of Scholarly Communication:
                  An Exploration of Faculty Values and Needs in Seven Disciplines,</title> including
               humanistic disciplines (history and archaeology). Concurrently, studies of
               collaboration among scholars engaged in the digital humanities and its impact on
               humanities scholarship began to proliferate <ptr target="#siemens2009"/>
               <ptr target="#siemens2011"/>
               <ptr target="#deegan2012"/>. </p>
            <p>With increased attention to scholarly collaboration in the digital humanities,
               further themes emerged in community discussion around credit and authorship <ptr
                  target="#nowviskie2011"/>
               <ptr target="#nowviskie2012"/>, the relationship between collaboration and
               infrastructure <ptr target="#edmond2015"/>, and the role of project management for
               alternative academics and other scholars in the humanities <ptr target="#leon2011"/>.
               While the majority of these social scientific studies e employ qualitative methods,
               quantitative methods have also been employed to study collaboration networks in terms
               of project membership and co-authorship <ptr target="#ossenblok2014"/>. In the vein
               of these previous studies, the aim of the HCRP project was to explore the evolving
               nature of humanities research. </p>
         </div>
         <div>
            <head>Methods and demographics</head>
            <p>In support of that exploration, the HCRP project examined the HWW community through
               qualitative interviews with Global Midwest awardees. The HWW Global Midwest project
               awardees comprise a cohort of humanists well situated to reflect upon how
               collaborative and experimental research initiatives affect their research practices
               and requirements, scholarly communication throughout the research process, and final
               research outcomes.</p>
            <p>The project team<note> Harriett Green, PI, Angela Courtney, Maria Bonn, Megan
                  Senseney, Nicholae Cline </note> conducted semi-structured interviews between fall
               2015 through spring 2016 primarily by telephone and Skype with twenty-eight
               researchers who participated in projects funded by the first round of HWW Global
               Midwest awards. The interview protocol was reviewed and approved by IRB at UIUC.
               Participants were guaranteed anonymity and that quotations would not be attributed
               without explicit permission.</p>
            <p>The interviews lasted between thirty minutes and an hour, and participants were asked
               about the aims of their collaborative projects, the processes for developing their
               collaborations, the types of resources used to support collaboration and project
               management (and whether additional resources are required), the challenges they
               encountered, data sharing practices, and how their research approaches and
               methodologies were influenced by engaging in collaborative research. The interviews
               were recorded and transcribed, then coded in ATLAS.ti 7. Preliminary codes were
               developed inductively based on themes identified in the raw transcripts, and each
               transcription was coded multiple times to ensure inter-coder reliability. This study
               applies a qualitative analysis method that expands upon prior studies by <ptr
                  target="#brockman2001"/>
               <ptr target="#palmer2002"/>
               <ptr target="#palmer2005"/>, along with a theoretical grounding in qualitative
               content analysis <ptr target="#corbin2008"/>. </p>
            <p>The research team interviewed twenty-eight project awardees, including nine principal
               investigators and eighteen team members, from twelve projects funded in the first
               round of HWW Global Midwest grant awards. In addition to the HWW Global Midwest
               project awardees, the team also interviewed one staff member of the overarching
               Humanities Without Walls administrative team. The initial goal was to interview the
               principal investigators for each project and at least one project researcher from
               each collaborating institution. Ultimately, the HCRP team reached one third of the
               total pool of potential interviewees, falling slightly short of the initial goal. But
               the team succeeded in ensuring that respondents adequately represented the wide range
               of disciplinary and institutional affiliations associated with awarded projects, in
               addition to reaching team members from all but one of the awarded projects (excluding
               the HCRP project, n = 13). The majority (79 %) of interviewees were tenured faculty,
               having achieved the rank of associate or full professor at the time of the interview.
               Only 11 % of interviewees were assistant professors, and the remaining interviewees
               were in non-tenure-line positions. Compared to the broader pool of HWW Global Midwest
               awardees, the demographic group most underrepresented among our respondents are
               non-tenure-line project participants. Tenured professors are slightly
               overrepresented, due primarily to our emphasis on prioritizing interviews with
               project PIs (86 % of whom are tenured faculty). While the gender identification among
               participants is nearly evenly split between male and female (49 and 51 %
               respectively) across all HWW Global Midwest awardees, interview respondents were
               slightly skewed. Among respondents, 57 % identified as male and 43 % identified as
               female.</p>

            <head>Crossing disciplinary and institutional boundaries</head>
            <p>The interviews revealed that the HWW Global Midwest researchers often encountered
               situations that required them to step outside their own research practices, to
               investigate their methods, and to be open to the unfamiliar techniques of their
               collaborators. Respondents frequently found themselves working with partners who had
               widely different research practices, while sharing common topical interests. The
               researchers coalesced into groups that engaged in sometimes uncomfortable
               experimentation in order to pursue in-depth research explorations that ranged from
               movement and dance to water quality in Midwestern communities. The funded projects
               were diverse in both their areas of investigation and in the people undertaking that
               investigation. Research topics ranged from Midwest heritage German language speakers
               to African Immigration and the Production of the Global Futures: Detroit &amp;
               Berlin, as well as Aggregating Great Lakes Environmental History: Exploring the Value
               of Distributed Digital Archives for Research and Teaching and incubating
               collaborative research through dance performance, to name just a few.<note> For a
                  complete list of funded projects see <ref

            <p>Broad inter- and cross-disciplinary work characterized the research foci as well as
               the make-up of the teams of HWW Global Midwest projects. Projects included those that
               evolved beyond their initial concepts. For example, research that originally focused
               on waterways came to include <quote rend="inline">ethnic leisure and labor in the
                  Great Lakes.</quote> Shared interests, rather than common methodologies,
               frequently brought the groups together. Scholars and performers learnt from each
               other and sometimes found themselves in unfamiliar territory, such as improvisational
               dance for one scholar. Teams comprised filmmakers, historians, oral historians,
               independent scholars, teachers, museum personnel, librarians, and more. </p>
            <p>Interdisciplinary approaches brought surprising discoveries as well as complex
               disagreements that linger beyond the projects. They used new and unfamiliar tools, as
               well as more traditional and familiar methods and approaches. Other teams creatively
               pushed themselves to experiment with approaches beyond their established academic
               milieu. One respondent suggested that the value of this initiative was <quote
                  rend="inline">almost more about the process â€¦ what we would call project- based
                  learning has afforded individual faculty members to do work in the humanities, but
                  stretching it even further, to do collaboration with non-university
                  experts.</quote>

            <head>Changing approaches and changing practices; new research skills for new research
               opportunities</head>
            <p>Collaborative scholarship as an opportunity and a challenge to move out of oneâ€™s
               scholarly comfort zone, was a quality often noted and usually celebrated by the
               interviewees. When reflecting on the nature of collaboration, respondents described
               their engagement as <quote rend="inline">a form of collective learning,</quote>
               <quote rend="inline">a virtual program,</quote> an effort to <quote rend="inline"
                  >bring people together in a common intellectual space</quote>; and a process that
                  <quote rend="inline">involves determining shared goals, finding a diversity of
                  resources in the room, figuring out when to work collegially.</quote>
            </p>
            <p>Methodologies varied greatly within HWW Global Midwest projects, both those in the
               study under discussion and those in the ongoing work. Project leaders often mediated
               group differences. Some projects allocated finding to hire graduate research
               assistants to provide project management support and found those assistants also
               mediated the cross-disciplinary encounters, as in one project where the students, in
               the course of project work, asked <quote rend="inline">focused questions... to help
                  figure out how their areas of expertise would come together.</quote> Many groups
               worked very carefully to develop a method of analysis. One respondent noted, <quote
                  rend="inline">Weâ€™ve really been in constant dialogue with a lot of different
                  groups about what the shape of the project should in fact be and what sort of
                  questions we should focus on.</quote> Another respondent characterized a groupâ€™s
               work as having <quote rend="inline">a lot of cross-fertilization of methodologies â€¦
                  not so much about content</quote> suggesting that disciplinary foci may be less
               malleable than methodological approaches. An historian explained that s/he started to
               understand <quote rend="inline">how a performer uses historical research ...to
                  produce 'amazing things.'</quote> The same respondentâ€™s project planned to employ
               several methods of analysis, including producing a short film, conducting a series of
               interviews, investigating precise research questions, and participating in a
               performance of dancers and scholars rolling around on the floor. This type of
               development of collaborative methods was described by one group as a process
               that:</p>
            <p><quote rend="block">unfolds in an uncertain and, in that sense, an egalitarian manner
                  because no one knows yet what the thing will be. It makes some people anxious. It
                  makes members uncomfortable sometimes, but it has been very productive. You go on
                  an inkling. You go on a hunch and you see where it takes you. That is typical of
                  ethnography, but also, I think, of collaboration, as well.</quote>
            </p>
            <p>These dynamic and educational elements of collaboration influenced how the
               participantsâ€™ research approaches evolved as well. Evidence of shifting approaches
               emerged throughout the interviews, as participants described shifts in their
               research, publication, and even pedagogical opportunities. One interviewee described
               her work as <quote rend="inline">like a loop. It is not a straight line.</quote>
               Others placed great value on <quote rend="inline">working with other
                  scholars,</quote> leading to <quote rend="inline">discovering different research
                  areas.</quote> Individually, some respondents noted that they now write <quote
                  rend="inline">stuff that is not very academic, but that is intended for policy
                  makers or community leaders.</quote> Respondents also observed shifts in their
               pedagogical approaches, as one described: <quote rend="inline">we might try to
                  produce like a website or something that talked about the curriculum and how we
                  did it.</quote> One respondent shared a visionary project goal to <quote
                  rend="inline">create a collaborative teaching and education process that would
                  bring in folks from outside the community.</quote> Researchers also sought ways to
               make more immediate community impacts through shifts in their approaches to research,
               as scholars applied their humanistic methods <quote rend="inline">to address
                  important political, cultural and social issues.</quote></p>
            <p>The importance of community engagement and impact became so apparent in this round of
               funded initiatives, and in projects arising from latter rounds of funding, that the
               most recent call for proposals form the Humanities Without Walls consortium requires
               explicit articulation of methods and strategies for what it terms <title
                  rend="quotes">Reciprocity and Redistribution</title>: </p>
            <p><quote rend="block">Reciprocity and redistribution areÂ methodsÂ for engaging
                  collaborators in genuinely equal and ethical partnerships â€” partnerships that are
                  not one-directional (i.e., only from campus outward) or faculty-centered (i.e.,
                  hierarchical in ways that privilege presumptively white western scholarly

               These strategies aim to challenge the academic status quo by enabling community

               projects; and to be equitably resourced for their time and <ref

            <p>Merging epistemological approaches can enhance the research process, but a difficult
               combination of methods can also fracture research partnerships. Respondents
               appreciated being able to <quote rend="inline">see how each other was
                  thinking,</quote> yet there were also difficulties, such as a <quote rend="inline"
                  >romanticized view of history</quote> that some historians perceived from
               performers in one project bringing together scholars and artists. Another respondent
               noted disagreement with a performance interpretation, but acknowledged it resulted
               from <quote rend="inline">a different leverage on the material.</quote> One
               participant discussed the <quote rend="inline">epistemological difference between

                  constraints were pretty real.</quote>
            </p>
            <p>Overall, respondents had notably positive and optimistic viewpoints overall toward
               their experiences. One respondent noted, <quote rend="inline">Iâ€™m hoping that this
                  project re-centers anthropologyâ€¦ for some sort of reclaiming of what it is and

            <p>Apparent throughout the interviews, both as a result of direct questioning and
               through impromptu comments offered by the interview subjects, was that this
               collaborative work was both technology enabled and technology dependent, from the
               workaday activities of managing to-do lists and task assignments to the projectsâ€™
               aspirations for publication and impact. One respondent observed of the changes in

                  >Itâ€™s stunning that weâ€™re able to do this across these kinds of distances. Itâ€™s a

            <head>Technology for research management: </head>
            <p>Project collaborators communicated both remotely and in person as opportunity arose.
               The most common tool cited for remote collaboration was email. Other frequently cited
               modes of engagement included conference calls (via Skype, Google Hangouts, or
               telephone), as well as file sharing and collaborative authoring tools (via Google
               Drive, Box, and Dropbox). In discussing project management, email was by far the most
               commonly tool. Many interviewees seemed chagrined about their project management
               methods or lack thereof, but one did highlight the HWW Global Midwest process as a
               positive learning experience: <title rend="quotes">I think that my experience with
                  the Humanities Without Walls project and the other project have sort of together
                  kind of pushed me to be more enthusiastic and more diligent in using these online
                  tools for collaboration and sharing work.</title>
            </p>
            <p>Most interviewed HWW Global Midwest research groups used popular file sharing and
               communications software and tools (See table A). A few teams described how they used
               unique platforms, including one group that made use of the digital humanities
               software built for the NINES and 18thConnect projects. But whether they used popular
               or specialized tools, the prevailing ethos in the choice and use of research tools is
               captured in one respondentâ€™s declaration that <quote rend="inline">weâ€™re using an
                  existing infrastructure and weâ€™re applying it in a quite different way.</quote>
            </p>
            <p>Another important piece of collaborative research infrastructure is storage for
               backing up and storing recorded data. Several respondents mentioned storage needs for
               data from interviews and video recordings, especially in regards to archiving and
               research protocol policies. One participant explained that in order to <quote
                  rend="inline">protect what we had agreed to for IRB was much, much more
                  complicated than when youâ€™re doing it on your own.</quote> Research policies per
               the IRB also factored into technical project workflows: Another team became so
               frustrated with the varying IRB processes among schools that they are trying to
               create a <quote rend="inline">kind of gentle IRB</quote> process that would
               facilitate research and data sharing via <quote rend="inline">a protocol that could
                  be approved at all of our universities.</quote>

                     notice that Zoom, the pandemic-induced dominant remote communication and
                     collaboration tool is not included in the inventory of tools. At the time of
                     this study, Zoom was only emergent (it was mentioned by one respondent as
                     looking promising). Clearly, there is new work ahead investigating the impact
                     of Zoom on humanities collaboration and research practices.</note></head>

            <p>Respondents also cited a host of different formats for expressing and sharing their
               project work: performances, films, websites were among the formats they used, as well
               as traditional written texts and academic presentations. A number of respondents
               envisioned using a hybrid of formats to fully express their research products. One
               respondent described that they intended <quote rend="inline">to create some kind of
                  interactive map [and] ideally a repository of sounds.</quote> Another discussed
               their strategies for sharing interview data as a format of dissemination, noting that
                  <quote rend="inline">weâ€™re still processing the data [and] deciding how to feature
                  itâ€¦ weâ€™re not tweeting the results or something like that. We made a clear
                  decision, because of the vulnerability of the population, to really wait for the
                  dissemination of the results until weâ€™re able to ensure that we can protect our
                  subjects in how we present the information.</quote> This response also highlights
               the complex characteristics of humanities data, and the multiplicity of factors that
               must be considered as part of the processes of data sharing and archiving. The
               variety of data formats utilized by the interviewed researchers suggests that
               scholars increasingly may break away from traditional journal articles and monographs
               to explore the multitude of other ways that their scholarship can be shared.</p>

            <head>Collaborative knowledge generation: Humanists need humans </head>
            <p>In addition to seeking to understand the nature of the technological and research
               infrastructure that can best support humanities collaboration, the interviews were
               designed to deepen our collective understanding of the human dimension of such
               collaboration. In reviewing the interviews in aggregate, the emphasis on the human
               element of these research partnerships is striking. While those interviewed
               frequently remarked upon both the challenges and the opportunities of technologically
               enabled research and communication, they almost inevitably circle back to the role of
               human actors in the collaborative process. Human action is often called out as an
               essential component of successful collaborative projects; some member of the team
               needs to step up and act, whether thatâ€™s calling a meeting or writing an important
               document or any of the myriad actions that advance project work. </p>
            <p>The roles of enabling human actors can be broadly defined as grease and glue. Some
               project team members performed as a sort of social and bureaucratic lubricant,
               reducing friction between researchers, methods and institutions. Others were
               connective tissue, creating and sustaining relationships by means as diverse as
               email, phone calls, budget updates and putting food on dinner tables shared by all
               project members.</p>
            <p>Projects selected for HWW Global Midwest awards represent a mixture of pre-existing
               and newly developed collaborative teams. Responses among interviewees suggest a
               difference in motivation for formation of collaborations: Some awardees desired to
               work with a particular set of colleagues, while others sought to find colleagues as a
               means of securing funding. The nature of the collaboration varied considerably across
               the projects of the interviewed respondents. Respondents who were not the principal
               investigators described collaboration processes in a variety of ways, ranging from
               full engagement (e.g., a <q>democracy of participation</q> and a <q>real
                  partnership</q>) to language that suggests removal or distancing (e.g., <quote
                  rend="inline">I was invited to join into a collaboration which someone else had
                  designed</quote>). Another respondent remarked that different collaborators
               assumed leadership positions at different times. As discussed above, several
               respondents also emphasized the interdisciplinary nature of their projects. </p>
            <p>Once these very human humanists had coalesced into collaborative teams, they needed
               to devise strategies for managing themselves and their work. The initial round of
               funding provided a preliminary workshop on forming collaborations and creating
               proposals. Arising from the findings of the current study as well as the observations
               and labor of the administrative staff at the Humanities Research Institute at UIUC,
               later projects have been supported by research workshops, the development of an
               experts database and explicit guidelines for managing both projects and
               collaboration. </p>
            <p>Consideration of tools aside, the need most consistently identified by interviewees
               was for project managers â€” people with responsibilities dedicated to keeping the
               projects moving forward. In general, there seems to have been a dawning awareness of
               this need. One participant who had budgeted for a project manager did not immediately
               find her collaborators to be sympathetic to this budget allocation: <quote
                  rend="inline">When we were planning this project, that was the big budget item and
                  some of my collaborators were like â€˜this is too much for the project managerâ€™ and
                  I was like â€˜I think this is a big complicated project and we need somebody who
                  really can deal with logisticsâ€™.</quote> The growing sense of need for assistance
               and dedicated project management engenders a parallel sense of the potential value of
               and for graduate students participating in the projects. Interviewed respondents
               repeatedly attested to the value of graduate assistants who shouldered the management
               burden of the projects or about the (unfulfilled) need for such students.</p>
            <p>It should be noted that the roles for graduate students identified in the present
               study quickly presented both challenges and opportunities. The HWW initiative clearly
               presented opportunities for graduate student training and engagement as
               collaborators, but those opportunities bore with them the possibility of exploiting
               graduate student labor. Subsequent calls for proposals, including one now open,
               required formal statements of <quote rend="inline">plans for graduate partnership and
                  collaboration.</quote> The supporting materials on the <ref

            </p>
            <p>Questions about project management methods inevitably brought forth voluble
               explanations, complaints and sometimes confessions. Descriptions of project
               management strategies were often rueful, even apologetic, in tone: <quote
                  rend="inline">itâ€™s absolutely [the] Wild West . . . Itâ€™s all very loose.</quote>
               Some scholars had very strong opinions about how project management should work, and
               argued for <quote rend="inline">a timeline thatâ€™s very clear, weekly updates and
                  regular project meetings.</quote> One participant very self-consciously modeled
               good project management behavior, as they worked with a research assistant to
               distribute weekly updates to team members across a number of projects.</p>
            <p>The project teams increasingly recognized the need for human connection to ensure and
               accelerate success. Along with email and (graduate student) assistance, another
               common element of successful projects is in-person meetings between remote
               collaborators. On the negative side, interviewers heard, <quote rend="inline">One of
                  the challenges is that our project team has not been able to get together and
                  thatâ€™s a challenge on many levels,</quote> and, from one team, <quote
                  rend="inline">nobody has met.</quote> Positive experiences were cited, such as
               getting together at the coffee shop, and for dinner and going on a field trip. <quote
                  rend="inline">I really think that the in-person meetings are the most effective.
                  Thatâ€™s when weâ€™re focused. Thatâ€™s when weâ€™re engaged. I mean the technology helps,
                  but the in-person interaction is very important to the life of the
                  project.</quote></p>
            <p>Respondents noted that several groups felt it was important to be in the same place
               in order to talk about the project, and preferred face to face conversation. One
               group had a week-long residency that included dinner meetings, at which they would
               review what they discovered that day and how it affected their perception of the
               Global Midwest. The importance such connection plays in promoting project success
               echoes that explored in a recent book, <title rend="italic">Sustaining
                  Interdisciplinary Collaboration: A Guide for the Academy</title>, whose authors
               call out the importance of both actual and metaphorical coffee machines: Researchers
                  <quote rend="inline">talk to each other during chance encounters in the search for
                  caffeine and this chitchat can reveal a common interest or excite curiosity. The
                  discovery of affinities fosters personal relationships, which in turn can be
                  helpful if one gets stuck in oneâ€™s work or needs technical assistance. These
                  reliable relationships are a stock of social capital</quote>
               <ptr target="#bendix2017" loc="66"/> .</p>
            <p>With the increased human connection promoted by the projects and their shared funding
               came an increased sense of accountability and responsibility towards partners in
               research. As respondents discussed collaborative initiatives, many were mindful of
               the importance of providing appropriate credit and recognition for project partners.
               One respondent noted that <quote rend="inline">for us, the notion of collaboration
                  was built around the idea that both parties would be equally acknowledged.</quote>
            </p>
            <p>Ensuring that contributions are appropriately acknowledged also appears to give rise
               to moments of tension within projects. Another respondent observed that <quote
                  rend="inline">there was a little bit of misunderstanding, and some disagreements
                  [â€¦] had to do with who is being acknowledged for what.</quote> These comments and
               others like them indicate some collective wariness about the readiness of humanities
               disciplines to acknowledge the legitimacy of co-authored publication. Respondents
               differed on whether they planned for their collaboration to culminate in co-authored
               publications. One respondent noted, <quote rend="inline">I didnâ€™t expect a lot of
                  co-authoring, more of a co-design of the platform.</quote> Another viewed
               co-authorship as an important <quote rend="inline">end product collaboration.</quote>
               While discussion of evaluation for tenure and promotion were present within the
               interviews, they were not as prevalent as might be expected. One respondent noted
               that <quote rend="inline">Humanities have sort of a hard time understanding how to
                  evaluate joint publications.</quote> In an anecdote about a colleague, another
               respondent described how co-authored publications in a tenure portfolio made the
               process of evaluation more difficult, but did not ultimately impede the scholarâ€™s
               promotion. </p>

               report and reflected on past efforts to support innovative humanities collaborations.
               In response to that panel and through a dayâ€™s discussion, the questions that were

            <head>The work ahead</head>
            <p>While the work of this investigation results in a rich set of insights into the
               grounded practice, challenges and perceived benefits of collaboration in the
               humanities, this work also clearly reveals that such collaboration is relatively
               nascent, for scholars, for the institutions that support the and in which they work.
               Throughout the interviews, respondents were quick to comment on their past
               experiences with collaboration, or lack thereof. Interviewed researchers who
               specialized in film and performance cited an existing culture of collaboration within
               their fields. Others remarked on their prior collaborations as being <title
                  rend="quotes">unusual.</title> Still others expressed their own discomfort with
               the practice of collaboration. One respondent remarked, <quote rend="inline">what I
                  recall about sitting on the panel in front of the Chicago public to talk about
                  processes of collaboration was that [we] both said weâ€™re terrified.</quote>
            </p>
            <p>In reflecting on implementing and managing collaborative work, one participant summed
               up the sentiments of many, saying <quote rend="inline">that was definitely a learning
                  curve for all of us.</quote> A steep learning curve for many, but one that most
               deemed worth undertaking. One interviewee shared that <quote rend="inline">this HWW
                  process, which included certain professional development and information for
                  faculty and then the opportunity to work together in teams to develop the
                  proposal, was just priceless.</quote> Perhaps most positively, another respondent
               reported among their collaborators that <quote rend="inline">we all agreed that weâ€™d
                  like to do this again.</quote></p>
            <p>Ultimately, the HWW Global Midwest activity seems to have whetted participant
               interest in collaborative work and spurred many researchers to pursue new interests
               and work with others both in and outside of their field who they otherwise never
               would have had met. One participant explained that until she worked on the HWW Global
               Midwest project, she had never previously considered the opportunity to produce
               alternative forms of publication outside of those traditional to academia. Another
               respondent reflected on a bond that formed between herself and others working to
               produce a public performance: <quote rend="inline">I thought it was totally unique
                  because...leading these colleagues at different universities definitely deepened
                  my relationship with them.</quote> Another respondent reported that her time doing
               research on the global Midwest expanded her research interests and led to another
               regional research opportunity. These reports of these experiences even more strongly
               underscore how research collaborations can lead to future opportunities for social
               bonds and deepened professional opportunities. At the same time, they underscore the
               need for both institutions and individuals to address the challenges posed by
               collaborative work.</p>
            <p>The participants identified many such project challenges with this new model of
               activity and funding. Reported examples included concerns about the consistency among
               research group members in following project procedures (e.g., storage locations for
               project data, research procedures, or use online sharing tools). Many respondents
               also described major challenges in managing project budgets and personnel
               administration. Several respondents recalled feelings of frustration about the
               demanding administrative overhead, which drew time and energy away from been
               conducting valuable research, highlighting the challenge of coordinating review by
               multiple IRBs, and having <quote rend="inline">to coordinate financial arrangements
                  between 3 institutions, which are not necessarily used to doing this
                  together.</quote> They also pointed out personnel challenges such as barriers to
               hiring and funding graduate assistance with their research: Examples of problems and
               challenges included graduate studentsâ€™ inability to pay for costly research expenses
               upfront, and researchers being limited in how much student assistance they had due to
               studentsâ€™ limitations on contracted work hours. Other interviewees expressed
               difficulties collaborating across universities in terms of research protocols,
               budgets, and policies.</p>
            <p>The participants also highlighted some positive models of institutional support for
               effective project planning and organization, specifically the workshops held at
               Michigan State <quote rend="inline">where you could prototype your proposals, you get
                  feedback on your proposals from peers, where you were given presentations by
                  people from outside the university about collaborating with communities, so itâ€™s
                  in a sense, professional development.</quote> Such support for professional
               development may be one of the ways in which academic institutions can respond to the
               needs of humanities scholars and to recommendations such as those that emerged at the
               summit.</p>
            <p>Multiple respondents discussed the goal of sustaining collaborative relationships in
               their project beyond the grant period. The most common approach that respondents
               pursued was to develop follow-on proposals for financial support from other granting
               agencies. Where sustaining the outcomes of the project supersedes the continuing
               collaborative relationship, an alternate approach frequently cited by respondents was
               to embed project materials in courses. Perhaps the most exciting form of
               sustainability is respondentsâ€™ openness to future collaboration, often stemming from
               the original HWW Global Midwest projects. </p>
            <p>If we are to encourage and support such continuing collaboration, it is clear that
               there is work to do in developing institutional and, perhaps more importantly,
               interinstitutional structures of policy, managed relationships and technical support
               that will maximize the scholarly outcomes of humanities collaboration. There is also
               a need for a broad swath of research to identify the most effective practices and
               strategic investments to enable those outcomes and to exploit them most fully.
               Bendix, Bizer and Noyes assert that <quote rend="inline">the social framework of
                  interdisciplinary research can be described, planned for and cultivated</quote>
               <ptr target="#bendix2017" loc="ix"/>, and there are many questions to ask of those
               interdisciplinary researchers and many they should ask of themselves.</p>
            <p>The work of understanding and building a culture of humanities collaboration has
               already progressed beyond its state at the time of this study. HWW awarded a second
               round of funding for ten projects addressing the theme of the global Midwest in 2016.
               These projects are the work of scholars from eight academic institutions and several
               of the projects also engage non-academic collaborators such as journalists and
               artists. In March of 2016, the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation awarded a $4.2 million
               grant to the Illinois Program for Research in the Humanities at the University of
               Illinois at Urbana-Champaign to support the work of the <ref

                  Without Walls consortium</ref> to <quote rend="inline">leverage the strengths of
                  multiple distinctive campuses and create new avenues for collaborative research,
                  teaching, and the production of scholarship in the humanities, forging and
                  sustaining areas of inquiry that cannot be created or maintained without
                  cross-institutional cooperation.</quote> This second award from the foundation has
               funded fourteen research projects addressing a grand challenge: <quote rend="inline"
                  >what is the work of the humanities in a changing climate?</quote> The 2016 award
               also includes funding for an extension and expansion of the work discussed in this
               article. That work is currently in its early stages, and its investigators can
               anecdotally report than many of the challenges to collaboration remain, but that
               there also seems to be an increasing ease with collaboration amongst the humanities
               scholars concerned and an increasing eagerness to engage in such work. If the
               perception of such an ease is substantiated by continuing data collection, it marks a
               considerable evolution from the <soCalled>terrified</soCalled> scholars of 2015.</p>
            <p>In the time that this article was under review and revision, interest in
               collaboration in the humanities had become so well-established that the National
               Endowment for the Humanities <ref
                  target="https://www.neh.gov/sites/default/files/inline-files/Collaborative%20Research%20Notice%20of%20Funding%20Opportunity%202020.pdf"
                  >announced funding opportunities</ref> specifically <quote rend="inline">to
                  support groups of two or more scholars seeking to increase humanistic knowledge
                  through convenings, research, manuscript preparation for collaborative
                  publications, and the creation of scholarly digital projects.</quote> Of course,
               in this time, there has been another significant development in scholarly
               collaboration of all kinds and disciplines. The global pandemic of 2020-2021 prompted
               perforce remote collaboration, leading many who had formerly been disinclined to
               engage with collaborative tools and technologies to embrace and sometimes master
               those tools and technologies. This has a great deal of impact upon the work ahead.
               Future research upon humanities collaboration will need to investigate and assess how
               collaborative work has been changed and shaped by the lessons of Covid and to ask
               whether the findings of the present study are relevant in the post-pandemic
               period</p>
