                <p>This article traces the history of Storyspace, the world’s first program for
                    creating, editing and reading hypertext fiction. Storyspace is crucial to the
                    history of hypertext as well as the history of interactive fiction. It argues
                    that Storyspace was built around a topographic metaphor and that it attempts to
                    model human associative memory. The article is based on interviews with key
                    hypertext pioneers as well as documents created at the time.</p>

            <p>Michael Joyce has kept a journal for many years. Before he begins to write, he
                inscribes the first page with an epigram: <q>Still flowing</q>. As anyone who has
                read Joyce’s fictions or critical writing will attest, his work is replete with
                multiple voices and narrative trajectories, a babbling stream of textual overflow
                interrupted at regular intervals by playful, descriptive whorls and eddies. If there
                is a common thread to be drawn between his hyperfictions, his academic writing and
                his novels, then it is this <term>polyglot dialogue</term>, as Robert Coover terms
                it — a lyrical stream of consciousness. Joyce can tell a story. And he has told many
                stories: four books, forty scholarly essays, and at last count (my count), a dozen
                    fictions.<note>Though in many cases the <q>critical</q> works are also fiction,
                    and the <q>books</q> are also critical works.</note> What courses through this
                work is a gentle concern, or even fixation, with how stories are told, with <cit>
                    <quote rend="inline" source="#joyce2004">how we make meaning, as if a
                        caress</quote>
                    <ptr target="#joyce2004" loc="45"/>
                </cit>. The metaphor of water is an appropriate one. Like Ted Nelson, who had his
                first epiphany about the nature of ideas and the connections between them as he
                trailed his hand in the water under his grandfather’s boat, Joyce has long been
                concerned with how to represent a multiplicity of ideas and their swirling
                interrelationships, with how stories change over time. In the essay <title
                    rend="quotes">What I Really Wanted to Do I Thought</title>, about the early
                development of Storyspace, Joyce writes: <quote rend="block" source="#joyce1998"
                    >What I really wanted to do, I discovered, was not merely to move a paragraph
                    from page 265 to page 7 but to do so almost endlessly. I wanted, quite simply,
                    to write a novel that would change in successive readings and to make those
                    changing versions according to the connections that I had for some time
                    naturally discovered in the process of writing and that I wanted my readers to
                    share. <ptr target="#joyce1998" loc="31"/>
                </quote>
            </p>
            <p>That novel, of course, would become <title rend="italic">afternoon</title> , the
                world’s first hypertext fiction <ptr target="#joyce1987"/>. The development of
                Storyspace is, at least in part, the story of Joyce’s quest to find a structure for
                what did not yet exist, or as he wrote in a lengthy document created at the time
                called the Markle Report (see note on sources<note>
                    <p>Historians attach great importance to <q>primary evidence</q> — source
                        material and documents that were created at the time under study. Matthew
                        Kirschenbaum notes in his recent book, <title rend="italic"
                            >Mechanisms</title> (2008), <cit>
                            <quote rend="inline" source="#kirschenbaum2008">The single indespensible
                                source for the early history of Storyspace is Joyce and Bolter’s
                                report to the Markle Foundation, which funded Storyspace for a
                                crucial development year in 1985</quote>

                        </cit>. The copy I will be using here is held at the Michael Joyce Archives
                        at the Harry Ransom Research Centre, dated 1986 (hereafter <title
                            rend="quotes">the Markle Report</title>). The Markle Report was written
                        during the first development cycle for Storyspace, and describes both the
                        research process behind the program and the tool itself as it was used at
                        the time over 60 typed pages; for this reason, I will be relying heavily on
                        it. That said, human memory is fallible, but so are documents. The Markle
                        Report was written mainly by Joyce, and in the manner of any document
                        assembled in haste and addressed to a funding body, it presents a particular
                        view of the task at hand (and sometimes gets the minor details mixed
                        up).</p>
                    <p>As Joyce put it when I queried his use of some terms in the report, <cit>
                            <quote rend="inline" source="#joyce2011b">I feel like I’m hoisting my
                                own petard, but obviously I wrote the whole Markle Report; my

                            <ptr target="#joyce2011b"/>
                        </cit>. To get a more detailed picture I will be supplementing this source
                        with oral histories obtained in 2011 – most particularly the recollections
                        of Michael Joyce, Jay David Bolter, John B Smith and also Mark Bernstein,
                        who has maintained the code for the last twenty years. Stuart Moulthrop and
                        Nancy Kaplan have kindly helped with some of the minor details, and Michael
                        Joyce provided me with a copy of his unpublished manuscript, <title
                            rend="italic">Re:mindings</title> (he was reluctant to part with this,
                        but it is used by permission). I also rely heavily on Joyce and Bolter’s
                        critical work because this theory influenced the development of the
                        system.</p>
                </note>), to find <cit>
                    <quote rend="inline" source="#bolter1986">a structure editor...for creating

            <p>As I have argued elsewhere,<note>
                    <ptr target="#barnet2013"/>
                </note> the early hypertext systems were built to embody particular visions about
                how the human mind and memory work, to represent the <quote rend="inline"
                    source="#barnet2013">complex interconnections</quote> that hold between ideas.
                Each system (re)presented a different model of these interconnections and of the
                perceived complexity underlying a mass of information. As Jay David Bolter put it in
                1991, <cit>
                    <quote rend="inline" source="#bolter1991">electronic symbols...seem to be an
                        extension of a network of ideas in the mind itself</quote>
                    <ptr target="#bolter1991" loc="207"/>
                </cit> (also cited by <ptr target="#joyce1998" loc="23"/>). Storyspace is no
                exception; Joyce intuitively felt that stories disclose themselves in their <quote
                    rend="inline" source="#joyce1998">connectiveness,</quote> and that <cit>
                    <quote rend="inline" source="#joyce2011b">we are associative creatures. That’s
                        what we do</quote>
                    <ptr target="#joyce2011b"/>
                </cit>. Unlike the hypertext pioneers van Dam, Engelbart, Nelson or Bush, however,
                Joyce is first and foremost a writer – and Storyspace was designed for writers. The
                image of potentiality that guided Joyce was consequently a literary one; it started
                with an idea for a novel.</p>
            <p>In every interview Joyce has given about <title rend="italic">afternoon</title> or
                the development of <title rend="italic">Storyspace</title>, the leitmotif of a
                    <quote rend="inline" source="#joyce2004">story that changes each time you read
                    it</quote> returns like a Wagnerian melody. Joyce’s writing is filled with such
                recurrences, with images and phrases that return again and again; <quote
                    rend="inline" source="#joyce2004">recurrence is the sounding of memory in
                    air,</quote> he writes in <title rend="italic">Othermindedness</title>
                <ptr target="#joyce2004" loc="97"/>. As Stuart Moulthrop observed in response to
                this article, the name <q>Joyce</q> is also an echo, <cit>
                    <quote rend="inline" source="#moulthrop2011">an echo he won’t acknowledge for

                            possibility outlined by Michael Joyce, hypertexts which are unlimited

                        Book</title>. </note>. This particular image, the image of a multiple
                fiction, is important enough that it appears verbatim or near verbatim in many of

                />, the idea of a novel that changes with each reading was obviously important to
                him, based on its longevity in his own work. In our interview, he actually corrected
                my phrasing: <quote rend="inline" source="#joyce2011b">forgive this, this is like an
                    English teacher, it’s not <emph>every</emph> reading in the sense of every

                <ptr target="#joyce2011b"/>. If Storyspace has an origin legend, then it begins with
                this multiple fiction; in Vassar College’s version of the tale, Joyce <quote
                    rend="inline" source="#vassar1992">looked at his little Apple II in the early

                    exist</quote>
                <ptr target="#vassar1992"/>. Apocryphal stories aside, what is clear is that as a
                novelist, Joyce was thinking about the process of writing, and even more
                importantly, about the internal connections that exist in stories - connections that
                might, with the aid of a computer, be shaped by potential readers.</p>
            <p>In the early 80s, as a classics professor working at the University of North
                Carolina, Chapel Hill, Jay David Bolter was also thinking about the computer as a
                writing space, and about the connections that hold between ideas. His department had
                been pioneering research into the computerization of classical scholarship since
                1975, led by David Packard (son of billionaire computing pioneer David Packard, Sr.,
                the co-founder of Hewlett Packard). Unlike his contemporaries, and crucially for the
                future of humanities computing, Bolter had a background in computer engineering. He
                completed a Masters in Computer Science in 1978 as well as a PhD in Classics in
                1977, both from UNC, and he was a member of the Committee for Computer Applications
                (APA) beginning in 1981<note>I’ve gleaned this information largely from Bolter’s CV:

                </cit>. He became Packard’s assistant for a couple of years and worked on his
                pioneering mini-computer system IBYCUS. </p>
            <p>IBYCUS was the first computer to allow the editing, search, and retrieval of

            <p>Computing science was engaged in a love affair with AI in the 70s and 80s; it was
                particularly intent on modeling the perceived structure of the human mind and
                memory, imitating nature and improving on it (a topic that Bolter critiques in the
                first edition of <title rend="italic">Writing Space</title>
                <ptr target="#bolter1991" loc="171175"/>, unfortunately removed from the second
                edition published in 2001). Both Joyce and Bolter spent a year as Visiting Fellows
                at the Yale AI Project, Bolter from 1982 to 1983 and Joyce from 1984 to 1985. Bolter

            </p>
            <p>From 1980 to 1987, there was a second <q>boom</q> in this area and large amounts of
                money were available for research<note>In the 1980s a form of AI program called
                        <q>expert systems</q> was adopted by corporations around the world and
                    knowledge became the focus of mainstream AI research. Traditional AI took a back
                    seat to research in this area and in neural networks. In those same years, the
                    Japanese government aggressively funded AI with its fifth generation computer
                    project. Another encouraging event in the early 1980s was the revival of
                    connectionism in the work of John Hopfield and David Rumelhart. Once again, AI
                    had achieved success.</note>. It was a glamorous field, and both Bolter and
                Joyce felt the gravitational pull of it. In the Markle Report they note that their <cit>
                    <quote rend="inline" source="#bolter1986">collaboration stems from, and has been

                </cit>. It might be worth reflecting at this point that, whereas the project of
                hypertext has been all too successful with the proliferation of the web, AI remains
                arguably fictional<note>Stuart Moulthrop, personal communication 2011. </note>. In
                the 1980s however, there was a brief resurgence of hope as the new technology of
                    <q>expert systems</q> and artificial neural networks picked up steam. </p>
            <p>Given the prominence they ascribe to this research, I will briefly explore some of
                the work produced at Yale here. Joyce in particular was influenced by the ideas of
                the indomitable Roger Schank, Director of the Yale AI Project and author of a
                seminal book in AI called <title rend="italic">Dynamic Memory</title>, first
                published in 1982. (It has subsequently been revised. The 1999 edition is the one I
                will be referring to here.) Joyce picked up the term <term>remindings</term> from
                Schank’s work, probably from this book, noting in <title rend="italic">Of Two
                    Minds</title> that Schank is <cit>
                    <quote rend="inline" source="#joyce1998">nearly alone in artificial intelligence

                    <ptr target="#joyce1998" loc="165"/>
                </cit>.</p>
            <p>He also spent a couple of years corresponding with Natalie Dehn, a researcher at
                Schank’s lab, who used the term extensively in her work on story-generation
                    programs<note>Matt Kirschenbaum details this correspondence well in his chapter
                    on afternoon and Storyspace; I will not cover it again here. </note>. When Joyce
                first began corresponding with Dehn in 1983, she was working on a story generation
                program called TALE-SPIN that attempted to simulate an author’s mind as she makes up
                a story <ptr target="#dehn1981"/>. The ideal structure editor, write Bolter and
                Joyce in the Markle Report, would facilitate <cit>

                </cit>.</p>
            <p>For Dehn, the process of writing is deeply influenced by the author’s own memory: <cit>
                    <quote rend="inline" source="#dehn1981">This memory needs to contain not only
                        facts about the storyworld thus far constructed, but also prior knowledge of
                        memorable episodes, characters, etc., in the author's life</quote>
                    <ptr target="#dehn1981"/>
                </cit>. TALE-SPIN was an <quote rend="inline" source="#dehn1981">AI attempt at story
                    generation</quote> by making up Aesop-fable-like stories that were the
                consequence of a particular storyworld. It was a world simulator, and this world
                included the characters that lived in it and their goals and motivations. TALE-SPIN
                behaved, in effect, like an author’s memory. It had to keep track of these
                characters and their specific environment, access the material, and reformulate the
                narrative based on these items. To explain and describe this process of
                reformulation and retrieval she also borrowed the term <term>reminding</term> from
                Schank.</p>
            <p>For Roger Schank, <term>reminding</term> describes the association of episodes in
                human memory, and the <title rend="italic">remodeling</title> that takes place upon
                recall (hence the title of his book, <title rend="italic">Dynamic Memory</title>). A
                library does not have a dynamic memory; it changes with great difficulty. Human
                memory, on the other hand, is constantly rewriting the connections between episodes
                and changing the categorizations and associative trails of information. It does not
                recall information so much as reconstruct it (hence, re-mindings, not just bringing
                episodes to mind again and again, but building them afresh each time). </p>
            <p>In the early 80s, there were specific research questions that concerned Schank at the
                Yale AI lab: </p>
            <quote rend="block" source="#schank1999">When we process events as they happen, we need
                to find particular events in memory that are closely related to the current input we

                experience to be like another? Under what labels, using what indices, do we look for
                related episodes? <ptr target="#schank1999" loc="21"/>.</quote>
            <p>These are questions about the relationship between ideas, and how the mind snaps
                instantly from one item to another, to paraphrase Bush. They were also questions,
                Joyce recalls, that made sense to him during his fellowship. He would sit with Dehn
                and members of Schank’s group and <cit>
                    <quote rend="inline" source="#joyce2011b">once they got over the initial hump of

            <p>From early on in the piece, due to the high profile of this field and their
                involvement with it, Bolter and Joyce evidently felt the need to stress that
                Storyspace was not AI: <quote rend="inline" source="#bolter1986">We hasten to
                    note,</quote> they wrote in 1986, <cit>

                    chapter, hypertext turns AI inside out.</note>, as they go on to note with no

                </cit>.</p>
            <p>Bolter published a book shortly after his fellowship at Yale that would become a
                classic in computing studies <title rend="italic"> Turing’s Man: Western Culture in
                    the Computer Age</title> (1984). In <title rend="italic">Turing’s Man</title>,

                <note> Again, the influence of AI is clear in this book; The New York Times went so

                    </cit>. </note>. He also introduces some ideas around <q>spatial</q> writing
                that would recur and grow in importance in his later work; in particular, the
                relationship between early Greek systems of place-memory loci (the art of memory)
                and electronic writing. </p>
            <p>The seeds behind Bolter’s oft-cited and influential observation from <title

                </cit> germinated here, in the early 80s, in his reflections on computers and the
                classical arts. The classical art of memory represented information by attributing
                to it spatial characteristics, and similarly, <cit>

                    follow networks of association in our data, as indeed human memory does. This
                    fact was particularly appreciated in the oral culture of Greece and Rome <ptr

            <p>At the time he started working with Bolter, Joyce had ambitions of his own; he wanted

                Markle Report, which was written entirely by Joyce even though Bolter appears as an

                Richard Grusin (2000), which developed a model for reminding in the digital era: in
                this book, Grusin and Bolter argue that visual media achieve their cultural
                significance by remodeling or reworking earlier media (hence
                <emph>re</emph>mediation). There is a double logic to remediation; contradictory

            <p>The thing about technological visions is that they change. In particular, they change
                as they are being built into artifacts. Computer languages and hardware have their
                own limits and capacities, and these impact on the direction of development
                projects. Andrew Pickering calls this dance, this mutually constitutive dance
                between vision and artifact, the <q>mangle of practice</q>. When Bolter and Joyce
                first started tinkering with an early software experiment for the IBM PC to <q>try
                    out</q> some of these ideas, this was precisely what happened; their ideas
                evolved in tandem with the software experiments.</p>
            <p>In the Markle Report, Joyce refers to an early program Bolter brought to their
                discussions called TEXT <ptr target="#bolter1986" loc="12"/>. According to Joyce,

                <ptr target="#bolter2011"/> – but either way the name is not important. Joyce was
                primarily using an Apple II at this stage; he soon acquired a Macintosh (<q>not,
                    however, before he purchased an Apple Lisa [using grant money] for something

                margin of this article<note> Stuart Moulthrop, personal communication. </note>).
                GLOSSA was written for the IBM PC in Pascal, one of the high-level development
                languages in use at the time<note> Along with FORTRAN and BASIC. Pascal is obviously
                    still in use, but is no longer the primary development language for Apple
                    machines. </note>. The precursors of Storyspace, TALETELLER, TALETELLER 2, and
                also the original Storyspace, were all written in Pascal - and by 1985, when both
                Joyce and Bolter were using Macs, Apple had its own Mac Pascal<note> When we called
                    it TALETELLER 2, we were already working on Mac by that time <ptr
                        target="#bolter2011"/>. </note>. Once converted to Mac, Bolter and Joyce
                were committed – <cit>

                </cit>.</p>
            <p>One of the most basic and enduring tools in Pascal is linked lists, which is a simple
                way to store and present <q>elements</q> using pointers to indicate the next element
                (or <q>node</q>) in a list. In our interview Bolter pointed out that he had taken a
                lot of computer science courses, and <cit>
                    <quote rend="inline" source="#bolter2011">linked lists obviously are the key to

                </cit>. This is an interesting observation, and Joyce mentions Adventure-type
                fictions as an influence in the Markle Report (<ptr target="#bolter1986" loc="19"/>,
                although he also mentions numerous cultural and literary influences including the
                novels of Sterne and Joyce, Cortazar’s <title rend="italic">Hopscotch,</title> even
                jazz music). Neither Bolter nor Joyce believe, however, that they were influenced by
                Adventure-type games, except in the sense that they were <cit>
                    <quote rend="inline" source="#bolter2011">a kind of zeitgeist at the

                </cit>. Joyce is especially adamant that they were trying to avoid hierarchical
                structures <ptr target="#joyce2011a"/>. Human memory is fallible though,
                particularly concerning the past - and data models are very hard to trace at any
                rate (they always reflect something else, popping up everywhere like the grin of the
                Cheshire cat, as <ptr target="#mcaleese1999"/> points out).</p>
            <p>For my part, I’d like to suggest that if there is a technical <q>origin</q> to the
                tree-like data structure in Storyspace, it is more likely to have come from the
                functions at hand in the computer language Bolter was using than Adventure-type
                games, namely linked lists. In other words, the tree-like structures were just part
                of the forest of software design<note>Stuart Moulthrop, comment in the margin of
                    this article. </note>. In my investigations into hypertext history, one
                surprising find is that this very basic programming function has been quite
                influential (the reader will have to look at my new book to discover just how deep
                they go). This is a far more pedestrian explanation, almost trivially true, but
                sometimes programming is about implementing the most obvious sequence of
                instructions. </p>
            <p>The first product of Joyce’s and Bolter’s conversation around the original program,
                GLOSSA, was called TALETELLER, a name that stuck until 1985 (as Matthew Kirschenbaum
                observes <ptr target="#kirschenbaum2008" loc="174"/>). Bolter had GLOSSA in hand
                when they first started collaborating, but its successor, TALETELLER, was a product
                of tinkering together. As Joyce recalls, <cit>

                </cit>. <quote rend="block" source="#joyce2011b">TALETELLER was an attempt to hack
                    together, and without any visual structure, the kind of associative program that

            </p>
            <p>Around this time, Joyce started preparing what he called <q>pseudocode,</q> a
                delightful mash of poetic handwritten text, symbols and logical notations, to
                explain his ideas. Given the lyrical, polyglot style of his fictions and critical
                work, we would expect no less in his technical projects; Joyce has always written to
                his own loony tune music, to paraphrase him in <title rend="italic">Of Two
                    Minds</title>
                <ptr target="#joyce1998" loc="181"/>. </p>
            <p>In his book <title rend="italic">Mechanisms</title>, Kirschenbaum explains how this
                pseudocode was eventually used to plan and write Joyce’s fiction <title
                    rend="italic">afternoon </title>
                <ptr target="#kirschenbaum2008" loc="182–183"/>. Joyce generally uses an arrow →
                    <quote rend="inline" source="#kirschenbaum2008">to indicate a link, and symbols
                    for various operators,</quote> e.g. an ampersand to indicate an AND condition
                    <ptr target="#kirschenbaum2008" loc="182"/>. Joyce thinks the process may have
                been a little more complicated than this, however, and that the pseudocode was more
                like a lyrical <q>mnemonic</q> than a draft or plan. The trope of memory returns;
                    <quote rend="block" source="#joyce2011b">There exist only scraps of notes from
                    writing [<title rend="italic">afternoon</title>] in the Harry Ransom Centre

                    the fiction, which otherwise I wrote totally <q>in</q> the system of Storyspace,
                    reading and re-reading sequences, and experiencing guard field permutations,

                    <ptr target="#joyce1998" loc="181"/>
                </cit> inspired the most distinctive feature of Storyspace: guard fields. </p>
            <p>As we have seen, one of Joyce’s key rhetorical strategies is recurrence (the
                    <soCalled>sounding of memory in air</soCalled>), phrases that appear again and
                again as the writing progresses, relying heavily on the reader’s own memory of
                previous instances of the same phrase or node to alter their present experience. He
                is hyperconscious of where the narrative has already been. Guard fields control a
                reader’s experience of the text based on where they have been. This is done by
                placing conditions on the activation of links, <cit>
                    <quote rend="inline" source="#ryan1999">preventing a link from being followed
                        unless a specific node has been visited</quote>
                    <ptr target="#ryan1999" loc="138"/>
                </cit>. The reader’s experience is thus literally as well as metaphorically shaped
                by the path already taken, enabling Joyce to repeat terms and nodes throughout the
                work and have them reappear in new contexts. Conversely, they enable Joyce to ensure
                that readers don’t access key nodes until they have seen or visited others; although
                the narrative seems to be following a path that may have been followed before, it
                changes slightly at the next turn.</p>
            <p>The most famous example of the use of guard fields is the <q>white afternoon</q> node
                in <title rend="italic">afternoon</title>, the node that reveals that Peter may have
                inadvertently killed his own son. Hypertext critic Jane Yellowlees-Douglas (Joyce’s
                favourite reader, whose dissertation was on <title rend="italic">afternoon</title>)
                argues this node <q>completes</q> the work for her, but it is accessible only after
                the reader has seen a certain sequence of other nodes; <cit>
                    <quote rend="inline" source="#yellowlees-douglas2004">a succession of guard
                        fields ensures that it is reached only after a lengthy visitation of

                </cit>. Guard fields are a powerful device, and one that Joyce deploys to full
                effect in <title rend="italic">afternoon</title>. According to the Markle Report,
                Joyce <q>agitated</q> for them to be included in the design of Storyspace from the
                outset, and Bolter quickly obliged in their fledgling program: <quote rend="block"
                    source="#bolter2011">It was just a matter of putting a field into the link data
                    structure that would contain the guard, and then just checking that
                    field...against what the user did before they were allowed to follow the link...
                    It was [that] idea you know and it was Michael’s. <ptr target="#bolter2011"/>
                </quote>
            </p>
            <p>Guard fields, along with the topographic <q>spatial</q> writing style, have remained
                integral to the Storyspace program for 30 years hence.</p>
            <p>In 1985 Bolter became involved with an interdisciplinary research group at UNC
                directed by a colleague from computer science, John B. Smith. Smith formed this
                research group when he returned to UNC as a faculty member in 1984 <ptr
                    target="#smith2011"/>. Bolter and Joyce have always credited Smith as a coauthor
                of Storyspace, but Smith wanted to clarify in our interview that he wasn’t involved
                in the development of either TALETELLER or Storyspace — he feels he made more of an
                intellectual contribution insofar as <cit>
                    <quote rend="inline" source="#smith2011">there was a sort of cloud of ideas that
                        we were all drawing on in the discussions we’d have in this research entity

                    <ptr target="#smith2011"/>
                </cit>.</p>
            <p>Textlab was comprised of three people from computer science including Smith, a
                cognitive scientist called Marcy Lansman, and Bolter from classics. The group would
                have weekly meetings at Chapel Hill, <quote rend="inline" source="#smith2011">and we
                    would debate and discuss’</quote> problems and issues around hypermedia, data
                structures and the visual representation of writing and thinking <ptr
                    target="#smith2011"/>. Textlab was a very productive group, and they developed a
                number of hypertext systems between 1984 and 1989. Primary among them was the
                Writing Environment (WE), the system with which Smith was most closely associated.
                This expository writing system was contemporaneous with Storyspace.</p>
            <p>The development of the Writing Environment was central to these discussions; it was
                the major project concerning Textlab. WE was a hypertext system built for the PC
                explicitly designed in accord with a <cit>
                    <quote rend="inline" source="#smith1986">cognitive model of the writing
                        process</quote>
                    <ptr target="#smith1986"/>
                </cit>. Unlike Bolter and Joyce, Smith and the rest of the WE team were <quote
                    rend="inline" source="#smith1986">not interested in prose, in fiction</quote>.
                Designed to produce paper documents for professionals, users employed the system to
                represent their ideas as nodes, move them into <q>spatial</q> clusters, and link
                them into an associative network. Crucially, this network was not intended to be
                read at a screen like Storyspace fictions are. WE would assemble the nodes in
                sequence and print a linear document. If the user edited this tree structure, then
                the structure of the corresponding printed document would change. The model was
                derived from a review of the literature in cognitive psychology, composition theory,
                and the nascent field of Human Computer studies (this would become HCI). Bolter
                coauthored a seminal paper on WE in 1986 with Smith, Lansman, Stephen Weiss, David
                Beard and Gordon Ferguson, and contributed to its development. </p>
            <p>From the outset in the discussions this group were having, however, according to
                Smith, it became apparent that: <quote rend="block" source="#smith2011">Jay was more
                    interested in the Macintosh hardware, and he was also interested in applying
                    these ideas to literature and a literary context. So Jay at some point said
                        <q>Ok, I think I’m going to set off and do an alternate system,</q> probably
                    incorporating a lot of the ideas that were floating around in this group, and

            </p>
            <p>The Markle Report refers to a system that <quote rend="inline" source="#bolter1986"
                    >strongly influenced Storyspace</quote> at this time called PROSE, credited to
                John B. Smith <ptr target="#bolter1986" loc="13"/>. Smith does not recall making a
                system called PROSE, however, and believes it is referring to an early version of WE
                    (2011)<note>Interview, 2011. This suspicion was later confirmed by both Joyce
                    and Bolter.</note>. Although there was actually a program around at the time

                influenced the development of Storyspace<note>We do not have space to go into more

            <p>Joyce and Bolter’s next implementation, again in Pascal, was called TALETELLER 2.
                They both emphasized the influence of the Macintosh user interface on their thinking
                at this time, particularly the idea of representing the working space as a series of
                nested levels or spaces inspired by the <cit>

                </cit>. This file structure was not designed to be redrawn at will, and the
                assumption was that users were concerned with editing documents, not their <title

            <p>The Markle Report refers to a meeting at this time with Dr. Kristine Hooper from the
                Apple Educational Division, who explained the Aspen Movie Project at MIT, an early
                hypermedia system that allowed the user to take a virtual tour of surrogate travel

                    before. There in one room: Ted Nelson’s Xanadu, Engelbart’s NLS/Augment,
                    Walker’s Symbolics Document Explorer, Joyce and Bolter with Storyspace,
                    [Bernstein’s] Hypergate, Meyrowitz and Landow and Yankelovich and van Dam with

            <p>Along with Stuart Moulthrop’s <title rend="italic">Victory Garden</title>, <title
                    rend="italic">afternoon</title> is arguably the most important hypertext fiction
                in the history of computing. Citations of it are too numerous to include here
                because <quote rend="inline" source="#ensslin2007">it appears in virtually every

            <p>The closest reader of Joyce’s fictions has always been Jane Yellowlees Douglas
                (particularly in her book, <title rend="quotes">The End of Books, or Books Without
                    End?</title> 2000), and several new interpretations of <title rend="italic"
                    >afternoon</title> have been published in recent years by young scholars, most
                notably literary critic Alice Bell (2010) and Bangor University’s Astrid Ensslin
                (2007). </p>
            <p>For this reason, I will not take the reader through yet another interpretation of
                    <title rend="italic">afternoon</title>; this has already been done, elsewhere
                and brilliantly. I will simply note that the fiction Joyce distributed on diskette
                at Hypertext ’87 did more than just demonstrate Storyspace; it demonstrated what
                network literature could be, and arguably opened a space for that genre to evolve.
                    <title rend="italic">[A]fternoon</title> was also the realization of Joyce’s
                long-held dream. It is a book that changes with each reading. </p>
            <p>As Matthew Kirschenbaum observes in his own chapter on <title rend="italic"
                    >afternoon</title>, there is a journal entry in the Joyce Archives dated June 4,
                1988, that notes: <quote rend="block" source="#kirschenbaum2008">What is not

                    contacted each other: <q>to write a novel that changes each time you read it</q>
                    came to be the story, <title rend="italic">afternoon</title>, which will likely

            <p>In 1988, Joyce, Bolter and Smith formed a startup they called Riverrun Ltd., a return
                to Joyce’s favourite metaphor (and an evocation of the famous first word of James

                    rend="italic">Carmen Sandiego</title> and <title rend="italic">Galactic
                    Empire</title> games. According to Matthew Kirschenbaum, who went through the
                correspondence between Joyce and Brøderbund, it was eventually dropped in 1989
                because of <cit>
                    <quote rend="inline" source="#kirschenbaum2008">what was perceived to be a

                </cit>. After Broderbund, Joyce entered into conversation with Mark Bernstein, the
                founder of Eastgate Systems. Eastgate signed a contract licensing Storyspace in
                December 1990 and has distributed it since that time.</p>
            <p>Pieces of editing software, particularly hypertext systems, are not known for their
                shelf life. None of the first-generation hypertext systems from the 60’s and 70’s
                have survived into the modern era. Even what is called the <q>second generation</q>
                of hypertext systems from the late 70’ and early 80’s, the contemporaries of
                Storyspace – FRESS, Intermedia, Smith’s WE, Apple’s Hypercard – are no longer in
                use. Storyspace, however, has survived for almost thirty years; content is still
                being written for it, it still being bought and sold, and it is still being used in
                pedagogic environments, although the user base is probably fairly small (a couple of
                hundred users). This is virtually unheard of in the history of computing software;
                systems just don’t last that long. The reason Storyspace has survived is fairly
                simple: Eastgate Systems has been maintaining it.</p>
            <p>It would be remiss to write a history of hypertext without devoting time to Eastgate
                and to its founder, Mark Bernstein. In addition to the development of early
                hypertext systems, <cit>
                    <quote rend="inline" source="#kitzmann2006">the history of hypertext was also

                </cit>. Eastgate Systems has been the major publisher of hypertext fiction for over
                twenty years, and published the majority of what is now considered <q>serious
                    literary hypertext</q> (this is also Eastgate’s tagline), including Joyce’s
                    <title rend="italic">afternoon</title>, Stuart Moulthrop’s <title rend="italic"
                    >Victory Garden </title>and Shelley Jackson’s <title rend="italic">Patchwork
                    Girl</title>. In addition, Bernstein has maintained and extended the Storyspace
                code since 1990 (it has been entirely rewritten in C, and doesn’t share a single
                line of code with the original Pascal version, which presents its own conundrum:
                where is the Storyspace in Storyspace?). He has also made significant contributions
                to hypertext as a critical discourse<note> Bernstein’s paper, <title rend="quotes"

                As John Vinder puts it on his blog, <quote rend="block" source="#vinder2010">Who has
                    made a more substantial contribution to the field of electronic literature than

                    field. You could name individual authors whose works helped to legitimize the
                    field of born-digital literature. If you go with this approach, you may suggest
                    Michael Joyce, Shelley Jackson, or Stuart Moulthrop, yet all these authors were

            <p>Eastgate pioneered hypertext publishing in the late 80’s and arguably legitimised
                hypertext as a creative endeavor. As Australian hypertext theorist and author Adrian

                        Eastgate Systems at length in <title rend="italic">Mechanisms</title>.
                        Eastgate’s role in stewarding Storyspace is well-known, and has been
                        documented by scholars... My chapter, however, concerned an even earlier
                        period in the software’s development, based largely on the archival
                        materials housed at the Ransom Center. Whatever our disagreements, I have,
                        and have always had, much respect for Mark Bernstein’s contributions to

                internationally before the web, a direct <cit>

                </cit>. </p>
            <p>If we have now come to the point where we might talk about a hypertext <q>canon,</q>
                and indeed Astrid Ensslin has just published a book arguing we should do that, this
                is due in no small part to the publishing and marketing of titles by Eastgate. From
                early on, Bernstein sought to find and publish hypertexts because he felt the
                literary world needed some real examples; it was all hypertext theory, no <q>serious
                    hypertext</q>. As Stuart Moulthrop observed, in 1990, Bernstein stood before the
                European Conference on Hypertext and uttered the famous first words, <q>Where are
                    the hypertexts?</q> – a question that is arguably still just as urgent. Eastgate
                was set up to provide an answer to that question. </p>
            <p>Bernstein also developed his own hypertext system, which was operational by 1988 –
                Hypergate. Hypergate is noteworthy because it introduced the concept of
                    <term>breadcrumbs</term> – showing whether a link takes you back to a place
                you’ve already seen. This concept was invented by Bernstein, and eventually made its
                way into the Mosaic browser (Eastgate never implemented breadcrumbs in Storyspace).
                Possibly for this reason, Bernstein was initially more interested in signing Joyce’s
                hypertext fiction, <title rend="italic">afternoon,</title> than he was in
                Storyspace. As Joyce recalls it, <cit>
                    <quote rend="inline" source="#joyce2011b">
                        <title rend="italic">afternoon</title> was my bargaining chip in many ways.
                        That’s how I remember things. I made the publishing of <title rend="italic"

                    <ptr target="#joyce2011b"/>
                </cit>. Bernstein thought this was overstating the situation. He remembered
                approaching Joyce about <title rend="italic">afternoon</title>, because it seemed a
                natural fit, but he <cit>

            <p>Beginning in 1989, these discussions went on for some time: <quote rend="block"
                    source="#bernstein2011">At Hypertext ’89, I had discussions with Michael Joyce
                    where we basically agreed that we were going to do this, and Broderbund had
                    returned the right to Storyspace to Michael and Jay. So from that time for the
                    next several months we proceeded under the assumption that it would be. <ptr

            <p>The contract with Eastgate licensing the development and maintenance of Storyspace is
                dated December 17, 1990. Over the next five years, a number of hypertext fictions
                were written in Storyspace and marketed by Eastgate that have since attained (or
                should attain, according to Ensslin’s book <title rend="italic">Canonizing
                    Hypertext</title> 2007) <q>canonical</q> status. These include Moulthrop’s
                    <title rend="italic">Victory Garden</title> (1991), Carolyn Guyer’s <title
                    rend="italic">Quibbling </title>(1993), Jane Yellowlees Douglas <title
                    rend="italic">I Have Said Nothing</title> (1994) and Shelley Jackson’s <title
                    rend="italic">Patchwork Girl</title> (1995). </p>
            <p>So important was Storyspace (and Eastgate) to the early development of the field,
                argues Katherine Hayles, that works created within Storyspace have come to be known
                as the Storyspace School <ptr target="#hayles2008" loc="6"/>. Alice Bell’s recent
                book on hypertext fiction similarly argues for the creation of a hypertext canon,
                and analyzes four hypertext fictions that were created in Storyspace, providing <cit>
                    <quote rend="inline" source="#bell2010">a critical theory for the analysis of
                        Storyspace fictions</quote>

                </cit>. </p>
            <p>For my own part, I find it strange that recent theorists are arguing for a formal
                canon – it is almost as though we have forgotten the lessons of poststructuralism.
                What, exactly, is wrong with margins and interstices? Isn’t that where all the
                interesting stuff happens? Why canonize it? Stuart Moulthrop wrote an interesting
                response to Alice Bell’s book on Storyspace fiction in the <title rend="italic"
                    >Electronic Book Review</title>: <quote rend="block" source="#moulthrop2011a"
                    >For Dr. Bell, the adjectival <term>niche</term> is a term of suspicion. I
                    disagree, having learned to think of literary or cultural niches not as traps,
                    but as necessary predicaments or premises. As I see it, if dwellers in these
                    dens need to escape anything, it is the niche distinction itself, the overriding
                    concern with separation of specialist and popular markets. <ptr

            <p>This is the legacy of Storyspace. Whichever side you fall in this debate, the fact is
                that Storyspace fictions predominate in what arguably already is (or should be) a
                hypertext canon. The arrival of the Web and HTML changed the landscape for hypertext
                and for Storyspace. Storyspace was originally built (as were all the early hypertext
                systems) as a standalone system – in this case running under the Macintosh OS. It
                was not intended to create networked hypermedia like the texts found on the Web.
                Arguably, it still belongs to the pre-Web era (and by including it in this story, I
                have contributed to that perception).</p>
            <p>Bernstein extended the program in 1995 to enable users to export HTML templates, but
                as Katherine Hayles points out, <cit><quote rend="inline" source="#hayles2008"> the
                    limitations of Storyspace as a web authoring program are significant. For
                    example, it has a very limited palette of colors and cannot handle sound files
                    that will play on the web</quote>
                <ptr target="#hayles2008" loc="6"/></cit><note> Though Hayles doesn’t seem to realize
                    these limitations also apply to HTML. </note>. Guard fields are also very
                difficult to implement on the web, and the HTML link model simply cannot support
                some of the more complicated link models of the earlier hypertext systems.</p>
            <p>
                <quote rend="block" source="#bernstein2011">The relationship between Storyspace and
                    the web has never been entirely easy, in part because the Storyspace link model
                    is richer than the web’s and it turns out that for the sorts of things people
                    want to do in Storyspace the richness matters a lot… Guard fields are invaluable
                    for large scale narrative and we have not come up with an alternative [on the
                    web] <ptr target="#bernstein2011"/>.</quote>

            <p>Authors also started turning to Flash and to some extent Javascript around the turn
                of the century. We now have a generation of writers who are willing to script within
                Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) – or as Stuart Moulthrop puts it, <q>a wave of Jay Bolters</q>
                <note>
                    <p> Comment to the author.</p>
                </note>. For these reasons, although Storyspace continues to be used to produce
                stand-alone works, <cit><quote rend="inline" source="#hayles2008">it has been eclipsed
                    as the primary web authoring tool for electronic literature</quote>
                <ptr target="#hayles2008" loc="6"/></cit>. Like all the first generation hypertext
                systems, the web presented a completely different model for building hypertexts.
                Storyspace was never about engaging a crowd, and it has never really entered the web
                era.</p>
            <p>Bolter has a rather pessimistic view of the impact of the web on networked
                literature, and on the legacy of Storyspace. <quote rend="inline"
                    source="#bolter2011">The web compromised on the vision of hypertext,</quote>
                he observes. It compromised on the <cit><quote rend="inline" source="#bolter2011"
                    >literary, political, social vision of the original hypertext movement</quote>
                <ptr target="#bolter2011"/></cit>, and it allowed work to be commercialized quickly and
                easily. This has its benefits, of course. The web provides a massive new audience
                and a quick (and free) way of distributing products to that audience – but the web
                obliterated Bernstein’s original business model. The whole concept of selling
                hypertext is made immensely more difficult when everywhere literature is given away
                for free. As Bolter pointed out, the literary community <cit><quote rend="inline"
                    source="#bolter2011">often revolted against this, because it was so easily
                    commercialised</quote>
                <ptr target="#bolter2011"/></cit>. </p>
            <p>The most famous example of this rebellion against the web is Robert Coover’s <title
                    rend="quotes">Literary Hypertext: The Passing of the Golden Age</title> (1999).
                In this keynote address to the second Digital Arts and Culture (DAC) Conference,
                Coover lamented the passing of a specific body of digital literature – what we would
                now classify as the Storyspace School – and the rise of the <quote rend="inline"
                    source="#coover1999">noisy, restless, opportunistic, superficial, e-commerce
                    driven</quote> web texts, that <cit><quote rend="inline" source="#coover1999">are
                    about as appealing as a scatter of old magazines on a table in the dentist’s
                    lounge</quote>
                <ptr target="#coover1999"/></cit>. The Golden Age of hypertext has passed, the visual
                usurping the verbal (the margins, in fact, used to be the site for revolutions:
                perhaps this is why Moulthrop is reluctant to leave them).</p>
            <p>Looking back on its history, one of the most interesting aspects of Storyspace is the
                fact that it bridged the gap between humanities and computing science so early, and
                that it was taken seriously by both fields. This was largely due to the fact that
                Bolter <quote rend="inline" source="#joyce2011b">had a seat in both
                    worlds,</quote> as Joyce points out, collaborating with his engineering
                colleagues from the outset <ptr target="#joyce2011b"/>. Unlike Nelson and Engelbart,
                Bolter and Joyce were not ridiculed; on the contrary, they both felt embraced by
                computing science. This set a precedent for future work in the area. In fact,
                according to Joyce, <cit><quote rend="inline" source="#joyce2011a">what has gone
                    unremarked is Storyspace’s contribution to a dialogue, if not across the two
                    cultures then at least across the engineering and literary communities</quote>
