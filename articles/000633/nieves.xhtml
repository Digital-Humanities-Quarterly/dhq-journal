                     and segregation learn to harness the “master’s tools”? I urge us to consider a new way forward, for a Black DH, that as a social movement
                     and as a political project once again challenges the still white-dominated field of
                     digital humanities without hesitation or apology – and is unapologetic about its commitment
                     to racial justice. Black DH, as Moya Bailey, Kim Gallon, and Jessica Marie Johnson
                     have argued elsewhere, should be simultaneously experimental, analytical, computational,
                     speculative, and have unique design capabilities as a series of practices and in shaping
                     the field’s future.</p>

               <div class="ptext" id="p1">Black Lives Matter. Black Women’s Lives Matter. The lives of Black women such as Saartjie
                  Baartman, Anna Julia Cooper, Charlotte Maxeke, Victoria Earle Matthews, Antoinette
                  Sithole, Pauline Hopkins, and Winnie Madikizela-Mandela have mattered greatly. Yet,
                  for many, these names mean very little. For others, many of these women were pioneers,
                  and some might even argue, Afro-Futurists, women who seemingly anticipated the urgency
                  of DH debates during these pandemic-ridden times, who looked at progress, social change,
                  and world-building in Black communities well before others of their day. As a scholar
                  of race, gender, and the built environment, I could not help but have Black women’s
                  lives matter to me. In the U.S. and South Africa (where much of my current scholarly
                  work is situated) the lives of Black women in racial uplift have always been critical,
                  but have never been properly valued, documented, or recognized. Black women’s lives
                  matter in both of these geo-political contexts because of the labor they contributed
                  in the making of the empires of both the English in colonial America and the Dutch
                  in the Cape Colony of Southern Africa. These histories cannot continue to be ignored,
                  erased, overlooked, or silenced without making certain of the many contributions that
                  were made at great personal and collective costs by so many Black and Brown women
                  – these same women who ultimately found ways to begin dismantling the legacy of settler-colonialism
                  [<a class="ref" href="#nieves2020">Nieves 2020</a>]. These histories are unique in many significant ways, but the tools of white supremacy,
                  racial capitalism, and genocide are very much the common thread that stitches these
                  living tableaus together. I remind you what Audre Lorde once wrote:</div>
               
               <blockquote>
                  <p class="ptext">For the master’s tools will never dismantle the master’s house. They may allow us
                     to temporarily beat him at his own game, but they will never enable us to bring about
                     genuine change. Racism and homophobia are real conditions of all our lives in this
                     place and time. I urge each one of us here to reach down into that deep place of knowledge
                     inside herself and touch that terror and loathing of any difference that lives here.
                     See whose face it wears. Then the personal as the political can begin to illuminate
                     all our choices.  [<a class="ref" href="#lorde2007">Lorde 2007</a>]</p>

               <div class="ptext" id="p2">I have, since 2004, been working in South Africa on a series of digital projects informed
                  by community-driven participatory practices. That work has raised a number of issues
                  for me, and what I consider to be some of the core values that are needed today when
                  working in Black DH – values especially informed by feminist and intersectional epistemologies.
                  Working to establish a series of foundational guidelines for this work reminds me
                  that I was the signatory of an earlier call to action, the “eBlack Studies Manifesto”, sponsored by the African-American Studies Department at the University of Illinois
                  Urbana in 2008 that defines eBlack studies as “the ongoing application of current digital information technology towards the production,
                  dissemination, and collection of historical knowledge critical to the discipline of
                  Black Studies and to the overall black experience”" [<a class="ref" href="#alkalimat2008">Alkalimat, et al. 2008</a>]. The authors, of whom I was just one out of fifteen, outlined nine imperatives to
                  guide and grow the fledgling discipline. Some 16+ years later we have grown eBlack
                  Studies significantly, despite daunting challenges faced during the economic crisis
                  of that same year in 2008, and the subsequent global recession.</div>

               <div class="ptext" id="p3">For me, a queer scholar of color who still cannot easily separate my everyday lived
                  reality from my activist and social justice-based pedagogies – the kind of activism
                  that embraces the “personal is political” – I am often left to wonder how scholarly practice for some in the ivory tower are
                  just what they do from 9am to 5pm, Monday through Friday. As a Black DH practitioner
                  who cannot ignore my own positionality as a scholar of color, I do not see a neat
                  separation between my day-to-day lived reality from my digital practices. And as I
                  write this short reflection piece, we are once again facing a global crisis, a pandemic,
                  brought on by COVID-19 that has impacted Black and Brown people, here in the U.S.,
                  and across the African Diaspora, in disproportionate numbers. We might never know
                  the full extent of the damage done by the pandemic because of the mis-handling and
                  willful neglect of the necessary data to more fully and qualitatively document its
                  impact.</div>

                  outside the academy, to address the kind of disciplinary focus of, and adherence to
                  the dominant fields and tools created in support of a very Eurocentric-focused model
                  for digital humanities – something we continue to see at our yearly international
                  Association of Digital Humanities Organizations (ADHO) conference with significant
                  pushback from our European colleagues who disavow race as a legitimate category of
                  analysis or humanistic inquiry [<a class="ref" href="#ciotti2017">Ciotti 2017</a>].</div>

               <div class="ptext" id="p5">Fortunately we have been able to break free from that white-male centered, heteronormative,
                  overtly text-based monolingual analytic focus, making significant inroads through
                  DH2018 in Mexico City and other interventions across the Americas, the Caribbean,
                  and digital projects that readily engage with racial justice including the African
                  American History, Culture, and Digital Humanities (AADHUM) program at the University
                  of Maryland-College Park; the Colored Conventions Project (CCP) at the Pennsylvania
                  State University; the Forum on Digital Ethnic Studies at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln;
                  and the History of Black Writing (HBW) at the University of Kansas-Lawrence. Each
                  of these institutions is making significant progress in training students and modeling
                  the kind of scholarship that is currently needed to address racial and systemic inequalities
                  in digital humanities. With institutional support, and alliances with one or two senior
                  faculty who have also leveraged their positions in their respective fields (along
                  with their reputations), Black DH is becoming more “mainstream.” However, it is still
                  seen at many institutions as niche or the result of digital faddism, or worse, is
                  subject to the pressures of neo-liberal administrators seeking new funding streams
                  for embattled Black, African American, and Africana Studies Programs and/or Departments.
                  Rectifying the financial and socio-political imbalance of Black, African American,
                  and Africana Studies Programs and/or Departments must come along with the full embrace
                  of digital humanities. All this still impedes a clear way forward for Black DH without
                  some sort of agreed upon set of practices, community building strategies, and new
                  knowledge-making frameworks. Fortunately, this special issue of <cite class="title italic">DHQ</cite> that looks ahead and features the work of a new generation of digital scholars, provides
                  us with the sorts of examples where Black DH is now heading.</div>

                  who have influenced my own feminist digital scholarly praxis and who deserve further
                  research. Finding ways of bridging Black women’s lived realities while also attempting
                  to articulate some guidelines for doing the work of Black DH (and embracing the phrase,
                  “the personal is political”) is worthy of discussing and debating further, but only as to those next, actionable
                  steps. Inaction is not acceptable. “Pearl clutching”, hand-wringing, and talking things to their untimely demise can no longer be the
                  default. Instead, institutions of higher education must pivot from their dependence
                  on soft-money “support” (on external monies that do not necessarily seed long-term pedagogical change) and,
                  instead, begin now to endow student and community-based Black DH practices. It is
