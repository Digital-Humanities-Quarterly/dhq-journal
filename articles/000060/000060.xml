            <p>This poster introduces some of the rhetorical and ethical dimensions that underpin
               the graphics and visuals designed to illustrate results from a computer simulation.
               Simulations have been used by meteorologists to predict and report weather behavior,
               by climatologists to forewarn about the inevitable damage that global warning will
               cause, and by government officials to foresee the potential destruction of a major
               hurricane. In particular, my poster examines the latter — a set of visuals from
               Hurricane Pam, a computer simulation and set of training exercises that predicted the
               devastation that Hurricane Katrina would cause one year prior to the tragedy. FEMA
               conducted preparation workshops for state and local officials, arming them with
               workbooks with projection maps, conceptual models, and other visuals meant to help
               ready them. This poster seeks to understand what part the visuals might have played
               in preparation failure.</p>

            <p>This poster introduces some of the rhetorical and ethical dimensions that underpin
               the graphics and visuals designed to illustrate results from a computer simulation.
               Simulations have been used by meteorologists to predict and report weather behavior,
               by climatologists to forewarn about the inevitable damage that global warning will
               cause, and by government officials to foresee the potential destruction of a major
               hurricane. In particular, my poster examines the latter — a set of visuals from
               Hurricane Pam, a computer simulation and set of training exercises that predicted the
               devastation that Hurricane Katrina would cause one year prior to the tragedy. FEMA
               conducted preparation workshops for state and local officials, arming them with
               workbooks with projection maps, conceptual models, and other visuals meant to help
               ready them. This poster seeks to understand what part the visuals might have played
               in preparation failure.</p>
            <p>The poster raises questions pertaining to the nature and ethics of the simulated
               illustration, first by engaging simulated visuals in terms of visual rhetoric, or
               their capacity to persuade. Computer simulations are meant to stand-in for the real
               thing. Simulated visuals represent virtual events in much the same way that
               photographs represent actual events. However, since simulated visuals represent
               predictions, they vary in the extent to which they capture all of the fine-grained
               surface details of the source — the more accurate the simulation, the more the
               simulated visual can have the realistic value of photographs (or what Benjamin calls
                  <q>aura</q> or authenticity). Unfortunately, in the case of visuals from Hurricane
               Pam, design decisions <emph>further removed</emph> the representations from the
               potential tragedy. </p>
            <p>The poster also broaches issues of visual ethics. If simulated visuals parallel
               photographs, then do they have capacity for photographic truth? In some cases, even
               when simulated visuals are not perfect replicas, they still manage to convey a
               virtual truth sufficient to teach and inform audiences. In the case of Hurricane
               Pam’s maps and illustrations, major design elements did not paint a humane, complex,
               or realistic enough picture to help prepare workshop attendees. The poster explores
               these questions and draws some basic conclusions about the verisimilitude and
               veracity of simulation visuals. </p>
