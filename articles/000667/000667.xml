				<p>Imagine a world in which research was valued so that research records were not
					periodically lost at the end of every research project. To avoid project endings
					resulting in data loss, researchers need a long-term data service that ensures
					continued access to their primary records. Storage on hard disks is not
					curation; it simply amasses files with no metadata, no license or deposit
					conditions, and no public access. In the absence of institutional or national
					work to preserve the outputs of research in our disciplines of linguistics and
					musicology, our project, the Pacific and Regional Archive for Digital Sources in
					Endangered Cultures (PARADISEC), developed exemplary methods and services for
					curating research data based on accepted standards for metadata and data
					formats. The data we have focused on is analog tape, recorded in fieldwork, and
					often the only recording made in a particular indigenous language. Initially
					recorded for the purposes of research, these recordings have heritage value to
					the people recorded and their descendants. In addition, we provide citable data
					for use in building on existing research that was previously inaccessible. We
					continue to train new generations of researchers to create well-described
					research materials, recognizing that archival formats should be created in the
					course of normal research to make the whole process of curation much easier for
					both the depositor and the archive. Researchers seek advice about how to manage
					their records and are open to learning how to make better records that they will
					be able to access in future. We act as a repository that curates and preserves
					research at all stages of its creation: recordings deposited during fieldwork,
					or at the end of a research project or a researcher’s career (or life). To
					support longevity we have always written an XML file of the complete catalog
					entry to the item (the package of files) updated each time the catalog entry is
					updated, so each item is self-describing. We are now developing an innovative
					curation method using emerging technology (Oxford Common File Layout and
					Research Object Crate) to ensure the collection can be decoupled from a catalog
					and still be self-describing, a first step to ensuring longevity.</p>
				<p>And, perhaps more important than any of this, digitization has allowed us to
					engage with the communities in the Pacific, Papua New Guinea (PNG), and
					South-East Asia that are the source of the recordings, which we can now return,
					sometimes half a century or more after they were made.</p>
				<p>We address the following research questions. How can we ensure the records we
					create in the course of our research will exist into the future and remain
					citable (see Coble and Karlin in this issue)? How can our research data be made
					available for a wider public, most importantly for the people recorded and their
					descendants? How can we prepare our students for this new approach to curation
					of primary research data so that they can build good methodology into their
					normal research practice, with much more productive outcomes? Finally, having
					built a collection of research data from projects that have ended, how can we
					manage this into the future? PARADISEC could be criticized for creating a
					collection that has no future, as there is no commitment from a national agency
					to the long-term carriage of the collection, but we suggest that we are not
					alone in this and that cases like PARADISEC need to be addressed as part of a
					strategic approach to research infrastructure. We have shown that it is possible
					to build the basis of future research by curating existing primary research
					material, and, in doing that, to provide access to research materials for the
					broader community. For each depositor their described and structured collection
					is typically in better shape than it was on their laptops or hard disks.</p>
				<p>The loss of records when a research project ends is a major tragedy that needs to
					be avoided (see also Otis in this issue). For digital projects, the evanescence
					of the digital threatens imminent loss from any number of threats, such as power
					loss, physical breakdown of equipment, or network failure. For analog records,
					the senescence of unique media threatens loss by deterioration and is
					exacerbated by the lack of playback machinery. Much of the primary research data
					of linguistics, musicology, and anthropology from the latter part of the last
					century is still located on analog media and there is no more final ending to
					research data than its decay into unusability. There is an international effort
					to build language archives that are mainly based in Europe and North America,
					and linked by a network called the Digital Endangered Languages and Musics
					Archives Network (DELAMAN).<note>
						<ref target="https://delaman.org">https://delaman.org</ref></note> Further,
					the Open Language Archives Community<note>
						<ref target="http://www.language-archives.org"
							>http://www.language-archives.org</ref></note> has developed a standard
					metadata set that these archives can use that allows for interoperability
					between language archives. </p>
				<p>In Australia, hundreds of analog tapes were at risk of loss as no national
					institution had it in their mandate to collect tapes containing material from
					outside of Australia. Experts predict <ptr target="#nfsa2017"/> that analog
					tapes will be largely unplayable by the year 2025 due to media breakdown and a
					lack of playback machinery, and, in many places, the task of preservation and
					repatriation of the content of these tapes remains to be taken up. Our research
					group, based at three Australian universities, addressed this challenge in the
					early 2000s by building a repository and digitization workflow that now includes
					210 terabytes of material, representing 1,350 languages in 16,000 hours of audio
					recordings along with manuscript and video materials. Many of these languages
					represent small<note> These could also be called endangered languages, but that
						would limit the focus of our work. While <q>endangered</q> is part of the
						name we established at the outset, it is probably not the most appropriate
						term to use to cover the many cultures and languages that continue to be
						spoken, even with few speakers, that are targeted by our work, hence my use
						of the term <q>small</q> language, following <ptr target="#dorian2014"/>.
					</note> communities of indigenous speakers in the Pacific, South-East Asia, and
					PNG, and are under-resourced (in number of online resources available), and so
					the imperative to ensure their records are findable and accessible is all the
					more urgent <ptr target="#barwick2018"/>. Linguists increasingly require
					citation of primary records for the purposes of research, and in order to build
					new kinds of materials on the original records (books, online presentations,
					dictionaries, and so on), and that is predicated on those records having
					persistent identification, provided by a suitable repository. Thus, while there
					is in our case a particular imperative to ensuring these records are properly
					made, described, and curated, the same principles can be applied to research in
					many disciplines. </p>
				<p>In the course of doing this work, we train new researchers in appropriate methods
					for creating reusable primary records, and we have built a platform for citation
					of data, allowing for verification and licensed reuse of that data. We have done
					this training with several 1-year infrastructure grants over the 20-year life of
					the project. While there was an Australian National Data Service, it
					paradoxically did not curate data but served metadata and provided data storage
					with no guarantee of longevity. The current Australian Research Data Commons
					(ARDC) also has no national service for curating research data (and so, no
						<q>Commons,</q> its focus being on infrastructure for current research).
					Neither national service had or has within its mandate to implement an ongoing
					data curation service that would house primary research records into the future.
					So, despite large funding sources apparently available for research data, they
					are typically not available for curating the kinds of humanities and social
					science (HASS) records we are concerned with in PARADISEC, nor to make them
						FAIR.<note> ARDC and similar services all subscribe to the FAIR principles
							(<ref target="https://www.force11.org/group/fairgroup/fairprinciples"
							>https://www.force11.org/group/fairgroup/fairprinciples</ref>) of
						Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable data, but, without a
						long-term repository with licenses for re-use, data can not actually be FAIR
						beyond the current funding cycle. </note>
				</p>
				<p>For our community of linguists, musicologists, and ethnographers, this lack of
					mandate is a particularly acute problem as our records are the result of
					fieldwork that has taken some effort to undertake, usually in remote areas in
					Australia, PNG, or the island nations of the Pacific <ptr
						target="#thieberger2012a"/>. We enter into relationships with people whose
					languages or cultural traditions we record, and we want to act responsibly by
					making the recordings available to them into the future. These are sometimes the
					only recordings and perhaps the only presence of speakers of this language on
					the web. Furthermore, many of these small languages are at risk of loss, and
					some are no longer spoken due to many factors. So we have endangered records of
					endangered languages, compounding the responsibility of researchers to ensure
					they lodge records in a secure repository, or, if that repository does not
					exist, to build it, as we did with PARADISEC.</p>
				<p>For our forebears it was not a simple matter to make recordings available to the
					communities they worked in. Analog tape could be returned to national cultural
					centres that had playback equipment, but there was no such capacity outside of
					capital cities. Clearly a colonial mindset was also at play, in which the
					records were taken as being the property of the recorder who typically made no
					provision for their long-term preservation <ptr target="#thieberger2020"/>. In
					the latter part of the twentieth century there was not the necessary
					institutional infrastructure to look after these recordings in Australia, with
					the result that many fieldtapes remained in the possession of retired
					researchers, or in the hands of their executors once they had died.</p>
				<p>This situation motivated a collaboration of linguists and musicologists who were
					successful in obtaining a one-year infrastructure grant from the Australian
					Research Council in 2003. With the title <title rend="quotes">Pacific and
						Regional Archive for Digital Sources in Endangered Cultures
						(PARADISEC),</title> we set the goal of digitizing 500 hours of recordings
					in the first year. We established a metadata schema to describe the files we
					created, conforming to DCMI<note>
						<ref target="https://dublincore.org">https://dublincore.org</ref>.</note>
					and the Open Language Archives Community (OLAC)<note>
						<ref target="http://www.language-archives.org/"
							>http://www.language-archives.org/</ref></note>. With advice from the National Library of
					Australia and the National Film and Sound Archive, we bought reel to reel tape
					and cassette playback machines and employed an audio-engineer. Over time we
					built a lab with high quality analog to digital audio converters, a tape
					cleaning system, and a vacuum oven (required to re-adhere magnetic media to
					their carrier polyester tape backing) to deal with the range of conditions in
					which tapes were presented to us. With this foundation, we kept locating more
					and more tapes, and finding small grants to support continual digitization over
					the past 20 years. We have now digitized about 7,900 hours of analog tape, and
					house a further 8,000 hours of born-digital audio. Together with 2,600 hours of
					video and many text files, there are 420,000 files organized into 680
					collections.</p>
				<p>On accessing the collection, delivery versions of high resolution files are
					automatically created, for example, wav files have mp3 versions and tif files
					have jpg versions. A digital object identifier (doi) is assigned to all public
					collections, items, and files. Depositors assign rights, licensing the use of
					the files, which can include making items closed to all users except those
					nominated by the depositor (who can alter access conditions over time). They can
					also make items or collections private, which means no search engine finds them,
					and no doi is assigned, which is useful when a collection is being constructed.
					Once users are registered, they are then able to access any ‘open’ item, having
					first agreed to standard access conditions.</p>
				<p>To maximize access to the collection, our catalog has several APIs that are
					picked up by national and international aggregators, including OLAC<note>
						<ref target="http://www.language-archives.org/"
							>http://www.language-archives.org/</ref></note>, Research Data Australia<note>
						<ref target="https://researchdata.edu.au"
						>https://researchdata.edu.au</ref></note>, and the National Library of
					Australia’s TROVE<note>
						<ref target="https://trove.nla.gov.au/"
						>https://trove.nla.gov.au/</ref></note>. OLAC, in turn, presents its
					harvested records in single pages per language so that our metadata is then
					available along with any other material related to any one of the 7,000 or so of
					the world’s languages. And, of course, Google also picks up our catalog.</p>
				<p>There are many locations in the world for which internet access is difficult, and
					often expensive, and so access to heritage materials in or near their source
					communities remains problematic. A solution we have tested in a few locations (a
					village in Vanuatu, an Australian Western Desert community, workshops in Honiara
					and in Papeete) is to load relevant items from the collection onto a small
					low-powered computer, known as a Raspberry Pi<note><ref
							target="https://language-archives.services/about/pi/"
							>https://language-archives.services/about/pi/</ref></note>, which
					includes a wifi transmitter. We plug in a usb drive with a catalog of just those
					files in a simple html form that can be retrieved on a mobile phone, from a
					local signal transmitted by the Raspberry Pi, independent of any internet
					access. The catalog is created by a service we wrote, called
							dataloader<note><ref
							target="https://language-archives.services/about/data-loader/"
							>https://language-archives.services/about/data-loader/</ref></note>,
					that harvests the XML file stored in each item and then creates the catalog of
					just that small collection. This catalog includes services that allow video
					files to be viewed, audio files to be heard, and pdf files to be scrolled. All
					files can then be downloaded to the mobile phone without being impeded by
					bandwidth considerations. In 2022/23 we plan to provide installations of these
					units to regional cultural centres (museums and similar agencies) in the Pacific
					so that files can be accessed locally. Recall that these are recordings made in
					the past few generations. They were analog tapes of people from villages in many
					locations, stored inaccessibly, and so they have not been available for the
					people recorded or their families. Once these recordings are back in the
					relevant communities they can inspire revitalization of oral traditions and
					additional contextual information that can enrich our catalog. </p>

				<head>What has been preserved?</head>
				<p>While the total hours and size of the collection is impressive, it is the content
					of each of the files that gives a sense of the enormous value held by PARADISEC.
					For example, a major collection among those that initially motivated our project
					was that left by Arthur Capell, the professor at the University of Sydney in the
					1950s, with tapes in nearly 300 languages<note><ref
							target="https://dx.doi.org/10.4225/72/56E7A74251D08"
							>https://dx.doi.org/10.4225/72/56E7A74251D08</ref> You must be logged in
						as a registered user to access the files in this collection.</note>, and
					thousands of pages of notes<note><ref
							target="https://paradisec.org.au/fieldnotes/AC2.htm"
							>https://paradisec.org.au/fieldnotes/AC2.htm</ref></note>. All of this
					was left in the house of Capell’s executor, who undertook the massive task of
					managing and describing the tapes and papers. We have <ref
						target="https://paradisec.org.au/fieldnotes/AC2.htm">digitized this
						collection</ref> as some 1,300 items, and put it online. This includes over
					15,000 pages of notes from a large number of Pacific and south-east Asian
					languages, together with many recordings on open reels and cassettes. In my own
					experience, in Capell’s collection I have found a recording of a speaker of
					Nafsan, the language that I research in Vanuatu, and took that recording and
					associated notes back to the village where speakers live. The speakers can now
					also access all of this information via mobile phones themselves. So, a
					collection that was previously available only to visitors to the executor’s
					house is now an openly available and licensed set of research and heritage
					material. The physical copies of these items are held by the National Library of
					Australia.</p>
				<p>An unsolicited collection was offered to us by Ruth Roesler, who had no other
					suitable repository available to her. This work, created with her husband Calvin
					Roesler in the 1950s<note>
						<ref target="https://dx.doi.org/10.4225/72/56E824684C625"
							>https://dx.doi.org/10.4225/72/56E824684C625</ref></note>, was among the
					Asmat people of the south coast of what is now West Papua. It includes
					folktales, origin stories, documentations of customs, songs, descriptions of
					daily life and linguistic analysis. Items 001 to 054 were open reel audio
					recordings that we digitized and all following items are notes, most of which
					are transcripts of audio, and we have also put these into an online display<note>
						<ref target="https://paradisec.org.au/fieldnotes/ROES/web/serieslist.htm"
							>https://paradisec.org.au/fieldnotes/ROES/web/serieslist.htm</ref></note>. </p>
				<p>We worked with the anthropologist Ian Frazer who had more than 200 cassettes, and
					40 open reels recorded from 1971 to 1985, in fieldwork in North Malaita, Solomon
					Islands, mainly in To'abaita but with neighbouring groups as well (Lau,
					Baelelea, Pijin). These are recordings of music (traditional and contemporary),
					traditional stories, history, life histories, traditional and present day
					customs/culture, political history, labour history, and much else. This
					collection was located as a result of PARADISEC's <title rend="quotes">Lost and
						Found</title><note>
						<ref target="https://www.delaman.org/project-lost-found"
							>https://www.delaman.org/project-lost-found</ref></note> project and
					digitization was funded by an Endangered Languages Documentation Programme
					Legacy Materials Grant and the ARC Centre of Excellence for the Dynamics of
					Language.</p>
				<p>An important aspect of all of this work is taking inaccessible records and
					preparing them for access, including licensing, and online curation. As noted in
						<ptr target="#thieberger2020"/>, by archiving with PARADISEC, records made
					with indigenous people are available to those people as soon as possible after
					they are recorded. As <ptr target="#jimerson2007" loc="256"/> notes, archives
					contribute to the public interest <quote rend="inline">by documenting
						underrepresented social groups and fostering ethnic and community
						identities.</quote> Similarly, Smith observes that </p>
				<cit>
					<quote rend="block">imperialism and colonialism brought complete disorder to
						colonized peoples, disconnecting them from their histories, their
						landscapes, their languages, their social relations and their own ways of
						thinking, feeling and interacting with the world. […] To discover how
						fragmented this process was one needs only to stand in a museum, a library,
						a bookshop, and ask where indigenous peoples are located.</quote>
					<ptr target="#smith1999" loc="28"/>
				</cit>
				<p>I suggest that the process of making records available addresses some of Smith’s
					concerns and works to decolonize academic practice. </p>
				<p>To represent the beauty of the sounds in many of our collections, we have written
					a soundscape that takes a curated set of samples of audio and displays it on a
					map, playing a sample together with the metadata<note>
						<ref target="https://www.paradisec.org.au/Soundscape/index.html"
							>https://www.paradisec.org.au/Soundscape/index.html</ref></note>. This
					kind of view is possible because the collection has a predictable structure,
					includes geographic metadata, and automatically transcodes files to a
					deliverable mp3 on ingestion. The soundscape provides another way to discover
					the material in the collection. We also made a virtual reality exploration of a
					geographic landscape in which shards of light emanating from the ground
					represent each language, allowing users to navigate between them, and hearing,
					in effect, a forest of languages as they pass through them.<note>
						<ref target="https://glossopticon.com">https://glossopticon.com</ref></note>
					In a similar vein, material from our collection has been used by the artist Lena
					Herzog in her work <title rend="quotes">Last Whispers.</title><note>
						<ref target="https://www.lenaherzog.com/last-whispers"
							>https://www.lenaherzog.com/last-whispers</ref></note>
				</p>
				<p>A collection of research data is of relevance to academic research as it provides
					a citable basis, for example, for verification of claims made in papers.
					Humanities research data has an additional appeal in that is it is likely to be
					comprehensible to the general public, and to be of particular relevance to the
					people involved in its creation. One way in which we are publicizing the
					collection is by producing a series of podcasts in which users of items in the
					collection discuss their reactions to finding the material, and, in some cases,
					relearn songs or oral tradition from the earlier materials.<note>

				<head>How to prevent data endings</head>
				<p>A repository can provide a solution for project endings for the primary data
					created in the course of research. Projects of fieldwork and analysis of
					language materials typically result in grammatical analysis, often a
					dissertation, or in publications that cite the primary data. Recently our
					discipline has focused more on citation of primary data to provide necessary
					context for analytical claims (<ptr target="#thieberger2016"/>, see also Holmes
					and Takeda, this volume). At the same time, we have increasingly recognized our
					responsibility to prepare records for the speakers we work with. These two
					desiderata have led to an understanding of the need to create records in ways
					that allow them to be re-used, which, in turn, requires training for the
					researcher. We run regular training courses in the tools and methods that will
					result in well-constructed research corpora, emphasizing the importance of
					standard metadata descriptions that can then be imported into PARADISEC’s
					catalog.</p>
				<p>In our experience, it is often only when arriving at the point of depositing
					records in an archive that a researcher consciously takes stock of their
					materials and prepares them in a structured format. At this point they may
					realize what remains to be done – which media have not been transcribed, which
					texts have not been annotated, which photographs are not identified, and so on.
					For most current researchers, this, in itself, is a satisfactory outcome.
					Regardless of the longevity of the archive, they are now able to find items in
					their own collections and to continue to build their research based on these
					well-structured data files. Of course, this management of research data is done
					more easily at the moment of creation of the records, and to assist with the
					task of building a well-structured collection from that moment, we have worked
					with colleagues<note>At the Endangered Languages Archive (London) and at the
						University of Hawa’i’ at Manoa, funded by the National Science Foundation,
						the ARC Centre of Excellence for the Dynamics of Language, and the
						Endangered Languages Documentation Programme.</note> to develop a metadata
					entry tool called Lameta<note><ref target="https://lameta.org"
							>https://lameta.org</ref>, written by John Hatton</note>, now available
					for general use. Lameta is a standalone app that presents files on your computer
					for description and organizes structured metadata that can then be exported to
					formats accepted by a range of existing language archives. For a researcher to
					end a project gracefully they need to have good guidance in managing their
					records, and a tool like Lameta is part of that guidance, making it as easy as
					possible to provide structured metadata. To promote the use of this and other
					tools we regularly run training workshops, and discuss the workflow <ptr
						target="#thieberger2012b"/> that takes records through from fieldwork,
					transcription, annotation, and to archiving.</p>
				<p>An example of the new life of research data is my own collection of recordings
					made in Efate (Vanuatu) since the mid-1990s in the local language Nafsan. I
					prepared a set of data using the tools expected of my discipline, with outputs
					conforming to the standards required by PARADISEC (high resolution media,
					textual transcripts, structured lexicon, and so on). A guide to this collection
					is available as a webpage.<note>
						<ref target="https://www.nthieberger.net/sefate.html"
							>https://www.nthieberger.net/sefate.html</ref></note> Some of this
					material was then prepared as a book of 70 bilingual stories, a dictionary
					produced both as a book and a phone app, and the corpus of audio and transcripts
					and texts has been used in four international projects examining particular
					linguistic features and each requiring a structured media and text corpus. A PhD
					student began work on analysing tense and aspect in the language by working
					through the texts, before going on to conduct her own fieldwork, and a postdoc
					worked in detail on aspects of the language that I had only briefly addressed.
					Several videos from my collection have been put onto Facebook pages by speakers
					of the language. None of this would have been possible if I had kept the records
					on my laptop, or lost them when the hard disk failed.</p>

				<head>PARADISEC’s endings</head>
				<p>We have ensured the longevity of many research collections in PARADISEC, all the
					while expecting that there would be a national digital repository that would
					take responsibility for collections like ours. There was in 2003 no national
					Australian repository for digital HASS research of this kind, motivating the
					work that we undertook, and, unfortunately, this continues to be the case. The
					timescale that projects like ours operate under is governed by funding cycles,
					and national research infrastructure for HASS in Australia is typically no
					different, usually with three-year horizons of funding and no commitment to
					long-term curation of the research data that has been invested in so heavily by
					the taxpayer. While repositories for genomics, bio-informatics, or
					astro-physical data are designated as national research capabilities<note>
						<ref
							target="https://www.dese.gov.au/national-research-infrastructure/funded-research-infrastructure-projects"
							>https://www.dese.gov.au/national-research-infrastructure/funded-research-infrastructure-projects</ref></note>
					whose future is assured by governments, not a single humanities data repository
					is granted that status. This is despite our collection, for example, being just
					a fraction of the size of any of these STEM repositories. There is an Australian
					national server program, and data storage is provided on a merit-based system
					which we have benefited from, to house both the online collection and a mirrored
					offsite copy. However, storage on its own is not enough to ensure the safety of
					a collection like ours: we provide a rich catalog and set of services to allow
					interaction with the data, including discipline-specific viewers for media and
					transcripts, citation forms for data, and feeds to international aggregators for
					this kind of material, using standard language identifiers to build resource
					guides for each language in the world. All of this contributes to the value of a
					curated repository, and is much more than simply storage on disk. Because of the
					lack of a national data service, we have continued to operate PARADISEC for 20
					years, despite funding hiatuses. We have built an automated system that allows
					ingestion of new items with minimal handling, and continues to provide access as
					long as the servers are running. This means that we can operate with a skeleton
					staff when needed, and, when funds are available, we can continue the more
					labour-intensive work of processing analog tapes. Clearly, this requires a
					commitment by our personnel that goes beyond a normal employment contract, a
					commitment for which we are all very grateful, and which has allowed the
					collection to endure over two decades so far. </p>
				<p>We have learned, in our efforts to uncover unique materials on closed-down
					servers or hard disks, that files on a disk are only part of the preservation
					story, and the very simple solution that this suggests is one that keeps data
					and metadata together. For the past decade each time we save a catalog item it
					writes an XML file to the collection, and any subsequent edits to that catalog
					item are saved to the same location, so that files and metadata are co-located.
					As a result, we were able to quickly take advantage of a small grant in 2019 to
					convert the catalog and collection to a new format, using Research Object Crate
					(RO-Crate) and inspired by a platform we called Arkisto<note>
						<ref target="https://arkisto-platform.github.io/"
							>https://arkisto-platform.github.io/</ref></note>. This creates bundles
					of data that can be stored on disk with no external catalog and that still
					maintain their contextual information, metadata, licence information, and access
					conditions, and so stand a far better chance of surviving into the future than
					files in proprietary systems, or those using monolithic databases for their
					descriptions. As the metadata is written in json, a commonly used format, it is
					not difficult to re-create a catalog of any of these bundles, independent of
					whatever software was used to create them originally. </p>
				<p>Future work on this promising development will include changing the user’s
					interaction with the collection to a single page application that is built from
					the collection itself, with regular indexing creating the page. For the time
					being our catalog will continue to create the metadata that is then stored in
					the RO-Crate file with the collection object. The new catalog viewer already has
					improved ways of interacting with the collection. For example, any media that
					has a time-aligned transcript is playable together with that transcript, and the
					text of the transcript is searchable. This means that the text in the entire
					collection can be searched and the selected chunk of media can be heard or seen
					for each search result. This viewer can be deployed to other ways of delivering
					the collection, for example, on a Raspberry Pi for local wifi access. Such
					microservices can be added to the system as required, with the underlying
					structure of the collection in the standard RO-Crate format. This makes the
					catalog available for delivery in various forms, allowing for tailoring to
					different user groups if required (for example, localizing the interface or
					changing search terms depending on who the target users are).</p>

				<head>Conclusion</head>
				<p>There is an urgent need for national repositories to take up the challenge
					presented by the increase in the number of orphaned and fragile digital
					projects. When those projects have created some of the few records in small
					languages there is a greater imperative to curate those records and ensure their
					longevity. The great risk to a collection of this kind is a lack of perennity
					common to all <q>ended projects,</q> and we advocate for national data services
					that will capitalize on the investments already made in each research grant,
					each research project, and each researcher’s effort.</p>
				<p>PARADISEC demonstrates a functioning repository that arises out of a disciplinary
					base. It models data management and provides training in data creation that
					benefits both the researcher and the repository, and as a result, the broader
					community can access curated and licensed items in the collection. PARADISEC has
					provided structure for collections that were previously disparate and
					undescribed. It has digitized analog materials and so made them more accessible.
					Copies of these collections are held by the depositors and, if permitted, by
					cultural or language centres relevant to the content of a particular collection.
					This, in itself, has been a valuable service provided by our project.</p>
				<p>Ended projects have found a home in PARADISEC in a format that will endure as
					properly structured and described files on disk, even if the worst case
					eventuates and the current repository has no further funding. Our challenge as
					researchers, and the challenge for national research infrastructure planners, is
					how to make collections like PARADISEC’s continue to provide access into the
					future. </p>
