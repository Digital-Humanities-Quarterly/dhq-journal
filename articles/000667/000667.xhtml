                  <div class="ptext" id="p1">Imagine a world in which research was valued so that research records were not
                     				periodically lost at the end of every research project. To avoid project endings
                     				resulting in data loss, researchers need a long-term data service that ensures
                     				continued access to their primary records. Storage on hard disks is not
                     				curation; it simply amasses files with no metadata, no license or deposit
                     				conditions, and no public access. In the absence of institutional or national
                     				work to preserve the outputs of research in our disciplines of linguistics and
                     				musicology, our project,
                     				the Pacific and Regional Archive for Digital Sources in Endangered Cultures
                     				(PARADISEC), developed exemplary methods and services for curating research data
                     				based on accepted standards for metadata and data formats. The data we have
                     				focused on is analog tape, recorded in fieldwork, and often the only recording
                     				made in a particular indigenous language. Initially recorded for the purposes
                     of
                     				research, these recordings have heritage value to the people recorded and their
                     				descendants. In addition, we provide citable data for use in building on
                     				existing research that was previously inaccessible. We continue to train new
                     				generations of researchers to create well-described research materials,
                     				recognizing that archival formats should be created in the course of normal
                     				research to make the whole process of curation much easier for both the
                     				depositor and the archive. Researchers seek advice about how to manage their
                     				records and are open to learning how to make better records that they will be
                     				able to access in future. We act as a repository that curates and preserves
                     				research at all stages of its creation: recordings deposited during fieldwork,
                     				or at the end of a research project or a researcher’s career (or life). To
                     				support longevity we have always written an XML file of the complete catalog
                     				entry to the item (the package of files) updated each time the catalog entry is
                     				updated, so each item is self-describing. We are now developing an innovative
                     				curation method using emerging technology (Oxford Common File Layout and
                     				Research Object Crate) to ensure the collection can be decoupled from a catalog
                     				and still be self-describing, a first step to ensuring longevity.</div>

                  <div class="ptext" id="p2">And, perhaps more important than any of this, digitization has allowed us to
                     				engage with the communities in the Pacific, Papua New Guinea (PNG), and
                     				South-East Asia that are the source of the recordings, which we can now return,
                     				sometimes half a century or more after they were made.</div>

                     				create in the course of our research will exist into the future and remain
                     				citable (see Coble and Karlin in this issue)? How can our research data be made
                     				available for a wider public, most importantly for the people recorded and their
                     				descendants? How can we prepare our students for this new approach to curation

                     				built a collection of research data from projects that have ended, how can we
                     				manage this into the future? PARADISEC could be criticized for creating a
                     				collection that has no future, as there is no commitment from a national agency
                     				to the long-term carriage of the collection, but we suggest that we are not
                     				alone in this and that cases like PARADISEC need to be addressed as part of a
                     				strategic approach to research infrastructure. We have shown that it is possible
                     				to build the basis of future research by curating existing primary research
                     				material, and, in doing that, to provide access to research materials for the
                     				broader community. For each depositor their described and structured collection
                     				is typically in better shape than it was on their laptops or hard disks.</div>

                  <div class="ptext" id="p4">The loss of records when a research project ends is a major tragedy that needs to
                     				be avoided (see also Otis in this issue). For digital projects, the evanescence
                     				of the digital threatens imminent loss from any number of threats, such as power
                     				loss, physical breakdown of equipment, or network failure. For analog records,
                     				the senescence of unique media threatens loss by deterioration and is
                     				exacerbated by the lack of playback machinery. Much of the primary research data
                     				of linguistics, musicology, and anthropology from the latter part of the last
                     				century is still located on analog media and there is no more final ending to
                     				research data than its decay into unusability. There is an international effort
                     				to build language archives that are mainly based in Europe and North America,
                     				and linked by a network called the Digital Endangered Languages and Musics
                     				Archives Network (DELAMAN).<a class="noteRef" href="#d3e201">[2]</a> Further, the Open
                     				Language Archives Community<a class="noteRef" href="#d3e206">[3]</a> has
                     				developed a standard metadata set that these archives can use that allows for
                     				interoperability between language archives. </div>

                  <div class="ptext" id="p5">In Australia, hundreds of analog tapes were at risk of loss as no national
                     				institution had it in their mandate to collect tapes containing material from
                     				outside of Australia. Experts predict [<a class="ref" href="#nfsa2017">NFSA 2017</a>] that analog tapes will be
                     				largely unplayable by the year 2025 due to media breakdown and a lack of
                     				playback machinery, and, in many places, the task of preservation and
                     				repatriation of the content of these tapes remains to be taken up. Our research
                     				group, based at three Australian universities, addressed this challenge in the
                     				early 2000s by building a repository and digitization workflow that now includes
                     				150 terabytes of material, representing 1,300 languages in 14,000 hours of audio
                     				recordings along with manuscript and video materials. Many of these languages
                     				represent small<a class="noteRef" href="#d3e217">[4]</a> communities of indigenous speakers in the Pacific, South-East Asia, and PNG, and
                     				are under-resourced (in number of online resources available), and so the
                     				imperative to ensure their records are findable and accessible is all the more
                     				urgent [<a class="ref" href="#barwick2018">Barwick and Thieberger 2018</a>]. Linguists increasingly require citation of
                     				primary records for the purposes of research, and in order to build new kinds
                     of
                     				materials on the original records (books, online presentations, dictionaries,
                     				and so on), and that is predicated on those records having persistent
                     				identification, provided by a suitable repository. Thus, while there is in our
                     				case a particular imperative to ensuring these records are properly made,
                     				described, and curated, the same principles can be applied to research in many
                     				disciplines. </div>

                  <div class="ptext" id="p6">In the course of doing this work, we train new researchers in appropriate methods
                     				for creating reusable primary records, and we have built a platform for citation
                     				of data, allowing for verification and licensed reuse of that data. We have done
                     				this training with several 1-year infrastructure grants over the
                     				20-year life of the project. While there was an Australian National Data
                     				Service, it paradoxically did not curate data but served metadata and provided
                     				data storage with no guarantee of longevity. The current Australian Research
                     				Data Commons (ARDC) also has no national service for curating research data (and
                     				so, no “Commons,” its focus being on infrastructure for current research).
                     				Neither national service had or has within its mandate to implement an ongoing

                     				So, despite large funding sources apparently available for research data, they

                     				available to them into the future. These are sometimes the only recordings and
                     				perhaps the only presence of speakers of this language on the web. Furthermore,
                     				many of these small languages are at risk of loss, and some are no longer spoken
                     				due to many factors. So we have endangered records of endangered languages,
                     				compounding the responsibility of researchers to ensure they lodge records in
                     a
                     				secure repository, or, if that repository does not exist, to build it, as we did

                     				centres that had playback equipment, but there was no such capacity outside of
                     				capital cities. Clearly a colonial mindset was also at play, in which the
                     				records were taken as being the property of the recorder who typically made no

                     				many fieldtapes remained in the possession of retired researchers, or in the

                     				Research Council in 2003. With the title “Pacific and Regional Archive for
                     				Digital Sources in Endangered Cultures (PARADISEC),” we set the goal of
                     				digitizing 500 hours of recordings in the first year. We established a metadata
                     				schema to describe the files we created, conforming to DCMI<a class="noteRef" href="#d3e255">[6]</a> and the Open Language Archives Community
                     					(OLAC)<a class="noteRef" href="#d3e261">[7]</a>. With advice from the
                     				National Library of Australia and the National Film and Sound Archive, we bought
                     				reel to reel tape and cassette playback machines and employed an audio-engineer.
                     				Over time we built a lab with high quality analog to digital audio converters,
                     a
                     				tape cleaning system, and a vacuum oven (required to re-adhere magnetic media
                     to
                     				their carrier polyester tape backing) to deal with the range of conditions in
                     				which tapes were presented to us. With this foundation, we kept locating more
                     				and more tapes, and finding small grants to support continual digitization over

                     				For example, a major collection among those that initially motivated our project
                     				was that left by Arthur Capell, the professor at the University of Sydney in the
                     				1950s, with tapes in nearly 300
                     				languages<a class="noteRef" href="#d3e304">[13]</a>, and thousands of pages of
                     				notes<a class="noteRef" href="#d3e309">[14]</a>. All of this
                     				was left in the house of Capell’s executor, who undertook the massive task of
                     				managing and describing the tapes and papers. As can be seen by following the
                     				link in footnote 11, we have digitized this collection as some 1,300 items, and
                     				put it online. This includes over 15,000 pages of notes from a large number of
                     				Pacific and south-east Asian languages, together with many recordings on open
                     				reels and cassettes. In my own experience, in Capell’s collection I have found
                     a
                     				recording of a speaker of Nafsan, the language that I research in Vanuatu, and
                     				took that recording and associated notes back to the village where speakers
                     				live. The speakers can now also access all of this information via mobile phones
                     				themselves. So, a collection that was previously available only to visitors to
                     				the executor’s house is now an openly available and licensed set of research and
                     				heritage material. The physical copies of these items are held by the National

                  <div class="ptext" id="p23">We have ensured the longevity of many research collections in PARADISEC, all the
                     				while expecting that there would be a national digital repository that would
                     				take responsibility for collections like ours. There was in 2003 no national
                     				Australian repository for digital HASS research of this kind, motivating the
                     				work that we undertook, and, unfortunately, this continues to be the case. The
                     				timescale that projects like ours operate under is governed by funding cycles,
                     				and national research infrastructure for HASS in Australia is typically no
                     				different, usually with three-year horizons of funding and no commitment to
                     				long-term curation of the research data that has been invested in so heavily by
                     				the taxpayer. While repositories for genomics, bio-informatics, or
                     				astro-physical data are designated as national research capabilities<a class="noteRef" href="#d3e421">[25]</a>
                     				whose future is assured by governments, not a single humanities data repository
                     				is granted that status. This is despite our collection, for example, being just
                     				a fraction of the size of any of these STEM repositories. There is an Australian
                     				national server program, and data storage is provided on a merit-based system
                     				which we have benefited from, to house both the online collection and a mirrored
                     				offsite copy. However, storage on its own is not enough to ensure the safety of
                     				a collection like ours: we provide a rich catalog and set of services to allow
                     				interaction with the data, including discipline-specific viewers for media and
                     				transcripts, citation forms for data, and feeds to international aggregators for
                     				this kind of material, using standard language identifiers to build resource
                     				guides for each language in the world. All of this contributes to the value of
                     a
                     				curated repository, and is much more than simply storage on disk. Because of the
                     				lack of a national data service, we have continued to operate PARADISEC for 19
                     				years, despite funding hiatuses. We have built an automated system that allows
                     				ingestion of new items with minimal handling, and continues to provide access
                     as
                     				long as the servers are running. This means that we can operate with a skeleton
                     				staff when needed, and, when funds are available, we can continue the more
                     				labour-intensive work of processing analog tapes. Clearly, this requires a
                     				commitment by our personnel that goes beyond a normal employment contract, a
                     				commitment for which we are all very grateful, and which has allowed the
                     				collection to endure over two decades so far. </div>

                  <div class="ptext" id="p24">We have learned, in our efforts to uncover unique materials on closed-down servers
                     				or hard disks, that files on a disk are only part of the preservation story, and
                     				the very simple solution that this suggests is one that keeps data and metadata
                     				together. For the past decade each time we save a catalog item it writes an XML
                     				file to the collection, and any subsequent edits to that catalog item are saved
                     				to the same location, so that files and metadata are co-located. As a result,
                     we
                     				were able to quickly take advantage of a small grant in 2019 to convert the
                     				catalog and collection to a new format, using Research Object Crate (RO-Crate)
                     				and inspired by a platform we called Arkisto<a class="noteRef" href="#d3e429">[26]</a>. This creates bundles of data
                     				that can be stored on disk with no external catalog and that still maintain
                     				their contextual information, metadata, licence information, and access
                     				conditions, and so stand a far better chance of surviving into the future than
                     				files in proprietary systems, or those using monolithic databases for their
                     				descriptions. As the metadata is written in json, a commonly used format, it is
                     				not difficult to re-create a catalog of any of these bundles, independent of
                     				whatever software was used to create them originally. </div>

                  <div class="ptext" id="p25">Future work on this promising development will include changing the user’s
                     				interaction with the collection to a single page application that is built from
                     				the collection itself, with regular indexing creating the page. For the time
                     				being our catalog will continue to create the metadata that is then stored in
                     				the RO-Crate file with the collection object. The new catalog viewer already has
                     				improved ways of interacting with the collection. For example, any media that
                     				has a time-aligned transcript is playable together with that transcript, and the
                     				text of the transcript is searchable. This means that the text in the entire
                     				collection can be searched and the selected chunk of media can be heard or seen
                     				for each search result. This viewer can be deployed to other ways of delivering
                     				the collection, for example, on a Raspberry Pi for local wifi access. Such
                     				microservices can be added to the system as required, with the underlying
                     				structure of the collection in the standard RO-Crate format. This makes the
                     				catalog available for delivery in various forms, allowing for tailoring to
                     				different user groups if required (for example, localizing the interface or
                     				changing search terms depending on who the target users are).</div>
