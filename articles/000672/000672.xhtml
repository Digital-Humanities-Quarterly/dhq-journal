                  				In not only classrooms but also digital spaces, conceptual keywords are rich tools
                  for scholarship, teaching, and research. This article analyzes “climate change” as a keyword in contemporary literary studies to assess how the keyword's occurence
                  in the MLA International Bibliography frames metadata engagement. Encouraging access
                  to scholarship through effective keyword selection enables finding, citing, and responding
                  to important scholarship. Among other fields, contemporary literary studies and the
                  digital humanities will benefit from shared terms of engagement to encourage precision
                  with terms in a variety of contexts. Drawing on bibliometric analysis tools, I analyze
                  indexed citations from four academic journals: <cite class="title italic">ISLE: Interdisciplinary Studies in Literature and Environment</cite>; <cite class="title italic">Contemporary Literature</cite>; <cite class="title italic">MFS Modern Fiction Studies</cite>; and <cite class="title italic">Publications of the Modern Language Association</cite>. Working with ISLE as a reference case and the latter three as test cases, I find
                  that the occurence of “climate change” as a keyword is less than that of a different, broader keyword: “enviromental crisis.” The disjunction in occurence rates between these two terms provides a keyword problematic
                  that requires further review. For each corpus, I discuss the ramifications of this
                  keyword problematic by highlighting significant intersections and disconnections.
                  To conclude, I reflect on the benefits of standardized indexing practices for contemporary
                  literary studies, the digital humanities, and emergent fields like the digital environmental
                  humanities.

                  <div class="ptext" id="p1"> The Marxist scholar and critic Raymond Williams was one of the first to suggest
                     				the importance of keywords for literary studies. Originally published in 1976,
                     				Williams’s book <cite class="title italic">Keywords: A Vocabulary of Culture and
                        					Society</cite> challenges conceptions of everyday terms through historical
                     				analysis. Specifically, Williams’s keywords demonstrate how shared discourse
                     				changes over time. As Williams notes, “When we come to say ‘we just don’t speak
                     				the same language’ we mean something more general: that we have different
                     				immediate values or different kinds of valuation, or that we are aware, often
                     				intangibly, of different formations and distributions of energy and interest” [<a class="ref" href="#williams2014">Williams 2014</a>, xxiii–xxiv]. Studying conceptual keywords in this view not only
                     				enables insights into semantic shifts but also reveals how historically
                     				contingent conditions embed themselves within such shifts. As such, composing
                     				keyword entries revealed to Williams that “words which seem to have been there
                     				for centuries, with continuous general meanings, have come in fact to express
                     				radically different or radically variable, yet sometimes hardly noticed,
                     				meanings and implications of meaning” [<a class="ref" href="#williams2014">Williams 2014</a>, xxix]. These insights have since
                     				generated a rich tradition of keyword analysis projects in the humanities,
                     				including but not limited to select critical theory books, the “Living Lexicon”
                     				series from the journal <cite class="title italic">Environmental Humanities</cite>, as well
                     				as the <cite class="title italic">Keywords </cite>series from New York University Press,
                     				which includes entries on disability, gender and sexuality, and environmental
                     				studies. </div>
                  			
                  <div class="counter"><a href="#p2">2</a></div>
                  <div class="ptext" id="p2"> Since Williams, scholars have relied on keywords in reading, writing, and
                     				teaching. For many today, a different kind of keyword engagement influences
                     				research methods. Keyword indexing in databases such as the Modern Language
                     				Association (MLA) International Bibliography facilitates access to published
                     				scholarship’s metadata. Selecting effective keywords on such databases enables
                     				the act of finding, citing, and responding to scholarship. Scholars interested
                     				in climate change, for instance, search databases for articles that effectively
                     				deal with the topic’s complexity, which, as Andrew Ross [<a href="#ross2016">2016</a>] notes, connects
                     				to historical ramifications for scientific knowledge and planetary, geopolitical
                     				conflict [<a class="ref" href="#ross2016">Ross 2016</a>, 38–40]. However, it is important to note for not only contemporary
                     				literary studies but also the digital humanities that disjunctions in database
                     				indexing impede digital access to scholarship. In this article, I explore how
                     				select academic journals from contemporary literary studies exemplify this
                     				disjunction through the occurrence of <em class="term">climate change</em> as a keyword. Applying
                     				the VOSviewer bibliometric analysis tool, I analyze thousands of unique
                     				citations in four academic journals representative of work in contemporary
                     				literary studies that I, as a scholar of the field, look to trendsetters. Large
                     				datasets of bibliographic data allow us to survey scholarship through their
                     				indexed citations and authorial networks [<a class="ref" href="#nolen2016">Nolen and Richardson 2016</a>] [<a class="ref" href="#friedman2017">Friedman and Bernstein 2017</a>] [<a class="ref" href="#lei2019">Lei and Liu 2019</a>] [<a class="ref" href="#earhart2021">Earhart et al. 2021</a>] [<a class="ref" href="#sanderman2021">Sanderson et al. 2021</a>]. Digital bibliometric analyses
                     				therefore enable scaled-up analyses of how keywords impact precise framing of
                     				and engagement with indexed research. </div>

                  <div class="ptext" id="p3"> The field of contemporary literary studies presents a valuable case study in how
                     				we categorize humanistic scholarship about climate change and related
                     				environmental issues because its scholarship reviews direct representations of
                     				climate change. Owing to established fields such as ecocriticism, the discipline
                     				enjoys many conferences, journal articles, and monographs dedicated to climate

                     				scholarship will only proliferate in the coming years. Digital humanists will
                     				thus benefit from looking at the use of keywords in contemporary literary
                     				studies. The field reflects ongoing some of the more significant developments
                     in
                     				humanities scholarship on myriad environmental issues, including but not limited
                     				to climate change. Deriving insights from a bibliometric analysis of
                     				contemporary literary studies will, in turn, suggest new possibilities for
                     				indexing scholarship to encourage engagement and access. While I go in more
                     				detail about the results below, this project’s central purpose is to identify
                     				how climate change occurs as an object of scholarly inquiry in the humanities
                     				through its use as a keyword in contemporary literary studies. </div>

                        				</cite>corpus as a reference case for the occurrence of <em class="term">climate change</em> as a
                     				keyword in a journal explicitly interested in environmental issues. With this
                     				corpus as a basis, I compare the other three corpora as benchmarks of
                     				contemporary literary studies scholarship. In selecting journals for analysis,
                     I
                     				gathered indexed citations from journals with approximately 500-750 results in
                     				the MLA International Bibliography. These results derive from filtering out
                     				non-English language results and citations that occur prior to 2000. The <cite class="title italic">ISLE </cite>corpus counts 665 unique citations; the <cite class="title italic">CL </cite>corpus counts 620; the <cite class="title italic">MFS
                        				</cite>corpus counts 763; and the <cite class="title italic">PMLA </cite>corpus counts 1,964.
                     				Though I considered journals such as <cite class="title italic">Environmental Humanities
                        				</cite>and <cite class="title italic">Resilience: A Journal of Environmental
                        					Humanities</cite> as supplemental reference cases to <cite class="title italic">ISLE</cite>, they were excluded because their indexed citation count in the

                  <div class="ptext" id="p5">Although the periodization of “contemporary literature” is highly contested
                     				[<a class="ref" href="#martin2019">Martin 2019</a>], I define my scope as including literature published from 1985 to
                     				the present while limiting scholarship on said literature from 2000 to early
                     				2022. I adopt this timeline because I am most interested in scholarship that
                     				addresses recent representations of climate change that benefit from engagement
                     				(or lack thereof) with the past three decades of climate science. At the same
                     				time, I acknowledge that these journals — beside <cite class="title italic">ISLE</cite> — do
                     				not tally significant counts of <em class="term">climate change</em> as a keyword because the topic
                     				was likely peripheral to their interests up until the last decade. However, I
                     				find them valuable test cases because they have since published on the topic
                     				and, thus, can be analyzed as a corpus with keyword connections that either do
                     				or do not reflect the topic’s many connections. With these variables in mind,
                     I
                     				assembled each journal’s corpus, limiting their indexed citations in the MLA
                     				International Bibliography to English-language citations from 2000 to the
                     				present. <a class="noteRef" href="#d3e335">[1]</a> I
                     				then exported the citations as research information system files to process with
                     				VOSviewer, a bibliometrics tool with modularity algorithms for visualizing
                     				author networks and keyword occurrence clusters [<a class="ref" href="#janvaneck2022">Jan Van Eck and Waltman</a>]. I
                     				initially isolated keywords that occur at least ten times in the top fifty
                     				keywords across the run of journal articles and book reviews, removing keywords
                     				that convey period duration or generalist categories. <a class="noteRef" href="#d3e340">[2]</a> I began
                     				with 10 keyword occurrences because that number suggests a keyword’s relative
                     				frequency in a corpus of at least 500 citations. If a <em class="term">climate change</em> cluster
                     				did not emerge at ten keywords, I decreased the occurrence count to five and,
                     if
                     				necessary, one keyword to find the climate change keyword cluster. I
                     				simultaneously increased the top count in permutations of 50, 100, and 1,000,
                     				while decreasing the occurrence count (if a cluster does not emerge in the top
                     				fifty, it will also emerge at subsequent scales). I followed these steps to
                     				determine the relative significance of “climate change” as a keyword in each
                     				reviewed corpus. </div>

                     				literary studies [<a class="ref" href="#goldstone2014">Golstone and Underwood 2014</a>], it also follows bibliometric
                     				analyses in applied environmental sciences that propose new avenues for research
                     				[<a class="ref" href="#haunschild2016">Haunschild et al. 2016</a>] [<a class="ref" href="#zyoud2020">Zyoud and Fuchs-Hanusch 2020</a>] [<a class="ref" href="#xiao2021">Xiao et al. 2021</a>]. Reconciling differences between these projects will inform framings
                     				of climate change in digital humanities research and points to the utility of
                     				digital interventions in the environmental humanities. Survey approaches of
                     				contemporary literary studies, ecocriticism, and the environment humanities
                     				precede this project, as we see in select articles from Ursula K. Heise [<a href="#heise2006a">2006a</a>]
                     				[<a href="#heise2006b">2006b</a>] [<a href="#heise2008">2008</a>] [<a href="#heise2013">2013</a>]. But because digital humanities tools can analyze
                     				thousands of citations in databases, scaled-up bibliometric analyses can model
                     				approach for determining common terms of engagement between otherwise
                     				disconnected disciplines. As such, I focus on climate change as a keyword
                     				because keywords such as “climate malaise,” “climate fatigue,” and “climate
                     				perturbation” are not commonly recognized. The project also must rely on the
                     				keywords provided by the indexers of the MLA International Bibliography:
                     				“climate change” is the keyword because it is what appears on the database. I
                     				follow this determined condition because climate change is a discursive
                     				mainstay, a keyword in the truest sense of William’s work. For example, a brief

Our empirical knowledge of climate change daily evolves with

                     				in popular media coverage or in everyday conversation, we commonly do not
                     				associate the phrase “environmental crisis” with ecological catastrophe more
                     				than we do “climate change.” As a conceptual keyword, “climate change” is
                     				commonplace among environmental humanists, scientists, and policymakers alike.
                     				Its appeal as a keyword lies in its shared distribution between possibly
                     				disparate groups. At the same time, the conceptual keyword “environmental
                     				crisis” may lend itself to complexities that “climate change” does not present
                     				because the former touches on issues such as pollution, biodiversity loss, and
                     				changing ecosystems. These more specific problems and their local occurrences
                     				are not always direct effects of climate change. Consequently, indexing an
                     				article with the keyword “environmental crisis” may misrepresent its account of
                     				environmental issues that require further contextualization. </div>

                     				through journals may remain the best way to assess their scholarship, many
                     				contemporary scholars instead rely on Googling, library search portal browsing,

                     				climate engineering, or climate fiction should be indexed with climate change
                     				only if the essay makes a significant connection between said topics and climate
                     				change. Such meaningful connections allow us to can avoid the nebulousness of
                     				“environmental crisis,” which I argue does not offer as many interdisciplinary
                     				inroads. This is not to overlook the fact that keyword indexing can be an
                     				imperfect practice; however, I hope my results show that it can be standardized
                     				for renowned publications interested in publishing on the topic. </div>

                  <div class="ptext" id="p27">A systematic adoption of keywords, as Williams writes, grants us “a vocabulary to
                     				use, to find our own ways in, to change as we find it necessary to change it,
                     as
                     				we go on making our own language and history” (<a href="#williams2014">xxxv-xxxvi</a>). Whether one works in
                     				contemporary literary studies or the digital humanities (or both), following
                     				similarly determined examples of keyword selection will ensure continued
                     				collective meaning making in scholarly discourse. Students, scholars, and
                     				teachers interested in DEH will also benefit from deliberate indexing choices.
                     				As the DEH take on new, forms, effective indexing practices that precisely frame
                     				discussions of climate change in teaching, scholarship, and outward facing
                     				projects will enrich the field’s interdisciplinary significance. At the same
                     				time, because “climate change” is a phrase with meaning beyond academic
                     				indexing, it can be a keyword that encompasses diverse yet globally
                     				interconnected environmental issues; subsuming it within the “environmental
                     				crisis” hierarchy only dilutes the outward access to such scholarship. </div>
