               represent the intermedia and performative textuality of a large corpus of
               experimental works and practices in an electronic database, including some early
               instances of digital literature. This article describes the multimodal editing of
               experimental works in terms of a hypertext rationale, and then demonstrates the
               performative nature of the remediation, emulation, and recreation involved in digital
               transcoding and archiving. Preservation, classification, and networked distribution
               of artifacts are discussed as representational problems within the current
               algorithmic and database aesthetics in knowledge production.

               practices in ways that draw attention to the performative nature of digital archiving
               itself.<a class="noteRef" href="#d3e212">[1]</a> Decisions about standards for digital encoding, metadata fields, database
               model, and querying methods impose their particular ontologies and structures to
               collections of heterogenous objects derived from historical practices that emphasized
               the eventive nature of signification as an interactive process of production. Instead
               of a transparent remediation of an original autograph object in its digital surrogate
               – a visual effect of the digital facsimile experience that is frequent in scholarly
               archives – multiplicity of media and versions, as well as the programmatic focus on
               live performance as poetic action, call for a self-conscious engagement with the
               differentials of inscription technologies and, ultimately, with the strangeness of
               digital codes as an expression of the performativity of the archive. The PO.EX
               project provided both a context for this heightened awareness of digital archiving as
               an act of transcoding, and an environment for experimenting with forms of archiving
               that attempted to respond to that self-consciousness about archival intervention.
               This article contains an overview of the project and offers an account of how the
               PO.EX Archive has wrestled to address the difficult theoretical questions raised by
               the progress of our research.</div>

                  <div class="ptext" id="p2">The name "PO.EX" contains the first syllables of the words
                  "POesia EXperimental" and it has been used as a general
               acronym for those and subsequent experimental practices since the first retrospective
               exhibition of the movement, which was held at the National Gallery of Art, Lisbon, in
               1980. A second major retrospective was organized by the Serralves Museum of
               Contemporary Art, Porto, in 1999. <a class="noteRef" href="#d3e249">[2]</a> The PO.EX project
               involved a multidisciplinary team of 13 researchers, with expertise in literary
               studies, communication and information sciences, contemporary art, and computer
               science. At various stages, the project also benefited from the collaboration of 6
               research assistants. A significant part of the work consisted of locating sources,
               digitizing, and classifying them. The <cite class="title italic">PO.EX Digital
                  Archive</cite> holds c. 5000 items in multiple formats (text, image, audio, and
               video files) and is scheduled for online publication at the end of 2013.<a class="noteRef" href="#d3e259">[3]</a> The recently
               finished second stage of the project (<cite class="title italic">PO.EX ’70-80</cite>,
               under development 2010-2013) digitized works from the 1970s and 1980s. It was
               preceded by an earlier project (<cite class="title italic">PO.EX ’60</cite>, under
               development 2005-2008) that digitized works from the 1960s, namely the magazines and
               exhibition catalogues of the Experimental Poetry movement. The result of the first
               stage was published in 2008 both as a web site and a CD-ROM. In its present
               instantiation PO.EX will be published as an open repository using DSpace.</div>

                  <div class="ptext" id="p3">Portuguese experimental literature of the 1960s, 1970s, and 1980s includes visual
               poetry, sound poetry, video-poetry, performance poetry, computer poetry, and several
               other forms of experimental writing. Experimental literary objects, practices, and
               events often consist of an interaction between notational forms on paper (or other
               forms of media inscription) and site-specific live performances. In experimental
               practices, the eventuality of literary meaning is dramatically foregrounded by
               turning the text into a script for an act whose performance co-constitutes the work.
               Such performative practices are poorly documented and yet they may exist in several
               media and in multiple versions. Multiplication of versions across media is another
               aspect of the laboratorial dimension of experimental aesthetics: a visual poem may
               have a version for gallery exhibition, and another for a book collection; its live
               reading may have been sound recorded or it may have become a script for a film or
               computer animation. Fragility and ephemerality of materials also characterize works
               that may have been produced in very small editions or in a single exhibition version.
               The aim of <cite class="title italic">PO.EX: A Digital Archive of Portuguese Experimental
                  Literatutre</cite> is to represent this intermedia and procedural textuality in a
               relational database and to explore the research and communicative potential of this
               new archival space.</div>
                  <div class="counter">

                  </div>
                  <div class="ptext" id="p4">The multimedia affordances of hypermedia textuality seem particularly adequate for
               representing those intermedia and performative dimensions of literary practices, and
               also for preserving the ephemeral nature of inscriptional traces that have taken
               multiple forms, including paper and book formats, video and sound recordings, live
               performances and public installations, computer codes and screen displays. The
               aggregation, structuring, and marking up of digital surrogates of this large
               multimodal corpus have interpretative implications that challenge our representations
               of experimental works and practices, and our database imagination for digital
               possibilities. Whether taking the form of facsimiles of books, photographs of
               installations, sound recordings of readings, videos of performances, or emulations of
               early digital poems, digital remediation re-performs the works for the current
               techno-social context. Editing intermedia texts for a digital environment forces us
               to address a number of specific questions related to documents, methods, contexts,
               and uses. </div>

                  <div class="ptext" id="p5"> The materials included in the <cite class="title italic">PO.EX Digital Archive </cite>
               are, in many ways, similar to those we may find in archives such as <cite class="title italic">UbuWeb</cite>, particularly in its early versions, which were
               focused on visual, concrete, and sound poetry. <a class="noteRef" href="#d3e288">[4]</a>
                     <cite class="title italic">UbuWeb</cite>, however, has grown as an open and decentered
               hypertext without explicit editing principles or scholarly methodology that would
               control the metadata about original sources and their digital remediations. Its
               emphasis falls on collaborative non-institutional construction and on a rationale of
               open access that uses the networked reproduction and distribution of files to provide
               global access to digital versions of rare materials in multiple media (print, sound,
               video, film, radio) that often exist only in limited copies or in inaccessible
               archives. Digital republication, by itself, contributes to a redefinition of the
               cultural and social history of creative practices, since many of these
               experimentations and communities of practice were generally absent from institutional
               print-based narratives of artistic and literary invention. <cite class="title italic">UbuWeb</cite>’s inclusive approach has created a vast repository of art
               practices, media, genres, and periods. This approach has produced a new context for
               understanding the nature and history of experimental forms in English (and, to a much
               lesser extent, in a few other languages and cultures) simply as a result of their
               hypertextual contiguity and networked availability. A similar effect may result from
               the PO.EX project: the mere aggregation of dispersed works and textual witnesses in
               various media – some of which were unaware of each other and entirely absent from
               mainstream accounts of contemporary literature and contemporary art – will produce a
               new perception of Portuguese experimental literature both for inside and outside
               observers. The following section briefly sketches some of the questions raised by the
                  <cite class="title italic">PO.EX Digital Archive</cite>, and describes its
               infrastructure and content.</div>

                  </div>
                  <div class="ptext" id="p6">Given that a significant part of the materials are rare, and in some cases exist only
               in a single instance, one of the declared aims of the PO.EX project is to collect and
               preserve our artistic and cultural heritage through digital remediation. This is
               especially true of (1) visual texts, collages and other ephemeral works of which
               there is only the original object, (2) sound and video recordings that have never
               been published or distributed before, and (3) computer works that cannot be run in
               current digital environments (see Torres 2010). A survey of published and unpublished
               materials housed in public and private collections, and sometimes in the writers’
               archives, revealed the existence of a large body of work in multiple media.<a class="noteRef" href="#d3e316">[5]</a> Three features are
               common to PO.EX authors: openness to experimentation in different technological media
               (such as printing techniques, audiotape, film, video, and computers); willingness to
               participate in the public sphere and engage in social and political debates
               (producing works for television, for instance, or works of public art); and a general
               inter-art sensibility that places verbal language in an intermedia tension with
               visual art, video art, installation, performance, theatre, and music. Representing
               the polymedia and polytextual dynamics of these works – within a network that
               includes, in some cases, preparatory documents and multiple versions, and also
               authorial and non-authorial critical texts – became the main theoretical and
               technical challenge of the project.</div>

                  <div class="ptext" id="p7">Our analysis and description of the collected materials recognized six types of
               materialities that were to be digitally represented in the archive: planographic,
               three-dimensional, phonographic, videographic, digital, and performative [see <a href="#figure01">Figure 1</a>]. Materiality, a category that subsumes the
               artistic medium and production techniques of the originals, was also conceived in
               terms of a differential relation to the code-based medium of digital reinscription
               with its screen-based interface for perceptual experience. Thus the mode of original
               technical inscription and of its particular perceptual experience, rather than the
               artistic discipline or genre, became the basis for categorizing the work’s
               materiality. For each item a digital surrogate would be generated through specific
               encoding procedures and formats, and its metadata would contain fields describing the
               original objects as well as fields describing the surrogates. The following diagrams
               explain the remediating dynamics for different kinds of objects: printed pages of
               text, including visual poems [see <a href="#figure02">Figure 2</a>], artists’
               books and public art [see <a href="#figure03">Figure 3</a>], audiotaped sound
               poems [see <a href="#figure04">Figure 4</a>], video works [see <a href="#figure05">Figure 5</a>], early computer works [see <a href="#figure06">Figure 6</a>], and performance-based practices [see <a href="#figure07">Figure 7</a>]. Two examples are given for each type of

               can be illustrated with "Soneto Ecológico" ["Ecological Sonnet"] (1985, 2005), by Fernando Aguiar. This
               work is a public park in which seventy trees of ten different species (autochthonous
               from Western Iberia) have been planted according to line and rhyme patterns of
               Portuguese classical sonnets (14 lines, abab cdcd efe fef). The work was originally
               created as three-dimensional model and blueprint for the park, and was exhibited
               several times in this form. Twenty years after its first presentation, the projected
               park was finally created in the town of Matosinhos [see <a href="#figure08">Figure 8</a>]. Digital representation of this work in the archive is achieved
               by means of a network of files: photographs of the original 3D model, digitized
               images of textual descriptions, plans and diagrams, as well as photographs and videos
               of the actual park. These are further complemented with an interview of the author,
               and several reception documents. The archive will thus generate three contexts for
               reading this work: the context of its own textual and material history; the context
               of parodies of the sonnet form in the PO.EX movement; and the context of ecological
               awareness in national policies for forestation and protection of local tree
               species.</div>

                  <div class="ptext" id="p9"> Remediation of this multimodal corpus raises two clusters of theoretical and
               technical problems. The first cluster of problems originates at the level of the
               source materials for the archive, such as selecting from the source materials those
               documentary evidences (in multiple media) that will come to represent a given body of
               works and, in some cases, live performances of works. Selected works and documents
               can be transcoded according to several technical protocols. Digital representation of
               the source objects generally follows a hypertext rationale, as established and
               formalized by scholarly electronic editions of literary and artistic works published
               since the mid-1990s. This means producing digital facsimiles and transcriptions,
               marking up variations and versions, and creating elaborate metadata both about the
               digital surrogates and their source objects. The second cluster of problems derives
               from issues posed by the new archival medium. We need to work with a model of
               electronic space that takes full advantage of its processing, aggregative, and
               collaborative functionalities as a new space for using the archived materials in new
               contexts, including teaching, research, and other creative practices. In this
               section, I discuss issues of remediation related to print, audio, and born-digital
               artifacts, and I will place the archive within theoretical frameworks useful for
               thinking about editorial questions raised by the multimodal and experimental nature
               of its content. </div>

Major scholarly
                  electronic textual editing projects of the late 1990s and early 2000s have adopted
                  Jerome McGann’s "hypertext rationale" (2001[1996]). McGann
                  conceived of hypertext as a metacritical tool that would allow editors to move
                  beyond the codex rationale, liberating texts from their hierarchical confinement
                  in the inscriptional space of the book. Once texts were remediated in digital
                  form, bibliographic codes could be more thoroughly apprehended and investigated,
                  while the genetic and social dynamics of textual production could be marked and
                  digitally represented as a network of historically situated inscriptions:</div>

                        <p class="ptext"> The exigencies of the book form forced editorial scholars to
                  develop fixed points of relation – the "definitive text",
                     "copy text", "ideal text", "Ur
                     text", "standard text", and so forth – in order to
                  conduct a book-bound navigation (by coded forms) through large bodies of
                  documentary materials. Such fixed points no longer have to govern the ordering of
                  the documents. As with the nodes on the Internet, every documentary moment in the
                  hypertext is absolute with respect to the archive as a whole, or with respect to
                  any subarchive that may have been (arbitrarily) defined within the archive. In
                  this sense, computerized environments have established the new <cite class="title italic">Rationale of HyperText</cite>. [<a class="ref" href="#mcgann2001">McGann 2001</a>, 73, 74]

                  sums up this view of the material incommensurability of each textual instantiation
                  through the concept of "script acts" as networks of genetic and
                  social documents: "By script acts I do not mean just those acts involved in
                        writing or creating scripts; I mean every sort of act conducted in relation
                        to written and printed texts, including every act of reproduction and every
                        act of reading."
                      [<a class="ref" href="#shillingsburg2006">Shillingsburg 2006</a>, 40]. Once encoded and marked-up as electronic texts, past textual iterations
                  are reiterated as machine-processable forms. The "hypertext
                     rationale" implies digitizing and structuring materials in ways that
                  give a meta-representational function to the process of de-centering and
                  re-constellating their textual modularities in digital formats. Texts are not just
                  pluralized in their various authorial and editorial forms but they are also
                  re-networked within large ensembles of production and reception documents.
                  Hypertext became a research tool for understanding the multidimensional dynamics
                  of text, and for testing social editing as theory of textuality. In the electronic
                  medium, the scholarly edition is reconfigured as an archive that attempts to make
                  explicit the editorial frames that have produced each textual instance in its past
                  bibliographic materiality. Self-awareness of textual transmission and intertextual
                  dependence, coupled to a hypertext rationale for electronic editing, resulted in a
                  general movement away from the discrete book-like digital <em class="term">edition</em> to

                  eloquently argued for the importance of modeling the functionality of e-space in
                  ways that reflect a thorough understanding of the dynamics of book structures, but
                  also in ways that go beyond the structures of the codex and take full advantage of
                  programmable networked media. She highlights the following affordances of digital
                  materiality: continuous reconfiguration of digital artifacts at the level of code,
                  the capacity to mark those reconfigurations, the aggregation of documents and data
                  in integrated environments, and the creation of spaces for collaboration and
                  intersubjective exchange [<a class="ref" href="#drucker2009">Drucker 2009</a>, 173]. Designing a
                  digital archive depends on the best possible articulation between re/presenting
                  and remediating the materials and inscribing that remediated representation in the
                  specifics of the database ontology and algorithmic functionalities of networked
                  digital materiality [see Figure 9]. </div>

                     Archive</cite> derives from the centrality of multimodal modes of
                  communication for experimental literary practices. Audio, film, video and other
                  media technologies were creatively explored in various institutional and
                  non-institutional settings. Verbal and written experimentation extended to a
                  programmatic exploration of the expressive potential of sound and video recording
                  or computer processing, for example. These multimedia textualities, which
                  challenged the codex- and print-centric hegemony of mainstream literary forms,
                  also raise specific textual problems when it comes to editing. Charles Bernstein’s
                  apologia of poetry’s audiotextuality [<a class="ref" href="#bernstein1998">Bernstein 1998</a>] – which later
                  became a justification for the <a class="ref"

                  the historical and poetical value of the recorded human voice reading poetry.
                  Sound recordings are seen as evidence of the plural existence of literary works.
                  Each recorded reading is a unique textual instantiation of the work:</div>
                     <blockquote>
                        <p class="ptext">
                  The poem, viewed in terms of its multiple performances, or
                     mutual intertranslatability, has a fundamentally plural existence.  This is
                     most dramatically enunciated when instances of the work are contradictory or
                     incommensurable, but it is also the case when versions are commensurate. To
                     speak of the poem in performance is, then, to overthrow the idea of the poem as
                     a fixed, stable, finite linguistic object; it is to deny the poem its
                     self-presence and its unity.  Thus, while performance emphasizes the material
                     presence of the poem, and of the performer, it at the same time denies the
                     unitary presence of the poem, which is to say its metaphysical unity.

                     <div class="ptext" id="p15">He also highlights the fact that audiotexts are yet another instance of the
                  multiple textuality of the poem: "The audio text may be one more generally discounted
                        destabilizing textual element, an element that undermines our ability to fix
                        and present any single definitive, or even stable, text of the poem.
                        Grammaphony is not an alternative to textuality but rather throws us deeper
                        into its folds."
                      [<a class="ref" href="#bernstein2006">Bernstein 2006</a>, 281]. The availability of sound recording thus creates a historical situation in
                  which the written text can cease to be identified as the primary literary
                  instance: "A widely available digital audio poetry archive will have
                        a pronounced influence on the production of new poetry. In the coming
                        digital present, it becomes possible to imagine poets preparing and
                        releasing poems that exist only as sound files, with no written text, or for
                        which a written text is secondary."

                     Manifesto</cite> (2003), for instance, suggests a combination of bibliographic
                  principles with the modular and social affordances of the new medium. In this
                  sense, it parallels McGann’s hypertext rationale as a programmatic intervention
                  for placing written textual instances in a radiant dynamics that is independent
                  from their bibliographic origins. Bernstein envisions audio textualities as a
                  series of discrete, single, and technically standardized files that can be
                  appropriated and combined by listeners in terms of the modularity of the digital

                  audiotexts perceived as literary experiences and not merely as a collection of
                  historical documents. Networked distribution of artistic and cultural forms has

                  particular mode of presentation follows an audiotext rationale that offers users
                  non-hierarchical access to multiple pairs of visual text and audio clips. In
                  several instances, recordings contain performances of visual texts that have never
                  been read aloud before. Vocalization of their visual patterns opens up their
                  notational strategies to new sound appropriations. The audio is producing the
                  visual anew and cannot be perceived as a mere record from the past. The
                  documentary function of the digital facsimile as a surrogate of a printed visual
                  poem has been displaced by a reading intervention that calls attention to itself

                  reconstructing the code for their early works is limited by lack of specific
                  documentation. In the case of Pedro Barbosa our archive includes handwritten notes
                  and diagrams describing iterations and transformations, and also printed outputs
                  of generative texts from mid to late 1970s. Melo e Castro produced a series of
                  animated poems between 1986 and 1989 in collaboration with the Open University in

                  of the original handwritten notes and punched tapes as well as the videopoems, but
                  the texts will not be generated or animated by code.</div>

                     <div class="ptext" id="p24">The work of artist Silvestre Pestana provides another example of how PO.EX has
                  addressed the problems of migrating born-digital work. <cite class="title italic">Computer poetry</cite> is the title of a series of poems he produced in 1981
                  [see <a href="#figure11">Figure 11</a>]. At the time, Pestana purchased a
                  Spectrum personal computer with which he made the first three versions of his
                  monochrome visual computer poetry: the first is dedicated to E. M. de Melo e
                  Castro, the second to Henri Chopin, and the third to Julian Beck. Despite being
                  the only instance of such work in Portugal in 1981 (Pedro Barbosa, active since
                  1975, was working mainly with text generation), this work of dynamic and
                  generative visual poetry still offers important clues for understanding the
                  evolution of computer-animated visual poetry and its relation to the printed
                  visual poetry of the experimental poets. The work was never published. Its code
                  (with some errors recently identified and corrected by the author) was published
                  in the book <cite class="title italic">Poemografias</cite>, an anthology of visual
                  poetry co-edited by Pestana [<a class="ref" href="#aguiar1985">Aguiar 1985</a>, 214, 215, 216]. In
                  this case, Pestana’s early "Computer Poems" can be
                  emulated for the current networked environment, since the community of Spectrum
                  users has made available code forms that run in a Java environment. Although
                  unable to recover the material environment of its original execution, this
                  migration resulted in a version that approximates the functionality of the
                  original. </div>

               observation of the achievements and shortcomings of editions and archives developed
               during the first two decades of electronic scholarly editing, Shillingsburg proposed
               four sets of questions that must be answered by the infrastructure and
               functionalities of the edition or archive [<a class="ref" href="#shillingsburg2006">Shillingsburg 2006</a>, 92, 93]. The first group of questions concerns the relations between
               different documentary states of the text and how these relations are made visible for
               readers. The second set deals with methodological issues about how editorial
               interventions are made clear. The third group addresses the ways in which a context
               for the primary texts is produced in the archive through both autograph and allograph
               materials. Finally, the fourth set of questions details the uses of the edition or
               archive, including interactions such as making personal collections and annotations
               on the materials. </div>

               which there are multiple print and handwritten witnesses, most of them can be applied
               to a project devoted to contemporary experimental literature. Contemporary practices
               take place in a multimedia environment in which versions are also a function of their
               multiple media inscriptions and not necessarily from later transmission or
               remediation processes. Because of their programmatic emphasis on process and
               performance, experimental practices tend to generate multiple textual instances of
               any given work: a sound poem, for instance, will often have one or several written
               notations (a performance manuscript or typescript, sometimes a published version),
               and one or more sound or video recordings of live performances. This combination of
               ephemerality and multiplicity, of scarcity and abundance, poses challenges for any
               editing and archival project of late 20th-century experimental literature in a
               digital environment that are similar to problems raised by documentary and critical
               editing of historical material of earlier periods. </div>

                  <div class="ptext" id="p27">By means of the concept of electronic edition or archive as "knowledge site", Shillingsburg has tried to capture a set of textual,
               contextual, interpretive, and interactive features that any literary edition or
               archive must provide for current and future users. These features imply a synthesis
               between documentary and critical edition that takes advantage of the affordances of
               the medium. We could say that his model, based on electronic editing projects
               developed in the 1990s and early 2000s, is an attempt to invent the digital medium
               for editing purposes. Shillingsburg has structured his "electronic infrastrutcture for script acts" into four levels: textual
               foundations; contexts and progressions; interpretive interactions; and user
               enhancements [see <a href="#figure12">Figure 12</a>]. "Textual foundations" refers to basic data, inferred data, internal data
               links, bibliographic analysis, and textual analysis; "contexts
                  and progressions" includes contextualized data (for each stage of textual
               existence), intertextuality, and linguistic analysis; "interpretive interactions" refers to reception history and adaptations;
               and "user enhancements" considers the possibility of users
               adding new markup, creating new variant texts, and writing commentary and explanatory
               and personal notes [<a class="ref" href="#shillingsburg2006">Shillingsburg 2006</a>, 101, 102]. </div>

               for document selection and for digital representation, including database structure,
               bibliographic and semantic metadata, and interface form. Despite its critical and
               theoretical sophistication, this model is still insufficient for the specific nature
               of this project. On the one hand, textual, methodological, and contextual principles
               need to be adapted to the multimedia textuality of this particular corpus of
               experimental literature; on the other hand, we want to experiment with creative
               possibilities for digital remediation of the collected materials. Theoretical and
               technical issues triggered by ongoing research also impact on the possible uses of
               the archive. Especially important in this regard, are the social and academic uses
               that we want and expect this archive to support and encourage. The gathering of rare,
               disperse, and often inaccessible materials, and the creation of a user-friendly
               interface to a relational multimedia database should be equally productive for
               general online reading/viewing/listening practices (including access through mobile
               devices) and for specialized teaching and research purposes. </div>

               is more complex, time consuming, and costly than what we could hope to accomplish in
               a three-year project, we tried to explore them at least in their theoretical
               implications. The aim would be for this archive to fruitfully combine the
               preservation, repositorial, and dissemination functions, with the creation of a
               research resource capable of generating new knowledge in the future. This seems to be
               the best way to maximize the simulation and interactive capabilities of digital
               environments and digital tools as knowledge sites. Even if we had to limit the
               structure and functionality of the archive to what was computationally feasible
               within our resources, we have tried to think through the electronic infrastructure of

               investigation into the possibilities of digital representation and database structure
               that creatively explores the materiality of the medium and of its codes. The
               possibility of creating a fluid environment – open to addition and restructuring as a
               result of ongoing and future critical interactions between users and objects – is one
               example of the kind of remodeling and progressive categorization inherent in the
               flexibility of digital representation as reconfigurable and self-documenting data.
               Reconceived as a remediated critical environment, the digital archive should be able
               to sustain and encourage reflexive feedbacks between textual representation,
               contextual simulation, and interpretative interaction [see Figure 13]. </div>

               current historical form of an institutional desire for structured, aggregated,
               displayable, and manipulable representations. If archival meaning is codetermined in
               advance by the structure that archives, the order of the archive – its politics of
               representation – coproduces the writings and readings by means of specific
               preservation and presentation strategies. Inclusion and exclusion, as well as the
               conceptual and interpretative apparatus expressed in structure and interaction

                     relations in the originals (A1, A2) are translated into material and textual
                     relations in the surrogates (B1, B2). Translation takes place at the material
                     level of transcoding (adoption of specific digital standards and formats for
                     generating text, image, audio, and video files, including transcoding between
                     earlier and current digital formats) and at the metadata level of textual
                     description and classification. The archive order is a multilayered documentary
                     and critical simulation of external relations mediated by its own internal
                     structures and forms.</div>

                  digital archiving is to think of the digital archive as a process of translation
                  [See Figures 16 and 17]. The transcoding of objects in digital format is based on
                  an assessment of material and textual features of the source objects and on
                  decisions about the best way to represent those features in digitized form –
                  facsimile images, textual transcriptions, standards for audio and video encoding,
                  transcoding between digital formats. Remediation creates object-to-object
                  correspondences across media, while submitting the surrogates to constraints and
                  affordances of the new medium, such as modularity and processibility. Material and
                  textual relations are reconstituted within the archival order also as a network of
                  interrelations whose internal order is in tension with an external order. </div>

                     <div class="ptext" id="p35">This process of media translation can be illustrated with the naming system for
                  files in the archive [see <a href="#figure18">Figure 18</a>]. The creation
                  of a digital archive implies the cumulative production of a large quantity of
                  files that maintain a network of relationships among themselves and between them
                  and their sources. Descriptive metadata (that identify the contents and technical
                  data of the file) and administrative metadata (that identify creators and editors
                  of the file) enable producers and users to assess the authenticity, integrity, and
                  quality of the data. In addition to this self-description associated with each
                  file, it is also important that the overall organization of the archive and of the
                  adopted remediation methodology are reflected in the directory structure and
                  naming conventions of files, which should become clear, in the first place, for
                  all project participants, and also for users. These conventions should allow not
                  only a clear understanding of relations between files that derive from each other,
                  but also their relationship with the objects, collections, and repositories of
                  origin. Naming conventions should also allow the continuous addition of new
                  elements within their scheme of hierarchies and associations (see [<a class="ref" href="#pitti2004">Pitti 2004</a>]). </div>

                     original document from which digital versions were obtained. The second
                     sequence of letters is used to identify the author of the work (in the case of
                     works with multiple authorship, authors’ identifiers are separated by dots).
                     The third letter sequence contains the initials of the work’s title (followed
                     by a number if there is more than one digital representation of the same work).
                     Sequences of digits that follow the letters identify the relative order of
                     derivation of digital objects when files with variable resolutions are created
                     from the same matrix. The final extension identifies the file type (.tif, .jpg,
                     .pdf, .mpg, .mov, .flv, etc.). Each file name situates the object within the
                     ecology of the archive and traces its origin to a media source outside the

                  representation of the collections and the associative retrieval of items.
                  Overlapping hierarchies and cross-relations establish the ontological
                  representation of the archive as an aggregation of explicitly related and
                  searchable items. Machine performance is dependent upon a category-building
                  process that gives form and structure to a collection of items. We have made some
                  effort to keep our system relatively flexible since we recognized the limitations
                  of current taxonomies and systems of classification for forms of literature that
                  are defined essentially by intermediality, and by the combination of literary and

                  need to provide a critical and classificatory perspective that uses taxonomies
                  validated by scientific and academic communities. Although the taxonomies have
                  been generated through close observation of the specifics of the selected corpus,

                  digital facsimile approach has been substituted by a formal intervention that uses
                  the original work as a program for further textual instantiations that can be
                  developed through the use of code. Remediation becomes a creative translation that
                  rewrites the text with scripts that explore its signifying potential within the
                  new medium. Digital representation has become an occasion for a media translation
                  that plays with the ratios of the various intersemiotic textual levels in the
                  source works. In this anti-archival approach remediation is an open exploration of
                  the signifying potential contained in visual and permutational texts. This form of
                  reading as rewriting has been applied to a selection of paper-based works of the

                  press. The randomized combination of printed headlines on the pages of periodicals
                  is performed, in one case, by means of animation (using Actionscript code by Jared

                  collage of newspaper headlines in the original paper collage. Instead of digitally

                     <div class="ptext" id="p41"> The combinatorial collage of newspapers’ headlines has been applied to the
                  current online press, using RSS tools and the language of web pages to build a
                  mechanism for real-time digital collage – a device that is able to produce
                     "found poems" through an algorithmic procedure. By
                  displacing the particular historical content and historical reference of the
                  original collage, this digital recoding de-contextualizes and breaks the chains of
                  meaning that bind text and context, a move comparable to what happened in the
                  original. Indeed, this is one of the main effects of the collage by António
                  Aragão: original sentences and references have been abolished, or they remain only
                  as a distant echo, since the poem has broken the markers of discursive cohesion
                  and coherence that ensured their pragmatic function in the newspaper context. Its
                  signifying emptiness, that is, its potential for meaning is embodied in the
                  arbitrary network of relationships between words and sentence fragments, which
                  continuously overlap and repeat in different scales and at various points of the
                  screen, resembling statistical clouds of occurrences. </div>

                  <div class="ptext" id="p42">The fetishist eroticism of detail is common to many digital archives that establish
               their authority on the basis of exhaustiveness in listing, describing, and marking
               details. Scholarly literary archives of autograph materials embody this contradiction
               between the desire for exhaustive markup of a never-ending set of material features
               and the resistance of textual instances to any fixed encoding system. This is one of
               the heuristic consequences of digital archives: our obsessive attempt to represent
               objects confronts us not just with what we don’t know, but also with the limits of
               knowledge as representation. Digital modeling seems to be, in this sense, a new way
               of experiencing the failure of representation. Inclusiveness, detailism, and
               exhaustiveness become ever-present and ever-unresolved issues. </div>
                  <div class="counter">
                     <a href="#p43">43</a>
                  </div>
                  <div class="ptext" id="p43">The medium’s simulatory affordances raise our awareness about the signifying
               potential of a whole new level of material differences. Once you begin to pay
               attention to all the minutiae of paper and ink, script and layout, cancellations and
               erasure, folds and cut-outs, preliminary and preparatory, software and hardware,
               materiality and textuality expand to all possible inscriptional variations. Writing
               acts assume a gestural and bodily dimension, as if read through an abstract
               expressionist code. Digital tools and environments show themselves as reading and
               interpretative devices rather than mere instrumental techniques for textual
               reproduction and simulation. The interpretative nature of editing and archiving as an
               intervention in the material instantiation of a specific textual field dispels
               empiricist illusions about the possibility of objective and definitive textual
               reconstitutions. Any digital representation will depend on the granularity of its
               description and on the politics of its constraints. The PO.EX Archive showed us the
               limits of our digital models for the artifacts that we were trying to preserve,
               classify, recreate, and network. These multiple transcodings performed the artifacts
               as particular products of the database aesthetics of knowledge production. </div>
                  <div class="counter">
                     <a href="#p44">44</a>
                  </div>
                  <div class="ptext" id="p44">This may well be one of the theoretical and methodological achievements of the
               current digital archiving obsession: editing and archiving can be critically used for
               acts of reinterpretation that fully engage the complexity of the various textual and
               media materialities of literary practices. Denaturalized and reframed by digital
               codes and forms, the dynamics between bibliographic, linguistic, spatial, visual,
               sonic, cinematic, and performative is rendered more explicit – a dynamics that can be
               programmatically used for reexamining the material production of meaning and for
               reimagining the archive itself as a representational intervention. Ultimately, the
               remediation of manuscripts, books, collages, photographs, audiotapes, videotapes, and
               programming codes as an intermedia network of digital objects gives us the
               opportunity for a reflexive exploration of the performative nature of digital
               simulation itself. Decentred and decontextualized by the technical affordances of the
               medium, digital surrogates enter a new space for material, textual, and conceptual
               experiments. </div>

                  reception documents) are remediated as digital facsimiles in image formats. They
                  are not transcribed as alphanumeric text. Although this option is justifiable
                  because of the constellated and visual character of many works, it was also
                  determined by our limited resources in time and money. Works and documents in
                  standard typographic layout should also have been transcribed into digital text
                  formats. This would enable complex queries in the textual body. One of the
                  consequences of this limitation is that most of the critical dimension of the
                  archive depends on the taxonomies used for associating metadata with each
