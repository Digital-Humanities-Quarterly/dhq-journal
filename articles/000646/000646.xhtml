                     a coherent set of methodologies — than it is a mode of thinking about digital
                     humanities praxis that resists the idea that “innovation” is defined by newness,
                     scale, or scope. Broadly speaking, minimal computing connotes digital humanities
                     work undertaken in the context of some set of constraints. This could include lack
                     of access to hardware or software, network capacity, technical education, or even
                     a reliable power grid [<a class="ref" href="#mcwg2022">Minimal Computing Working Group 2022</a>].</div>

                  <div class="ptext" id="p4">Minimal computing is an approach that, first and foremost, advocates for using <em class="emph">only</em> the technologies that are necessary and sufficient for
                     developing digital humanities scholarship in such constrained environments. This
                     does not mean that the “minimal” of “minimal computing” implies ease for all users
                     or prescribes acceptable types of hardware, software, and platforms (e.g., Jekyll,
                     Arduino, and Raspberry PI).<a class="noteRef" href="#d4e237">[3]</a> Rather, it gestures towards a decision-making process
                     driven by the local contexts in which scholarship is being created. In this way,
                     minimal computing is platform- and software-agnostic, emphasizing instead the
                     importance of making these choices, based on the constraints with which we are
                     working, to facilitate the development of digital humanities scholarship in
                     environments where resources (e.g., financial, infrastructural, and labor) or
                     freedoms (e.g., movement and speech) are scarce. </div>

                  <div class="ptext" id="p5">Our observations here may not satisfy those expecting a more concrete definition
                     of minimal computing. Therefore, we offer the following: minimal computing is
                     perhaps best understood as a heuristic comprising four questions to determine what
                     is, in fact, necessary and sufficient when developing a digital humanities project
                     under constraint: 1) “what do we need?”; 2) “what do we have”; 3) “what must we
                     prioritize?”; and 4) “what are we willing to give up?” </div>
                  
                  <div class="counter"><a href="#p6">6</a></div>
                  <div class="ptext" id="p6">“What do we need?” is a question that echoes throughout essays and case studies in
                     this special issue. In 2016, Alex, along with Élika Ortega, posed this question in
                     their essay, “Multilingual Practices and Minimal Computing” [<a class="ref" href="#gil2016">Gil and Ortega 2016</a>].
                     The question of “need” is one intended to cut through a tendency in digital
                     humanities to valorize keeping pace with trends towards high-speed computing,
                     acquisition of the latest computational technologies, and fetishization of the
                     cutting edge. Sometimes — perhaps often — when we pause to consider what we <em class="emph">actually</em> need to complete a project, the answer isn’t access
                     to the latest and greatest but the tried and true. In our work with faculty and
                     collaborators, we have seen firsthand how the drive to be “innovative” for the
                     sake of innovation can be a deterrent to actually completing (or even starting) a
                     project. For example, Roopika (Roopsi)<a class="noteRef" href="#d4e269">[4]</a>
                     has had countless conversations with colleagues who are convinced that they <em class="emph">need</em> to use a particular piece of software, like ArcGIS,
                     because it’s popular and has a name brand association with digital humanities,
                     when something simpler like Tableau, ArcGIS StoryMaps, or even Google My Maps
                     would suffice.<a class="noteRef" href="#d4e273">[5]</a> Alex has had many similar conversations, in which the need to publish an
                     online edition of a historical text is confused with the need to learn TEI, or the
                     desire to count occurrences of a trope in a literary text is confused with
                     learning Python or using an “easy” but expensive tool like NVivo. When we reorient
                     our praxis around the question of “what we need?” rather than what we <em class="emph">think</em> we need, we are better positioned to see digital
                     humanities projects through because our technical choices, methods, and research
                     questions are more appropriately aligned. </div>
                  
                  <div class="counter"><a href="#p7">7</a></div>
                  <div class="ptext" id="p7">The question of “What do we have?” is equally as critical because it encourages
                     practitioners to focus on the assets available to them and thus resists a deficit
                     mindset for those of us who are working under constraints. Quite often, the lauded
                     models of digital humanities scholarship are projects developed with significant
                     institutional resources and grant funding. It’s easy to look at those examples and
                     focus on what we <em class="emph">don’t</em> have. Shifting the frame of our
                     thinking towards what we <em class="emph">do</em> have is critical to identifying
                     the resources we have at our disposal. Minimal computing draws the inspiration for
                     this question from asset-based approaches that exist in multiple forms around the
                     world, such as <em class="emph">jugaad</em> in India, <em class="emph">gambiarra</em> in Brazil, <em class="emph">rebusque</em> in Colombia, <em class="emph">jua kali</em> in Kenya, and <em class="emph">zizhu
                        chuangxin</em> in China. These practices privilege making do with available
                     materials for creative problem-solving and innovation [<a class="ref" href="#risam2018a">Risam 2018a</a>]. An example of
                     this in the U.S. context appears in Joshua Davis’s book <cite class="title italic">Spare
                        Parts</cite>, the story of a group of undocumented high school students whose
                     underwater robotics team beat teams from colleges like MIT, who had access to
                     high-tech polymers and funding from Xerox, simply by relying on knowledge gleaned
                     from working with family members who were gardeners and mechanics [<a class="ref" href="#davis2014">Davis 2014</a>]
                     [<a class="ref" href="#risam2018b">Risam 2018b</a>]. In her work at Salem State University, Roopsi and her colleagues
                     Susan Edwards and Justin Snow put the question of “what do we have?” at the heart
                     of their digital humanities initiatives with students. They focused on the
                     resources they had — archival holdings on early 20th century local history, their
                     collective knowledge, their library server, and existing faculty professional
                     development programs that they could reappropriate to build a digital humanities
                     internship program for students [<a class="ref" href="#risam2018">Risam and Edwards 2018</a>] [<a class="ref" href="#risam2017">Risam et al. 2017</a>].
                     Alex, in turn, has purposefully visited several countries around the world, and
                     worlds within countries, to answer the question: what do folks doing humanities
                     and cultural work have? The answers vary wildly, from the University of Khartoum's
                     history department to Havana's undercommons to the incarcerated youth at Rikers
                     Island in New York City. In Sudan, for example, electricity is unstable at certain
                     times of day and Internet activity is censored by the government. This means that
                     any solutions there must focus on what scholars do have: hard drives, where
                     projects can live more freely than on the Internet; the ability to create multiple
                     versions of projects to evade government censors; and dedicated, affordable PCs
                     running on batteries to provide classes with access. Through a focus on what we do
                     have, rather than what we don’t, we are better positioned to assess and leverage
                     extant resources and use them to resourcefully make do with the means at our
                     disposal. They may not look like the resources that are available at elite
                     institutions or made possible by grant funding, but they are resources
                     nonetheless. </div>
                  
                  <div class="counter"><a href="#p8">8</a></div>
                  <div class="ptext" id="p8">Following on the questions of what we need and what we have, asking “What must we
                     prioritize?” is essential to the mode of thinking for which minimal computing
                     advocates. When working under constraints, we cannot treat all competing
                     priorities in a project as equally important. When developing a recent project,
                     Roopsi chose to use WordPress rather than the Jekyll static site generator for the
                     website. While using Jekyll would have reduced maintenance and increased security
                     because it does not rely on a database — two features that Roopsi prefers —
                     WordPress’s graphical user interface (GUI) made website updates easier for all her
                     collaborators.<a class="noteRef" href="#d4e329">[6]</a> The learning curve for Jekyll, which involves using the command
                     line and requires some rudimentary understanding of Markdown, CSS, and Liquid, was
                     unfamiliar to most of them, and her collaborators, who work at universities with
                     high teaching loads, could not allocate the bandwidth to learning Jekyll simply to
                     add content to a website. Prioritizing people over platforms, in this instance,
                     was the appropriate choice to ensure full participation of all collaborators. On
                     the other hand, in his role as digital scholarship librarian, which included
                     helping individual faculty members get digital projects off the ground, Alex found
                     it enormously more time efficient to receive data from collaborators in formats
                     that were already familiar to them (e.g., spreadsheets and Microsoft Word
                     documents) and build projects for them using Jekyll or Wax himself. In both cases,
                     the priority determines the choice of technology. Whether it is or isn't a
                     technology associated with Minimal Computing™ is less important. The question
                     “What must we prioritize?” speaks to the fact that minimal computing is not
                     prescriptive or advocating for the use of particular software, hardware, or
                     platforms, but rather points to a decision-making process that responds to the
                     constraints of a given situation for project development.</div>
                  
                  <div class="counter"><a href="#p9">9</a></div>
                  <div class="ptext" id="p9">The final question for minimal computing is, “What are we willing to give up?” In
                     environments in which we are contending with limitations, whether of
                     infrastructure, finances, labor, and/or technical knowledge, among other factors,
                     we simply cannot have it all. There are tough decisions to be made, taking into
                     account what we need, what we have, and what we must prioritize. This could mean
                     eschewing the latest, flashiest methods that would cost more money, time, and
                     labor, in favor of a simpler approach that would be practically achievable with
                     what we have. Or it could mean choosing a platform that does not meet every
                     desired requirement of a team but still makes it possible for a project to move
                     forward.<a class="noteRef" href="#d4e338">[7]</a> For example, when working with students at Salem State
                     University, where students typically work 30-40 hours per week in addition to
                     taking classes, Roopsi tended to use out-of-the-box tools that students can
                     reasonably learn how to use during class time, rather than bespoke solutions that
                     would require students to learn how to code and require substantial independent
                     work outside of class. By giving up what might ultimately be prettier or more
                     elegant, in the context of teaching, she instead focused on technologies that help
                     students gain confidence in their digital literacy skills and have small wins that
                     might later encourage them to develop a stronger technical skill set. Alex has
                     made analogous decisions in his own practice. When designing the technology for

                     challenge of creating a map that could be downloaded in low bandwidth environments
                     and even function on a USB key, in order to make the project capable of traveling
                     around as many of the different digital infrastructures of the planet as possible.
                     To do so, he had to give up on the idea of a map with functionalities such as
                     zoom, tiles, or layers [<a class="ref" href="#gil2014">Gil et al. 2014</a>]. Recognizing that wanting to have it all
                     is a deterrent is essential to making the choices necessary when working under
                     constraints.</div>

                  <div class="ptext" id="p10">The “minimal” in “minimal computing” therefore stands in stark contrast to an
                     implied “maximal,” where “maximal” connotes design choices that are made without
                     putting the question of what is necessary and sufficient at the heart of
                     decision-making. The primary contribution of minimal computing to digital
                     humanities is to draw attention to the fact that the decisions we make when
                     designing digital humanities projects — our use of particular kinds of hardware,
                     software, and platforms — are not inherently virtuous (or lacking in virtue) but
                     are inevitably encumbered by opportunities and challenges, affordances and
                     limitations, and benefits and tradeoffs by nature. The authors in this issue
                     grapple with these very concerns — just as the two of us do as practitioners —
                     each coming to different answers that are responsive to the local contexts in
                     which their theories and practices are being developed and the constraints of
                     these environments. This is our minimal computing. </div>

                     illuminating the tensions within digital humanities that have given rise to the
                     concept over the past several decades and will continue to be shaped by minimal
                     computing’s four constituent questions — 1) “what do we need?”; 2) “what do we
                     have”; 3) “what must we prioritize?”; 4) “what are we willing to give up?” — in

                  <div class="ptext" id="p12">The first tension implied in minimal computing is between the constant drive
                     towards larger, faster, always-on forms of computing and the infrastructural,
                     institutional, and financial realities that constrain digital humanities project
                     development. In the context of academic research, this tension dates back to the
                     birth of modern computers, long before the advent of the personal computer or the
                     Internet. At that time, only elite universities in wealthy countries could afford
                     mainframe computers for computational labor. Today, this impulse takes many forms
                     in digital humanities, including the valorization of cluster computing, high speed
                     Internet, cloud computing, and big data. Those supporting and relying on
                     computation who work on the creation of online publications cite the need for
                     user-friendly data entry (i.e., GUIs in web browsers) or continuous publication of
                     new materials. Those working in cultural analytics, text analysis, and the like
                     cite the need for large data processing capacity in the drive towards new insights
                     derived algorithmically from large data sets of cultural corpora. Implied in this
                     narrow definition of “innovation” is an access differential: those who have access
                     to such technologies and those who do not. </div>

                     of digital humanities research. For example, grant funding and institutional
                     support for digital humanities scholarship follows this mentality, exacerbating
                     existing inequities. The creation of projects that rely solely on the Internet for
                     distribution, thereby excluding large groups of scholars around the world from
                     access, offers another example. While researchers in the Global North are
                     beginning to develop more nuanced understandings of the asymmetrical ecologies of
                     access to and use of technology — which researchers of the Global South have long
                     understood — the expenses tied to newer, faster, and bigger technologies continue
                     to have material implications on the ground.<a class="noteRef" href="#d4e402">[9]</a> These costs go well beyond access, touching on
                     environmental concerns, questions of ownership and control over scholarship in the
                     context of postcolonial and neocolonial relationships, the reinforcement of
                     inequitable prestige economies in the global academy, labor conditions for
                     academic workers, and more. And, put simply, this attitude implicitly limits the
                     scope of digital humanities scholarship to the type of work that can be produced

                     humanities without having to develop much symbolic computational literacy.
                     However, these tools are inextricably linked to the dominance of English as a
                     lingua franca for programming and markup languages, with downstream implications
                     for those working with languages other than English — namely the emphasis on
                     Anglophone scholarship in digital humanities and the comparative underdevelopment
                     of multilingual digital humanities, particularly languages in scripts other than

                     systems that drive that production, and by extension, the labor to maintain and
                     sustain them. For example, platforms like WordPress that rely on a database
                     require labor to keep abreast of updates and patches, deprecated dependencies like
                     plugins, and their vulnerability to security breaches — and to fix the issues that
                     inevitably arise. Such invisible labor is so successfully obscured that even the

                     Certainly, a team might choose to use a GUI because it best serves the questions
                     of what we need, have, must prioritize, and are willing to give up. However, like
                     all design decisions, such a choice comes with consequences. While those who doubt
                     their ability to learn how to code see the use of GUI-driven platforms as the key
                     to access, often these systems foreclose more control over the production of
                     knowledge, and by extension, participation that is more meaningful to those who
                     seek access. As Matthew Kirschenbaum has proposed, coding is a form of
                     worldmaking, in which the coder defines how that world operates [<a class="ref" href="#kirschenbaum2009">Kirschenbaum 2009</a>]. In the context of digital humanities, being able to code gives us the power
                     to create new worlds in which we model human knowledge and culture [<a class="ref" href="#risam2018a">Risam 2018a</a>].
                     As we (Roopsi and Alex) have developed our own capacity to code, we have come to
                     see the ways that it has opened up the possibilities for digital humanities
                     scholarship, particularly when working with material from communities that have
                     historically been — and continue to be — excluded from the cultural record. </div>

                     computational literacy, we can more easily seek solutions that promote broader
                     access through reduction of technological complexity (e.g., minimizing reliance on
                     databases, thereby reducing security risk and maximizing access in low bandwidth
                     environments). The idea of a reduction in computation has two useful and concrete
                     senses for us: first, literally less code or fewer bytes, and in turn, less
                     computational processing time or capacity. This notion of doing more with less has
                     been fundamental to the development and teaching of computer science, where
                     students are introduced early on to the concept of “Big O notation,” which
                     highlights the importance of ever more efficient algorithms to accomplish a given
                     task. We also see this drive towards “elegance” in the history of UNIX systems,
                     and in some of the foundational forms of computing that are still in use today in
                     digital humanities. A reduction in computation implies a reduction in energy
                     consumed, storage, and labor. In the same vein, we know that computation itself
                     allows us to perform many tasks that could be done by hand but would take
                     substantially longer. Take for example the creation of a works cited page: we can
                     either construct it by ourselves, or we could let software like Zotero write it
                     for us based on our bibliographic data. While by no means wedded to reduction in
                     computation or the substitution of manual labor by computation as requirements,
                     minimal computing asks us to imagine how these might help us accomplish our
                     various scholarly tasks in the humanities. </div>

                     and necessity. In her work at Salem State University, Roopsi worked with minimal
                     hardware, created small static sites, and processed small data sets out of
                     necessity, born from working at a resource-starved public university. Alex, in his
                     work at Columbia University, did so often by choice. In her new position at

                     cluster computing — a choice that Alex had at Columbia and will have at Yale
                     University. Both of us can take for granted high speed Internet access provided by
                     our universities, as well as access to a reliable power grid. Even accounting for
                     the major disparities in resources between the institutions where we started our
                     careers, we recognize that our work in digital humanities has been undertaken in

                     begin steadily accelerating during the second half of the 20th century. Despite
                     its relatively late arrival, the demands of computing on energy sources seem to

                     possibilities for the development of a digital cultural record that includes the

                     archives, and texts that attest to human knowledge and history — has been
                     profoundly shaped by colonialism. Its transformations, brought about by computers
                     and networks, place us today in a long transition from an analog cultural and
                     historical record to a hybrid one — parts analog, parts digital. This is not to
                     suggest that the digital is distinct from material reality — the digital is itself
                     material — but the analog record and the digital record are different enough that
                     it's helpful to think about the digital as a separate domain. (In short,
                     preserving paper is a fundamentally different affair than preserving bitstreams.)

                     have also suggested, is gravely affected by socio-technical inequities — not every
                     cultural heritage or scholarly outfit around the world has access to the same
                     infrastructure or resources. In response to this, minimal computing encourages
                     solutions that can be implemented universally. The irony of two people trained as
                     postcolonialists advocating for a universal is not lost on us. This is the same
                     paradox that many anti-colonial and postcolonial writers explored in the 20th
                     century: to seek the universal in the recovery of the particulars that were
                     ignored in colonial archives and rendered invisible by the totalizing impulse of
                     European colonialism and its “Enlightenment” [<a class="ref" href="#wilder2015">Wilder 2015</a>]. However, what we seek
                     is an interoperability of digital humanities practices that promote access and
                     equity in digital knowledge production. </div>

                  <div class="ptext" id="p23">A quick overview, in the largest of broad strokes, paints a concerning picture of
                     the scholarly record at a planetary scale today. The European, North American, and
                     East Asian dominance in the production of knowledge is evident in terms of brute
                     quantity. Concomitant with this state of affairs, several pirate operations have
                     arisen from the ashes of the former Soviet Union and its satellites, creating
                     libraries that give access to a large part of this knowledge to the rest of the
                     world with access to the Internet.<a class="noteRef" href="#d4e504">[13]</a> In Latin America, the long history of open access initiatives
                     gives us further hope. Despite these liberatory efforts, the flows of knowledge
                     continue to move from those who produce the most in the putative “West” to the
                     rest — mimicking flows of colonial power from center to periphery — without any
                     clear sign that the movement is reciprocated through uptake of scholarship from
                     the Global South. </div>

                  <div class="ptext" id="p24">At the heart of this state of affairs is the role of capital in the control of
                     scholarly production. Open access and pirate enterprises point away from the
                     accumulation of capital, and as such, clash with the monopolizing tendencies of
                     the North Atlantic and East Asian models of knowledge production, which coincide
                     with larger expenses in computational infrastructure. It is, perhaps, no surprise
                     that such tendencies have led to the knowledge cartels of the Global North
                     attempting to co-opt open access through article processing charges (APCs) levied
                     on authors to make their scholarship open access. Minimal computing intervenes by
                     studying and creating modes of production that promise control at the local level
                     for those who wish to avoid absorption by capital, who don't want to cede their
                     intellectual integrity to the pressures that come with that absorption, and whose
                     work is suppressed because it does not align with that which capital values (i.e.,
                     knowledge production beyond the Global North).<a class="noteRef" href="#d4e518">[14]</a> This includes an exploration of the possibilities for
                     community knowledge production that define the shifting epistemologies of our

                     of documents. We include the production of data, data sets, and documents as data,
                     all of which can be used for algorithmic analysis or manipulation. The issue of
                     control over data sets, especially those that can inform the pasts of whole
                     demographics of people in the world, will certainly come to a head in the 21st
                     century. One example of danger is control over Black data. At the moment of
                     writing, the vast majority of the data and documents that help us understand the
                     history of Black people during the period of Atlantic chattel slavery are
                     controlled by predominantly white scholarly teams and library administrators or
                     white-owned vendors.<a class="noteRef" href="#d4e527">[15]</a> This demonstrates how access
                     to infrastructure has direct consequences on our study and reconstruction of the
                     past and, by extension, what we understand that past to be. While data reparations
                     must be made, our interest here is in the role that minimal computing can play in
                     the development of present and future data sets, documents as data, and methods
                     that promote collaboration and interoperability among colleagues around the world
                     by not only taking into account uneven distribution of resources and the
                     constraints with which the majority are contending but also by ensuring that

                     different labor arrangements. Large or wealthy universities and colleges in the
                     North Atlantic, for example, enjoy full-time information technology and digital
                     scholarship teams working in and outside libraries that provide a certain degree
                     of stability to the creation of digital collections and digital humanities
                     scholarly projects. A few companies, staff on soft-money, and independent
                     contractors have also joined the fray to provide their technical services.
                     Granting agencies in rich economies have supported the production of digital
                     humanities projects that involve arrangements between non-technical scholars and
                     teams of technologists, often with an unacknowledged systems administration team
                     provided by institutions or a company. In this arrangement the scholars with
                     resources bear little pressure to understand the fundamentals of the labor
                     arrangements that make their projects possible and are alienated from the means of
                     production of their own knowledge. In addition to our concern for those who
                     provide invisible labor, we recognize that those who do not have access to such
                     arrangements will only continue to lag in their ability to keep pace with those
                     who do. By advocating for minimal computing, therefore, we aim to create a more
                     level playing field for the future of a digital cultural record where the voices
                     of those who have been excluded can be heard and valued through a more equitable,

                     issue features two types of contributions: theoretical essays and case studies.
                     The five lengthier essays build on the early writings of the Minimal Computing
                     Working Group, as well as our own writing [<a class="ref" href="#gil2016">Gil and Ortega 2016</a>] [<a class="ref" href="#risam2018a">Risam 2018a</a>], to

                  <div class="ptext" id="p28">The essays explore the theories and practices of minimal computing. We open the
                     issue with Grant Wythoff’s <cite class="title quote">Ensuring Minimal Computing Serves Maximal Connection,</cite>
                     which examines current conversations on digital minimalism in light of the history
                     of minimalism in art and asks whether arguments for minimalism hold in a
                     socially-distant and unevenly connected world. We continue with two essays that
                     take different approaches to exploring the relationship between minimal computing
                     and labor. Tiffany Chan and Jentery Sayers’s “Minimal Computing from the Labor
                     Perspective” considers the lessons from the University of Victoria Libraries’
                     migration Vault to advocate for degrowth of digital projects by articulating
                     project needs, the labor required, and how to sustain it. Exploring the affective
                     dimensions of minimal computing, Quinn Dombrowski’s essay, “Minimizing Computing
                     Maximizes Labor,” argues that the tradeoff for using static site generation for
                     web development is a concomitant increase in emotional labor and proposes needed
                     interventions to realize the potential of static-site generators for digital
                     humanities scholarship. Offering a critique of plain-text, Nabeel Siddiqui’s
                     “Hidden in Plain-TeX: Investigating Minimal Computing Workflows” situates
                     Markdown, a markup language used in Minimal Computing™, in the history of TeX and
                     explores the lessons it provides for those who engage with digital humanities.
                     Concluding this section, Martin Eve’s “Lessons from the Library: Extreme
                     Minimalist Scaling at Pirate Ebook Platforms” proposes a novel application of
                     minimal computing to the emergence of pirate libraries that explores tensions
                     between minimalism and maximalism in Library Genesis and its scalability. </div>

                  <div class="ptext" id="p29">Equally as important are the case studies, which present minimal computing in
                     practice. They collectively offer an exploration of multiple methods, articulating
                     how they exemplify, build on, and expand minimal computing practices in diverse
                     geographic, cultural, and linguistic contexts. We begin with case studies that
                     offer insight on labor and precarity. Matthew Lincoln, Jennifer Isasi, Sarah
                     Melton, and François Dominic Laramée’s “Relocating Complexity: The Programming

                     publication. Christina Boyles and Andy Boyles Petersen’s case study, “Power and
                     Precarity: Lessons from the Makers by Mail Project,” interrogates the relationship
                     between minimal computing and academic austerity, using the question, “What do we
                     need?” to center not only technological developments but also ethical engagement. </div>

                     hegemonic representations of the Mexico-United States border and argues that
                     minimal computing practices generate a third digital space to document multiple
                     histories and public memory of the borderlands. Shifting transnational
                     collaboration into the realm of teaching, Raffaele Viglianti, Gimena del Rio
                     Riande, and Nidia Hernández’s case study, “Open, Equitable, and Minimal: Teaching
                     Digital Scholarly Editing North and South,” examines how minimal computing can
                     establish common ground between research environments in the Global North and
                     Global South through their experience teaching a Collaborative Online

                     Wensi Lin, Yinzhou Zhao, Mengyue Chang, Han Chen, Quiang Hu, and Yongqing Xie’s
                     “Simple but Beautiful: A Case Study on the ZHI Project of Traditional

                  <div class="ptext" id="p33">As the essays and case studies indicate, we welcomed engagement from minimal
                     computing enthusiasts and critics alike in this special issue. Indeed, our
                     articulation of minimal computing in this introduction is as influenced by the
                     insights and critiques raised by authors in this issue as it was by our previous
                     writing and work with the Minimal Computing Working Group. The most salient
                     critique for us, which demands the most attention, is the technical education
                     (i.e., symbolic computational literacy, or knowing how to code) that reduction in
                     computation requires. Time to learn new skills is a privilege, and technological
                     training is not something that can be delivered in a few workshops or a summer
                     school. Rather, it requires sustained effort with the belief that the time
                     invested will ultimately liberate scholarship from reliance on out-of-the-box
                     tools and open up new possibilities for representation of material from minortized
                     communities in the digital cultural record. Further, as several of the essays and
                     case studies in this issue testify, a complete divorce from expensive or maximal
                     forms of computation prove impossible at present. The relationship with social
                     media, Google and Amazon infrastructure, large databases, and GitHub will continue
                     for the foreseeable future Despite critiques, which can and should continue to be
                     addressed through our collective work, the two of us still see minimal computing
                     as a space wherein we can explore forms of computation that do not depend on
                     expensive infrastructures and the harmful practices of the centers of capital
                     accumulation in the 21st century. In the final tally, we hope this conversation
                     can serve as one of the loci of inspiration for original local and regional
                     practices that best meet the needs of the workers of the record and a critique of
                     current systems of knowledge distribution and (re-)production of the past — both
                     humanistic and technical.</div>

                     is that minimal computing is synonymous with static site generation. It is not.

                     humanities is not defined by which platform one uses but what one does with it.

                     principles of minimal computing have given rise to a variety of methods. In the
                     intervening years, minimal computing saw multiple developments, such as the
