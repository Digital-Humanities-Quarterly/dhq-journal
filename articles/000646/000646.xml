            <p>Minimal computing is the answer. Minimal computing is easy. Minimal computing
               consists of multiple methods, some as yet to be imagined. Minimal computing will end
               pandemics/thwart Putin/stop climate change. Minimal computing will save the
               humanities. Minimal computing is a false prophet. Minimal computing distracts from
               the pressing issues of the day. Minimal computing is static site generation. Minimal
               computing is hard. Minimal computing is not the answer.</p>
            <p>Perhaps all of these statements made, explicitly or implicitly, throughout this
               special issue of <title rend="italic">Digital Humanities Quarterly</title> are true.
               Perhaps they are all fiction. Or, perhaps, minimal computing is a methodological
               Jekyll and Hyde,<note> Pun on the <ref target="https://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll site
                     generation software</ref> and the <ref
                     target="https://jekyllthemes.io/theme/hyde">Jekyll theme Hyde</ref>
                  intended.</note> good, evil, and, well, strange, all at once. Or, perhaps, minimal
               computing is a Rorschach inkblot — those of us who practice and critique it see what
               we want to see, project our hopes and fears, and expect too much. In this special
               issue, the first collection of peer reviewed scholarship on minimal computing, we
               shed light on the theories and practices of minimal computing through a blend of
               theoretical essays and case studies that illuminate how to undertake digital
               humanities scholarship under institutional and infrastructural constraints. </p></div>
            <div>
               <head>Defining Minimal Computing</head>
               <p>Defining minimal computing is as quixotic a task as defining digital humanities
                  itself <ptr target="#kirschenbaum2012"/> <ptr target="#spiro2012"/> <ptr target="#bianco2012"/> <ptr target="#hall2012"/>.<note> Yes, we
                     went there. </note> Minimal computing is less a singular methodology — or even
                  a coherent set of methodologies — than it is a mode of thinking about digital
                  humanities praxis that resists the idea that <q>innovation</q> is defined by newness,
                  scale, or scope. Broadly speaking, minimal computing connotes digital humanities
                  work undertaken in the context of some set of constraints. This could include lack
                  of access to hardware or software, network capacity, technical education, or even
                  a reliable power grid <ptr target="#mcwg2022"/>.</p>
               <p>Minimal computing is an approach that, first and foremost, advocates for using <emph>only</emph> the technologies that are necessary and sufficient for
                  developing digital humanities scholarship in such constrained environments. This
                  does not mean that the <q>minimal</q> of <q>minimal computing</q> implies ease for all users
                  or prescribes acceptable types of hardware, software, and platforms (e.g., Jekyll,
                  Arduino, and Raspberry PI).<note> A recurrent misunderstanding that we encounter
                     is that minimal computing is synonymous with static site generation. It is not.
                     In this essay we use the term <q>Minimal Computing™</q> to denote this
                     misperception. </note> Rather, it gestures towards a decision-making process
                  driven by the local contexts in which scholarship is being created. In this way,
                  minimal computing is platform- and software-agnostic, emphasizing instead the
                  importance of making these choices, based on the constraints with which we are
                  working, to facilitate the development of digital humanities scholarship in
                  environments where resources (e.g., financial, infrastructural, and labor) or
                  freedoms (e.g., movement and speech) are scarce. </p>
               <p>Our observations here may not satisfy those expecting a more concrete definition
                  of minimal computing. Therefore, we offer the following: minimal computing is
                  perhaps best understood as a heuristic comprising four questions to determine what
                  is, in fact, necessary and sufficient when developing a digital humanities project
                  under constraint: 1) <q>what do we need?</q>; 2) <q>what do we have</q>; 3) <q>what must we
                  prioritize?</q>; and 4) <q>what are we willing to give up?</q> </p>
               <p><q>What do we need?</q> is a question that echoes throughout essays and case studies in
                  this special issue. In 2016, Alex, along with Élika Ortega, posed this question in
                  their essay, <title rend="quotes">Multilingual Practices and Minimal Computing</title> <ptr target="#gil2016"/>.
                  The question of <q>need</q> is one intended to cut through a tendency in digital
                  humanities to valorize keeping pace with trends towards high-speed computing,
                  acquisition of the latest computational technologies, and fetishization of the
                  cutting edge. Sometimes — perhaps often — when we pause to consider what we <emph>actually</emph> need to complete a project, the answer isn’t access
                  to the latest and greatest but the tried and true. In our work with faculty and
                  collaborators, we have seen firsthand how the drive to be <q>innovative</q> for the
                  sake of innovation can be a deterrent to actually completing (or even starting) a
                  project. For example, Roopika (Roopsi)<note> Examples from Roopsi’s experience are
                     drawn from her work at Salem State University (2013-2022), while Alex’s are
                     from his work at Columbia University (2012-2022). We are starting new positions
                     at Dartmouth College and Yale University, respectively, in July 2022. </note>
                  has had countless conversations with colleagues who are convinced that they <emph>need</emph> to use a particular piece of software, like ArcGIS,
                  because it’s popular and has a name brand association with digital humanities,
                  when something simpler like Tableau, ArcGIS StoryMaps, or even Google My Maps
                  would suffice.<note> If anything, we hope that our heuristic for minimal computing
                     liberates scholars from the mentality of <q>this-platform-is-digital-humanities</q>
                     and <q>that-platform-is-not-digital-humanities</q> because, ultimately, digital
                     humanities is not defined by which platform one uses but what one does with it.
                  </note> Alex has had many similar conversations, in which the need to publish an
                  online edition of a historical text is confused with the need to learn TEI, or the
                  desire to count occurrences of a trope in a literary text is confused with
                  learning Python or using an <q>easy</q> but expensive tool like NVivo. When we reorient
                  our praxis around the question of <title rend="quotes">what we need?</title> rather than what we <emph>think</emph> we need, we are better positioned to see digital
                  humanities projects through because our technical choices, methods, and research
                  questions are more appropriately aligned. </p>
               <p>The question of <q>What do we have?</q> is equally as critical because it encourages
                  practitioners to focus on the assets available to them and thus resists a deficit
                  mindset for those of us who are working under constraints. Quite often, the lauded
                  models of digital humanities scholarship are projects developed with significant
                  institutional resources and grant funding. It’s easy to look at those examples and
                  focus on what we <emph>don’t</emph> have. Shifting the frame of our
                  thinking towards what we <emph>do</emph> have is critical to identifying
                  the resources we have at our disposal. Minimal computing draws the inspiration for
                  this question from asset-based approaches that exist in multiple forms around the
                  world, such as <emph>jugaad</emph> in India, <emph
                     >gambiarra</emph> in Brazil, <emph>rebusque</emph> in Colombia, <emph>jua kali</emph> in Kenya, and <emph>zizhu
                     chuangxin</emph> in China. These practices privilege making do with available
                  materials for creative problem-solving and innovation <ptr target="#risam2018a"/>. An example of
                  this in the U.S. context appears in Joshua Davis’s book <title rend="italic">Spare
                     Parts</title>, the story of a group of undocumented high school students whose
                  underwater robotics team beat teams from colleges like MIT, who had access to
                  high-tech polymers and funding from Xerox, simply by relying on knowledge gleaned
                  from working with family members who were gardeners and mechanics <ptr target="#davis2014"/>
                  <ptr target="#risam2018b"/>. In her work at Salem State University, Roopsi and her colleagues
                  Susan Edwards and Justin Snow put the question of <q>what do we have?</q> at the heart
                  of their digital humanities initiatives with students. They focused on the
                  resources they had — archival holdings on early 20th-century local history, their
                  collective knowledge, their library server, and existing faculty professional
                  development programs that they could reappropriate to build a digital humanities
                  internship program for students <ptr target="#risam2018"/> <ptr target="#risam2017"/>.
                  Alex, in turn, has purposefully visited several countries around the world, and
                  worlds within countries, to answer the question: what do folks doing humanities
                  and cultural work have? The answers vary wildly, from the University of Khartoum's
                  history department to Havana's undercommons to the incarcerated youth at Rikers
                  Island in New York City. In Sudan, for example, electricity is unstable at certain
                  times of day and Internet activity is censored by the government. This means that
                  any solutions there must focus on what scholars do have: hard drives, where
                  projects can live more freely than on the Internet; the ability to create multiple
                  versions of projects to evade government censors; and dedicated, affordable PCs
                  running on batteries to provide classes with access. Through a focus on what we do
                  have, rather than what we don’t, we are better positioned to assess and leverage
                  extant resources and use them to resourcefully make do with the means at our
                  disposal. They may not look like the resources that are available at elite
                  institutions or made possible by grant funding, but they are resources
                  nonetheless. </p>
               <p>Following on the questions of what we need and what we have, asking <q>What must we
                  prioritize?</q> is essential to the mode of thinking for which minimal computing
                  advocates. When working under constraints, we cannot treat all competing
                  priorities in a project as equally important. When developing a recent project,
                  Roopsi chose to use WordPress rather than the Jekyll static site generator for the
                  website. While using Jekyll would have reduced maintenance and increased security
                  because it does not rely on a database — two features that Roopsi prefers —
                  WordPress’s graphical user interface (GUI) made website updates easier for all her
                     collaborators.<note> See, we said minimal computing is not synonymous with
                     Jekyll. </note> The learning curve for Jekyll, which involves using the command
                  line and requires some rudimentary understanding of Markdown, CSS, and Liquid, was
                  unfamiliar to most of them, and her collaborators, who work at universities with
                  high teaching loads, could not allocate the bandwidth to learning Jekyll simply to
                  add content to a website. Prioritizing people over platforms, in this instance,
                  was the appropriate choice to ensure full participation of all collaborators. On
                  the other hand, in his role as digital scholarship librarian, which included
                  helping individual faculty members get digital projects off the ground, Alex found
                  it enormously more time efficient to receive data from collaborators in formats
                  that were already familiar to them (e.g., spreadsheets and Microsoft Word
                  documents) and build projects for them using Jekyll or Wax himself. In both cases,
                  the priority determines the choice of technology. Whether it is or isn't a
                  technology associated with Minimal Computing™ is less important. The question
                  <q>What must we prioritize?</q> speaks to the fact that minimal computing is not
                  prescriptive or advocating for the use of particular software, hardware, or
                  platforms, but rather points to a decision-making process that responds to the
                  constraints of a given situation for project development.</p>
               <p>The final question for minimal computing is, <q>What are we willing to give up?</q> In
                  environments in which we are contending with limitations, whether of
                  infrastructure, finances, labor, and/or technical knowledge, among other factors,
                  we simply cannot have it all. There are tough decisions to be made, taking into
                  account what we need, what we have, and what we must prioritize. This could mean
                  eschewing the latest, flashiest methods that would cost more money, time, and
                  labor, in favor of a simpler approach that would be practically achievable with
                  what we have. Or it could mean choosing a platform that does not meet every
                  desired requirement of a team but still makes it possible for a project to move
                     forward.<note> As Keith Richards and Mick Jagger, forerunners of minimal
                     computing, once noted, <quote rend="inline">You can’t always get what you want but if you try
                        sometimes, well, you just might find you get what you need</quote> <ptr target="#richards1969"/>.</note> For example, when working with students at Salem State
                  University, where students typically work 30-40 hours per week in addition to
                  taking classes, Roopsi tended to use out-of-the-box tools that students can
                  reasonably learn how to use during class time, rather than bespoke solutions that
                  would require students to learn how to code and require substantial independent
                  work outside of class. By giving up what might ultimately be prettier or more
                  elegant, in the context of teaching, she instead focused on technologies that help
                  students gain confidence in their digital literacy skills and have small wins that
                  might later encourage them to develop a stronger technical skill set. Alex has
                  made analogous decisions in his own practice. When designing the technology for
                  the project Around DH in 80 Days, for example, he was confronted with the
                  challenge of creating a map that could be downloaded in low bandwidth environments
                  and even function on a USB key, in order to make the project capable of traveling
                  around as many of the different digital infrastructures of the planet as possible.
                  To do so, he had to give up on the idea of a map with functionalities such as
                  zoom, tiles, or layers <ptr target="#gil2014"/>. Recognizing that wanting to have it all
                  is a deterrent is essential to making the choices necessary when working under
                  constraints.</p>
               <p>The <q>minimal</q> in <q>minimal computing</q> therefore stands in stark contrast to an
                  implied <q>maximal,</q> where <q>maximal</q> connotes design choices that are made without
                  putting the question of what is necessary and sufficient at the heart of
                  decision-making. The primary contribution of minimal computing to digital
                  humanities is to draw attention to the fact that the decisions we make when
                  designing digital humanities projects — our use of particular kinds of hardware,
                  software, and platforms — are not inherently virtuous (or lacking in virtue) but
                  are inevitably encumbered by opportunities and challenges, affordances and
                  limitations, and benefits and tradeoffs by nature. The authors in this issue
                  grapple with these very concerns — just as the two of us do as practitioners —
                  each coming to different answers that are responsive to the local contexts in
                  which their theories and practices are being developed and the constraints of
                  these environments. This is our minimal computing. </p>

               <head>Tense Origins</head>
               <p>Minimal computing in the humanities — like digital humanities itself — emerges
                  from many parallel and intersecting origin stories. Rather than tracing the
                  genealogies that led us to this special issue of <title rend="italic">Digital
                     Humanities Quarterly </title>chronologically, we might be better served by
                  illuminating the tensions within digital humanities that have given rise to the
                  concept over the past several decades and will continue to be shaped by minimal
                  computing’s four constituent questions — 1) <q>what do we need?</q>; 2) <q>what do we
                  have</q>; 3) <q>what must we prioritize?</q>; 4) <q>what are we willing to give up?</q> — in
                  the foreseeable future.<note> For those who insist on a Marvel Comics-style origin
                     story: By the shores of Lake Geneva, Alps looming in the distance, the Minimal
                     Computing Working Group was born at its first workshop at the Digital
                     Humanities 2014 Conference in Lausanne. As the workshop’s <ref
                        target="http://www.globaloutlookdh.org/minimal-computing/kickstart-workshop/"
                        >call for proposals</ref> suggests, the themes running through this special
                     issue are deeply connected to initial framings for minimal computing and the
                     principles of minimal computing have given rise to a variety of methods. In the
                     intervening years, minimal computing saw multiple developments, such as the
                        <ref target="https://go-dh.github.io/mincomp/">Minimal Computing Working
                        Group site</ref>; development of software and workflows, such as <ref
                        target="https://elotroalex.github.io/ed/">Ed., a Jekyll theme for minimal
                        digital editions</ref>, and <ref target="https://minicomp.github.io/wax/"
                        >Wax, a workflow for producing minimal digital exhibits</ref>; and the
                     vanquishing of Thanos. (Fine, that last one wasn’t us.) </note>
               </p>
               <p>The first tension implied in minimal computing is between the constant drive
                  towards larger, faster, always-on forms of computing and the infrastructural,
                  institutional, and financial realities that constrain digital humanities project
                  development. In the context of academic research, this tension dates back to the
                  birth of modern computers, long before the advent of the personal computer or the
                  Internet. At that time, only elite universities in wealthy countries could afford
                  mainframe computers for computational labor. Today, this impulse takes many forms
                  in digital humanities, including the valorization of cluster computing, high speed
                  Internet, cloud computing, and big data. Those supporting and relying on
                  computation who work on the creation of online publications cite the need for
                  user-friendly data entry (i.e., GUIs in web browsers) or continuous publication of
                  new materials. Those working in cultural analytics, text analysis, and the like
                  cite the need for large data processing capacity in the drive towards new insights
                  derived algorithmically from large data sets of cultural corpora. Implied in this
                  narrow definition of <q>innovation</q> is an access differential: those who have access
                  to such technologies and those who do not. </p>
               <p>The implications of this attitude have substantial impact on the future directions
                  of digital humanities research. For example, grant funding and institutional
                  support for digital humanities scholarship follows this mentality, exacerbating
                  existing inequities. The creation of projects that rely solely on the Internet for
                  distribution, thereby excluding large groups of scholars around the world from
                  access, offers another example. While researchers in the Global North are
                  beginning to develop more nuanced understandings of the asymmetrical ecologies of
                  access to and use of technology — which researchers of the Global South have long
                  understood — the expenses tied to newer, faster, and bigger technologies continue
                  to have material implications on the ground.<note> We use the terms <q>Global North</q>
                     and <q>Global South</q> as shorthand for the divide between high-income and
                     low-income economies produced by colonialism. However, we recognize that like
                     related terms such as <q>developed countries,</q> <q>the Third World,</q> and <q>the West</q>
                     it has limitations in its tendencies towards homogenization and its
                     geographical accuracy. </note> These costs go well beyond access, touching on
                  environmental concerns, questions of ownership and control over scholarship in the
                  context of postcolonial and neocolonial relationships, the reinforcement of
                  inequitable prestige economies in the global academy, labor conditions for
                  academic workers, and more. And, put simply, this attitude implicitly limits the
                  scope of digital humanities scholarship to the type of work that can be produced
                  with more robust resources. </p>
               <p>The second tension is a relatively newer one between metaphorical computer
                  literacy — the ability to use GUIs, an act in which most people with computational
                  devices engage through their ordinary interactions online — and symbolic
                  computational literacy, or the ability to <q>code,</q> which remains the purview of a
                  rare few, especially in the humanities. Much has been made of the debate over
                  whether one must code to be a digital humanist<note> Yes, we went there too.
                  </note> <ptr target="#cecire2011"/> <ptr target="#sample2011"/> <ptr target="#posner2012"/>. The two of us have, at earlier
                  moments in our careers, understood firsthand how many who wish to undertake
                  digital humanities scholarship are simply looking for easy access to
                  out-of-the-box software and platforms with GUIs for project development. </p>
               <p>The history of digital humanities is marked by many laudable efforts to create
                  tools with GUIs that allow scholars to create digital scholarship in the
                  humanities without having to develop much symbolic computational literacy.
                  However, these tools are inextricably linked to the dominance of English as a
                  lingua franca for programming and markup languages, with downstream implications
                  for those working with languages other than English — namely the emphasis on
                  Anglophone scholarship in digital humanities and the comparative underdevelopment
                  of multilingual digital humanities, particularly languages in scripts other than
                  Latin and those read from right to left <ptr target="#fiormonte2015"/> <ptr target="#risam2018a"/> <ptr target="#wrisley2019"/>. In addition, we have increasingly come to understand that GUIs hide the
                  systems that drive that production, and by extension, the labor to maintain and
                  sustain them. For example, platforms like WordPress that rely on a database
                  require labor to keep abreast of updates and patches, deprecated dependencies like
                  plugins, and their vulnerability to security breaches — and to fix the issues that
                  inevitably arise. Such invisible labor is so successfully obscured that even the
                  most veteran practitioners struggle with its implications after decades of work in
                  the field <ptr target="#drucker2021"/> <ptr target="#yelton2021"/>. Technologies associated with Minimal
                  Computing™ like Jekyll offer some relief from labor issues by avoiding reliance on
                  a database, though not without inevitable tradeoffs — among them, the learning
                  curve for use. </p>
               <p>The <q>minimal</q> of <q>minimal computing</q> has been assumed by some to promise ease of
                  use or to only require a minimal amount of symbolic computational literacy.
                  Certainly, a team might choose to use a GUI because it best serves the questions
                  of what we need, have, must prioritize, and are willing to give up. However, like
                  all design decisions, such a choice comes with consequences. While those who doubt
                  their ability to learn how to code see the use of GUI-driven platforms as the key
                  to access, often these systems foreclose more control over the production of
                  knowledge, and by extension, participation that is more meaningful to those who
                  seek access. As Matthew Kirschenbaum has proposed, coding is a form of
                  worldmaking, in which the coder defines how that world operates <ptr target="#kirschenbaum2009"/>. In the context of digital humanities, being able to code gives us the power
                  to create new worlds in which we model human knowledge and culture <ptr target="#risam2018a"/>.
                  As we (Roopsi and Alex) have developed our own capacity to code, we have come to
                  see the ways that it has opened up the possibilities for digital humanities
                  scholarship, particularly when working with material from communities that have
                  historically been — and continue to be — excluded from the cultural record. </p>
               <p>Making the transition to thinking and practicing in the realm of symbolic
                  computational literacy, we can more easily seek solutions that promote broader
                  access through reduction of technological complexity (e.g., minimizing reliance on
                  databases, thereby reducing security risk and maximizing access in low bandwidth
                  environments). The idea of a reduction in computation has two useful and concrete
                  senses for us: first, literally less code or fewer bytes, and in turn, less
                  computational processing time or capacity. This notion of doing more with less has
                  been fundamental to the development and teaching of computer science, where
                  students are introduced early on to the concept of <q>Big O notation,</q> which
                  highlights the importance of ever more efficient algorithms to accomplish a given
                  task. We also see this drive towards <q>elegance</q> in the history of UNIX systems,
                  and in some of the foundational forms of computing that are still in use today in
                  digital humanities. A reduction in computation implies a reduction in energy
                  consumed, storage, and labor. In the same vein, we know that computation itself
                  allows us to perform many tasks that could be done by hand but would take
                  substantially longer. Take for example the creation of a works cited page: we can
                  either construct it by ourselves, or we could let software like Zotero write it
                  for us based on our bibliographic data. While by no means wedded to reduction in
                  computation or the substitution of manual labor by computation as requirements,
                  minimal computing asks us to imagine how these might help us accomplish our
                  various scholarly tasks in the humanities. </p>
               <p>Implied in the first two tensions is a crucial third: the tension between choice
                  and necessity. In her work at Salem State University, Roopsi worked with minimal
                  hardware, created small static sites, and processed small data sets out of
                  necessity, born from working at a resource-starved public university. Alex, in his
                  work at Columbia University, did so often by choice. In her new position at
                  Dartmouth College, Roopsi will have the choice to work with expensive software or
                  cluster computing — a choice that Alex had at Columbia and will have at Yale
                  University. Both of us can take for granted high speed Internet access provided by
                  our universities, as well as access to a reliable power grid. Even accounting for
                  the major disparities in resources between the institutions where we started our
                  careers, we recognize that our work in digital humanities has been undertaken in
                  relative privilege not shared by our colleagues around the world. </p>
               <p>Choosing to do otherwise — to pursue maximal approaches to digital humanities — is
                  not inherently noxious. However, the humanities, charged with the interpretation
                  and stewardship of human culture writ large, cannot afford to ignore scholarship
                  developed under substantial constraints or circumstances. Otherwise, we will only
                  reproduce and amplify the exclusions and biases that colonialism and
                  neocolonialism have produced in the analog cultural and historical record <ptr target="#risam2018a"/>. Accordingly, any desire to work alongside colleagues around the world to
                  ensure the production of a more inclusive digital cultural record requires
                  engagement with necessity and constraint. Minimal computing provides theoretical
                  and practical considerations to facilitate such collaboration and dialogue. </p>
               <p>The tensions we have outlined arise out of unfortunate political, historical, and
                  economic circumstances that provide urgent and appropriate ground for minimal
                  computing practices and theory to thrive. This larger set of circumstances is
                  beyond humanities practitioners to resolve, but they certainly provide the frame
                  and fuel for much of our practice today. We would be remiss, however, to not
                  acknowledge the relationship between the climate crisis and the development of
                  computational technologies. Computing emerged <term>in medias res</term>
                  of a process that began with the imperial enterprises of Portugal and Spain five
                  centuries ago, only to be turbo-charged during the Industrial Revolution and to
                  begin steadily accelerating during the second half of the 20th century. Despite
                  its relatively late arrival, the demands of computing on energy sources seem to
                  grow exponentially as the world becomes more dependent on computers. Ecological
                  activism consistently casts a critical look at these rising costs. In addition to
                  energy, the environmental impact of computation includes mineral exploitation,
                  chemical emissions during production, and e-waste and landfill runoff. Clean
                  energy for the planet may be solved in this or the next century, but we can't know
                  that with certainty without recourse to some mystic belief in innovation,
                  structural change, and destiny. We are left with few concrete options to join the
                  effort to reverse our impact on the planet besides our voices, one of them being
                  the reduction of our relatively small carbon footprint as scholars.<note> We
                     recognize that change must be structural and that reducing our individual
                     carbon footprints while technology companies destroy the environment with
                     unregulated abandon is like saying that banning plastic straws will save the
                     sea turtles when they only account for 0.025% of ocean plastics <ptr target="#unep2018"/> —
                     peak neoliberalism. But unlike ableist attempts to replace plastic straws with
                     paper ones (which disintegrate into a pulpy mess in your drink and are <emph>not</emph> suitable substitutes), we are not proposing a minimal
                     computing mandate, just food for thought on an affordance of minimal computing.

               <head>Why Minimal Computing? </head>
               <p>To be clear, our investment in minimal computing comes not from a fetish for
                  computational reduction or a bias against databases or supercomputing but from a
                  very real fear that reliance on these technologies is foreclosing the
                  possibilities for the development of a digital cultural record that includes the
                  voices and stories from communities that have been elided in the cultural record —
                  like our own.<note> Roopsi is Kashmiri and Alex is Dominican, though people often
                     think we are related.</note> This fear and our belief in the possibility of
                  changing it is what fundamentally drives all the work we do <ptr target="#risam2018a"/> <ptr target="#gil2016"/>. As we have noted, documentary culture — the primary sources,
                  archives, and texts that attest to human knowledge and history — has been
                  profoundly shaped by colonialism. Its transformations, brought about by computers
                  and networks, place us today in a long transition from an analog cultural and
                  historical record to a hybrid one — parts analog, parts digital. This is not to
                  suggest that the digital is distinct from material reality — the digital is itself
                  material — but the analog record and the digital record are different enough that
                  it's helpful to think about the digital as a separate domain. (In short,
                  preserving paper is a fundamentally different affair than preserving bitstreams.) </p>
               <p>The construction of this new record of the human past, present, and future, as we
                  have also suggested, is gravely affected by socio-technical inequities — not every
                  cultural heritage or scholarly outfit around the world has access to the same
                  infrastructure or resources. In response to this, minimal computing encourages
                  solutions that can be implemented universally. The irony of two people trained as
                  postcolonialists advocating for a universal is not lost on us. This is the same
                  paradox that many anti-colonial and postcolonial writers explored in the 20th
                  century: to seek the universal in the recovery of the particulars that were
                  ignored in colonial archives and rendered invisible by the totalizing impulse of
                  European colonialism and its <q>Enlightenment</q> <ptr target="#wilder2015"/>. However, what we seek
                  is an interoperability of digital humanities practices that promote access and
                  equity in digital knowledge production. </p>
               <p>A quick overview, in the largest of broad strokes, paints a concerning picture of
                  the scholarly record at a planetary scale today. The European, North American, and
                  East Asian dominance in the production of knowledge is evident in terms of brute
                  quantity. Concomitant with this state of affairs, several pirate operations have
                  arisen from the ashes of the former Soviet Union and its satellites, creating
                  libraries that give access to a large part of this knowledge to the rest of the
                  world with access to the Internet.<note> Two examples are <ref
                        target="https://sci-hub.se/">Sci-Hub</ref> for articles and <ref
                        target="http://libgen.is/">Library Genesis</ref> for ebooks, which are very
                     illegal so you should definitely not visit the links and search for what you
                     need. </note> In Latin America, the long history of open access initiatives
                  gives us further hope. Despite these liberatory efforts, the flows of knowledge
                  continue to move from those who produce the most in the putative <q>West</q> to the
                  rest — mimicking flows of colonial power from center to periphery — without any
                  clear sign that the movement is reciprocated through uptake of scholarship from
                  the Global South. </p>
               <p>At the heart of this state of affairs is the role of capital in the control of
                  scholarly production. Open access and pirate enterprises point away from the
                  accumulation of capital, and as such, clash with the monopolizing tendencies of
                  the North Atlantic and East Asian models of knowledge production, which coincide
                  with larger expenses in computational infrastructure. It is, perhaps, no surprise
                  that such tendencies have led to the knowledge cartels of the Global North
                  attempting to co-opt open access through article processing charges (APCs) levied
                  on authors to make their scholarship open access. Minimal computing intervenes by
                  studying and creating modes of production that promise control at the local level
                  for those who wish to avoid absorption by capital, who don't want to cede their
                  intellectual integrity to the pressures that come with that absorption, and whose
                  work is suppressed because it does not align with that which capital values (i.e.,
                  knowledge production beyond the Global North).<note> Insofar as anything can be
                     <q>outside</q> capital.</note> This includes an exploration of the possibilities for
                  community knowledge production that define the shifting epistemologies of our
                  historical moment.</p>
               <p>When we speak of knowledge production, we no longer speak simply of the production
                  of documents. We include the production of data, data sets, and documents as data,
                  all of which can be used for algorithmic analysis or manipulation. The issue of
                  control over data sets, especially those that can inform the pasts of whole
                  demographics of people in the world, will certainly come to a head in the 21st
                  century. One example of danger is control over Black data. At the moment of
                  writing, the vast majority of the data and documents that help us understand the
                  history of Black people during the period of Atlantic chattel slavery are
                  controlled by predominantly white scholarly teams and library administrators or
                  white-owned vendors.<note> See <ref target="https://matrix.msu.edu/enslaved"

                     however, in the work of scholars such as Kim Gallon <ptr target="#gallon2016"/>, the Colored
                     Conventions Project <ptr target="#foreman2021"/>, the work of the <ref

                     Marie Johnson as principal investigators. </note> This demonstrates how access
                  to infrastructure has direct consequences on our study and reconstruction of the
                  past and, by extension, what we understand that past to be. While data reparations
                  must be made, our interest here is in the role that minimal computing can play in
                  the development of present and future data sets, documents as data, and methods
                  that promote collaboration and interoperability among colleagues around the world
                  by not only taking into account uneven distribution of resources and the
                  constraints with which the majority are contending but also by ensuring that
                  control over the production of knowledge is in their hands.</p>
               <p>All of this scholarly and cultural work by necessity implies the need for
                  different labor arrangements. Large or wealthy universities and colleges in the
                  North Atlantic, for example, enjoy full-time information technology and digital
                  scholarship teams working in and outside libraries that provide a certain degree
                  of stability to the creation of digital collections and digital humanities
                  scholarly projects. A few companies, staff on soft-money, and independent
                  contractors have also joined the fray to provide their technical services.
                  Granting agencies in rich economies have supported the production of digital
                  humanities projects that involve arrangements between non-technical scholars and
                  teams of technologists, often with an unacknowledged systems administration team
                  provided by institutions or a company. In this arrangement the scholars with
                  resources bear little pressure to understand the fundamentals of the labor
                  arrangements that make their projects possible and are alienated from the means of
                  production of their own knowledge. In addition to our concern for those who
                  provide invisible labor, we recognize that those who do not have access to such
                  arrangements will only continue to lag in their ability to keep pace with those
                  who do. By advocating for minimal computing, therefore, we aim to create a more
                  level playing field for the future of a digital cultural record where the voices
                  of those who have been excluded can be heard and valued through a more equitable,
                  collaborative approach to the labor of knowledge production that facilitates their
                  engagement. </p>

               <head>Minimal Computing and Its Discontents </head>
               <p>In their own ways, articles in this special issue speak to the ways the tensions
                  of environment, race, access, labor, and control interface with the material
                  realities of producing digital humanities scholarship under constraints. This
                  issue features two types of contributions: theoretical essays and case studies.
                  The five lengthier essays build on the early writings of the Minimal Computing
                  Working Group, as well as our own writing <ptr target="#gil2016"/> <ptr target="#risam2018a"/>, to
                  expand, imagine, dream, caution, critique, and, at times, heckle. The nine case
                  studies that follow take a closer look at how minimal computing is practiced, on
                  the ground, through projects and tools being developed and used.</p>
               <p>The essays explore the theories and practices of minimal computing. We open the
                  issue with Grant Wythoff’s <title rend="quotes">Ensuring Minimal Computing Serves Maximal Connection,</title>
                  which examines current conversations on digital minimalism in light of the history
                  of minimalism in art and asks whether arguments for minimalism hold in a
                  socially-distant and unevenly connected world. We continue with two essays that
                  take different approaches to exploring the relationship between minimal computing
                  and labor. Tiffany Chan and Jentery Sayers’s <title rend="quotes">Minimal Computing from the Labor
                  Perspective</title> considers the lessons from the University of Victoria Libraries’
                  migration Vault to advocate for degrowth of digital projects by articulating
                  project needs, the labor required, and how to sustain it. Exploring the affective
                  dimensions of minimal computing, Quinn Dombrowski’s essay, <title rend="quotes">Minimizing Computing
                  Maximizes Labor,</title> argues that the tradeoff for using static site generation for
                  web development is a concomitant increase in emotional labor and proposes needed
                  interventions to realize the potential of static-site generators for digital
                  humanities scholarship. Offering a critique of plain-text, Nabeel Siddiqui’s
                  <title rend="quotes">Hidden in Plain-TeX: Investigating Minimal Computing Workflows</title> situates
                  Markdown, a markup language used in Minimal Computing™, in the history of TeX and
                  explores the lessons it provides for those who engage with digital humanities.
                  Concluding this section, Martin Eve’s <title rend="quotes">Lessons from the Library: Extreme
                  Minimalist Scaling at Pirate Ebook Platforms</title> proposes a novel application of
                  minimal computing to the emergence of pirate libraries that explores tensions
                  between minimalism and maximalism in Library Genesis and its scalability. </p>
               <p>Equally as important are the case studies, which present minimal computing in
                  practice. They collectively offer an exploration of multiple methods, articulating
                  how they exemplify, build on, and expand minimal computing practices in diverse
                  geographic, cultural, and linguistic contexts. We begin with case studies that
                  offer insight on labor and precarity. Matthew Lincoln, Jennifer Isasi, Sarah
                  Melton, and François Dominic Laramée’s <title rend="quotes">Relocating Complexity: The Programming
                  Historian and Multilingual Static Site Generation</title> discusses the labor-based
                  challenges of maintaining a sustainable static-site architecture for the <title
                     rend="italic">Programming Historian</title> when expanding into multilingual
                  publication. Christina Boyles and Andy Boyles Petersen’s case study, <title rend="quotes">Power and
                  Precarity: Lessons from the Makers by Mail Project,</title> interrogates the relationship
                  between minimal computing and academic austerity, using the question, <q>What do we
                  need?</q> to center not only technological developments but also ethical engagement. </p>
               <p>We continue with case studies that examine cross-border collaborations. Sylvia
                  Fernández’s <quote rend="inline"><title rend="italic">United Fronteras</title> como tercer espacio: Modelo
                  transfronterizo a través de las humanidades digitales poscoloniales y la
                  computación mínima</quote> (<quote rend="inline"><title rend="italic">United Fronteras</title> as Third Space: A
                  Transborder Model Through Postcolonial Digital Humanities and Minimal Computing</quote>)
                  discusses how the project <title rend="italic">United Fronteras</title> counters
                  hegemonic representations of the Mexico-United States border and argues that
                  minimal computing practices generate a third digital space to document multiple
                  histories and public memory of the borderlands. Shifting transnational
                  collaboration into the realm of teaching, Raffaele Viglianti, Gimena del Rio
                  Riande, and Nidia Hernández’s case study, <title rend="quotes">Open, Equitable, and Minimal: Teaching
                  Digital Scholarly Editing North and South,</title> examines how minimal computing can
                  establish common ground between research environments in the Global North and
                  Global South through their experience teaching a Collaborative Online
                  International Learning (COIL) course on minimal digital scholarly editions at
                  Universidad del Salvador in Buenos Aires, Argentina and the University of
                  Maryland, College Park in the United States. </p>
               <p>Taking up minimal editions from another angle, Zahra Rizvi, Rohan Chauhan, A. Sean
                  Pue, and Nishat Zaidi’s case study, <title rend="quotes">Minimal Computing for Exploring Indian
                  Poetics,</title> explores their use of plain text and minimal computing to produce
                  multilingual, annotated digital critical editions of poetry in multiple Indian
                  languages and to visualize poetics. Looking at the challenges of language, labor,
                  and socio-technical infrastructure, Till Grallert’s <title rend="quotes">Open Arabic Periodical
                  Editions: A Framework for Bootstrapped Scholarly Editions Outside the Global
                  North</title> provides an in-depth look at successful efforts to digitize and disseminate
                  texts from the late Ottoman Eastern Mediterranean. </p>
               <p>We conclude the issue with case studies that explore applications of minimal
                  computing beyond textual studies. Chris Diaz’s case study, <title rend="quotes">Minimal Computing with
                  Progressive Web Apps,</title> describes his work in collaboration with museums and
                  students to develop <title rend="italic">Caravans of Gold</title>, a multilingual
                  digital exhibit built as both a static website and progressive web app. Tackling
                  the challenge of documenting intangible cultural heritage, Jing Chen, Mengqi Li,
                  Wensi Lin, Yinzhou Zhao, Mengyue Chang, Han Chen, Quiang Hu, and Yongqing Xie’s
                  <title rend="quotes">Simple but Beautiful: A Case Study on the ZHI Project of Traditional
                  Craftsmanship</title> discusses how to use minimal computing to bridge a gap between
                  craftspeople and the general public and facilitate sustainable knowledge
                  production about cornerstones of traditional craftsmanship in Nanjing, China:
                  Yunjin brocade, gold foil forging, and velvet flower making. Finally, Tanya
                  Clement, Ben Brumfield, and Sara Brumfield’s <quote rend="inline">The AudiAnnotate Project: Four Case
                  Studies in Publishing Annotations for Audio and Video</quote> discusses their work
                  creating the AudiAnnotate platform, which builds on the IIIF standards for AV to
                  address challenges of engaging with audio through annotation.</p>
               <p>As the essays and case studies indicate, we welcomed engagement from minimal
                  computing enthusiasts and critics alike in this special issue. Indeed, our
                  articulation of minimal computing in this introduction is as influenced by the
                  insights and critiques raised by authors in this issue as it was by our previous
                  writing and work with the Minimal Computing Working Group. The most salient
                  critique for us, which demands the most attention, is the technical education
                  (i.e., symbolic computational literacy, or knowing how to code) that reduction in
                  computation requires. Time to learn new skills is a privilege, and technological
                  training is not something that can be delivered in a few workshops or a summer
                  school. Rather, it requires sustained effort with the belief that the time
                  invested will ultimately liberate scholarship from reliance on out-of-the-box
                  tools and open up new possibilities for representation of material from minortized
                  communities in the digital cultural record. Further, as several of the essays and
                  case studies in this issue testify, a complete divorce from expensive or maximal
                  forms of computation prove impossible at present. The relationship with social
                  media, Google and Amazon infrastructure, large databases, and GitHub will continue
                  for the foreseeable future. Despite critiques, which can and should continue to be
                  addressed through our collective work, the two of us still see minimal computing
                  as a space wherein we can explore forms of computation that do not depend on
                  expensive infrastructures and the harmful practices of the centers of capital
                  accumulation in the 21st century. In the final tally, we hope this conversation
                  can serve as one of the loci of inspiration for original local and regional
                  practices that best meet the needs of the workers of the record and a critique of
                  current systems of knowledge distribution and (re-)production of the past — both
                  humanistic and technical.</p>
