      <dhq:abstract>
        <p>Over the past decade, podcasting has grown into one of the most important media forms in
          the world. This article argues that podcasting’s unique technical affordances —
          particularly RSS feeds and user-entered metadata — open up productive methods for
          exploring the cultural practices and meanings of the medium. We share three different
          methods for studying RSS feeds and podcast metadata: 1) visualizing how topics and
          keywords trend over time; 2) visualizing networks of common associated keywords entered by
          podcasters; and 3) analyzing norms and common practices for the duration of podcasts (as a
          time-based media format, podcasting is unusual in that it is not bound by the programming
          schedules and technical limitations that provide strict parameters for most audiovisual
          forms). The methods and preliminary results reveal how metadata can function as a
          surrogate for studying large collections of time-based media objects. Yet our study also
          shows that, when it comes to born digital media, the metadata are never fully separate
          from the objects they describe. We argue that future work in AV in DH needs to delineate
          between methods best suited for digitized media collections compared to those most
          appropriate for born digital media collections.</p>

    <body>
      <div>
        <head>Introduction</head>
        <p>As a cultural form, podcasting resists easy definition. It is a highly porous medium,
          traveling with us over earbuds, phone speakers, and car stereos, accompanying us on
          commutes, jogs, errands, and road trips. It’s a sound-based media that we also experience
          visually through live shows, thumbnail icons, and t-shirts that say <quote rend="inline"
            >Friend of the Pod</quote> or <quote rend="inline">Night Vale Community College.</quote>
          Despite these definitional challenges, the medium, by most measures, is booming — with the
          quantity of podcasts, listeners, advertising revenue, and non-profit funding increasing
          sharply year after year, including an <soCalled>explosive</soCalled> 2018, which saw the
          number of U.S. people over the age of twelve who have ever listened to a podcast climb
          above 50% for the first time <ptr target="#edison2019"/>
          <ptr target="#podnews2019"/>.</p>
        <p>If we consider podcasts from a purely technical standpoint, it is possible to narrow the
          definition slightly. As we have elaborated elsewhere, a podcast can be defined as a
          collection of downloadable files, of any format, served, with accompanying metadata, via
          an open updatable internet feed, primarily RSS <ptr target="#hansen2020"/>. An XML-based
          protocol, RSS allows for podcasters to easily publish their completed work and distribute
          it to audiences, who can opt to subscribe to particular feeds. In many ways, the metadata
          and the open feed are what separate a podcast from other media files on the internet,
          including other forms of on-demand audio (for example, music streaming platforms and audio
          book companies). Because RSS feeds are open, podcasting is platform-independent. Listeners
          can subscribe to feeds through a number of different podcatching apps and a variety of
          platforms. At least for now.</p>
        <p>Both the expansive cultural meanings of podcasting and the rigid technical definition
          have animated our work over the past three years on the PodcastRE database and our desire
          to study and preserve this emerging format. Based at the University of Wisconsin-Madison
          and supported by grants from the university and the NEH, PodcastRE (short for Podcast
          Research and accessible at <ref target="http://podcastre.org">http://podcastre.org</ref>)
          is a data preservation and research initiative. As we write in April 2020, the PodcastRE
          database has grown to over 2.5 million podcast episodes from over 16,000 unique RSS feeds
          which occupy 99 terabytes of space within our RAID storage array. The collection has
          expanded beyond what any individual could listen to within a lifetime, and it only keeps
          growing.</p>
        <p>What can researchers do with millions of podcast episodes and their associated metadata?
          This article seeks to contribute to the body of digital humanities scholarship invested in
          harnessing the affordances of digital technology to investigate cultural data at a large
          scale <ptr target="#jockers2013"/>
          <ptr target="#underwood2019"/>
          <ptr target="#clement2016a"/>
          <ptr target="#clement2016b"/>. We argue that podcasting’s unique technical affordances
          (e.g. RSS and metadata) open up productive methods for exploring the cultural practices
          and meanings of the medium. These methods, in turn, hold broader relevance for scholars
          seeking to integrate media studies with computational analysis (or, as the theme of this
          special issue nicely puts it, <title rend="quotes">AV in DH</title>). Our study of
          podcasting shows the ways that metadata can function as a surrogate for studying large
          collections of time-based media objects. To put it simply, it’s far easier to query 2
          million metadata records than it is to query 2 million media files of movies, TV episodes,
          or audio programs. Yet our study also shows that, when it comes to born digital media, the
          metadata are never fully separate from the objects they describe, nor can they fully
          describe, or replace the need for, returning to the media themselves during the final
          analysis. As a result, future work in AV in DH needs to thoughtfully delineate between
          methods best suited for <emph>digitized media collections</emph> compared to those most
          appropriate for <emph>born digital media collections</emph>.</p>
        <p>In this article, we share three different methods for analyzing the metadata of
          PodcastRE’s born digital corpus, assessing the strengths and weaknesses of each method and
          sharing preliminary results. First, as we will share, PodcastRE’s Term Frequency Line
          Graph (<ref target="http://podcastre.org/lineGraph">http://podcastre.org/lineGraph</ref>)
          allows researchers to create visualizations of trending topics and keywords. Interpreting
          the results of the line graphs can be challenging, however, due to the messiness of the
          underlying metadata and the problem of <soCalled>normalizing</soCalled> a rapidly growing
          corpus and medium. Second, PodcastRE’s Associated Keyword Cloud visualization tool
          (available at <ref target="http://podcastre.org/wordCloud"
            >http://podcastre.org/wordCloud</ref>) enables researchers to query a keyword and
          generate a word cloud that displays the other keywords that appear alongside that keyword
          in podcasts. We argue that this data visualization harnesses the potential of the medium’s
          inconsistent and messy metadata and allows for open-ended explorations, serendipitous
          discovery, and new questions about the agency of podcasters in self-defining their
          cultural output and connecting it with particular communities and conversations. Third and
          finally, we share approaches for studying the duration of podcasts. As a time-based media
          format, podcasting is unusual in that it is not bound by the programming schedules and
          technical limitations that provide strict parameters for most audiovisual forms, such as
          movies, television, and radio. If a podcast can run anywhere from a couple of seconds to
          several hours in length, how do norms and common practices develop that establish optimal
          models for a podcast’s duration? To investigate these questions, we exported CSVs from the
          database (using a <soCalled>mediaFileDuration</soCalled> field generated by the individual
          episode files), sorted them into meaningful sample groups, and investigated the data for
          patterns.</p>
        <p>Ultimately, our goal for this article is to share research and methods for studying the
          explosion of audio culture taking place in podcasting and through the sonic communities
          and conversations podcasting draws together. These methods are especially well suited for
          studying audio, but they would also be valuable for exploring online video collections and
          other digital media objects. As in any research study, though, it’s important to address
          the specific before offering broader generalizations. With that in mind, we would like to
          now turn to a consideration of the history and design of RSS feeds, how they inform the
          underlying dataset (the PodcastRE collection), and the affordances and challenges of these
          structures.</p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <head>RSS Feeds, the PodcastRE Collection, and Working with Messy Metadata</head>
        <p>As the protocol that has enabled inconsistent and idiosyncratic podcast metadata to
          proliferate across the internet, it is fitting that there is no singular consensus on what
          the initials <soCalled>RSS</soCalled> should stand for. <title>Real Simple
            Syndication</title> is the most commonly cited meaning. But <title rend="quotes">Rich
            Site Summary</title> and <title rend="quotes">Resource Description Framework (RDF) Site
            Summary</title> have also been cited as the basis of the name. There is no question,
          however, that the technology has played a pivotal role in the growth of podcasting and
          infrastructure of PodcastRE.</p>
        <p>On March 15, 1999, Netscape published the first specification for RSS <ptr
            target="#rss2019"/>. Based on XML and developed by Ramanathan Guha and Dan Libby, RSS
          was created so that the Netscape home page <title rend="quotes">My Netscape</title> could
          be refreshed with new content from webpages which used the specification <ptr
            target="#hines1999" loc="para. 9"/>. Over the next couple of years, RSS went through
          multiple iterations, and then on December 25, 2000, Dave Winer and UserLand software
          released RSS 0.92 <ptr target="#rss2019"/>. It was this version of RSS which is most
          important in the history of podcasting as it was the first version which included the
          &lt;enclosure&gt; tag, which allowed for the attachment of media files. Concocted by
          Winer, with strong prompting from Adam Curry, as a way to deliver high quality multimedia
          files over the internet without the quality and wait time issues which plagued early
          streaming, the first use of an &lt;enclosure&gt; was to distribute a set of Grateful Dead
          MP3 files <ptr target="#winer2001" loc="para. 44"/>, presaging its dominant use in the
          years to come.</p>
        <p>RSS continued to develop for the next decade and mostly stabilized as a specification
          with version 2.0.11 on March 30, 2009 <ptr target="#rss2019"/>. Since then the only
          updates to the format have come in the form of XML Namespaces, which are ways of adding
          outside-of-specification elements to XML documents that are commonly used by Apple, Google
          and other podcast distributors to expand metadata options for commercial purposes <ptr
            target="#bray2009" loc="para. 1"/>
          <ptr target="#bergen2015" loc="para. 2"/>. Even as podcasting apps, playback technologies,
          and the on-demand sound industry has changed throughout the 2010s, the basic structure and
          syntax of RSS has remained constant, keeping the circulation of most podcasts relatively
          open and freely downloadable.</p>
        <p>The open infrastructure of RSS also became foundational for our work on PodcastRE <ptr
            target="#morris2019"/>. Interested in studying podcasts, but worried about the
          vulnerability of digital audio files, we realized in early 2014 that there were few
          searchable databases of podcasts for studying and analyzing the booming audio culture
          taking place in podcasting. We began rather humbly by logging RSS feeds manually in iTunes
          and downloading audio files to a local hard drive, tracking as best we could podcasts that
          were being cited in the press as part of the renewed interest in podcasting, like
            <emph>Serial</emph> or <emph>Welcome to Nightvale</emph>
          <ptr target="#adams2015"/>. As the project grew, we implemented a more coherent collection
          process, and since 2018, we have been saving podcasts included in discussions of
          podcasting’s <soCalled>golden age</soCalled> as well as interrogating what podcasts are
          being left out of that discussion. We’ve navigated the need to preserve the
            <soCalled>popular</soCalled> by automating the collection of a particular index of
          what’s popular: the Apple Podcasts top 100 lists for the U.S., Great Britain, France, and
          Australia every 24 hours. This automated approach toward collecting embraces both the
          affordances of the digital media and the MPLP (More Product, Less Process) model proposed
          by Mark A. Greene and Dennis Meissner <ptr target="#green2005"/>. Our efforts to identify
          and collect significant podcasts beyond the Apple Podcasts top 100 have been driven by
          collaborations with scholars who are researching independent podcasts produced by women,
          indigenous peoples, and people of color <ptr target="#wang2020"/>
          <ptr target="#florini2017"/> and by following the work of other networks, directories and
          databases devoted to highlighting marginalized/less visible podcasts (Podcasts in Color,
          Women In Podcasting, PotLuck Podcast Network, etc).</p>
        <p>PodcastRE’s collection of 2 million podcast episodes has thus been built by a combination
          of algorithmic methods and informed hand-selections. There’s also a <quote rend="inline"
            >submit a podcast</quote> feature on the project’s website that allows individuals to
          add the RSS feeds for podcasts they’d like preserved. The 16,000 archived podcast feeds
          are a fraction of the over 1,000,000 podcast feeds that, according to estimates, are
          currently being distributed <ptr target="#podcast2020"/>. But the PodcastRE collection
          does offer a valuable and diverse cross-section of English-language podcasts from the past
          several years.</p>
        <p>The common thread through all of this work has been RSS. To put it simply, if a podcast
          doesn’t have an RSS feed, then we cannot yet preserve it within our system. This is one of
          the reasons why the technical definition of a podcast — an open feed of downloadable files
          and associated metadata — has been so important to our work on PodcastRE. To achieve our
          goals of scale, not only did we need to be able to download podcast episode files
          automatically, we also needed to gather the metadata we could store automatically. For
          PodcastRE, the elements available through the RSS specification, and its associated
          namespaces, are as important as the podcast episode files themselves. RSS, in other words,
          defines the possible universe of metadata for the podcasts archived in PodcastRE.</p>
        <p>What we did not immediately appreciate was how messy, idiosyncratic, and incomplete the
          world of podcasting metadata would prove to be. Podcast RSS metadata is a world away from
          the familiar and relatively consistent metadata fields of TEI and Dublin Core. One reason
          is the relatively sparse number of elements which are required for a feed to be valid. In
          fact, an RSS feed only needs four elements to be present in order to be valid: the
          &lt;channel&gt; parent element with associated &lt;title&gt;, &lt;link&gt;, and
          &lt;description&gt; elements. This would be a feed without content though as it would
          contain no &lt;item&gt;s <ptr target="#winer2003" loc="para. 13"/>. Because authors fully
          manage their own RSS feeds, and the entry of the metadata into them, they are directly
          responsible for the depth and quality of the metadata. This aspect of podcast metadata
          cannot be stressed too highly. With the exception of a few elements like
          &lt;googleplay:category&gt; and &lt;itunes:type&gt;, there are almost no constraints on
          what podcast authors put into the various elements. Even fixed format elements like
          &lt;pubDate&gt;, which seems rather self explanatorily to mean the date on which a podcast
          episode was published into a feed, can end up being used by authors to mean something very
          different. For example, there are many &lt;pubDate&gt;s before 1950 in the metadata for
            <emph>The Reith Lectures</emph> podcast from the BBC, long before the term podcast was
          ever coined. Instead, the series uses &lt;pubDate&gt; to mean the day the lecture was
          originally given. RSS authors continue to have the authority to change anything they
          wish—including something as fundamental as the title of an episode, or even their whole
          podcast, at any time. Looking in PodcastRE, we see examples related to branding, as when
            <emph>Bookworm</emph> added their network and became <emph>KCRW's Bookworm</emph>; or to
          SEO, as when <emph>Highest Self Podcast</emph> added some terms and turned into
            <emph>Highest Self Podcast: Modern Spirituality, Ayurveda, Conscious Entrepreneurship,
            Mind-Body Balance</emph>.</p>
        <p>The inconsistent and incomplete metadata records created major challenges for our efforts
          to systematically preserve podcasts and make them easily searchable. We found it
          especially unfortunate that metadata fields that could have been revelatory for search
          faceting and social network analysis (fields such as &lt;network&gt;, &lt;host&gt;, and
          &lt;contributor&gt;) are not a part of any current podcast RSS specifications. Yet it was
          equally clear that authoritative approaches to metadata had their own problems and major
          blind spots. The inadequacies and biases of Library of Congress subject headings have
          received considerable attention within the discipline of information studies. For example,
          Juliet L. Hardesty <ptr target="#hardesty2019"/> has argued that the subject headings
          generally take the primacy of white men as a default; <title rend="quotes">Robert
            Frost</title> is cataloged under <title rend="quotes">Poets, American</title> without
          reference to gender or race, whereas Maya Angelou is listed under subjects including
            <title rend="quotes">African American women authors</title> and <title rend="quotes"
            >African American authors.</title> The catalogers, in these cases, are applying a schema
          that upholds a white patriarchal worldview and minimizes both the needs of users and the
          ways in which creators and subjects would choose to define themselves.</p>
        <p>In contrast, podcast creators have a tremendous amount of agency in how they define
          themselves and attempt to connect with users (i.e. listeners and audiences). When the
          creators of the PHX podcast entered the keywords <soCalled>podsincolor</soCalled> and
            <soCalled>women of color</soCalled> within their RSS feed, they actively chose to
          present themselves this way and place their work within a larger network of podcasts
          produced by people of color. The flexibility that characterizes metadata practices prove
          to be critical for marginalized podcasters in forming community, as they seek to carve out
          space for themselves within media production practices and platforms that consistently
          privilege hegemonic whiteness, accepted paradigms of masculinity, and heteronormativity.
          While this does not necessarily mean that self-policing within metadata production does
          not happen as a result of the asymmetrical power dynamics between platform and creator, it
          does still provide yet another avenue in which marginalized communities can stand in
          opposition to the individualistic neoliberal ideologies that undergird contemporary
          user-driven media production <ptr target="#hogan2008"/>
          <ptr target="#florini2017"/>. It is critical to note, however, that the non-uniformity of
          metadata production yields ambivalent practices, both where innovative podcasters can
          resist the influence of various dominant ideologies, while others use this space to
          reinforce their centrality simultaneously.</p>
        <p>For example, there are also many instances of podcasters stuffing their RSS with keywords
          in order to make them prominent within content aggregators and
            <soCalled>podcatchers.</soCalled> The internet abounds with advice and speculations for
          search engine optimization and the strategies that can be utilized in order to gain
          attention to one’s content, such as the optimal number of keywords, the kinds of thumbnail
          images that should be connected to content, and more <ptr target="#crowe2019"/>
          <ptr target="#podcast2015"/>. The opaque nature of how Apple Podcasts organizes its search
          results impacts the manner in which metadata is written, and this becomes influential to
          the ways that podcast creators self-define their own content. The dominating influence of
          Apple Podcasts categories can be observed by the fact that within the entirety of the
          PodcastRE database, the most used keywords lists are dominated by terms that are outlined
          either fully or in part by Apple Podcasts genre specifications. For example, with the
          exception of the words, <soCalled>podcast</soCalled> and <soCalled>radio,</soCalled> the
          top fifteen keywords for the podcast classification (the entire podcast series) terms all
          cohere to various genre classifications within Apple Podcasts. Similar patterns can be
          seen for the episodic classification where, with the exception of <title rend="quotes"
            >Talk Radio,</title>
          <title rend="quotes">Podcast</title> and a blank space/uncategorized, the top ten keywords
          reflect Apple Podcasts categories. The large amount of uncategorized keyword terms may
          gesture towards the fact that after 2013, the keywords metadata field became deprecated,
          meaning that it no longer affected the output of Apple Podcasts’ search engine algorithms
            (<ref target="https://support.libsyn.com/kb/the-rss-feed/"
            >https://support.libsyn.com/kb/the-rss-feed/</ref>). After this discovery, many
          podcasters may have forgone the labor of putting in keywords, as the fields that influence
          search engine optimization are now the title, author, and description tags.</p>
        <p>Even though Apple Podcasts deprecated keywords within its search algorithm, we became
          excited about the role keywords could play for our work on PodcastRE. What sort of data
          visualizations and discoveries might be possible by harnessing RSS metadata at scale?
          Ultimately, we built two data visualizations for the site. Perhaps not surprisingly, the
          more successful of the two was the one that most embraced the idiosyncratic, messy, and
          user-created nature of RSS.</p>

        <head>Graphing Metadata Term Frequency Across Time</head>
        <p>How do keywords and other fields used to describe podcasts change over time? Could
          tracking these changes prove useful for spotting trending topics within the podcasting
          ecosystem? To explore these questions, we created PodcastRE’s Term Frequency Line Graph
          (publicly available at <ref target="https://podcastre.org/lineGraph"
            >https://podcastre.org/lineGraph</ref>), which tracks the frequency across time that any
          word or phrase within the metadata appears. The fields searched include the title,
          creator, synopses, and keywords. A visualization graphing the term
            <soCalled>money</soCalled> within PodcastRE is displayed below. If a user clicks on any
          point within the graph, their browser opens up a new tab displaying all of the matching
          podcast episodes from that month or year that contain a matching search term.</p>
        <p>The Term Frequency Line Graph searches metadata included within individual podcast
          episodes and across the entire feeds (for example, while <soCalled>NBA</soCalled> may be a
          keyword that describes a podcast feed as a whole, <soCalled>China</soCalled> may be a
          keyword that describes a topic discussed within one episode of the podcast). By default,
          the X-axis of the graph is divided by years; however, users can toggle to a monthly scale.
          This allows for researchers to see when certain topics or keyword phrases spike on a
          seasonal cycle (for example, <soCalled>baseball</soCalled> consistently has an uptick
          during the playoffs every October) versus more macro-scale trends that rise and fall over
          a period of years.</p>
        <figure xml:id="figure01">
          <head>Term Frequency Line graph of <soCalled>money</soCalled>, tracked over time, within
            PodcastRE's corpus. Tool is available at <ref target="http://podcastre.org/lineGraph"

          <graphic url="resources/images/figure01.png"/>
        </figure>
        <p>When researchers use the Term Frequency Line Graph to look for trends across a span of
          years, however, they quickly encounter an interpretive challenge: almost any term they
          search will appear to dramatically increase in 2017 and 2018. This is because the
          PodcastRE collection grew exponentially over those two years, a result of the growth in
          the podcasting ecosystem as a whole and our own curatorial decision to automatically
          preserve any feed that appears on the Apple Podcasts Top 100 chart in the U.S., U.K.,
          Australia, or France. While we give users the ability to <soCalled>normalize</soCalled>
          the graph results (which employs an equation to account for the larger number of podcasts
          from some years compared than others), we know this feature has its limits. What does it
          mean to <soCalled>normalize</soCalled> the number of podcasts during a period in which the
          medium is rapidly evolving?</p>
        <p>We have tried to address this interpretive challenge through a <title rend="quotes">Rate
            of Episodes Added</title> button, which provides contextualization in regard to the
          database itself. By showing how many episodes are added per year, users can see how the
          rate of growth in the database can affect the numbers that are being shown for any query’s
          term frequency. Additionally, the <title rend="quotes">Area Graph</title> button
          transforms the data into a stacked graph, which allows for comparisons across multiple
          queries at particular moments in time and reminds users that the graphs are malleable and
          dynamic. Finally, the user can move to a more granular level at any point by clicking on a
          point in the graph, allowing them to investigate the actual podcast feeds and episodes
          that appear as abstractions within the graph. Users can save the data to a CSV file, a
          JPG, PNG or SVG vector image, so that this data can be applied to a variety of
          presentational contexts.</p>
        <p>In many ways, PodcastRE’s Term Frequency Line Graph exemplifies the limitations digital
          humanists are likely to encounter when applying data visualizations built for
            <emph>digitized text collections</emph> to <emph>born-digital media collections</emph>.
          We modeled the user-experience and technological framework of PodcastRE’s Term Frequency
          Line Graph on that of the Arclight app (<ref target="http://projectarclight.org"
            >http://projectarclight.org</ref>), which searches the 2.5 million page corpus of the
          Media History Digital Library (MHDL) <ptr target="#hoyt2016"/>. The MHDL is composed of
          books and magazines pertaining to the histories of film, broadcasting, and recorded sound
          from 1915 to 1960, which is an especially robust period for the searching of named
          entities (such as people, film titles, or radio station call letters). Additionally, the
          normalization function for Arclight graphs works quite well (the most represented year of
          1915-1960 is only double in size of the least represented year, avoiding PodcastRE’s
          challenge of grappling with exponential growth). Normalized searches for the names of
          movie stars, for example, generally map onto the arcs of their popularity and/or
          notoriety, sometimes, though not always, with surprising results. Data visualizations
          built for searching entities within large corpora of digitized texts are less adept at
          producing immediately legible results for searching the metadata keywords of a rapidly
          growing born-digital medium. What would it mean to design a data visualization tool that
          embraced the messiness of born-digital objects and their metadata, rather than trying to
          smooth them out?</p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <head>Associated Keyword Word Cloud</head>
        <p>In developing PodcastRE’s Associated Keyword Word Cloud, we sought to harness and
          foreground the specificities and idiosyncrasies of born digital media collections. This
          data visualization takes the keywords that podcasters entered to describe their work and
          puts them into conversation with other podcasters’ keywords. A specific example is helpful
          for understanding how it works.</p>
        <p>Using the keyword <soCalled>money</soCalled>, in a search conducted in the fall of 2019,
          we found the term appeared in the metadata of 68,619 podcast episodes saved within
          PodcastRE, collected from 587 discrete RSS feeds. The other keywords that appear most
          frequently along with <soCalled>money</soCalled> in podcast metadata are visualized below
          (see <ref target="#figure02">Figure 2</ref>). This visualization includes predictable
          matches within the popular financial self-help genre (e.g. <soCalled>wealth,</soCalled>
          <soCalled>business,</soCalled>
          <soCalled>entrepreneur</soCalled>), as well as meaningful intersections that lay outside
          financially-oriented podcasts (e.g. <soCalled>spirituality,</soCalled>
          <soCalled>Relationships &amp; Sex,</soCalled>
          <soCalled>Fear</soCalled>). When a user clicks on the keyword value in the cloud, the user
          is immediately transferred to the PodcastRE database interface, where it shows all of the
          podcasts that used these paired keyword values. <ref target="#figure03">Figure 3</ref>
          reveals the results of the podcasts that contain both the keywords
            <soCalled>money</soCalled> and <soCalled>spirituality.</soCalled> The process promotes
          serendipitous discovery and may lead the researcher toward encounters they hadn’t
          anticipated. For example, modern witchcraft is better represented in the podcasts with
            <soCalled>money</soCalled> and <soCalled>spirituality</soCalled> as keywords than most
          traditional forms of organized religion.</p>
        <figure xml:id="figure02">
          <head>Word cloud for the query, <soCalled>money,</soCalled> on the <soCalled>All
              Keywords</soCalled> category. Taken using the Associated Keyword Cloud visualization
            tool at <ref target="http://podcastre.org/wordCloud"

        </figure>
        <p>The Associated Keyword Cloud visualization was built through connecting together multiple
          open source technologies. Like the Term Frequency Line Graph, the Associated Keyword Word
          Cloud uses the Highcharts Javascript library to animate the visualization. To retrieve the
          information it needs, we query the keyword metadata facet within PodcastRE’s Solr search
          index, and we return and store them as key value pairs, with the number of podcasts that
          maintain both the queried keyword and the additional keyword (the hit count) next to the
          particular word. For example, if a user queries the word <soCalled>love</soCalled> within
          the database, a potential key value pair that would appear would be <quote rend="inline"
              >[<q>relationships</q>, 163],</quote> where <soCalled>relationships</soCalled> would
          be the associated keyword for <soCalled>love,</soCalled> and the <soCalled>163</soCalled>
          stands for how many times this keyword was added alongside the word
            <soCalled>love.</soCalled> The results are sorted through keywords that have the most
          hits down to the associated keywords that have the least hits. By targeting this metadata
          keyword field and assigning the <soCalled>weight</soCalled> of a word to be the number
          that is assigned to the hit count of the key value pair, we were able to visually
          represent which keywords were paired most often with the queried word, by making the word
          with the heaviest <soCalled>weight,</soCalled> the largest in the word cloud. Because
          certain topics have a range of associated keywords that spanned hundreds of words, we
          limited the number of keywords that can be shown on the word cloud to a maximum of 200
          words. While this decision may hinder researchers from getting the full range of
          associated keywords, this limitation was imposed to ensure readability on the
          visualization. Two hundred words seemed like a reasonable count in order for researchers
          to gain a sense of the wide range of relational topics that podcasters were dealing with,
          and simultaneously allow the visualizations to be effective in showing which keywords were
          the most actively engaged with.</p>
        <p>There are two options on the Associated Keyword Word Cloud interface that aid in
          isolating whether the keywords shown are related to podcasts in their entirety or
          exclusive to certain episodes. Additionally, if users want a merging of these two levels
          of metadata, they can search across both podcast and episode keywords by using the
            <soCalled>All Keywords</soCalled> option. In this manner, for podcasts that may deal
          with a wide range of topics, such as news or current events podcasts, there can be a
          closer examination on a micro episodic level of what kinds of keywords are used to define
          certain topical content. Often, the keywords that are used to describe podcasts are not
          uniformly applied to define episodes, so providing these two levels of analytical range
          gives researchers more flexibility in the kinds of questions they can ask using
          PodcastRE.</p>
        <p>All attempts to interpret the Associated Keyword Word Clouds ultimately lead back to
          reflecting on the practices, norms, aspirations, and communities of the podcasters
          themselves.</p>
        <p>As discussed earlier, keywords allow content creators to define their work to listeners
          and podcatcher applications. They are a space of creator agency, where podcast producers
          deploy keywords to create networks of ambient affiliation with other podcasts and subject
          matter. By making one of PodcastRE’s database visualization tools intimately connected to
          these creator-defined keywords and their relationships to other keywords, we provide an
          alternative mode of discoverability apart from the algorithms that govern commercial
          aggregators such as Apple Podcasts. In this manner, PodcastRE hopes to provide a different
          approach that foregrounds creator agency and their interactions with their own metadata
          through the digital archive’s organization, particularly with these metadata
          visualizations.</p>

        <head>Studying the Durations of Podcasts</head>
        <p>The Term Frequency Line Graph and Associated Keyword Word Cloud can both be effectively
          applied toward exploratory research and achieving serendipitous discoveries. But we also
          wanted to use PodcastRE and the <soCalled>mediaDuration</soCalled> field to examine a more
          focused question. What patterns can we notice about the duration of podcasts, and what can
          they tell us about practitioner norms and assumptions of what makes for a good length of a
          podcast? Unlike most other AV forms — movies, television, and radio — podcasts are a
          time-based medium that are not constrained by programming schedules (broadcast schedules,
          movie theater showtimes) and technical limitations (reels of film and tape). If a podcast
          could run anywhere from a couple of seconds to several hours in length, how do norms and
          common practices develop around perceived ideas of a podcast’s optimal duration? We
          realized that metadata could help us answer this question.</p>
        <p>In this section, then, we propose and share two approaches to studying podcast duration.
          First, we consider how duration analysis might clarify the differences between two
          programs of the same specification classification, in this case two popular daily programs
          from <emph>The New York Times</emph> and <emph>NPR</emph>, using data gathered from
          episodes ranging from the former’s launch in early 2017 to an end point of April 2018.
          Second, we conduct an investigation of a much larger scale, analyzing large rosters of
          programs to juxtapose duration across networks and genres. Our case studies here are the
          comedic programs of Earwolf and the comparably more serious fare of Gimlet Media, using
          data gathered from episodes ranging from 2009 until early 2018. In both of these cases,
          the statistics were gathered by first running an SQL query on the PodcastRE database, then
          exporting metadata for all of the episodes into a .csv file, and finally finding averages,
          medians, and other numbers using Microsoft Excel. All of these approaches required us to
          assemble subsets of data from within the PodcastRE collection (and the .csv files), rather
          than treating the entire collection as a dataset.<note>It should be noted that the ability
            to obtain duration data is not currently available to front-end users of the PodcastRE
            site.</note> The genre and network categories that we ourselves added to the
          spreadsheets opened the data up for more meaningful analysis, especially when paired with
          the duration metadata provided by the RSS feeds.</p>
        <p>Our first approach to studying duration explored what has become one of the most popular
          contemporary podcast formats: the daily news program. How long should a daily news podcast
          take to consume? When <emph>The New York Times</emph> launched <emph>The Daily</emph> in
          February of 2017, host Michael Barbaro described the fledgling program thusly: <quote
            rend="inline">This is how the news should sound. Fifteen minutes a day, five days a
            week. It isn’t quite a podcast — although you can listen wherever you listen to
            podcasts. It isn’t quite the radio — although the mechanics are largely the same. It
            isn’t quite the newspaper — although we’ll be drawing heavily on the journalism that

          <ptr target="#barbaro2017"/>. Though Barbaro pegged the program as difficult to explain,
          it was a nearly immediate hit, gaining over five million monthly listeners by July of 2018
            <ptr target="#jerde2018"/>. As Barbaro told <emph>Vanity Fair</emph> that same month,
            <quote rend="inline">When we started the show, we had many goals… We didn’t realize we

            company</quote>
          <ptr target="#pompeo2018"/>. Yet as is often the case, success breeds imitators and
          competitors, and <emph>The Daily</emph> witnessed the rise of its biggest challenger in
          June of 2017 when NPR launched <emph>Up First</emph>, a daily <quote rend="inline"
            >10-minute morning news podcast</quote> that is <quote rend="inline">designed with
            digital listeners in mind but will also serve as a preview of the news stories that will
            be treated in depth on public radio stations across the country throughout the
            day</quote>
          <ptr target="#up2017"/>. That program was also a swift triumph, and as of October 2018,
          both <emph>The Daily</emph> and <emph>Up First</emph> sat comfortably in the top five most
          popular podcasts according to Podtrac’s rankings: the former tailed behind only
            <emph>Serial</emph>, while the latter occupies the fifth spot <ptr target="#podtrac2018"
          />.</p>
        <p>Episode duration has been a central selling point for each of the two podcasts. As seen
          above, episode length was mentioned in both of the series’ launch press releases. Duration
          is also discussed in descriptions of the programs on their official websites. <emph>Up
            First</emph> has remained consistent in its advertised average runtime: <quote
            rend="inline">NPR’s <emph>Up First</emph> is the news you need to start your day. The
            biggest stories and ideas — from politics to pop culture — in 10 minutes</quote>
          <ptr target="#up2018"/>. <emph>The Daily</emph>, meanwhile, has added five minutes to its
          initial announcement: <quote rend="inline">This is how the news should sound. Twenty
            minutes a day, five days a week, hosted by Michael Barbaro and powered by New York Times
            journalism</quote>
          <ptr target="#nyt2018"/>. The programs are, essentially, two different approaches to the
          morning commute: <emph>Up First</emph>’s proposed shorter length seems guaranteed to slot
          into almost any daily trip to work, while <emph>The Daily</emph>’s longer runtime requires
          either a lengthy commute, multiple listening sessions, or even perhaps the utilization of
          1.5x or 2x speed playback options. Such duration decisions are complimented by
          storytelling approaches: <emph>Up First</emph>’s short length is matched with a
            <soCalled>greatest hits</soCalled> style compilation of short stories, while <emph>The
            Daily</emph>’s relatively lengthier duration is primarily spent on the discussion of a
          single story. In theory, then, the former aims to quickly provide its listeners with
          headline-style blurbs about the day’s biggest stories, while the latter seeks to
          exhaustively cover a single topic.</p>
        <p>Such temporal differences are roughly borne out by the metadata found in PodcastRE’s
          database, although the story is more complicated than the descriptions of the series
          imply. <emph>The Daily</emph> (mean duration of 22:51, median duration of 22:12) runs
          nearly ten minutes longer than <emph>Up First</emph> (mean duration of 13:33, median
          duration of 13:17), with both programs on average running a few minutes longer than their
          advertised lengths. The differences between the two series is much starker when
          considering the range in podcast durations, as <emph>Up First</emph> is relatively
          consistent in episode duration (shortest episode of 11:01 and longest episode of 17:46 for
          a range of 6:45) while <emph>The Daily</emph> varies widely between episodes (shortest
          episode of 13:00 and longest episode of 41:23 for a range of 28:23). These durational
          differences align neatly with the programs’ content choices (i.e. multiple headlines vs.
          single story focus), though they provide critical additional clarifications. While both
            <emph>Up First</emph> and <emph>The Daily</emph> release episodes each weekday morning,
          the former’s tight range and shorter length ties it more closely to its proposed function
          as morning commute listening, while the latter’s wider range and extended runtime
          emphasizes delivering a full story adequately. Since podcasts do not have the same
          durational constraints of broadcast media, these choices in runtime are clear aesthetic
          and storytelling decisions – yet given the evolutionary radio approach of NPR’s daily
          podcast and <emph>The New York Times</emph>’s commitment to the news story, these
          decisions are not completely detached from their companies’ original mediums.</p>
        <p>On a larger scale, podcast duration analysis can point towards divergent approaches by
          podcast networks and in certain genres. As an example, we conducted an analysis of thirty

            and <emph>Undone</emph>.</note> The former describes itself as <quote rend="inline">the
            leading comedy podcast network devoted to creating the best, funniest, and most
            entertaining podcast shows in existence</quote>
          <ptr target="#earwolf2018"/>. Gimlet Media specializes in more
            <soCalled>serious</soCalled> fare, characterizing itself as <quote rend="inline">the
            award-winning narrative podcasting company that aims to help listeners better understand
            the world and each other</quote>
          <ptr target="#gimlet2018"/>. Though both companies employ personnel who have worked or
          continue to work in other mediums, Earwolf and Gimlet are distinguished from other major
          podcast networks such as <emph>NPR</emph>, <emph>iHeartRadio</emph>, and <emph>WNYC
            Studios</emph> by their podcast nativism: both companies began as strictly
          podcast-focused networks rather than emerging within older media companies.</p>
        <p>Perhaps as a result, the two networks have markedly different approaches towards podcast
          episode length. Of the 30 surveyed Earwolf programs, 3 have average runtimes between 0-20
          minutes, 4 have average runtimes between 20-40 minutes, 6 have average runtimes between
          40-60 minutes, 10 have average runtimes between 60-80 minutes, 3 have average runtimes
          between 80-100 minutes, 3 have average runtimes between 100-120 minutes, and 1 has an
          average runtime between 120-140 minutes (See <ref target="#figure04">Figure 4</ref>). This
          means that over half of the surveyed programs have average episode durations over an hour,
          with programs ranging from <emph>Eardrop</emph>’s average runtime of 3:17 and <emph>Never
            Not Funny</emph>’s average runtime of 2:05:33. The shortest single episode was a
          38-second <emph>Eardrop</emph> episode, while the longest individual episode was a
            <emph>Comedy Bang! Bang!</emph> that lasted 3:19:02. Earwolf’s individual shows also
          frequently feature drastic ranges in shortest and longest duration: <emph>Hollywood
            Handbook</emph>, for instance, has a range of 1:53:27 between its shortest and longest
          episodes, while <emph>Comedy Bang! Bang!</emph>’s range is 2:39:06.</p>

          <head>Average durations of 30 surveyed Earwolf programs.</head>
          <graphic url="resources/images/figure04.png"/>
        </figure>
        <p>Gimlet, on the other hand, is much more consistent in its runtimes across series, though
          there is still variation between individual episodes. Of the 19 surveyed programs, only 1
          had an average runtime between 0-20 minutes, and that program (<emph>Chompers</emph>)
          serves a specific and brief function: children are meant to listen to the series as they
          brush their teeth. 2 of the series had an average runtime between 40-60 minutes, though
          both of those shows (<emph>Twice Removed</emph> and <emph>Mystery Show</emph>) are no
          longer producing episodes. The other 17 series, then, had average run times between 20-40
          minutes, aligning Gimlet’s roster with conventional advice on podcast episode
            length.<note>Though most blogs on the subject recommend tying duration to whatever
            length your content demands, they also routinely recommend shorter average durations,
            with <emph>We Edit Podcasts</emph>, for instance, writing, <quote rend="inline">it is
              possible to become successful with a longer show, but in general, the 22 minute rule
              trumps all</quote>
            <ptr target="#we2016"/>.</note> While individual episodes still varied quite a bit
            (<emph>Reply All</emph>, for instance, had a range of 1:35:29 between its shortest and
          longest episodes, while <emph>Mogul</emph> had a range of 1:16:17), these ranges were
          still much smaller than the largest Earwolf ranges.</p>
        <figure xml:id="figure05">
          <head>Average durations of 19 surveyed Gimlet programs.</head>
          <graphic url="resources/images/figure05.png"/>
        </figure>
        <p>The relative homogenization of Gimlet Media podcast duration, then, stands in stark
          contrast to the diverse podcast lengths of Earwolf. Every Gimlet Media podcast had an
          average run time under an hour, and 84.2% of the shows surveyed had average runtimes
          between 20-40 minutes. 56.7% of the Earwolf podcasts analyzed, meanwhile, had average
          runtimes over an hour long, and 76.7% of Earwolf’s podcasts had average runtimes over 40
          minutes long — in other words, over three-quarters of Earwolf’s shows ran longer on
          average than Gimlet’s <soCalled>sweet spot.</soCalled> Individual episode lengths varied
          in each of the networks’ programs, but Gimlet’s programs featured smaller ranges than the
          large variation found in many of Earwolf’s programs. Such differences may be the result of
          institutional decisions, generic divergences, or series lengths. Whatever the cause,
          however, Earwolf and Gimlet serve as evidence that podcast networks can have wildly
          divergent approaches towards episode duration, and that studying duration can lead us to
          insights about genre conventions, production values and more.</p>
        <p>On a recent episode of the <emph>Start Up</emph> podcast, the host and Gimlet CEO Alex
          Blumberg was reflecting on his decision to sell Gimlet media to Spotify. He noted that
          Gimlet’s gambit to standardize the production of highly edited and tightly produced
          'quality’ podcasts (that often followed very specific duration and other editorial
          decisions) had turned out to be a financially unfeasible strategy that was losing ground
          to cheaper and more popular chat cast style podcasts (where duration and other attributes
          are more flexible given the lower costs involved for editing and polishing the finished
          piece). His comments are a reminder that, despite the format’s substantial growth in the
          last two decades, there are still many lingering questions about the forms, conventions
          and economics of podcasting. We believe it is especially crucial during this time of flux,
          before podcasting stabilizes like so many other media have, to study the different
          approaches podcasters of all types are taking as they experiment with this emerging sonic
          format. Although duration numbers seem like relatively innocuous or descriptive metadata,
          the research from PodcastRE suggests they reveal historical relationships between new and
          old media formats, industrial and economic assumptions about <soCalled>ideal</soCalled>
          formats, and generic conventions that shape both amateur and professional podcasts.</p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <head>Conclusion</head>
        <p>Our work on PodcastRE has aimed to provide tools and data that account for podcasting’s
          complexity as a cultural form while simultaneously taking advantage of its unique
          technical affordances. The centering of RSS metadata and what can be mined from it through
          advanced search, graphing keywords over time, or visualizing word clouds of associated
          keywords has helped us facilitate the automated collection of a significant corpus of
          podcasts from a crucial period in the format’s emergence. It has also facilitated novel,
          fine-grained exploration of specific file characteristics as well, like duration metrics,
          across a variety of genres and shows.</p>
        <p>The reliance on RSS, however, has also forced us to confront the messiness and
          intricacies of a born digital object whose metadata and descriptive features are dynamic
          and podcaster generated. Podcasting’s relatively open and accessible origins have helped
          create a vibrant environment for web-based audio – one that includes the scores of
          podcasts available and the multiplicity of voices behind them, but also the numerous apps,
          aggregator sites and distribution technologies that have emerged to support podcasting’s
          rise. RSS and XML have not only been important to our work on PodcastRE, but to podcasting
          more broadly, and to the agency and control it has provided podcasters for defining their
          work on their own terms as well as for listeners in terms of defining their listening
          practices. Recently, there have been a number of attempts to move away from the more open
          and accessible versions of podcasting, to more closed and profitable models (e.g.
          exclusive shows tied to one platform, like Spotify, or subscription-based services like
          Luminary). While these options may make podcasting more user-friendly and convenient, or
          may offer podcasters more options for monetizing their work, they also make them more
          platform-dependent, less analyzable, and less open to research. </p>
        <p>The centrality of RSS to both podcasting and PodcastRE has been a theme throughout this
          article. We believe our methods and findings, however, hold relevance for beyond scholars
          researching other topics at the intersection of media studies and DH. As this study has
          shown, metadata records can serve as surrogates for studying large collections of
          time-based media objects, allowing researchers to query the durations of millions of media
          objects in a fraction of the time it would take to ingest and analyze transcoded media
          files. Yet our work has also shown that, when it comes to born digital media, the metadata
          are never fully separate from the objects they describe, nor are they fully capable of
          replacing close listening and other media studies methods. There is a need to delineate
          between methods best suited for <emph>digitized media collections</emph> compared to those
          most appropriate for <emph>born digital media collections</emph> and for devising
          strategies to blend AV and DH methods. By making these distinctions, we can better apply
          DH to AV and identify change and continuity, at a large scale, across media history.</p>
