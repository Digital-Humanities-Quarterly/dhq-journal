                  <p>Over the past decade, podcasting has grown into one of the most important media forms
                     in
                     the world. This article argues that podcasting’s unique technical affordances —
                     particularly RSS feeds and user-entered metadata — open up productive methods for
                     exploring the cultural practices and meanings of the medium. We share three different
                     methods for studying RSS feeds and podcast metadata: 1) visualizing how topics and
                     keywords trend over time; 2) visualizing networks of commonly associated keywords
                     entered
                     by podcasters; and 3) analyzing norms and common practices for the duration of podcasts
                     (as a time-based media format, podcasting is unusual in that it is not bound by the
                     programming schedules and technical limitations that provide strict parameters for
                     most
                     audiovisual forms). The methods and preliminary results reveal how metadata can function
                     as a surrogate for studying large collections of time-based media objects. Yet our
                     study
                     also shows that, when it comes to born digital media, the metadata are never fully
                     separate from the objects they describe. We argue that future work in AV in DH needs
                     to
                     delineate between methods best suited for digitized media collections compared to
                     those
                     most appropriate for born digital media collections.

                  <div class="ptext" id="p1">As a cultural form, podcasting resists easy definition. It is a highly porous medium,
                     traveling with us over earbuds, phone speakers, and car stereos, accompanying us on
                     commutes, jogs, errands, and road trips. It’s a sound-based media that we also experience
                     visually through live shows, thumbnail icons, and t-shirts that say “Friend of the Pod” or “Night Vale Community College.”
                     Despite these definitional challenges, the medium, by most measures, is booming —
                     with the
                     quantity of podcasts, listeners, advertising revenue, and non-profit funding increasing
                     sharply year after year, including an “explosive” 2018, which saw the
                     number of U.S. people over the age of twelve who have ever listened to a podcast climb
                     above 50% for the first time [<a class="ref" href="#edison2019">Edison 2019</a>]

                  <div class="ptext" id="p2">If we consider podcasts from a purely technical standpoint, it is possible to narrow
                     the
                     definition slightly. As we have elaborated elsewhere, a podcast can be defined as
                     a
                     collection of downloadable files, of any format, served, with accompanying metadata,
                     via
                     an open updatable internet feed, primarily RSS [<a class="ref" href="#hansen2020">Hansen 2020</a>]. An XML-based
                     protocol, RSS allows for podcasters to easily publish their completed work and distribute
                     it to audiences, who can opt to subscribe to particular feeds. In many ways, the metadata
                     and the open feed are what separate a podcast from other media files on the internet,
                     including other forms of on-demand audio (for example, music streaming platforms and
                     audio
                     book companies). Because RSS feeds are open, podcasting is platform-independent. Listeners
                     can subscribe to feeds through a number of different podcatching apps and a variety
                     of
                     platforms. At least for now.

                  <div class="ptext" id="p3">Both the expansive cultural meanings of podcasting and the rigid technical definition
                     have animated our work over the past three years on the PodcastRE database and our
                     desire
                     to study and preserve this emerging format. Based at the University of Wisconsin-Madison
                     and supported by grants from the university and the NEH, PodcastRE (short for Podcast
                     Research and accessible at <a href="http://podcastre.org" onclick="window.open('http://podcastre.org'); return false" class="ref">http://podcastre.org</a>)
                     is a data preservation and research initiative. As we write in April 2020, the PodcastRE
                     database has grown to over 2.5 million podcast episodes from over 16,000 unique RSS
                     feeds
                     which occupy 99 terabytes of space within our RAID storage array. The collection has
                     expanded beyond what any individual could listen to within a lifetime, and it only
                     keeps
                     growing.

                     This article seeks to contribute to the body of digital humanities scholarship invested
                     in
                     harnessing the affordances of digital technology to investigate cultural data at a
                     large
                     scale [<a class="ref" href="#jockers2013">Jockers 2013</a>]

                     [<a class="ref" href="#clement2016b">Clement 2016b</a>]. We argue that podcasting’s unique technical affordances
                     (e.g. RSS and metadata) open up productive methods for exploring the cultural practices
                     and meanings of the medium. These methods, in turn, hold broader relevance for scholars
                     seeking to integrate media studies with computational analysis (or, as the theme of
                     this
                     special issue nicely puts it, “AV in DH”). Our study of
                     podcasting shows the ways that metadata can function as a surrogate for studying large
                     collections of time-based media objects. To put it simply, it’s far easier to query
                     2
                     million metadata records than it is to query 2 million media files of movies, TV episodes,
                     or audio programs. Yet our study also shows that, when it comes to born digital media,
                     the
                     metadata are never fully separate from the objects they describe, nor can they fully
                     describe, or replace the need for, returning to the media themselves during the final
                     analysis. As a result, future work in AV in DH needs to thoughtfully delineate between
                     methods best suited for <em class="emph">digitized media collections</em> compared to those most
                     appropriate for <em class="emph">born digital media collections</em>.

                  <div class="ptext" id="p5">In this article, we share three different methods for analyzing the metadata of
                     PodcastRE’s born digital corpus, assessing the strengths and weaknesses of each method
                     and
                     sharing preliminary results. First, as we will share, PodcastRE’s Term Frequency Line
                     Graph (<a href="http://podcastre.org/lineGraph" onclick="window.open('http://podcastre.org/lineGraph'); return false" class="ref">http://podcastre.org/lineGraph</a>)
                     allows researchers to create visualizations of trending topics and keywords. Interpreting
                     the results of the line graphs can be challenging, however, due to the messiness of
                     the
                     underlying metadata and the problem of “normalizing” a rapidly growing
                     corpus and medium. Second, PodcastRE’s Associated Keyword Cloud visualization tool
                     (available at <a href="http://podcastre.org/wordCloud" onclick="window.open('http://podcastre.org/wordCloud'); return false" class="ref">http://podcastre.org/wordCloud</a>) enables researchers to query a keyword and
                     generate a word cloud that displays the other keywords that appear alongside that
                     keyword
                     in podcasts. We argue that this data visualization harnesses the potential of the
                     medium’s
                     inconsistent and messy metadata and allows for open-ended explorations, serendipitous
                     discovery, and new questions about the agency of podcasters in self-defining their
                     cultural output and connecting it with particular communities and conversations. Third
                     and
                     finally, we share approaches for studying the duration of podcasts. As a time-based
                     media
                     format, podcasting is unusual in that it is not bound by the programming schedules
                     and
                     technical limitations that provide strict parameters for most audiovisual forms, such
                     as
                     movies, television, and radio. If a podcast can run anywhere from a couple of seconds
                     to
                     several hours in length, how do norms and common practices develop that establish
                     optimal
                     models for a podcast’s duration? To investigate these questions, we exported CSVs
                     from the
                     database (using a “mediaFileDuration” field generated by the individual
                     episode files), sorted them into meaningful sample groups, and investigated the data
                     for
                     patterns.

                  <div class="ptext" id="p6">Ultimately, our goal for this article is to share research and methods for studying
                     the
                     explosion of audio culture taking place in podcasting and through the sonic communities
                     and conversations podcasting draws together. These methods are especially well suited
                     for
                     studying audio, but they would also be valuable for exploring online video collections
                     and
                     other digital media objects. As in any research study, though, it’s important to address
                     the specific before offering broader generalizations. With that in mind, we would
                     like to
                     now turn to a consideration of the history and design of RSS feeds, how they inform
                     the
                     underlying dataset (the PodcastRE collection), and the affordances and challenges
                     of these
                     structures.

                     the initials “RSS” should stand for. <cite class="title">Real Simple

                  <div class="ptext" id="p12">The common thread through all of this work has been RSS. To put it simply, if a podcast
                     doesn’t have an RSS feed, then we cannot yet preserve it within our system. This is
                     one of
                     the reasons why the technical definition of a podcast — an open feed of downloadable
                     files
                     and associated metadata — has been so important to our work on PodcastRE. To achieve
                     our
                     goals of scale, not only did we need to be able to download podcast episode files
                     automatically, we also needed to gather the metadata we could store automatically.
                     For
                     PodcastRE, the elements available through the RSS specification, and its associated
                     namespaces, are as important as the podcast episode files themselves. RSS, in other
                     words,
                     defines the possible universe of metadata for the podcasts archived in PodcastRE.

                  <div class="ptext" id="p13">What we did not immediately appreciate was how messy, idiosyncratic, and incomplete
                     the
                     world of podcasting metadata would prove to be. Podcast RSS metadata is a world away
                     from
                     the familiar and relatively consistent metadata fields of TEI and Dublin Core. One
                     reason
                     is the relatively sparse number of elements which are required for a feed to be valid.
                     In
                     fact, an RSS feed only needs four elements to be present in order to be valid: the
                     &lt;channel&gt; parent element with associated &lt;title&gt;, &lt;link&gt;, and
                     &lt;description&gt; elements. This would be a feed without content though as it would
                     contain no &lt;item&gt;s [<a class="ref" href="#winer2003">Winer 2003</a>, para. 13]. Because authors fully
                     manage their own RSS feeds, and the entry of the metadata into them, they are directly
                     responsible for the depth and quality of the metadata. This aspect of podcast metadata
                     cannot be stressed too highly. With the exception of a few elements like
                     &lt;googleplay:category&gt; and &lt;itunes:type&gt;, there are almost no constraints on
                     what podcast authors put into the various elements. Even fixed format elements like
                     &lt;pubDate&gt;, which seems rather self explanatorily to mean the date on which a podcast
                     episode was published into a feed, can end up being used by authors to mean something
                     very
                     different. For example, there are many &lt;pubDate&gt;s before 1950 in the metadata for
                     <em class="emph">The Reith Lectures</em> podcast from the BBC, long before the term podcast was
                     ever coined. Instead, the series uses &lt;pubDate&gt; to mean the day the lecture was
                     originally given. RSS authors continue to have the authority to change anything they
                     wish—including something as fundamental as the title of an episode, or even their
                     whole
                     podcast, at any time. Looking in PodcastRE, we see examples related to branding, as
                     when
                     <em class="emph">Bookworm</em> added their network and became <em class="emph">KCRW's Bookworm</em>; or to
                     SEO, as when <em class="emph">Highest Self Podcast</em> added some terms and turned into
                     <em class="emph">Highest Self Podcast: Modern Spirituality, Ayurveda, Conscious Entrepreneurship,

                     efforts
                     to systematically preserve podcasts and make them easily searchable. We found it
                     especially unfortunate that metadata fields that could have been revelatory for search
                     faceting and social network analysis (fields such as &lt;network&gt;, &lt;host&gt;, and
                     &lt;contributor&gt;) are not a part of any current podcast RSS specifications. Yet it was
                     equally clear that authoritative approaches to metadata had their own problems and
                     major
                     blind spots. The inadequacies and biases of Library of Congress subject headings have
                     received considerable attention within the discipline of information studies. For
                     example,
                     Juliet L. Hardesty [<a class="ref" href="#hardesty2019">Hardesty 2019</a>] has argued that the subject headings
                     generally take the primacy of white men as a default; “Robert
                     Frost” is cataloged under “Poets, American” without
                     reference to gender or race, whereas Maya Angelou is listed under subjects including
                     “African American women authors” and “African American authors.” The catalogers, in these cases, are applying a schema
                     that upholds a white patriarchal worldview and minimizes both the needs of users and
                     the
                     ways in which creators and subjects would choose to define themselves.

                  <div class="ptext" id="p15">In contrast, podcast creators have a tremendous amount of agency in how they define
                     themselves and attempt to connect with users (i.e. listeners and audiences). When
                     the
                     creators of the PHX podcast entered the keywords “podsincolor” and
                     “women of color” within their RSS feed, they actively chose to
                     present themselves this way and place their work within a larger network of podcasts
                     produced by people of color. The flexibility that characterizes metadata practices
                     prove
                     to be critical for marginalized podcasters in forming community, as they seek to carve
                     out
                     space for themselves within media production practices and platforms that consistently
                     privilege hegemonic whiteness, accepted paradigms of masculinity, and heteronormativity.
                     While this does not necessarily mean that self-policing within metadata production
                     does
                     not happen as a result of the asymmetrical power dynamics between platform and creator,
                     it
                     does still provide yet another avenue in which marginalized communities can stand

                     opposition to the individualistic neoliberal ideologies that undergird contemporary

                     [<a class="ref" href="#florini2017">Florini 2017</a>]. It is critical to note, however, that the non-uniformity of
                     metadata production yields ambivalent practices, both where innovative podcasters
                     can
                     resist the influence of various dominant ideologies, while others use this space to
                     reinforce their centrality simultaneously.

                     search engine optimization and strategies that can be utilized in order to gain attention
                     to one’s content, such as the optimal number of keywords, the kinds of thumbnail images

                     results impacts the manner in which metadata is written, and this influences the ways
                     that
                     podcast creators self-define their own content. The dominating influence of Apple
                     Podcasts
                     categories can be observed by the fact that within the entirety of the PodcastRE database,
                     the most used keywords lists are dominated by terms that are outlined either fully
                     or in
                     part by Apple Podcasts genre specifications. For example, with the exception of the

                     “podcast” and “radio,” the top fifteen keywords

                     “Podcast” and a blank space/uncategorized, the top ten keywords
                     reflect Apple Podcasts categories. The large amount of uncategorized keyword terms
                     may
                     gesture towards the fact that after 2013, the keywords metadata field became deprecated,
                     meaning that it no longer affected the output of Apple Podcasts’ search engine algorithms

                     podcasters may have forgone the labor of adding keywords, as the fields that most
                     influence search engine optimization are now the title, author, and description tags.

                     the podcasting ecosystem as a whole and our own curatorial decision to automatically

                     We modeled the user-experience and technological framework of PodcastRE’s Term Frequency
                     Line Graph on that of the Arclight app (<a href="http://projectarclight.org" onclick="window.open('http://projectarclight.org'); return false" class="ref">http://projectarclight.org</a>), which searches the 2.5 million page corpus of the
                     Media History Digital Library (MHDL) [<a class="ref" href="#hoyt2016">Hoyt 2016</a>]. The MHDL is composed of
                     books and magazines pertaining to the histories of film, broadcasting, and recorded
                     sound
                     from 1915 to 1960, which is an especially robust period for the searching of named
                     entities (such as people, film titles, or radio station call letters). Additionally,
                     the
                     normalization function for Arclight graphs works quite well (the most represented
                     year of
                     1915-1960 is only double in size of the least represented year, avoiding PodcastRE’s
                     challenge of grappling with exponential growth). Normalized searches for the names
                     of
                     movie stars, for example, generally map onto the arcs of their popularity and/or
                     notoriety, sometimes, though not always, with surprising results. Data visualizations
                     built for searching entities within large corpora of digitized texts are less adept
                     at
                     producing immediately legible results for searching the metadata keywords of a rapidly
                     growing born-digital medium. What would it mean to design a data visualization tool
                     that
                     embraced the messiness of born-digital objects and their metadata, rather than trying

                     Word
                     Cloud uses the Highcharts Javascript library to animate the visualization. To retrieve
                     the
                     information it needs, we query the keyword metadata facet within PodcastRE’s Solr
                     search
                     index, and we return and store them as key value pairs, with the number of podcasts
                     that
                     maintain both the queried keyword and the additional keyword (the hit count) next
                     to the
                     particular word. For example, if a user queries the word “love” within
                     the database, a potential key value pair that would appear would be “[‘relationships’, 163],” where “relationships” would
                     be the associated keyword for “love,” and the “163”
                     stands for how many times this keyword was added alongside the word
                     “love.” The results are sorted through keywords that have the most
                     hits down to the associated keywords that have the least hits. By targeting this metadata
                     keyword field and assigning the “weight” of a word to be the number
                     that is assigned to the hit count of the key value pair, we were able to visually
                     represent which keywords were paired most often with the queried word, by making the
                     word
                     with the heaviest “weight,” the largest in the word cloud. Because
                     certain topics have a range of associated keywords that spanned hundreds of words,
                     we
                     limited the number of keywords that can be shown on the word cloud to a maximum of
                     200
                     words. While this decision may hinder researchers from getting the full range of
                     associated keywords, this limitation was imposed to ensure readability on the
                     visualization. Two hundred words seemed like a reasonable count in order for researchers
                     to gain a sense of the wide range of relational topics that podcasters were dealing
                     with,
                     and simultaneously allow the visualizations to be effective in showing which keywords
                     were
                     the most actively engaged with.

                     closer examination on a micro episodic level of what kinds of keywords are used to
                     define
                     certain topical content. Often, the keywords that are used to describe podcasts are
                     not
                     uniformly applied to define episodes, so providing these two levels of analytical
                     range
                     gives researchers more flexibility in the kinds of questions they can ask using
                     PodcastRE.

                     and podcatcher applications. They are a space of creator agency, where podcast producers

                     applied toward exploratory research and achieving serendipitous discoveries. But we
                     also
                     wanted to use PodcastRE and the “mediaDuration” field to examine a more
                     focused question. What patterns can we notice about the duration of podcasts, and
                     what can
                     they tell us about practitioner norms and assumptions of what makes for a good length
                     of a
                     podcast? Unlike most other AV forms — movies, television, and radio — podcasts are
                     a
                     time-based medium that are not constrained by programming schedules (broadcast schedules,
                     movie theater showtimes) and technical limitations (reels of film and tape). If a
                     podcast
                     could run anywhere from a couple of seconds to several hours in length, how do norms
                     and
                     common practices develop around perceived ideas of a podcast’s optimal duration? We
                     realized that metadata could help us answer this question.

                  <div class="ptext" id="p30">In this section, then, we propose and share two approaches to studying podcast duration.
                     First, we consider how duration analysis might clarify the differences between two
                     programs of the same specification classification, in this case two popular daily
                     programs
                     from <em class="emph">The New York Times</em> and <em class="emph">NPR</em>, using data gathered from
                     episodes ranging from the former’s launch in early 2017 to an end point of April 2018.
                     Second, we conduct an investigation of a much larger scale, analyzing large rosters
                     of
                     programs to juxtapose duration across networks and genres. Our case studies here are
                     the
                     comedic programs of Earwolf and the comparably more serious fare of Gimlet Media,
                     using
                     data gathered from episodes ranging from 2009 until early 2018. In both of these cases,
                     the statistics were gathered by first running an SQL query on the PodcastRE database,
                     then
                     exporting metadata for all of the episodes into a .csv file, and finally finding averages,
                     medians, and other numbers using Microsoft Excel. All of these approaches required
                     us to
                     assemble subsets of data from within the PodcastRE collection (and the .csv files),
                     rather
                     than treating the entire collection as a dataset.<a class="noteRef" href="#d4e731">[1]</a> The genre and network categories that we ourselves added to the
                     spreadsheets opened the data up for more meaningful analysis, especially when paired
                     with
                     the duration metadata provided by the RSS feeds.

                  <div class="ptext" id="p31">Our first approach to studying duration explored what has become one of the most popular
                     contemporary podcast formats: the daily news program. How long should a daily news
                     podcast
                     take to consume? When <em class="emph">The New York Times</em> launched <em class="emph">The Daily</em> in
                     February of 2017, host Michael Barbaro described the fledgling program thusly: “This is how the news should sound. Fifteen minutes a day, five days a
                     week. It isn’t quite a podcast — although you can listen wherever you listen to
                     podcasts. It isn’t quite the radio — although the mechanics are largely the same.
                     It
                     isn’t quite the newspaper — although we’ll be drawing heavily on the journalism that
                     powers The New York Times”
                     [<a class="ref" href="#barbaro2017">Barbaro 2017</a>]. Though Barbaro pegged the program as difficult to explain,
                     it was a nearly immediate hit, gaining over five million monthly listeners by July
                     of 2018
                     [<a class="ref" href="#jerde2018">Jerde 2018</a>]. As Barbaro told <em class="emph">Vanity Fair</em> that same month,
                     “When we started the show, we had many goals… We didn’t realize we
                     were going to make money that was actually going to get pumped back into the
                     company”
                     [<a class="ref" href="#pompeo2018">Pompeo 2018</a>]. Yet as is often the case, success breeds imitators and
                     competitors, and <em class="emph">The Daily</em> witnessed the rise of its biggest challenger in
                     June of 2017 when NPR launched <em class="emph">Up First</em>, a daily “10-minute morning news podcast” that is “designed with
                     digital listeners in mind but will also serve as a preview of the news stories that
                     will
                     be treated in depth on public radio stations across the country throughout the

                     [<a class="ref" href="#up2017">NPR 2017</a>]. That program was also a swift triumph, and as of October 2018,
                     both <em class="emph">The Daily</em> and <em class="emph">Up First</em> sat comfortably in the top five most
                     popular podcasts according to Podtrac’s rankings: the former tailed behind only
                     <em class="emph">Serial</em>, while the latter occupies the fifth spot [<a class="ref" href="#podtrac2018">Podtrac 2018</a>].

                     of
                     the programs on their official websites also focus on duration. <em class="emph">Up First</em> has
                     remained consistent in its advertised average runtime: “NPR’s <em class="emph">Up

                     from politics to pop culture — in 10 minutes”
                     [<a class="ref" href="#up2018">NPR 2018</a>]. <em class="emph">The Daily</em>, meanwhile, has added five minutes to its
                     initial announcement: “This is how the news should sound. Twenty
                     minutes a day, five days a week, hosted by Michael Barbaro and powered by New York
                     Times
                     journalism”
                     [<a class="ref" href="#nyt2018">New York Times 2018</a>]. The programs are, essentially, two different approaches to the
                     morning commute: <em class="emph">Up First</em>’s proposed shorter length seems guaranteed to slot
                     into almost any daily trip to work, while <em class="emph">The Daily</em>’s longer runtime requires
                     either a lengthy commute, multiple listening sessions, or even perhaps the utilization
                     of
                     1.5x or 2x speed playback options. Such duration decisions are complimented by
                     storytelling approaches: <em class="emph">Up First</em>’s short length is matched with a
                     “greatest hits” style compilation of short stories, while <em class="emph">The
                        Daily</em>’s relatively lengthier duration is primarily spent on the discussion of a
                     single story. In theory, then, the former aims to quickly provide its listeners with
                     headline-style blurbs about the day’s biggest stories, while the latter seeks to
                     exhaustively cover a single topic.

                  <div class="ptext" id="p33">Such temporal differences are roughly borne out by the metadata found in PodcastRE’s
                     database, although the story is more complicated than the descriptions of the series
                     imply. <em class="emph">The Daily</em> (mean duration of 22:51, median duration of 22:12) runs
                     nearly ten minutes longer than <em class="emph">Up First</em> (mean duration of 13:33, median
                     duration of 13:17), with both programs on average running a few minutes longer than
                     their
                     advertised lengths. The differences between the two series is much starker when
                     considering the range in podcast durations, as <em class="emph">Up First</em> is relatively
                     consistent in episode duration (shortest episode of 11:01 and longest episode of 17:46
                     for
                     a range of 6:45) while <em class="emph">The Daily</em> varies widely between episodes (shortest
                     episode of 13:00 and longest episode of 41:23 for a range of 28:23). These durational
                     differences align neatly with the programs’ content choices (i.e. multiple headlines
                     vs.
                     single story focus), though they provide critical additional clarifications. While
                     both
                     <em class="emph">Up First</em> and <em class="emph">The Daily</em> release episodes each weekday morning,
                     the former’s tight range and shorter length ties it more closely to its proposed function
                     as morning commute listening, while the latter’s wider range and extended runtime
                     emphasizes delivering a full story adequately. Since podcasts do not have the same
                     durational constraints of broadcast media, these choices in runtime are clear aesthetic
                     and storytelling decisions – yet given the evolutionary radio approach of NPR’s daily
                     podcast and <em class="emph">The New York Times</em>’s commitment to the news story, these
                     decisions are not completely detached from their companies’ original mediums.

                     had an average runtime between 0-20 minutes, and that program (<em class="emph">Chompers</em>)
                     serves a specific and brief function: children are meant to listen to the series as
                     they
                     brush their teeth. 2 of the series had an average runtime between 40-60 minutes, though
                     both of those shows (<em class="emph">Twice Removed</em> and <em class="emph">Mystery Show</em>) are no
                     longer producing episodes. The other 17 series, then, had average run times between
                     20-40
                     minutes, aligning Gimlet’s roster with conventional advice on podcast episode
                     length.<a class="noteRef" href="#d4e1077">[4]</a> While individual episodes still varied quite a bit
                     (<em class="emph">Reply All</em>, for instance, had a range of 1:35:29 between its shortest and
                     longest episodes, while <em class="emph">Mogul</em> had a range of 1:16:17), these ranges were
                     still much smaller than the largest Earwolf ranges.

                  <div class="ptext" id="p37">The relative homogenization of Gimlet Media podcast duration, then, stands in stark
                     contrast to the diverse podcast lengths of Earwolf. Every Gimlet Media podcast had
                     an
                     average run time under an hour, and 84.2% of the shows surveyed had average runtimes
                     between 20-40 minutes. 56.7% of the Earwolf podcasts analyzed, meanwhile, had average
                     runtimes over an hour long, and 76.7% of Earwolf’s podcasts had average runtimes over
                     40
                     minutes long — in other words, over three-quarters of Earwolf’s shows ran longer on
                     average than Gimlet’s “sweet spot.” Individual episode lengths varied
                     in each of the networks’ programs, but Gimlet’s programs featured smaller ranges than
                     the
                     large variation found in many of Earwolf’s programs. Such differences may be the result
                     of
                     institutional decisions, generic divergences, or series lengths. Whatever the cause,
                     however, Earwolf and Gimlet serve as evidence that podcast networks can have wildly
                     divergent approaches towards episode duration, and that studying duration can lead
                     us to
                     insights about genre conventions, production values and more.

                  <div class="ptext" id="p38">On a recent episode of the <cite class="title italic">Start Up</cite> podcast, the show’s
                     host, and Gimlet CEO, Alex Blumberg was reflecting on his decision to sell Gimlet
                     media to
                     Spotify. He noted that Gimlet’s gambit to standardize the production of highly edited
                     and
                     tightly produced 'quality’ podcasts (that often followed very specific duration and
                     other
                     editorial decisions) had turned out to be a financially unfeasible strategy that was
                     losing ground to cheaper and more popular chat cast style podcasts (where duration
                     and
                     other attributes are more flexible given the lower costs involved for editing and
                     polishing the finished piece). His comments are a reminder that, despite the format’s
                     substantial growth in the last two decades, there are still many lingering questions
                     about
                     the forms, conventions and economics of podcasting. We believe it is especially crucial
                     during this time of flux, before podcasting stabilizes like so many other media have,
                     to
                     study the different approaches podcasters of all types are taking as they experiment
                     with
                     this emerging sonic format. Although duration numbers seem like relatively innocuous
                     or
                     descriptive metadata, the research from PodcastRE suggests they reveal historical
                     relationships between new and old media formats, industrial and economic assumptions
                     about
                     “ideal” formats, and generic conventions that shape both amateur and
                     professional podcasts.

                     complexity as a cultural form while simultaneously taking advantage of its unique
                     technical affordances. The centering of RSS metadata and what can be mined from it
                     through
                     advanced search, graphing keywords over time, or visualizing word clouds of associated
                     keywords has helped us facilitate the automated collection of a significant corpus
                     of
                     podcasts from a crucial period in the format’s emergence. It has also facilitated
                     novel,
                     fine-grained exploration of specific file characteristics as well, like duration metrics,
                     across a variety of genres and shows.

                  <div class="ptext" id="p40">The reliance on RSS, however, has also forced us to confront the messiness and
                     intricacies of a born digital object whose metadata and descriptive features are dynamic
                     and podcaster generated. Podcasting’s relatively open and accessible origins have
                     helped
                     create a vibrant environment for web-based audio – one that includes the scores of
                     podcasts available and the multiplicity of voices behind them, but also the numerous
                     apps,
                     aggregator sites and distribution technologies that have emerged to support podcasting’s
                     rise. RSS and XML have not only been important to our work on PodcastRE, but to podcasting
                     more broadly, and to the agency and control it has provided podcasters for defining
                     their
                     work on their own terms as well as for listeners in terms of defining their listening
                     practices. Recently, there have been a number of attempts to move away from the more
                     open
                     and accessible versions of podcasting, to more closed and profitable models (e.g.
                     exclusive shows tied to one platform, like Spotify, or subscription-based services
                     like
                     Luminary). While these options may make podcasting more user-friendly and convenient,
                     or
                     may offer podcasters more options for monetizing their work, they also make podcasts
                     more
                     platform-dependent, less analyzable, and less open to research.

                  <div class="ptext" id="p41">The centrality of RSS to both podcasting and PodcastRE has been a theme throughout
                     this
                     article. We believe our methods and findings, however, hold relevance for beyond scholars
                     researching other topics at the intersection of media studies and DH. As this study
                     has
                     shown, metadata records can serve as surrogates for studying large collections of
                     time-based media objects, allowing researchers to query the durations of millions
                     of media
                     objects in a fraction of the time it would take to ingest and analyze transcoded media
                     files. Yet our work has also shown that, when it comes to born digital media, the
                     metadata
                     are never fully separate from the objects they describe, nor are they fully capable
                     of
                     replacing close listening and other media studies methods. There is a need to delineate
                     between methods best suited for <em class="emph">digitized media collections</em> compared to those
                     most appropriate for <em class="emph">born digital media collections</em> and for devising
                     strategies to blend AV and DH methods. By making these distinctions, we can better
                     apply
                     DH to AV and identify change and continuity, at a large scale, across media history.
