                  <p>Digital literary studies constitutes a broad church.  However, the field tends to
                     divide into, at one pole, quantitative, macro-level studies of historical literary
                     texts and, at the other pole, close-readings of individual born-digital literary
                     works, typically hyper-avant-garde in conception.  There is, in practice, little
                     interplay between the two groupings.  This article sketches a proposed ‘meso’ space
                     in between the two extant levels.  Drawing on methods from book history, literary
                     sociology, cultural studies, and digital media theory, this mid-level approach examines
                     digital technology’s role in recasting the institutions of contemporary mainstream
                     literature:
                     the impact of powerful new digital intermediaries; the blurring of
                     author/reader/reviewer roles; and the continued existence of print artefacts within
                     online environments.</p>

                     successive waves of structuralist, post-structuralist, Marxist, feminist, postcolonial,
                     new-historicist, and queer theory in the academy seemed to have reached a point of
                     diminishing returns. Once revolutionary modes of analysis had ossified into rote
                     posturing, with talk of radical revisioning oddly transmuted into received wisdom.
                     This
                     sense of a discipline in stasis was not only intellectual but also institutional —
                     existential even. Universities’ political paymasters and research-funding bodies have
                     increasingly insisted that disciplines demonstrate their vocational utility and
                     real-world ‘impact’. Undergraduates, voting with their feet, indirectly registered
                     the
                     same message via declining enrolments, while graduate students — surveying a parlous
                     academic job market — opted for other, presumably safer, careers.<a class="noteRef" href="#d4e225">[2]</a> This already precarious
                     disciplinary status quo was then massively destabilized by the COVID-19 pandemic’s
                     shock
                     to higher-education systems worldwide as revenue from international students collapsed
                     in the face of travel bans and local lockdowns. In a discipline long prone to gloomy
                     prognostications about its future, English scholars of even a more optimistic cast
                     had
                     to admit, by 2020, that the doomsayers really did have a point (<cite class="title italic">Endgame</cite>, 2020).</div>

                  <div class="ptext" id="p2">Against this post-millennial background, engagement with the digital world seemed
                     a
                     logical pivot for the humanities, given information and communication technologies’
                     wholesale transformation of all aspects of contemporary western life since mainstreaming
                     of the internet in the early 1990s. For literary studies in particular though, this
                     turn
                     to the digital came freighted with heavy baggage. Mid-1990s ‘death of the book’
                     discourse had pitted an all-conquering ‘electronic literature’ (eLit) against an
                     ostensibly obsolete print medium, and had left many literary humanists with an active
                     distaste for digital triumphalism [<a class="ref" href="#kirschenbaum2014">Kirschenbaum and Werner 2014</a>, 406–7]. Strategic
                     errors made by digital boosters in positing the digital as implacable rival and
                     inevitable successor to print had served to polarize debate and made it harder to
                     adopt
                     middle-ground positions. As it transpired, eBooks and the printed codex negotiated
                     an uneasy marketplace modus vivendi, but traditional literary scholars and former
                     eLit
                     enthusiasts were slower to do likewise. The rise of Digital Humanities (DH) discourse
                     from around 2005 threatened a repeat of 1990s hostilities, this time with adherents
                     of
                     quantitative ‘distant reading’ at loggerheads with advocates of traditional hermeneutic
                     close reading, who accused their adversaries of not reading at all [<a class="ref" href="#eve2019">Eve 2019</a>, 3–4].</div>

                     Indeed, superseding them is is the starting point for the present discussion. In spite
                     of the self-presentation of both eLit advocates and DH-ers as radical agents of change,
                     their reconfigurations of the literary studies discipline have, if anything, not gone
                     far enough. Both approaches remain essentially text-centric, differing principally
                     on
                     whether a niche group of very recent texts is painstakingly interpreted, or a large
                     corpus of often obscure historical texts is digitally skimmed. Broader questions of
                     how
                     digital technologies might reconfigure academe’s now century-old literary studies

                  <div class="ptext" id="p4">At the outset of the present discussion, some definitional clarification seems in
                     order. In talking
                     about ‘digital literary studies’ I denote principally literary works, deploying whatever
                     medium, created since the late decades of the twentieth century. These have been
                     produced, circulated, and consumed in the context of a digital literary sphere (however
                     much the parameters of that sphere have expanded and its agents have multiplied over
                     subsequent decades). But, by extension, much of the following argument about practicing
                     a ‘literary cultural studies’ is also relevant to analyzing literature produced in
                     earlier, pre-digital eras, with due allowance being made for the varying medial
                     environments and socio-economic contexts of specific periods and geographical locations.
                     It is a broadly sociological, media-aware disposition I am advocating, not one with
                     strict chronological cut-off points.</div>
                  
                  <div class="counter"><a href="#p5">5</a></div>
                  <div class="ptext" id="p5">Currently, our intellectual schemas for making sense of the digital paradigm’s epochal
                     impact on literary culture remain inadequate. Digital literary studies continues to
                     miss
                     the larger significance of digital technologies for contemporary literary culture
                     because it takes either too micro or too macro a perspective. On one hand,
                     studies of eLit have existed since the late 1980s, and focus on close-reading individual
                     born-digital texts, usually of an avant-garde nature with at best coterie audiences.
                     On
                     the other hand, the last decade and a half has seen the efflorescence of DH approaches
                     which machine-read extensive historical literary corpora to gauge large-scale
                     statistical trends in genre, authorship, and nationality. However much their
                     chronological frame differs, the guiding methodology remains at some level hermeneutic.
                     Thus, DH scholar Alan Liu may be correct in his claim that “the contrast between the
                     practices of close reading and the digital humanities is so stark that it is changing
                     the very nature of the ground being fought over: the text” [<a class="ref" href="#liu2012">Liu 2012</a>, 494]. Yet, text-centrism of
                     either stripe still mostly disregards the material world beyond the text itself: the
                     agents of production, circulation, and consumption; the commercial context of the
                     book
                     trade; and the legal, political, and cultural policy frameworks that impinge upon
                     or
                     facilitate the flow of texts.<a class="noteRef" href="#d4e261">[3]</a> While often exemplary research about this intermediate space does exist
                     (see below), it is currently scant and scattered, too often existing as a corrective
                     to
                     the main currents of eLit or DH research rather than, as should be the case,
                     constituting the starting point for an overarching reorientation of the literature-media
                     interface around sociological concerns. We are thus left, in an era of rapid book-world
                     changes, with a troublingly partial understanding of how digital technologies are
                     transforming the very <em class="emph">institutionality</em> of contemporary,
                     mainstream literature. </div>

                  <div class="ptext" id="p6">To resolve this impasse, we urgently require what John Frow, discussing the future
                     of
                     literary sociology, terms a ‘mid-level concept’ (<a href="#frow2013">2013, [2010]</a>) — namely, an analytical
                     framework straddling, on one hand, innumerable individual literary texts and, on the
                     other, the unwieldy abstraction that is ‘literature’ [<a class="ref" href="#frow2013">Frow 2013</a>, 227]. Literary studies has
                     attempted, over its roughly century-long institutional history, to fill this ‘mid-level’
                     space with various organizing schema: periodization, genre categories; and diachronic
                     accounts of national literatures [<a class="ref" href="#frow2013">Frow 2013</a>, 221, 227]. But these too remain
                     near-exclusively text-centric. The <em class="emph">why</em> and <em class="emph">how</em> of literature’s arrival on the scholar’s desk for painstaking close-reading
                     are factored out of analysis, and the text’s relationship to an abstractly configured
                     form of identity politics has, in recent decades, dominated proceedings. The still
                     too-often hazy technological and institutional apparatus that moves a given book into
                     the scholarly ambit and makes it available for close-reading I here dub the ‘meso’
                     space. </div>

                  <div class="ptext" id="p7">I borrow this terminology from the field of economics where scholars since the 1980s
                     have also proposed a mid-level category to bridge that discipline’s traditional
                     bifurcation into microeconomic and macroeconomic frames [<a class="ref" href="#dopfer2004">Dopfer et al. 2004</a>]. The aim of such renegade economists is to capture those political-economic forces
                     governing the space between individual economic actors and the broader structures
                     within
                     which they operate. Largely in parallel, a conceptually cognate ‘new institutionalism’
                     has, since the early 1990s, also emerged within the discipline of sociology [<a class="ref" href="#powell1991">Powell and DiMaggio 1991</a>]
                     [<a class="ref" href="#thornton2012">Thornton 2012</a>]. It has a similar interest in
                     ‘mid-level’ or ‘meso’ intermediaries that shape cultural phenomenon (for example,
                     commercial organizations, public-sector entities, regulatory frameworks, social
                     networks) and which exhibit a strong degree of self-perpetuating autonomy. Such an
                     institutional focus helps integrate the abstract totalities of ‘society’ or ‘the
                     economy’ at one extreme and the empirical specificity of atomized individual choices
                     at
                     the other.<a class="noteRef" href="#d4e302">[4]</a> The approach also evinces a
                     refreshing self-consciousness that the level of reference chosen for analysis profoundly
                     influences the research questions formulated, the types of evidence sought, and the
                     resulting conclusions [<a class="ref" href="#thornton2012">Thornton 2012</a>, 14]. </div>

                     technological determinism of medium theory and the futile insularity of individual
                     case-studies unmoored to larger theoretical schema. Vitally, the new institutionalism
                     illuminates that literary entities are not mere externalities of an aesthetically
                     autonomous literary culture; they are constitutive of it in that they profoundly
                     influence what achieves recognition <em class="emph">as</em> ‘literature’. Literary
                     studies’ long preoccupation with the linguistic minutiae of the textual artefact thus
                     needs supplementing with sociological awareness of the <em class="emph">material</em> world beyond the text (in the word’s dual technological and economic senses), without
                     pitting the two perspectives against each other or subordinating one to serve as mere
                     illustration of the
                     other’s explanatory paradigms. The way out of literary studies’ currently troubled,
                     defensive pass as outlined at this article’s opening is thus multi-step: firstly,
                     to
                     reconceive the discipline in cultural-sociological terms. Secondly, to investigate
                     how
                     the current wave of accelerating digitization is changing that sociological context.
                     And
                     thirdly – as I sketch in this article’s final section – to use the opportunity provided
                     by these contextual changes to rethink literary studies in far-reaching ways: its
                     objects of study; institutional settings; analytic methods; potential publics; and
                     pedagogical practices.</div>

                     enlightening to examine how these fields may be currently shifting or even, tentatively,
                     converging. DH has emerged as a prime area of research renewal and public interest

                     environments comprising the core of contemporary media and communications. It makes
                     explicit the humanities’ continuing relevance for twenty-first-century culture and
                     society, rejecting inherited notions of a qualitatively-oriented humanities as

                     starting to acknowledge the missing ‘meso’ level. Richard Jean So’s <em class="emph">Redlining Culture</em> (2021) undertakes quantitatively-informed analysis of how
                     ‘minority authors’ have been consistently marginalized in the historical workings

                     of accelerating conglomeration among US trade publishers over the second half of the
                     twentieth century. It is a welcome DH avowal that “the economics of American literature
                     — production, reception, and recognition” emphatically matter [<a class="ref" href="#so2021">So 2021</a>, 5, 7–11]. By looking

                     such a maneuver, such as Scott Rettberg’s “Electronic Literature as Digital Humanities”

                     Nevertheless, in practice, most ELO adherents have tended to hold themselves somewhat
                     aloof from post-millennial DH developments, pointedly insisting that their own academic
                     project dates from at least the 1980s. But digital literary studies modes of affiliation
                     are perceptibly now in flux. Dene Grigar, former President of the ELO, co-edited the
                     volume <cite class="title italic">Electronic Literature as Digital Humanities: Contexts, Forms,
                        and Practices</cite> (2021) which proclaims unambiguously that electronic literature
                     <em class="emph">is</em> digital humanities [<a class="ref" href="#grigar2021">Grigar 2021</a>, 3]. Her echo of the title of
                     Rettberg’s article — “one of the inspirations for this book” — underlines eLit’s belated
                     surrender to the rhetorical and institutional pull of the more modish label [<a class="ref" href="#grigar2021">Grigar 2021</a>, 3]. Taken
                     together, works by the likes of So, Rettberg, and Grigar suggest that previously
                     operative binaries between eLit and DH (contemporary versus historical; qualitative
                     versus quantitative; creative versus analytical) are losing their valency. Their

                     especially apparent when we zoom out to consider the technological, institutional,
                     economic, and social changes underway since the early 1990s adoption of the Internet
                     across western societies. Indisputably, the landscape of contemporary mainstream
                     literature has been transformed. The gatekeeping authority of trade publishers has
                     been
                     partially usurped by self-publishing and crowd-funded publishing initiatives via which
                     anyone may anoint themselves an author. Circulation of literary works and venues for
                     book discussion have been similarly transformed by the rise of born-digital periodicals,
                     internet retailing, social-media book promotion, and online writers’ festivals. Thirdly,
                     consumption of literary culture has been revolutionized by traditionally passive,
                     silent, and anonymous readers using interactive technologies to network in online
                     book
                     clubs and to recast themselves as amateur literary critics via online book review
                     and
                     ratings platforms. Each wave of social-media has been co-opted in turn by a subsector
                     of
                     bookish users to facilitate digital book talk, whether via litblogs, bookTube,
                     bookstagram or, most recently, bookTok. Reader becomes reviewer and, more
                     problematically, de facto publicist and content producer. This last point underlines
                     digital technology’s greatest disruption of codex-based literary culture: how the
                     previously distinct roles of producer, disseminator, and consumer have become impossibly
                     blurred. As various functions in book historian Robert Darnton’s famous ‘Communications
                     Circuit’ are elided, single agents take on multiple, combined roles [<a class="ref" href="#murray2013">Murray 2013</a>].</div>

                  <div class="ptext" id="p16">These changes have not, of course, passed un-noticed by academe. Scholars drawn from
                     book history and media archaeology (Matthew Kirschenbaum, Lisa Gitelman, Martin Paul
                     Eve), communication and cultural studies (Ted Striphas) and cultural sociology (J.
                     B.
                     Thompson, Laura J. Miller) have analyzed the significance of the contemporary book
                     world’s pervasive digitization for their respective disciplines. While several of
                     these
                     scholars have backgrounds in literary studies, they nevertheless keep in view the
                     material specificity of the book object, so often rendered a transparent and passive
                     substrate by traditional formalist close-reading approaches. Because of this
                     extra-textual awareness, their works explore the effect of digitization on book culture
                     without the ominous 1990s sense of the entire book format being under threat. For
                     those
                     scholars in the group trained in sociology or communication on the other hand, the
                     pre-eminence of the book as a media format was never an article of faith. Thus, the
                     rise
                     of other media formats signals not ignominious demotion of the book but merely the
                     reorganization of an always-evolving informational ecosystem. The book – let alone
                     the
                     text — is never considered self-sufficient; it is, rather, the locus at which multiple
                     commercial, regulatory, social, and cultural forces converge. To understand the book
                     in
                     the current era is inevitably to be redirected outwards to these larger contexts.
                     It is
                     this invaluable sociological perspective that such scholars bring to contemporary

                  <div class="ptext" id="p17">Work undertaken to date in this meso zone should be applauded for its willingness
                     to
                     examine digital technologies’ impact on the contemporary literary world. It also,
                     at
                     points, shades into the more DH arm of digital literary studies (for example in So’s
                     recent book or the work of Martin Paul Eve). But here again the conception of the
                     digital’s role appears to be primarily quantitative: harnessing the enumerative power
                     and analytical scale of digital data to ask new ask questions about how Bourdieu’s
                     literary field functions. Proponents of more textually-oriented, quantitative ‘cultural
                     analytics’ approaches, such as Piper, are careful to pre-empt objections from those
                     schooled in literary critique by stating that distant reading is not (<em class="emph">pace</em> Moretti) a substitute for close-reading, but rather a filtering tool and
                     complement for detailed textual analysis [<a class="ref" href="#piper2015">Piper 2015</a>, 67]. In the view of such self-styled
                     academic bridge-builders, the two methods represent ‘commensurable’ approaches [<a class="ref" href="#long2016">Long and So 2016</a>, 237] [<a class="ref" href="#eve2019">Eve 2019</a>, 3–4]. Yet such work has been less ready to ask <em class="emph">qualitative</em> questions of the digital paradigm itself,
                     specifically, how the rise of digitization affects the inter-relationship of traditional
                     agents in the literary field. As a result, the digital tends to feature as
                     transcendent — a neutral, external tool invoked to aid analysis but not itself
                     complicit in the economic or sociological framing of the object of study. Where the
                     textual corpus chosen is largely historical, this factoring out of the digital’s agentic
                     role may be defensible, though it occurs also in contemporary-focused work. For example,
                     Laura B. McGrath, in a study of the late twentieth- and twenty-first-century book
                     world,
                     has illuminatingly deployed quantitative DH methods to reveal how US publishers
                     overwhelmingly use ‘comparable title’ data from white authors when estimating likely
                     sales for manuscripts under consideration, to the detriment of writers of color [<a class="ref" href="#mcgrath2019">McGrath 2019</a>].
                     Yet, her analysis is more an <em class="term">ex-post-facto</em> study of the top 500 titles used for
                     ‘comping’ by the current book industry than of the impact of rapid and ongoing
                     datafication on the industry itself. The problem, she implies, lies more with the
                     composition of the specific <em class="emph">corpus</em> of comp titles chosen than
                     with the act of ‘data-driven acquisitions’ <em class="emph">per se</em> [<a class="ref" href="#mcgrath2019">McGrath 2019</a>]. Accordingly, the digital still
                     functions primarily as a neutral aid for scholarly examination, rather than featuring
                     as

                     studies” [<a class="ref" href="#debruyn2013">De Bruyn 2013</a>, 197]. This, like cultural studies, would take issues of technological,
                     institutional, economic, and social context seriously. Text and context would be held
                     in
                     dynamic relationship, posited as mutually constitutive, without superimposing the
                     epistemological claims of one discipline on the other [<a class="ref" href="#thumala2021">Thumala 2021</a>, 103]. It can
                     thereby avoid the “sociological absolutism” that has bedeviled many previous parleys
                     between the literary studies and sociology disciplines, in which literature is allotted
                     the thankless task of ‘proving’ sociological precepts [<a class="ref" href="#frow2013">Frow 2013</a>, 219] [<a class="ref" href="#english2010">English 2010</a>, xii–xiii]. Discernible behind Collins’s remarks is du Gay et al.’s famous

                     widely-influential cultural studies diagram, the textual representation of the object
                     remains important for elucidating meaning, but it is contextualized against a much
                     broader background incorporating producer motives, audience behaviors, modes of
                     social-identity facilitation, and forms of regulation. The effect is a 360-degree

                  <div class="ptext" id="p20">The phrase ‘literary cultural studies’ may appear, at first glance, an oxymoron.
                     Cultural studies, in its British and Australian strains, grew of course out of a revolt
                     <em class="emph">against</em> the exclusive study of a highly limited historical
                     canon of English literature. To the extent that cultural studies has <em class="emph">ever</em> been interested in analyzing books, it is usually only those works so
                     debased and disparaged in traditional literary studies as to have been rendered
                     symbolically ‘unclean’: pulps; romances; horror; westerns; comics etc. What is radical
                     and refreshing about Collins’s brand of ‘literary cultural studies’ is that it brings
                     the sociological gaze of cultural studies to analyze afresh literary studies’ original
                     object of study: literature. More than this, Collins and his ilk eschew the knee-jerk
                     relativism of cultural studies orthodoxy to parse the concept of ‘literariness’ itself.
                     Here considerations of aesthetic value are not ruled out of bounds at the outset but
                     are
                     instead reconfigured as sociologically brokered: by analyzing, say, the disputes of
                     amateur lit-bloggers, paid book reviewers, and literary academics around a single
                     work
                     we are watching aesthetic evaluation being hammered out in real time by agents wielding
                     differing degrees of economic, institutional, and social capital. </div>

                     the broader project of building a ‘literary cultural studies’ or — in my preferred
                     formulation — ‘literary media studies’ for the digital’
                     remains unrealized. This is the ‘meso’ level of digital literary studies alluded to
                     in

                     new institutionalist mindset to account for the influence of contemporary technological,
                     institutional, economic, legal, and social factors which intervene between individual
                     texts and the totalizing abstraction of ‘Literature’. It should take the coexistence
                     and
                     interpenetration of print and digital domains as its intellectual ground and closely
                     analyze the complex flows of content between them. Doing so, it gives us tools to
                     understand why the ‘literary’ not only continues to exist in a digitally-dominated
                     mediascape (contrary to 1990s predictions), but how users deploy digital media to

                        those disciplines’ characteristic view of cultural phenomena as sociologically produced

                        ‘corruption’. The upshot was a radically dematerialized and decontextualized
                        understanding of literary works that was only partially corrected by the waves of
                        ideology critique that transformed literary studies from the 1960s onwards. While

                        by readers’ emotional investment in books. Academic literary studies’ prime goal of
                        reducing (or appearing to reduce) subjectivism in interpreting literary works was
                        designed to create the appearance of reproducibly ‘scientific’ knowledge. Hence the
                        preference for literary techniques (poetic forms, figures of speech, narrative point
                        of
                        view etc.) that could be taught as transferrable between individual works. The first
                        causality of such a drive for systematism and scientific replicability was readerly
                        subjectivism (“the affective fallacy”), in that an idealized Reader who served to model
                        preferred interpretations was substituted for actual, individual readers. The second
                        casualty was authorial subjectivism (“the intentional fallacy”), as examining a literary
                        creator’s motivation was likewise declared intellectually out of bounds [<a class="ref" href="#wimsatt1946">Wimsatt 1946</a>]. This strategy could largely hold sway in an era where authors had limited

                        ‘practical criticism’: close-reading seminar exercises; the essay (often read aloud
                        to a

                        enthusiasm for iterative or collaborative forms of assessment were scant, hence the

                        over a century ago: the expunging of subjectivism in interpreting texts. Contemporary
                        academics must engage in the delicate balancing act of recognizing that
                        emotionally-invested modes of reading among book enthusiasts never went away, while
                        simultaneously preserving their own status as professional interpreters of the literary
                        scene. Readerly affect can, as Rita Felski has demonstrated in a trilogy of recent
                        books, itself be the subject of academic analysis for what it reveals about dispositions
                        towards literature (<a href="#felski2008">2008</a>, <a href="#felski2015">2015</a>, <a href="#felski2020">2020</a>). Yet Felski barely mentions the massive archive of

                        equally important not to idealize readerly affect as necessarily resistant, but instead
                        to acknowledge how emotionally authentic reader responses to books are avidly data-mined
                        by media platforms in the interests of fine-tuning their algorithms and driving

                        embraced the internet’s characteristic distributed architecture and the democratic
                        access it permits. But at the same time, they demonstrate resilient interest in
                        mechanisms for cultural evaluation and discrimination (e.g. cumulative book review
                        ratings, community-endorsed litbloggers, ‘top’ bookTubers etc.). There is no necessary
                        contradiction here: such readerly communities seek a voice in the weighing of literary
                        worth and are restive with literary evaluation taking place behind closed doors and
                        then
                        being handed down, from on high, by an academic clerisy. Rather, they want broadening
                        of
                        the parties to literary discussion and for critics to publicly state their evaluative
                        criteria, with all verdicts being open to debate. Academic expertise still holds value
                        for this group, if academics can trade the familiar role of incontrovertible authority
                        for one of dialogic participant, and can make their arguments in language intelligible
                        to an interested layperson. The success and growth of literary-centric,
                        publicly-oriented websites such as Literary Hub is heartening in this regard.<a class="noteRef" href="#d4e876">[9]</a> A niche-targeted content

                        lecture/seminar/tutorial teaching modes; close-reading analytic method; and

                  <div class="ptext" id="p40">As we enter a third decade of ‘postcritique’ literary studies, it is clear that waiting
                     the digital out is not an option. Conceptions of a print culture posited in steadfast
                     opposition to the digital have been disproven by the consumer trends of the last 25
                     years and were, in any case, always ontologically suspect. Media historians have long
                     disputed neatly successionist views of a newer communication technology wholesale
                     replacing an earlier medium. The intellectual challenge — and payoff – instead lies
                     in
                     observing different mediums’ patterns of complex interdependence, mutual
                     cannibalization, and unexpected revivification. Literary studies’ post-millennial
                     pivot
                     towards the digital has been welcome in providing our discipline with justification
                     for
                     its continued twenty-first-century relevance. However, the <em class="emph">ways</em>
                     in which digital literary studies is currently configured have exposed a hollow middle
                     between, at one extreme, micro-scale studies of contemporary born-digital works that
                     are
                     often closer to fine arts practice, are accessed by miniscule publics, and are likely
                     to
                     become technologically obsolete within a decade and, at the other, macro-oriented
                     studies of pre-1923 literary history (now almost a century in the past). Neither of
                     these domains provides a viable roadmap for a literary studies discipline seeking
                     to
                     engage meaningfully with the mainstream of contemporary culture. It is not so much
                     that
                     embrace of the digital has been a mistake for literary studies but that the embrace
                     has
                     been awkwardly set up. Digital technologies not only provide new platforms for existing
                     texts, they normalize new modes for producing texts, radically expand networks for
                     circulating them, and greatly empower readers who seize the opportunity to become
                     textual producers in turn. Digital sociology offers the necessary tools to broaden
                     our
                     analytic gaze to capture this sense of a digital literary sphere in dynamic flux.</div>

                  <div class="ptext" id="p41">To return in closing to the Jim Collins interview mentioned earlier, he speaks of
                     the
                     urgency of the literary academy looking up from its texts and its now-familiar
                     ideological constructions of race, class, gender, and sexuality to engage fully with
                     the
                     <em class="emph">materiality</em> of contemporary literary culture: “for me to teach
                     contemporary fiction I should now talk to my students about how they come to it, how
                     it
                     circulates, what’s going on <em class="emph">outside</em> as well as inside the
                     classroom” [<a class="ref" href="#collins2010">Collins 2010</a>, 197]. Such an expansive mindset allows literary academe to converse with
                     communities of paraliterary enthusiasts with whom we have so far had little traffic:
                     the
                     burgeoning and vociferous audiences for writers’ festivals; book clubs; online
                     reviewing; and digitally-hosted book talk in general. Many of these groups have for
                     some
                     decades turned away from academic literary critics as taste arbiters, alienated by
                     the
                     arcane terminology and suspicious reading protocols they encountered in undergraduate
                     curricula or endured in diluted versions as high-schoolers. We cannot afford to pass
                     up
                     this opportunity to make common cause with a sizable body of literary enthusiasts
                     among
                     the broader public, not with literary studies buffeted by falling enrolments,
                     governments’ vocational agenda, and insecure patterns of academic employment. Demotic
                     brands of literary criticism never went away; we just lacked the theoretical,
                     methodological, and pedagogical tools (and yes, perhaps, the willingness) to engage
                     with
                     them. With the advent of the digital literary sphere, these extra-academic literary
                     discussions are better archived, more discoverable, and more socially porous than
                     ever
                     before. We are thus faced with the choice Rita Felski identifies in the epigraph to
                     this
                     article: to retreat in the face of digital culture and to define literariness in
                     ever-more circumscribed and aesthetically exclusive ways. Or, to embrace what the
                     digital literary sphere has to offer our discipline: new things to study; new ways
                     to
                     talk about them; and – crucially – new audiences who may well want to hear what we
                     have
                     to say about how contemporary literary culture actually functions.</div>
