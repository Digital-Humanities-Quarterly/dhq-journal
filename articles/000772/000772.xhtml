                  <p>Drawing from research on liberated minors, formerly enslaved children whom the colonial
                     state in Senegal 
                     entrusted to guardians following their emancipation, this article describes the process
                     of building a database consisting 
                     of identifying information about formerly enslaved children in early colonial Senegal based on data 
                     originally collected in the early twentieth century, and it uses the database to ask
                     both historical and ethical 
                     questions about naming practices and aliases, experiences of unfreedom, and the agency
                     of marginalized African children. 
                     Of the 1,324 liberated minors who entered guardianship in Saint-Louis from 1895 to 1910, for example, at 
                     least 114 of them took on another name at some point, a fact that raises interesting
                     questions about naming, name 
                     changes, and agency. I argue that names contain fragmentary evidence about their bearers'
                     cultural or linguistic 
                     background or geographic origin, and, more importantly, that aliases can offer insight
                     into social networks or 
                     self-fashioning. Yet reproducing names from colonial inventories in digital history
                     projects could reinscribe oppression 
                     and violence and, in some circumstances, could contribute to stigma and shame among
                     descended communities. As such, 
                     scholars should include them in databases and other digital history projects, but
                     only if ethical concerns can be 
                     addressed and resolved.

                     information about formerly enslaved 
                     children in early colonial Senegal based on data originally collected in the early twentieth century, and 
                     it uses the database to ask both historical and ethical questions about naming practices
                     and aliases, experiences of 
                     unfreedom, and the agency of marginalized African children. Derived from records related
                     to the guardianship of 
                     so-called liberated minors — children who, without their parents, sought official
                     recognition of their freedom in the 
                     decades after the French emancipation law of 1848 went into effect in Senegal — this data consists of 
                     children's names, approximate ages at liberation, gender, and regions of origin, along
                     with other information, including 
                     names of parents (if known) and names and occupations of guardians. This article highlights
                     the significance of naming 
                     in the archival record, suggesting that children's names and their name changes or
                     aliases offer insight into certain 
                     aspects of their identity and allow informed speculation about some of their experiences
                     under guardianship while also 
                     raising ethical questions.

                  <div class="ptext" id="p2">Efficient and thorough analysis of these records requires the use of digital tools
                     and, most particularly, a database 
                     created from the original guardianship records. There are compelling reasons to make
                     such a database widely and freely 
                     available. Importantly, a database derived from these data would shed light on a population
                     — African children — that 
                     has often been obscured by or absent from written records. Scholars and students could
                     use the data to examine trends 
                     in child slavery and liberation in nineteenth-century Senegal, identifying patterns in gender and age, 
                     much like Goodwin et al. have done with the much larger Senegal Liberation Registers database 
                     [<a class="ref" href="#goodwin_etal2021">Goodwin et al. 2021</a>]. They could also use such a database to study social networks in urban 
                     Senegal, by paying particular attention to data on the members of prominent families who
                     served as 
                     guardians, or to explore questions about child labor, particularly domestic service,
                     or urban poverty. In addition to 
                     scholars and students, broader publics, especially Senegalese people living in their
                     country or in the diaspora, could 
                     engage with a database by contributing additional data or interpretations and thereby
                     shaping the production of history, 
                     conducting genealogical research, or by learning more about slavery and emancipation
                     in West Africa. As a 
                     public-facing database that would feature named individuals and bits of information
                     about their lives, this project 
                     would join other digital history projects on slavery in the Atlantic world (such as
                     LiberatedAfricans.org, 
                     SlaveVoyages.org, or the many datasets and projects within Enslaved.org) in honoring
                     those who experienced enslavement, 
                     emphasizing their individuality and humanity and even telling their stories [<a class="ref" href="#araujo2021">Araujo 2021</a>, 39–40].

                  <div class="counter"><a href="#p3">3</a></div>
                  <div class="ptext" id="p3">Yet, as Risam has pointed out, there is danger in replicating the colonial archive in digital form,
                     since 
                     this can reinscribe colonial power structures and knowledge hierarchies [<a class="ref" href="#risam2018">Risam 2018</a>, 47–50]. Perhaps 
                     more importantly for these records, their sensitive nature (names of formerly enslaved
                     people) and the particular 
                     context in which they were produced (Senegal, where descent from enslaved people can result in stigma) 
                     raise important ethical questions about whether names should be shared, questions
                     that are complicated by the fact that 
                     important lines of inquiry hinge upon tracing and interpreting names and name changes
                     themselves. Using an early 
                     prototype of my guardianship database — which currently is not public-facing — I think
                     through what names might teach 
                     us and some of the ethical considerations around using them. I argue that names contain
                     fragmentary evidence about 
                     their bearers' cultural or linguistic background or geographic origin, and, more importantly,
                     that aliases can offer 
                     insight into social networks and self-fashioning. As such, scholars should include
                     names in databases and other digital 
                     history projects, but only if ethical concerns can be addressed and resolved.

                  <div class="ptext" id="p4">After the 1848 French emancipation law came into effect in Senegal, officials worried that recently freed 
                     children, especially those without parents, might threaten stability and economic
                     productivity in the colony. The 
                     French administration responded in April 1849 by establishing a system of guardianship
                     for these liberated minors, 
                     entrusting them to local notables who took on responsibility for liberated minors'
                     well-being and education or training 
                     in return for rights to their labor. During the decades that followed, a significant
                     number of unaccompanied minors were 
                     among the 28,930 enslaved people who left their enslavers in areas where slavery remained
                     legal to seek recognition of 
                     their freedom in Saint-Louis, Dakar and other towns and outposts under direct French control. 
                     Officials thus relied on the guardianship system to ensure basic maintenance and training
                     for these children. Still 
                     more children entered guardianship as victims of trafficking, as slave traders used
                     the system to obscure an illegal 
                     trade in enslaved children into the colonial capital and other towns.<a class="noteRef" href="#d4e247">[1]</a> It is 
                     difficult to quantify the total number of children who entered guardianship, but Martin Klein has estimated 
                     that 1,019 children entered the system from 1872 to 1885, and I have identified over
                     five hundred children recorded 
                     between 1849 and 1874 and at least 1,620 recorded from 1895 to 1911, when the practice
                     seems to have ended 
                     (M3, ANS; [<a class="ref" href="#dukebryant2019a">Duke Bryant 2019a</a>]).<a class="noteRef" href="#d4e274">[2]</a>

                  <div class="ptext" id="p5">From its creation in 1849 until its disappearance sometime in the 1910s, guardianship
                     generated records — in varying 
                     degrees of detail and at a range of intervals (and sometimes with years-long gaps)
                     — about the children it was meant to 
                     supervise. At a minimum, these records consisted of the names of children and their
                     guardians and basic demographics, 
                     since officials needed this information as they tried to administer the colony with
                     the trappings of modern bureaucracy. 
                     For a little over a decade, guardianship councils in both Saint-Louis and in Gorée worked to 
                     identify unaccompanied minors — not only those who had officially received liberation
                     from slavery, but also orphans 
                     and abandoned children — and to select their guardians. Instructed to submit an annual
                     report to the governor each 
                     year, the president of the guardianship council, a position assigned to the assistant
                     mayor in each town, would have 
                     needed to keep track of these children. There is some evidence in Senegal's archives that Mr. 
                     Hericé, president of the Saint-Louis guardianship council from 1849 to 1855, made at least a 
                     half-hearted effort to do this during his first few years in the role. An 1857 reform
                     required the presidents of the 
                     councils to collect specific information, enter it into a register, and publish it
                     in the official newspaper, the 
                     <cite class="title italic">Moniteur du Sénégal</cite>. Another reform in 1862 dissolved the councils altogether, giving the 
                     head of the judicial service responsibility for placements, oversight, and maintaining
                     records, with the help of 
                     auxiliaries in Gorée and certain French posts. Although Frédéric Carrère seems to have 
                     produced copious documentation of guardianship during his tenure as head of the judicial
                     service in the 1850s and 1860s, 
                     a series of his successors fell short in their record-keeping duties, as the lieutenant
                     governor complained in 1903 and 
                     as research in Senegal's archives today will confirm.<a class="noteRef" href="#d4e302">[3]</a> I have not located any records for Gorée during this period 
                     (Arrêté, 13 Apr. 1849, M3, ANS; [<a class="ref" href="#moitt2011">Moitt 2011</a>]; [<a class="ref" href="#moitt2024">Moitt 2024</a>]).

                  <div class="ptext" id="p6">In the early twentieth century, in the context of France's increasing discomfort with domestic slave 
                     trading and slavery itself in French West Africa, Lieutenant Governor Camille Guy and 
                     Governor General Ernest Roume undertook an investigation of guardianship. It was an open secret that many 
                     notables had abused guardianship, which had long functioned as a cover for a continued
                     trade in enslaved children to 
                     French-controlled territories. Once trafficked, these children could be “liberated”, entrusted to a guardian, and 
                     then required to work for their keep. Guy argued that a long history of poor record-keeping had hamstrung 
                     oversight and allowed this exploitation, and Roume seemed to agree. Indeed, in two reforms of guardianship 
                     in 1903 and 1904, Roume sought to address abuses by improving the state's knowledge of and surveillance 
                     over liberated minors, a responsibility he delegated to newly created guardianship

                     each meeting so that their health, living circumstances, and status as a minor could
                     be ascertained and documented. The 
                     Saint-Louis commission functioned regularly from 1904 until at least 1910, producing fascinating
                     and 
                     occasionally rich documentation of guardianship in its final years. The commission
                     in Dakar likewise left 
                     some records, as did the <span class="foreign i">cercle</span> commandants who supervised guardianship in places like 
                     Podor, Kaolack, Dagana, and Kedougou

                     these years form the core data sets

                     attempted to track down all liberated 
                     minors who had entered guardianship since 1895 and update their information or — if
                     they had reached majority, married, 
                     had a child, or died — remove them from guardianship. Seventy pages long, the register

                     a member of the administration or 
                     guardianship commission — for at least 375 children, thanks to the existence of additional
                     source material and, most 
                     usefully, a series of lists entitled something like this: “Inventory

                     established by the 30 November 1903 ordinance for the surveillance and protection

                     presence, along with the material and moral situation during the month of [MONTH 19__]”. The archive contains at 
                     least twenty-nine such lists recorded at monthly and then quarterly meetings held
                     in Saint-Louis from 
                     October 1904 through November 1910. Each list includes names of and information about
                     the 41 to 70 liberated minors 
                     whose guardians responded to a summons and appeared, with the minor in question, before
                     the guardianship commission for 
                     evaluation. The commission filled out hand-drawn standardized tables for the first
                     few years but switched to a 
                     machine-printed version in 1906 and 1907; the tables essentially copied the column
                     headings used in the register 
                     described above, meaning that there is considerable consistency in the approach to
                     recording data.<a class="noteRef" href="#d4e384">[5]</a> This feature of the data, which allows 
                     scholars to follow some liberated minors over a decade or longer and to sketch stories
                     about their lives, makes it 
                     particularly useful to scholars of childhood and of post-emancipation societies, and
                     it sets this dataset apart from 
                     many digital history projects in a similar vein (such as those that make up Enslaved.org)
                     which aggregate data 
                     generated in single encounters.

                     are in good condition, the

                     with African names, recorded 
                     them using phonetic spellings and likely did so with at least some variation, which
                     researchers must try to identify and 
                     address. Indeed, although the association of each person with an order-number was
                     meant to promote accuracy and 
                     consistency in the register and inventories, researchers could easily reproduce errors

                     commission or administration, or introduce new errors related to readability or other
                     difficulties with the documents. 
                     Even so, the dataset has remarkable potential to reveal certain details about children's
                     lives and experiences in 
                     post-emancipation Senegal and their encounters with the colonial state through the guardianship system.

                     (Microsoft Excel and Google 
                     Sheets), I reproduced some organizational elements from the original register and
                     inventories, but also added numerous 
                     fields that allowed me to combine information from multiple sources and to track certain
                     details that helped me answer 
                     specific research questions about children's everyday lives. The case in my database
                     is the individual liberated minor, 
                     and I included every name I found as I conducted research across at least nine dossiers
                     in Senegal's 
                     archives and in published sources (i.e., this is not a subset of a larger record).
                     Thus, as in the original documents, 
                     there are columns corresponding to each minor's date of liberation, name (separated
                     into given and family name), 
                     birthplace, age at liberation, details about their guardian, and observations. To
                     this, I added fields where I could 
                     record information about subsequent guardians (since many liberated minors were reassigned
                     at some point), and dates of 
                     subsequent appearances before the surveillance commission along with additional observations
                     made at those appearances. 
                     I also inserted fields to track information that I generated through interpretation,
                     including whether minors were male 
                     or female, were returned for reassignment, ran away, reached majority, had a baby,
                     married, were sent to prison, 
                     traveled to France with a guardian, received an apprenticeship, died, or — most important for this 
                     essay — used an alias or changed their name. Children who entered guardianship before
                     1895 are not currently part of 
                     this database because officials kept records very differently in the early period.
                     Performing more interpretive work on 
                     the records from 1849 to 1874 and adding at least one field to track children's status
                     (liberated minor, “free”, 
                     apprentice, orphan, etc.), would allow me to include even more records in the future.

                     I think they, and the database they

                     digital humanities project, I 
                     would need to complete a number of tasks related to digital data generation and organization:
                     cleaning up existing data, 
                     exploring options for more user-friendly software, and developing a comprehensive
                     metadata application profile, to name 
                     a few. I would also need to revisit the research and interpretation, preferably with
                     a research team well-versed in the 
                     French language and in Senegalese naming conventions, to better address the handwriting
                     difficulties and phonetic 
                     spellings mentioned above, to develop best practices for representing marginalia and
                     markings added by officials who 
                     reviewed these records, and to establish a method for cross-referencing other kinds
                     of documents (such as letters or 
                     reports) in which names from the database appear. The most important challenge, however,
                     and the issue I explore in the 
                     rest of this essay, relates to ethics — namely the ethics of making public the names
                     of children who were once 
                     enslaved.

                     names of 
                     other people who were or who became important to them. These <em class="emph">specific</em> names are valuable data in and of 
                     themselves, since analysis of their geographic or linguistic origins or their appearance
                     across multiple sources could 
                     offer insight into the demographics of post-emancipation Senegal, social networks and connections in 
                     specific urban areas, and other themes. Name changes or aliases captured in the documentation
                     could, as I suggest in 
                     the following section, raise questions about what prompted them and open new avenues
                     to consider children's actions and 
                     experiences.<a class="noteRef" href="#d4e426">[6]</a> The inclusion of names can also work as commemoration, by 
                     naming people who were previously nameless in our historical accounts and in official
                     public memory 
                     [<a class="ref" href="#araujo2021">Araujo 2021</a>, 39–40]. Yet although digitizing these names could support scholarly endeavors and 
                     activists working among people with slave ancestry, making them publicly available
                     could also subject descended 
                     communities to shame, discrimination, or other harms given the continued stigma of
                     slave descent found in many 
                     West African communities. After an exploration of one line of historical inquiry about
                     names in Senegal — 
                     the use of aliases by liberated minors — which illustrates some of the benefits accrued
                     to historical knowledge by 
                     naming names, I reflect on some of the ethical issues that would emerge were I to
                     make my database public.

                     personhood, claims to memory, or 
                     indicators of identity or origin. As Pier Larson pointed out in an essay on narratives of enslavement by 
                     Africans enslaved as children, narrators often remembered their parents and homes
                     and could sometimes name them 
                     [<a class="ref" href="#larson2008">Larson 2008</a>]. Goodwin et al. make a similar point in their analysis of the 
                     Senegal slave liberation registers, noting that fifty-two percent of “unaccompanied 
                     minors” were able to state both parents' names at liberation [<a class="ref" href="#goodwin_etal2021">Goodwin et al. 2021</a>]. This adds nuance 
                     to Orlando Patterson's argument that slavery produced “social death”, by 
                     emphasizing the importance of the memory of kin and community [<a class="ref" href="#patterson1982">Patterson 1982</a>]. Given that the information 
                     included in the guardianship records seems to have been collected from formerly enslaved
                     children themselves, the 
                     entries can allow some insight into what — and who — these children remembered and
                     how they identified themselves. 
                     To explore these themes, users of a digital history project would need to access the
                     names as they appeared in the 
                     documents.

                  <div class="ptext" id="p15">My liberated minors database revealed that name changes or aliases were strikingly
                     common in this population, since 
                     records for at least 114 of the 1324 Saint-Louis liberated minors included one. Indicated with 
                     “dit” or “dite ”(i.e., 
                     “known as”) before the new name, none of the records indicate who chose the alias or who 
                     decided to notify the guardianship council of its use, and the timing of their introduction
                     into the records varied. 
                     The May 1904 register of liberated minors includes approximately thirty records that
                     mention an alias, suggesting that 
                     the child was already using the name when the register was compiled (Liste des mineurs…,

                     Liberated Minors Database). Other aliases were introduced into the records later —
                     sometimes only after the child had 
                     appeared before the commission several times. Given that naming and renaming was an
                     act of power or empowerment, 
                     claimed by enslavers and often reclaimed by emancipated people, the introduction of
                     aliases into the guardianship 
                     council records raises questions about power, agency, and identity. Especially when
                     combined with other sources related 
                     to guardianship, these records provide hints of what might have been formerly enslaved
                     children's strategies to reclaim 
                     names and possibly also identities.

                     <span class="foreign i">métis</span> guardians were known by African or Muslim names. These trends prompt questions 
                     about who selected the aliases and why. Did French guardians assign French names as
                     an indication of the power they 
                     held over liberated minors, thus continuing the naming practices we associate with
                     slavery? Did they choose French names 
                     for their wards because they did not care to learn to pronounce or to have to remember
                     African names? Could the decision 
                     have represented an effort to promote assimilation or inclusion within the household?
                     We could pose similar questions 
                     about aliases that originated in the region or were linked to Islam. Did African guardians
                     choose aliases with local 
                     significance to assert control over wards whose names suggested foreign origins and
                     ethnicities (such as Bambara)? Or 
                     did they do so as a sign of affection, assimilation, or inclusion? Were liberated
                     minors placed with Wolof guardians, 
                     for example, more likely to use Wolof aliases? Regarding <em class="emph">all</em> name changes, is it possible that the 
                     children themselves initiated them? Could the use of an alias have been a strategy
                     for obscuring their past and 
                     avoiding stigma? Could it perhaps represent affection or belonging?

                  <div class="ptext" id="p17">As noted above, the records suggest that many liberated minors began using an alias
                     at some point long after their 
                     liberation and after their first appearance before the guardianship commission, though
                     the later introduction of an 
                     alias could simply reflect council members' efforts to correct wrong or incomplete
                     records. For example, young 
                     Souvergné, thought to be five at the time of her liberation on 20 September 1898, appeared
                     at least twice 
                     in the registers of the Saint-Louis guardianship commission — in May 1904 and July
                     1905 — without an alias. Her entry 
                     for September 1906, however, indicated that she was now “called Aram”. Her 
                     guardian, M. Boubou, a court orderly, and his wife, Mme. Boubou (who became 
                     Souvergné/Aram's official guardian in March 1900), may have been 
                     <span class="foreign i">métis</span>, since Africans were not usually assigned these titles of respect (Monsieur and 
                     Madame) in the registers. The alias, Aram, appears to derive from an Arabic/Muslim name, raising the 
                     question of whether Souvergné/Aram selected the name herself, or whether her guardians 
                     assigned it to her. By 1907, she had had a baby, and the register indicated that her
                     name should be stricken from the 
                     list of those under guardianship. This final reference to her did not include “dite 
                     Aram” (this is atypical, since for most other liberated minors who took on aliases, each
                     subsequent 
                     entry repeated the “dit” or “dite” 
                     language) (Liberated Minors Database). Might this indicate that she stopped using
                     the name after having her baby, or 
                     that she planned to stop using it when removed from guardianship? Of course, these
                     questions cannot be definitively 
                     answered by these sources alone, but they move us forward by encouraging us to ask
                     them.

                  <div class="ptext" id="p18">Although most aliases consisted only of a first name (<span class="foreign i">prénom</span>), a few records include 
                     alternative first and surnames, sometimes the family name of the liberated minor's
                     guardian. For example, on 2 August 
                     1898, authorities recognized the liberty of a young girl who had come from “the 
                     Bambaras” and was estimated to be five years old, recording her name as Nanténé. It 
                     appears that the girl continued to go by Nanténé for her first nine or ten years as the ward of 
                     Coumba M'Bissine Gueye, a laundress in N'Dar Toute. Records of her appearance in April 1905 
                     before the Saint-Louis commission indicate only that she was “well-kept and 
                     happy” and say nothing about an alias. But the next time she appeared in the commission's
                     records, in October 
                     1906, a note added to the “observation” column indicated that she went by the name of 
                     Séga. This alias and a notation that she was doing fine appeared in the five additional
                     entries recorded 
                     in 1907, 1908, and 1909, and the fourth-quarter entry for 1909 indicated that she
                     achieved majority by virtue of having 
                     had a child. Before her removal from guardianship, however, Nanténé/Séga had begun 
                     complaining (along with some other liberated minors and guardians) about the frequency
                     with which she had to come before 
                     the commission, and in September 1909, she submitted a letter to the commission to
                     this effect. Strikingly, the letter 
                     gave her name as “Siga Gueye, daughter of Mme. Koumba Mbisine” and 
                     referred to her guardian as her “mother” (Liberated Minors Database; 17 Sep. 1909,

                     circumstances surrounding the creation of this letter. Yet the incorporation of the
                     guardian's surname into the 
                     liberated minor's alias raises the question of whether this reflected fictive kinship
                     between 
                     Nanténé/Séga and her guardian, the guardian's claim to rights in the girl, or something else 
                     entirely.

                     commissioners reported that she was doing well and appeared to be twelve or thirteen
                     years old, but they made no note 
                     of an alias or name change. In their next record, however, dated November 1906, commissioners
                     wrote that she was 
                     “called Fanny”, and this alias appeared in six of the other seven entries 
                     recorded through 1910 (Liberated Minors Database). Yet other correspondence, generated
                     outside the space of the 
                     commission, suggests that she continued to be called Boyerika.

                     Boyerika's case is particularly interesting, because of both the variation in how the commissioner
                     
                     referred to her and the news he learned about her. She appeared on the lieutenant

                     the first part of the commissioner's comments repeated this formulation. Limalé Diop, he wrote, claimed 
                     that she had given the summons to “the minor Bayérika

                     her name differently as he summarized the justification she had provided: “Bayérika

                     (at least those who were

                     constellation of documents offers glimpses of some of the ways marginalized people
                     may have engaged in self-fashioning 
                     and encourages us to take names and naming seriously, as a possible method of not
                     only restoring names of enslaved 
                     people to history, but also learning about how they may have shaped their daily lives.
                     Indeed, the specifics of names 
                     and name changes — their association with a particular ethnicity, religion, region,
                     or community; their commonality as 
                     chosen nicknames, and so on — are datapoints that we can use as we try to better understand
                     ordinary experiences in 
                     early twentieth-century Senegal. Attention to names and aliases might also lead us to consider how people 
                     navigated a colonial regime that valued fixed and recorded identities. In these ways,
                     the specificity of names, whether 
                     given, inherited, selected, or imposed, can be central to a historical methodology
                     and would need to be known to the 
                     researcher to be used as such. This aspect of my database and analysis — which tracks
                     multiple contacts between 
                     individual formerly enslaved children and representatives of the state over time and
                     which takes seriously shifts in 
                     how the names were recorded — might serve as a model to others working on similar
                     kinds of digital history projects.

                     enslaved people in West 
                     Africa. It is well known that stigma associated with enslaved ancestry can affect people's
                     status, marriage 
                     prospects, and access to resources, and that it may drive them to remain in patronage
                     relationships. Scholars have 
                     explored some of the ways that descendants of enslaved people in West Africa have tried to improve their 
                     status — by hiding their enslaved origins, seeking to rehabilitate them, or renegotiating
                     relationships with former 
                     enslavers or patrons [<a class="ref" href="#klein1998">Klein 1998</a>] [<a class="ref" href="#klein2009">Klein 2009</a>] [<a class="ref" href="#rossi2009">Rossi 2009</a>] 
                     [<a class="ref" href="#schmitz2009">Schmitz 2009</a>]. Digital humanities projects that provide searchable databases of names of the (formerly)
                     
                     enslaved might facilitate these efforts of rehabilitation or might assist in people's
                     efforts to trace family history, 
                     but they could also have the unfortunate and unintended consequence of reinforcing
                     stigma or revealing descendants' 
                     previously hidden origins in slavery. Yet on the other hand, Lotte Pelckmans has found that some Ful'be 
                     living in contemporary Mali have sought to obscure enslaved ancestry partly by changing their names, 
                     suggesting that a project like mine could provide useful information about historical

                     questions related to knowledge production and reproduction. Because it would bring
                     names of formerly enslaved people 
                     into an online public space, we could view such a digital database as a monument to
                     those who were enslaved, a virtual 
                     “‘wall of names’” that could, if done right, help 
                     “rehumanize” enslaved people by naming them and providing biographical information about 
                     them. In this way, it could contribute to the project of “recovery” that Kim 
                     Gallon positions as a central concern of Black digital humanities. But, to extend to the
                     digital arena, 
                     Ana Lucia Araujo's critique of the lists of names of enslaved people that appear in many physical
                     sites 
                     memorializing slavery, a database would fail to achieve this if it presented only
                     names and skeletal information and 
                     if descendants of the people named were not involved. Indeed, as Araujo and others point out, most 
                     records pertaining to slavery (and by extension, to recognition of individuals' emancipation),
                     such as plantation 
                     inventories, bills of sale, ship logs, and insurance records, represent the perspectives
                     of enslavers and slave 
                     traders [<a class="ref" href="#araujo2021">Araujo 2021</a>, 39–40, 52–67] [<a class="ref" href="#gallon2016">Gallon 2016</a>]. The case I focus on here is a 
                     little different, since these records were produced not by enslavers but by colonial
                     officials tasked with recognizing 
                     liberation from slavery in an orderly way. But the fact that French officials pitched
                     better record-keeping as a key 
                     strategy to reform guardianship in 1903 and 1904 underscores the extent to which they
                     viewed collection of data as a 
                     technique of governance and colonial power. Thus, the information they collected reflected
                     colonial preoccupations, as 
                     did its organization and preservation, and uncritical replication of it could reinscribe
                     colonial power structures.

                     to the 
                     digital humanities, Roopika Risam calls upon scholars to work in a way that avoids merely replicating 
                     colonial archives — and therefore the “epistemic violence” of continued omission and 
                     marginalization — in digital form [<a class="ref" href="#risam2018">Risam 2018</a>, 56–60]. Postcolonial digital archives, she suggests, 
                     can become projects that invite users to draw on their own knowledge and resources
                     while engaging with content in 
                     innovative ways, perhaps by contributing annotations, suggesting alternative organizational
                     frameworks, tagging 
                     materials, or identifying related content. She also suggests that deeply engaged tagging
                     and cross-referencing — of 
                     complete sources and, when possible, the component parts of longer sources — might
                     allow people to make new 
                     connections between items cataloged in different files or held in different archives.
                     Projects might even incorporate 
                     digitization of items from private collections or museums, or they might rely on cultural
                     knowledge — solicited, 
                     freely given, and acknowledged — of people living in the places under study to interpret
                     or explain records in a

                     news outlets, public intellectuals, and members of the Senegalese public have engaged
                     in rigorous debate in recent 
                     decades about history and memory of the slave trade, but this debate has not centered
                     on the issue of whether and how 
                     to memorialize named victims of slavery or the slave trade, or whether such marginalized
                     people should be named in print 
                     or online. Instead, it has considered the meaning and symbolism of a UNESCO World
                     Heritage Site on Gorée 
                     Island, the <span class="foreign i">Maison des Esclaves</span> (Slave House), juxtaposing its importance as a 
                     site of memory of the slave trade with the history of the transatlantic slave trade,
                     in which the Maison figured 
                     minimally if at all. The debate has also positioned Africans only or mostly as victims
                     of the slave trade and has paid 
                     little or no attention to the internal slave trade, to the existence of African traders,
                     or to the incidence of slavery 
                     within Senegal. This is due, Cheikh Sene notes in a recent article, to the shame associated 
                     not only with enslaved ancestry but also with descent from slave traders, and to the
                     intentional “forgetting” that 
                     has primed closer connections with the African diaspora and elevated Gorée in tourist circuits

                     Are they simply focused on other issues, or would they find such a database offensive
                     or painful? Would they engage or 
                     contribute to a crowdsourcing effort, when invited? Before moving forward with any
                     plans, I would need to partner with 
                     Senegalese scholars who could help ensure cultural appropriateness and sensitivity
                     and who could assist with community

                  <div class="ptext" id="p29">This essay has offered a reflection on what (digital) historians and those who engage
                     with their work might gain from 
                     naming names of formerly enslaved people in digital history projects, and on the ethical
                     issues that might give them 
                     pause about revealing names. Using several examples from a database of formerly enslaved
                     children in 
                     Senegal, it shows that names and name changes — aliases — can carry fragments of information
                     about 
                     children's life experiences, backgrounds, and social ties. Though the names lead to
                     more questions than answers, they 
                     are useful datapoints, especially given that we know comparatively little about the
                     daily lives of enslaved and recently 
                     emancipated children in African history. If recorded names were replaced by pseudonyms
                     or codes — approaches commonly 
                     used to protect research subjects' identities and safeguard their interests — researchers
                     would not be able to 
                     duplicate the sort of analysis that I offer above.

                  <div class="ptext" id="p30">Using real names in an effective digital history framework with well-chosen tagging
                     can also enable cross-referencing, 
                     allowing users to make connections between sources found in disparate parts of an
                     archive or perhaps in different 
                     archives altogether, much like I was able to do in the case of Boyerika discussed above. The recurrence 
                     of some of these names across multiple inventories leads to a unique aspect of this
                     database: namely, that it indexes 
                     fragments of individual children's lives derived from repeated appearances before
                     the guardianship commission, allowing 
                     scholars to trace changes or continuities over time. And further, by connecting names
                     of at least some formerly enslaved 
                     people to documents that reveal other aspects of their stories, whether it was the
                     relationship cultivated with their 
                     guardian or another person, the neighborhood in which they lived, the work they performed,
                     or something else about them, 
                     we can move beyond the “wall of names” approach that Araujo rightfully calls 
                     into question. Effective digital repositories would allow users to make these kinds
                     of connections more easily and 
                     would also provide context, analysis, and stories that go beyond the names. In addition,
                     by inviting users not only to 
                     read content, but also to interact with it, contributing their own stories, reactions,
                     or analysis, a digital 
                     repository based on guardianship records could adopt an inclusive post-colonial stance.
                     Such a dynamic collaborative 
                     project could also help activists, historians, and others respond to the need to remember
                     domestic slavery in 
                     West Africa as a means of breaking through stigma and allowing people of enslaved descent to
                     reclaim 
                     identities, as Eric Hahonou and Lotte Pelckmans advocate

                     however. Since enslaved 
                     ancestry carries stigma in many West African societies still today, scholars need
                     to consider whether a public-facing 
                     digital database could be used to connect contemporary West Africans to enslaved ancestors
                     and how this might affect 
                     people today. Thus, any public database or other digital history project that includes
                     names of enslaved or formerly 
                     enslaved people in West Africa must be done in close cooperation with partners in the region to minimize 
                     the possibility of stigma or other harm, to promote cultural sensitivity, and to work
                     toward decolonizing digital 
                     history. Such a project could democratize access to the information, allow others
                     to engage in related research, and 
                     contribute to the important work of highlighting Black histories in digital spaces.
                     Perhaps most importantly, if 
                     ethical concerns can be resolved in collaboration with local partners, names offer
                     potentially rich insights into 
                     moments in ordinary — even marginalized — people's lives and digital tools allow us
                     more effectively to trace and 
                     connect the fragments.

                     on their ongoing digital humanities project utilizing the Senegal Liberation Registers.
                     Furthermore, 
                     Goodwin et al. found that “unaccompanied minors” accounted for 16% of all people 
                     seeking liberation from 1894 to 1903, the period with the richest data [<a class="ref" href="#goodwin_etal2021">Goodwin et al. 2021</a>].</span></div>
               <div class="endnote" id="d4e274"><span class="noteRef lang en">[2] The guardianship registers for the earlier period (1849 to 1874) 
                     include children with a wider range of identities and social positions — orphans,
                     apprentices, and liberated minors — 
                     and it is often very difficult to determine an individual's status based on the information
                     given. My numbers for the 
                     earlier period are therefore necessarily estimates. The Archives Nationales du Sénégal catalogs do not 
                     include guardianship registers for 1874 to 1895, which may mean that they were not
                     preserved.</span></div>
               <div class="endnote" id="d4e302"><span class="noteRef lang en">[3] While the records for this period include one 
                     list of liberated minors, organized alphabetically by name, which was meant to include
                     everyone who entered guardianship 
                     prior to 1864, most of the records were organized by date or by claim (<em class="term">reclamation</em>, i.e., a request made 
                     by a resident to obtain guardianship over a child or to arrange apprenticeship, a
                     complaint about a ward, a change in 
                     guardianship, etc.). See file M3, ANS.</span></div>
               <div class="endnote" id="d4e365"><span class="noteRef lang en">[4] The full title of this document is “Liste des mineurs délivrés de la captivité 
                     et confiés à la tutelle de M. le Procureur Général, Chef du Service Judiciaire depuis
                     l'année 1895”. There were 
                     only 24 minors with liberation dates in 1904, since the program was on its way out
                     by then; the number of children 
                     entering guardianship in the other years ranges from a low of 166 in 1899 to a peak
                     of 199 in 1896.</span></div>
               <div class="endnote" id="d4e384"><span class="noteRef lang en">[5] These 
                     “inventories” are found in the following files in the Archives Nationales du Sénégal (ANS): H(S)173, 
                     H(S)174, H(S)176, H(S)177, and H(S)178; the initial census of liberated minors, conducted
                     in May 1904, is in H(S)173. 
                     Other sorts of documents in these files and in H(S)175, H(S)206, 1F1, and K23 provide
                     additional qualitative data about 
                     specific liberated minors and are incorporated into the database as well.</span></div>

                     persons in Jamaica through careful analysis of inventories and lists of names 
                     [<a class="ref" href="#williamson2017">Williamson 2017</a>]. She suggests, much like I do below, that the use of certain kinds of names may have
                     
                     resulted from agency on the part of enslaved people.</span></div>
               <div class="endnote" id="d4e583"><span class="noteRef lang en">[7] “Boyerika” appears numerous times in the guardianship registers in 
                     this form, though I think it is more likely to be a combination of two or more shorter
                     names. One possibility is that 
                     the final syllable, “ka”, was the surname Ka or Kâ, a common name 
                     in the region associated with Peul people. “Boye” is a Peul given name meaning long awaited, 
                     and I am unsure what to make of the middle “ri” syllable in this rendering. See
