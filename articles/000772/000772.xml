            <head>Guardianship and Colonial Record-Keeping</head>
            <p>From 1849 to 1862, appointed guardianship councils were responsible for identifying formerly enslaved children in Saint-Louis and Gorée, Senegal, placing them with local notables, and ensuring some supervision over their placements. Instructed to submit an annual report to the governor each year, the councils would have needed to keep track of liberated minors and their placements, and there is some evidence in Senegal’s archives that the Saint-Louis council made at least a half-hearted effort to do this. An 1857 reform required additional record-keeping, instructing the presidents of the councils to collect specific information, enter it into a register, and publish it in the official newspaper, the <hi rend="italic">Moniteur du Sénégal. </hi>Another reform in 1862 dissolved the councils altogether, giving the head of the judicial service responsibility for placements, oversight, and maintaining records, with the help of auxiliaries in Gorée and certain French posts. Yet, as the lieutenant governor complained in 1903 and as research in Senegal’s archives today will confirm, a series of judicial service heads fell short in their duties to maintain records, and they likely lost track of many of the children in the process (Arrêté, 13 Apr. 1849, M3, ANS; Moitt 2011).</p>
            <p>In the early twentieth century, in the context of France’s increasing discomfort with domestic slave trading and slavery itself in French West Africa, Lieutenant Governor Camille Guy and Governor General Ernest Roume undertook an investigation of guardianship. It was an open secret that many notables had abused guardianship, which had long functioned as a cover for a continued trade in enslaved children to French-controlled territories. Once trafficked, these children could be “liberated,” entrusted to a guardian, and then required to work for their keep. Guy argued that a long history of poor record-keeping had hamstrung oversight and allowed this exploitation, and Roume seemed to agree. Indeed, in two reforms of guardianship in 1903 and 1904, Roume sought to address abuses by improving the state’s knowledge of and surveillance over liberated minors, a responsibility he delegated to the new guardianship surveillance commissions (Lieutenant Gouverneur to Gouverneur Général, 4 May 1904, K23, ANS; Arrêté, 24 Nov. 1903, SEN/XIV/28bis, ANOM; Duke Bryant 2020).</p>
            <p>The commissions’ first task, undertaken in 1904, was to track down all the liberated minors entrusted to guardians since 1895, to update and correct their records, and to take note of their current situation. After that, commissions were to convene — first monthly, and then on a quarterly basis — summoning dozens of liberated minors to appear at each meeting so that their health, living circumstances, and status as a minor could be ascertained and documented. The Saint-Louis commission functioned regularly from 1904 until at least 1910, producing fascinating and occasionally rich documentation of guardianship in its final years. The commission in Dakar likewise left some records, as did the <hi rend="italic">cercle </hi>commandants who supervised guardianship in places like Podor, Kaolack, Dagana, or Kedougou (Duke Bryant 2019). I have used these records, supplemented by correspondence, police reports, and other documents, to create a database on guardianship after 1895. The database includes names of over 1620 liberated minors (1324 of them in Saint-Louis), basic information about them, and, sometimes, the commissions’ observations.<note> The data comes from documents found in the following dossiers, held by the Archives Nationales du Sénégal:  H173, H174, H175, H176, H177, H178, H206, 1F1, and K23. Future references to the database use this abbreviation: Author-Database.</note> The question of whether to make it — and the original sources from which it derives — digital, accessible, and searchable raises important ethical and methodological questions, to which I now turn. </p>

            <head>Colonial Records and Post-Colonial Analysis: Names in Analog and Digital Histories </head>
            <p>The fact that Guy and Roume turned to the activity of maintaining good records as a strategy in reforming guardianship underscores the extent to which officials viewed collection of data as a technique of governance and colonial power. Indeed, on one hand, the guardianship records allowed the state to track, document, and attempt to exert control over particularly marginalized people; while on the other, they were evidence bolstering the French state’s claims, necessitated by domestic and international pressure, that it was a humane imperial power.  Officials and their auxiliaries collected information to support colonial goals, made decisions about it that reflected colonial assumptions, and organized it according to colonial logics. The records were thus deeply implicated in the functioning of the state. Furthermore, the fact that they were preserved, incorporated into the colonial archive, and included in a finding aid reflects not only colonial and postcolonial archiving conventions, but also the personal knowledge, interests, and biases of individual archivists who processed the records. Scholars can respond to these sets of constraints by adopting an expansive approach to archival work, reading sources against the grain, and asking questions that the data was not necessarily intended to address (Stoler 2009; Burton 2005; Donlon 2021). While digital history tools might help overcome some of the limitations of an individual researcher, by, for example, enabling scholars to search or cross reference immense quantities of data very quickly, a decision to digitize records and move this sort of data online raises additional ethical questions and considerations.</p>
            <p>Digital history projects encourage much wider circulation of data and analysis than traditional academic publications — this is a central goal of the digital humanities — so we therefore cannot assume that these projects provide any level of privacy, or that creators can predict who will use the information and to what end. This fact has led many digital humanists to decide against including sensitive material in publicly accessible projects, and this precedent raises questions about how to handle names of formerly enslaved people in West Africa. It is well known that stigma associated with slave ancestry can affect people’s status, marriage prospects, and access to resources, and that it may drive them to remain in patronage relationships. Scholars have explored some of the ways that descendants of enslaved people in West Africa have tried to improve their status — by hiding their slave origins, seeking to rehabilitate them, or renegotiating relationships with former masters or patrons (Klein 1998; Klein 2009; Rossi 2009; Schmitz 2009). Digital humanities projects that provide searchable databases of names of the (formerly) enslaved might facilitate these efforts of rehabilitation or might assist in people’s efforts to trace family history; but they could also have the unfortunate and unintended consequence of reinforcing stigma or revealing descendants’ previously hidden slave origins. I continue to wrestle with the question of whether it matters that my database is limited to children whose liberation received French recognition. Could their emancipated status go farther in overcoming stigma?</p>
            <p>Creating a digital history project centered on names of liberated minors in Senegal also raises ethical questions related to knowledge production and reproduction. Because it would bring names of formerly enslaved people into an online public space, we could view such a digital database as a monument to those who were enslaved, a virtual “‘wall of names’” that could, if done right, help “rehumanize” enslaved people by naming them and providing biographical information about them. In this way, it could contribute to the project of “recovery” that Kim Gallon positions as a central concern of Black digital humanities. But, to extend to the digital arena Ana Lucia Araujo’s critique of the lists of names of enslaved people that appear in many physical sites memorializing slavery, a database would fail to achieve this if it presented only names and skeletal information, and if descendants of the people named were not involved. Indeed, as Araujo and others point out (Araujo 2021, p. 39-40, 52-67; Gallon 2018), most records pertaining to slavery (and by extension, to recognition of individuals’ emancipation), such as plantation inventories, bills of sale, ship logs, and insurance records, represent the perspectives of slave owners and traders. The case I focus on here is a little different, since these records were produced not by slave owners but by colonial officials tasked with recognizing liberation from slavery in an orderly way. Thus, the information they collected reflected colonial preoccupations, as did its organization and preservation, and uncritical replication of it could reinscribe colonial power structures.</p>
            <p>In her recent book on postcolonial approaches to the digital humanities, Roopika Risam (2018, p. 56-60) proposes a way forward that avoids merely replicating colonial archives — and therefore the “epistemic violence” of continued omission and marginalization — in digital form. Postcolonial digital archives, she suggests, can become projects that invite users to draw on their own knowledge and resources while engaging with content in innovative ways, perhaps by contributing annotations, suggesting alternative organizational frameworks, tagging materials, or identifying related content. She also suggests that deeply engaged tagging and cross-referencing — of complete sources and, when possible, the component parts of longer sources — might allow people to make new connections between items cataloged in different files or held in different archives. Projects might even incorporate digitization of items from private collections or museums. Such broadening of scope can be used to democratize access and to produce new knowledge.</p>
            <p>Thus, bringing together the ethical concerns about perpetuating stigma, “outing” someone as a descendant of an enslaved person, and ensuring that our digital history projects challenge logics of slavery, colonialism, and white supremacy in the ways they present data and analysis, it seems that any way forward must do the following: 1. Involve representatives of the descended community as collaborators on the project; 2. Invite meaningful engagement and contributions from project users; and 3. Go (far) beyond simply replicating an interesting source from a colonial archive. In the remainder of the essay, I would like to explore in some detail how we might accomplish the third initiative with reference to the records on guardianship in Senegal, and at least gesture toward how we might achieve the first and second components. </p>

            <head>“Souvergné dite Aram”: Aliases and Name Changes in the Guardianship Records </head>
            <p>Names can be powerful indicators of personhood and can suggest certain identities and origins. Scholars can link names to ethnic or geographic communities, allowing for analysis — tentative and suggestive at best — of certain patterns of enslavement and liberation. Scholars can also use this information to at least gesture toward the memories that enslaved Africans carried with them.<note> Similarly, Margaret Williamson (2017) argues that scholars can learn a lot about enslaved persons in Jamaica through careful analysis of inventories and lists of names. She suggests, much like l do below, that the use of certain kinds of names may have resulted from agency on the part of enslaved people.</note> As Pier Larson (2008) pointed out in an essay on narratives of enslavement produced by Africans enslaved as children, these children often remembered their parents and homes, and could sometimes name them. Goodwin et al (2021) make a similar point in their analysis of the Senegal slave liberation registers, noting that fifty-two percent of “unaccompanied minors” were able to state both parents’ names at liberation. This adds nuance to Orlando Patterson’s (1982) argument that slavery produced “social death,” by emphasizing the importance of the memory of kin and community. Given that the information included in the guardianship records seems to have been collected from formerly enslaved children themselves, the entries can allow some insight into what — and who — these children remembered and how they identified themselves. To explore these themes, users of a digital history project would need to access the names as they appeared in the documents.</p>
            <p>Strikingly, guardianship records contain at least 114 instances of liberated minors in Saint-Louis using alternative names, or aliases (out of 1324 total records) during the period from 1904 to 1911. Naming and renaming was an act of power or empowerment, claimed by masters and often reclaimed by emancipated people (at least in the Americas). The introduction of aliases into the guardianship council records, which do not indicate <hi rend="italic">who </hi>decided on the name a liberated minor would use, raises questions about power, agency, and identity. Especially when combined with other sources related to guardianship, these records provide hints of what might have been formerly enslaved children’s strategies to reclaim names and possibly also identities.</p>
            <p>Because the 1903 reform required regular surveillance of liberated minors, it is possible to track some of these children over a period of several years. Of the 1324 liberated in Saint-Louis after 1895, I have found multiple points of interaction with the state (and thus multiple nodes of documentation) for 375 children. In addition, because at least until 1903, these children obtained French recognition of their liberation from slavery, their names also appear in the Senegal Liberation Registers, and digital history would make quick work of cross-referencing these records. The records of at least 114 of the Saint-Louis liberated minors included an alias, indicated with “<hi rend="italic">dit</hi>” or “<hi rend="italic">dite</hi>” (i.e., “known as”) before the new name, but these aliases were noted at different times. On the comprehensive list of minors liberated from 1895 to 1903, completed by the Saint-Louis guardianship commission in May 1904, approximately thirty records mentioned an alias, suggesting that the child was already using the name at that time (Liste des mineurs délivrés de la captivité et confiés à la tutelle de M. le Procureur Général, Chef du Service Judiciaire depuis l’année 1895, May 1905, H173, ANS; Author-Database). Other aliases were introduced into the records later — sometimes only after the child appeared before the commission several times — raising a series of interesting questions related to shifts in name usage, some of which I explore below.</p>
            <p>Interestingly, of the 114 aliases introduced into the liberated minor registry, thirty-one were French names. In all but about three cases, the liberated minors who came to be known by French aliases, such as Marie, Madeleine, or Pierre, had been entrusted to <hi rend="italic">métis</hi> or French guardians. Those entrusted to African guardians overwhelmingly went by African or Muslim aliases (some 65 cases), while only about ten liberated minors with French or <hi rend="italic">métis</hi> guardians were known by African or Muslim names. These trends prompt questions about who selected the aliases and why. Did French guardians assign French names as an indication of the power they held over liberated minors, thus continuing the naming practices we associate with slavery? Did they choose French names for their wards because they did not care to learn to pronounce or to have to remember African names? Could the decision have represented an effort to promote assimilation or inclusion within the household? We could pose similar questions about aliases that originated in the region or were linked to Islam. Did African guardians choose aliases with local significance to assert control over wards whose names suggested foreign origins and ethnicities (such as Bambara)? Or did they do so as a sign of affection, assimilation, or inclusion? Were liberated minors placed with Wolof guardians, for example, more likely to use Wolof aliases? Regarding ALL name changes, is it possible that the children themselves initiated them? Could the use of an alias have been a strategy for obscuring their past and avoiding stigma? Could it perhaps represent affection or belonging?</p>
            <p>As noted above, the records would suggest that many liberated minors began using an alias at some point long after their liberation and after their first appearance before the guardianship commission, though the later introduction of alias could simply reflect council members’ efforts to correct wrong or incomplete records. For example, young Souvergné, thought to be five at the time of her liberation on 20 September 1898, appeared at least twice in the registers of the Saint-Louis guardianship commission — in May 1904 and July 1905 — without an alias. Her entry for September 1906, however, indicated that she was now "called Aram." Her guardian, M. Boubou, a court orderly, and his wife, Mme. Boubou (who became Souvergné/Aram’s official guardian in March 1900), may have been <hi rend="italic">métis</hi>, since Africans were not usually assigned these titles of respect (Monsieur and Madame) in the registers. The alias, Aram, appears to derive from an Arabic/Muslim name, raising the question of whether Souvergné/Aram selected the name herself, or whether her guardians assigned it to her. By 1907, she had had a baby, and the register indicated that her name should be stricken from the list of those under guardianship. This final reference to her did not include "dite Aram" (this is atypical, since for most other liberated minors who took on aliases, each subsequent entry repeated the "<hi rend="italic">dit</hi>" or "<hi rend="italic">dite</hi>" language) (Author-Database). Might this indicate that she stopped using the name after having her baby, or that she planned to stop using it when removed from guardianship? These sources alone cannot answer these questions definitively, of course, but they move us forward by encouraging us to ask them. </p>
            <p>Similarly, the records suggest that young Salka, liberated on 24 April 1899 when she was estimated to be nine years old, used this name during her first few years in guardianship. The guardianship commission’s notes indicate that her guardian, Mlle. Marie Bérard of Sor and then of Rufisque, consistently treated her well. It was not until June 1907 that her alias, Joséphine, first appeared in the sources. The seven additional entries about her status, recorded from 1907 to 1910, all indicate that she went by Joséphine. In 1909 and 1910, she failed to respond to a couple of summonses to visit the commission, and finally, a police inquiry determined that she was twenty-two years old, older than the age of majority. She was likely removed from guardianship at that point (Author-Database). While it seems likely that Marie Bérard, whose name indicates that she was French or <hi rend="italic">métisse, </hi>chose a French alias for her ward, it is also certainly possible that Salka/Joséphine selected the name herself. </p>
            <p>Although most aliases consisted only of a first name (<hi rend="italic">prénom</hi>), a few records include alternative first and surnames, sometimes the family name of the liberated minor’s guardian. For example, on 2 August 1898, authorities recognized the liberty of a young girl who had come from "the Bambaras," and who was estimated to be five years old, recording her name as Nanténé. It appears that the girl continued to go by Nanténé for her first nine or ten years as the ward of Coumba M'Bissine Gueye, a laundress in N'Dar Toute. Records of her appearance in April 1905 before the Saint-Louis commission indicate only that she was "well-kept and happy," and say nothing about an alias. But the next time she appeared in the commission's records, in October 1906, a note added to the "observation" column indicated that she went by the name of Séga. This alias and a notation that she was doing fine appeared in the five additional entries recorded in 1907, 1908, and 1909, and the fourth-quarter entry for 1909 indicated that she achieved majority by virtue of having had a child. Before her removal from guardianship, however, Nanténé/Séga had begun complaining (along with some other liberated minors and guardians) about the frequency with which she had to come before the commission, and in September 1909, she submitted a letter to the commission to this effect. Strikingly, the letter gave her name as “Siga Gueye, daughter of Mme. Koumba Mbisine” and referred to her guardian as her “mother” (Author-Database; 17 Sep. 1909, Siga Gueye, fille de Mme. Koumba Mbisine à N’Dar Toute to President Tribunal, H178, ANS; Duke Bryant 2019b, p. 42-43). We cannot be sure about authorship, power relations, or other circumstances surrounding the creation of this letter. However, it strongly suggests that the liberated minor had come to use her guardian’s surname as part of her alias, raising the question of whether this reflected strategies of enslavement, fictive kinship, or something else.</p>
            <p>In rare cases, I have been able to triangulate sources, tracking a liberated minor through the records of the guardianship commission meetings <hi rend="italic">and </hi>in other kinds of evidence, especially police records and letters from guardians, that allow for more extended insight into a particular moment of the child’s life. Perhaps the most exciting example is the case of a girl whose name was recorded in the guardianship records as Boyerika at the time that she was liberated in August 1902, at the approximate age of seven.<note> “Boyerika” appears numerous times in the guardianship registers in this form, though I think it is more likely to be a combination of two or more shorter names. One possibility is that the final syllable, “ka,” was the surname, Ka or Kâ, a common name in the region associated with Peul people. “Boye” is a Peul given name meaning long awaited, and I am unsure what to make of the middle "ri" syllable in this rendering. See Association Nationale pour La Promotion des Patrimoines Sénégalais,  <ref target="http://www.facebook.com/988756457973749/posts/1652304014952320/">www.facebook.com/988756457973749/posts/1652304014952320/</ref> (22 August 2020).</note> Her story is fascinating because, though she ultimately took or received an alias, a later police report suggested that she continued to go by Boyerika, the name she had given to officials at liberation, raising compelling questions about agency and the strategies of formerly enslaved people. </p>
            <p>After her liberation, Boyerika was entrusted to Mlle. Maria Lacoste of Saint-Louis, a woman whose family name, use of the title Mademoiselle, and residence in the predominantly Christian "Sud" neighborhood of Saint-Louis suggest that she was French or <hi rend="italic">métisse</hi>. When Boyerika appeared before the commission in December 1905, commissioners reported that she was doing well and appeared to be twelve or thirteen years old, but they made no note of an alias or name change. In their next record, however, dated November 1906, commissioners wrote that she was "called Fanny," and this alias appeared in six of the other seven entries recorded through 1910 (Author-Database). Yet other correspondence, generated outside the space of the commission, suggests that she continued to be called Boyerika. </p>
            <p>In April 1909, a Mr. Leconte contacted the secretary general to request permission to take Boyerika <hi rend="italic">dite</hi> Fanny with him when he returned to France. He noted that the administration had entrusted the girl to him following Mlle. Lacoste's death some time before, and that he, in turn, had sent his ward to stay with Limali Diop, a carpenter's wife, while he traveled out of the colony.<note> The records are a bit confusing, since the commission registers say nothing of Mr. Leconte, indicating only that by October 1908, Boyerika's guardian had changed from Mlle. Lacoste to the wife of carpenter Limalé Diop.</note> Before granting the request, the secretary general corresponded with another official in the margins of Mr. Leconte's letter, asking for more information. In his response, which explained that Limalé Diop had given the girl to M. and Mme. Leconte to accompany them to France and that the liberated minor would return to the African woman upon her return, the official, strikingly, broke convention and referred to the girl ONLY as Boyerika (no "<hi rend="italic">dite</hi> Fanny") (23 Apr. 1909, Leconte to Secrétaire Général, H206, ANS).</p>
            <p>Similarly, in January 1911, the police commissioner referred to the girl only as Boyerika in a letter to the lieutenant governor. Instructed to track down the nine liberated minors who had not appeared before the commission's most recent meeting and to note their ages and “moral and material situation,” the wording of the commissioner's report suggests that he obtained the needed information by speaking with the young people. Boyerika's case is particularly interesting, because of both the variation in how the commissioner referred to her and the news he learned about her. She appeared on the lieutenant governor's list as "Boyerika, <hi rend="italic">dite</hi> Fanny, 16" and the first part of the commissioner's comments repeated this formulation. Limalé Diop, he wrote, claimed that she had given the summons to "the minor Bayérika <hi rend="italic">dite</hi> Fanny" and had expected her to appear before the commission on her own. Next, the commissioner shared information he claimed to have learned from the girl herself, and a very different rendering of her name appeared. "Bayérika declares that she left Abdou Diop [Limalé's husband], because she was not well cared for, and she took refuge with Doïner Diop, living in Nord." According to Bayérika, she simply forgot to visit the commission (Liste des mineurs, Réunion 21 Jan. 1911, H178, ANS; 4 Feb. 1911, Commissaire de Police to Secrétaire Général, H178, ANS). It is significant, I think, that these sources imply tensions between what the guardians (at least those who were French or <hi rend="italic">métis</hi>) wanted to call this liberated minor and her own apparent name preference. This constellation of documents offers glimpses of some of the ways marginalized people may have exercised agency and encourages us to take names and naming seriously, as a possible method of not only restoring names of enslaved people to history, but also learning about their lived experiences and other aspects of their humanity.</p>

            <head>Conclusion</head>
            <p>	It is precisely this sort of triangulation — the result of archival serendipity in the case of Boyerika — that a particularly effective digital history framework could facilitate, through effective tagging and searching that would allow users to make connections between sources found in disparate parts of an archive, or perhaps in different archives altogether. By connecting names of at least some formerly enslaved people to documents that reveal other aspects of their stories, whether it was the relationship cultivated with their guardian or another person, the neighborhood in which they lived, the work they performed, or something else about them, we can move beyond the “wall of names” approach that Araujo rightfully calls into question. Effective digital repositories would allow users to make these kinds of connections more easily and would also provide context, analysis, and stories that go beyond the names. In addition, by inviting users not only to read content, but also to interact with it, contributing their own stories, reactions, or analysis, a digital repository based on guardianship records could adopt an inclusive post-colonial stance. Such a dynamic collaborative project could also help activists, historians, and others respond to the need to remember domestic slavery in West Africa as a means of breaking through stigma and allowing people of slave descent to reclaim identities, as Eric Hahonou and Lotte Pelckmans (2012) advocate.<note> A model digital history project might be the Jamaican Slave Names Project, <ref target="http://jamaicanslavenames.com/">http://jamaicanslavenames.com/</ref>. </note>
            </p>
            <p>In the case studies explored above, I have tried to show the methodological value of working with names of enslaved people. Doing so can reveal patterns related to slavery, emancipation, and post-emancipation societies, and it can offer insight into the ways that formerly enslaved people sought to reclaim previous names or take on new ones as they took the status of liberated Africans. Digitizing the records on which this analysis is based and making datasets available online might allow us to ask new questions of the data, especially if records were tagged, cross referenced, and connected to other collections. Done in close cooperation with West African partners to minimize the possibility of stigma or other harm and to work toward decolonizing digital history, such a project could democratize access to the information, allow others to engage in related research, and contribute to the important work of highlighting Black histories in digital spaces.</p>
