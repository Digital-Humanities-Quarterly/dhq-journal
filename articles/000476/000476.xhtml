                  <p>How can digital traces of the performing arts be interpreted? What methodologies can
                     be proposed to “make them talk”? The specificity of these traces
                     leads to specific methodological responses, especially as the aim here is to
                     interpret the traces in both directions of understanding and replayability. It is
                     as
                     much a question of advancing a reflection on the conditions for the recovery of work,
                     as it is of analyzing an artistic approach based on its digital traces. Starting from
                     these epistemological issues, I present the development of two softwares, Rekall and
                     MemoRekall. These tools are part of a larger trend which I call “theatre analytics”. Theatre analytics is based on data from the traces of
                     the performing arts. Unlike the general approach of “big data in the social
                     sciences and humanities,” where we seek to determine general, average, profile
                     categories or repeatable (or even predictable) patterns, our primary concern remains
                     to capture the singular, the detail, the difference, the anomaly, in a constant round
                     trip between the micro and the macro dimensions. The ambition of theatre analytics
                     is
                     to offer a different way of looking at big data, more oriented towards complexity
                     than the quantity of data.

               <div class="ptext" id="p1">Digital technology has flooded the theatre. On stage, it is omnipresent: image
                  projections, real-time transformations of the actors' voices, interactions between
                  the
                  performers and the stage enhanced by all kinds of devices. Behind the scenes, there
                  is
                  no longer a single sound or light control room that is not digital, with the exception
                  of shows in the dark, in daylight or flickering candlelight or even the rare
                  performances without a sound broadcasting system. However, it is not just about the
                  shows. Creative processes are also impacted, as are other aspects of theatrical
                  activity: distribution of works, criticism, public reception, communication, financing.
                  If one wants to study the performing arts today, it is impossible not to take into
                  account companies' websites, blog and online newspaper articles, recordings broadcast
                  on
                  Youtube or Vimeo, social networks, email exchanges, budget tables, ticketing software.
                  Today, directors' notebooks also take the form of Word files, image-based blogs on
                  Tumblr or Instagram, posts on Facebook, Evernote notebooks, Pinterest tables, task
                  lists
                  in Trello, exchanges in Slack. The traces of the performing arts have become digital
                  traces. This phenomenon has been driven by two major trends: the emergence of the
                  born-digital heritage and theatre archives digitization.

               <div class="ptext" id="p2">The digital traces of the performing arts irremediably change not only the nature
                  of the
                  sources on which we rely to analyze works and write the history of performing arts
                  but
                  also how these studies are conducted and their results. The transformation of the
                  trace
                  into data-based information, making data a new type of source, is fraught with
                  consequences for the memory of the ephemeral theatre, consequences that are not yet
                  fully measured by the various actors, be they cultural institutions, librarians or
                  researchers. Historiography in a digital context is not a revival of quantitative
                  history in the strict sense of the term. It calls first and foremost for practices,
                  and
                  it is also in this practice that the narrative is housed. It is because it is a question
                  of practice, and not just of exposing traces, but instead of exposing them to
                  manipulation that a paradigm shift is taking place, inviting us to “make history
                  differently.” Because the traces are transformed, they invite a renewal of the
                  critique of sources that we thought we knew and make research questions evolve and
                  lead
                  to other epistemologies. The “digital turn” proposes a paradigm shift in how we
                  build the memory of performing arts by renewing source criticism, methodological
                  thinking, and narratives, moving beyond traditional methods of close reading to
                  computational assisted reading and contributing to the general reflection on digital
                  history.

                  developing a reflection on the conditions for the recovery of creative work as it
                  is of
                  analyzing an artistic approach based on its digital traces. Traditional methods, in
                  particular close reading, i.e., a reading, a precise analysis of each of the traces,
                  have to be combined with new approaches.

                  are
                  free and open source. Rekall and MemoRekall provide new opportunities of interpreting
                  digital documents for performing arts research. They offer different and unexpected
                  points of view on a dataset, either from a distant or a close reading approach, either
                  by extracting metadata or by linking documents. Furthermore, the softwares take into
                  account the open nature of the digital archive, which reconfigures itself as new
                  documents are added, new links are created, and allow collaborative research.

               <div class="ptext" id="p5">From an epistemological point of view, the creation of these tools is anchored in
                  the
                  emergence of a new field of research that can be called “theatre analytics.”
                  Theatre analytics are based on data from the traces of the performing arts. In line
                  with
                  “culture analytics,” the term refers to the calculation and emphasizes the
                  analysis of works, which is the foundation for the preservation and historiography
                  of
                  the performing arts. In both cases it is a matter of following in detail a process
                  to
                  show why and how a work is constituted by observing its various components and of
                  borrowing from mathematics to study, preserve and write a history of the performing
                  arts. Theatre analytics does not challenge existing methodologies but allows them
                  to be
                  supplemented by taking into account what is generally discarded, namely, digital traces,
                  considered too complex, too numerous, too fragile, with dubious authenticity. The
                  aim is
                  not to promote an approach that would be purely quantitative or statistical but on
                  the
                  contrary to see how qualitative analyses can also be conducted in a digital context.
                  Unlike the general approach of “big data in the social sciences and humanities,”
                  where we seek to determine general, average, profile categories or repeatable (or
                  even
                  predictable) patterns, our primary concern remains to seize the singular, the detail,
                  the difference, the anomaly in a constant round trip between the micro and the macro
                  dimensions, and looking for mesoscales. In the tracking of the singular at the core
                  of
                  big data, the deviation from the mean is made visible as such and no longer as an
                  error
                  against a standard. Nor is it a question of considering that singularity would be
                  calculable, as some research on emotions or creativity seems to state by reducing
                  digital traces to mathematical artifacts. On the contrary, we argue for an approach
                  where the singular, the ideosyncraric <span class="hi italic">via</span> computational methods,
                  be the focus of a qualitative interpretation. Data visualisation is ultimately
                  qualitative and must give rise to an accurate and informed reading. As Johanna Drucker,
                  who calls for a “visual epistemology,” points out “Visualizations are always interpretations — data does not have an
                  inherent visual form that merely gives rise to a graphic expression”
                  [<a class="ref" href="#drucker2014">Drucker 2014</a>, 7]. In this light, the ambition of theatre analytics
                  is to offer a different way of looking at big data that is more oriented towards
                  complexity, rather than the quantity of data, with a diversity of computer approaches
                  depending on the nature of the data and the research questions asked. Alongside other
                  methodologies less specific to the performing arts but which can also beRekall and
                  MemoRekall afforts such an approach. Part of the text is missing : Alongside other

                     analysis of works and the performing arts history? Let us take the tip of the
                     “iceberg” of technological obsolescence and big data. A creative process,
                     from its initial ideas to the <em class="term">première</em>, lasts an average of four years -
                     the same length as that of a technological cycle. In other words, at the moment of
                     the <em class="term">première</em>, it is necessary to update the management software and
                     computer systems accompanying the tour, to save and sort the hundreds, sometimes
                     thousands, of documents related to the work in a new version. As soon as the work
                     is
                     created, the artistic and technical team is confronted with problems of technological
                     obsolescence and a quantity of information that may have a decisive impact on the
                     production and its distribution of the work and can even, in the medium term, make
                     it
                     impossible to tour.

                     issues. The creative processes are also affected. To take the example of the
                     director's notebooks, in 20 years, who will remember applications such as Trello,
                     Slack, Evernote or Tumblr? Will we be able to read the digital traces that have been
                     stored and have access to the data they contain while guaranteeing their
                     authenticity? Not only are performances ephemeral, which is inherent to the
                     performing arts, but their digital traces seem even more evanescent. They are also
                     increasingly numerous, overwhelming us with a continuous flow of data, in an
                     unprecedented disproportion. These questions are not all new, but their amplification
                     gives them a new acuity. How can we write the history of the performing arts from
                     not
                     only fragile and variable traces, but also too numerous at for researcher or

                     legacy. Given this, one can but note that memory and the digital seem to oppose each
                     other. This need not be so. Reconciling them is essential. Digital traces cannot be
                     ignored in building and safeguarding the memory of the performing arts. These issues
                     are complex and urgent. If nothing is done, the technological obsolescence of digital
                     technology will overtake all other considerations, and an entire part of our culture
                     will vanish.

                     concerns a complex creation that takes place over several years. They are
                     heterogeneous, numerous but incomplete and fragile. The digital traces of the
                     performing arts are heterogeneous, both in terms of the type of file (image, sound,
                     text, video, computer program) and their content. All is happily mixed without any
                     distinction and with the elements of the show such as aspects about the creative
                     process or publicity compaigns, and the tour. These three aspects make it possible
                     to
                     define three main categories of digital traces that correspond to the main
                     chronological stages in the life of a performance: the creative process, the work,
                     audience reception. We can add a fourth one, not represented here: the administrative
                     digital traces of cultural institutions and companies, i.e., everything related to
                     the production of shows.

                     have counted several thousand files for <cite class="title italic">Re: Walden</cite>. The
                     situation is nothing new, and we can only observe the inflation of digital traces.
                     However, despite their impressive volume, the traces are far from being exhaustive.
                     Besides, some tasks left only minimal traces, for example there were only a few
                     photos and patches in the Pure Data software for the residency at the École Régionale
                     d'Acteurs de Cannes. Finally, digital traces do not take into account a large part
                     of
                     the exchanges, actions, and reflections taking place on and off the set, if they had
                     not been systematically recorded or were in the form of reports and notes. Part of
                     the digital activity itself rarely leads to the creation of preserved traces, like
                     the one that takes place on electronic networks, such as documents shared on Google
                     drive, conversations on Skype or applications such as Slate or Trello, images made

                     especially those from proprietary software (Word for example), we will probably no
                     longer be able to open them and therefore read them. The loss of traces seems to be
                     an unavoidable phenomenon. In fact, many artists have already lost not only traces
                     but also creative works.

                     of
                     “analogical” traces, while at the same time differentiating themselves from
                     them. As for the first observation, linked to heterogeneity, number or fragility,
                     it
                     is ultimately “merely” a question of accentuating phenomena already well
                     identified in the analogical world. The great diversity of the nature of documents
                     in
                     the performing arts collections; the inflation of archives is a recurring problem
                     identified, notably by Krzystof Pomian [<a class="ref" href="#pomian1992">Pomian 1992</a>], where paper ends
                     up being reduced to dust, inks are erased, magnetic strips become electronic snow.
                     Despite the appearance of continuity, in fact digital technology fundamentally
                     changes the ontology of the trace. To use Bruno Bachimont's expression, we have gone
                     from a “graphic reason”<a class="noteRef" href="#d4e308">[2]</a>
                     [<a class="ref" href="#goody1977">Goody 1977</a>] to a “computational reason”
                     [<a class="ref" href="#bachimont2008">Bachimont 2008</a>]. As they become numerical, traces are coded and
                     presented as numbers, which allows for computational calculation. This makes the
                     question of reading traces and their authenticity complex (for they must be
                     “decoded”) while opening up to being manipulated. In other words, digital
                     traces are “analyzable”, in the triple sense of
                     discretization (the decomposition of a thing into its elements), computer calculation
                     and data visualization. Analytical geometry, attributed to Descartes that allows a
                     graphic representation of algebra, is the prelude to contemporary data
                     visualizations. The digital traces of the performing arts thus presents several
                     paradoxes: technological obsolescence versus full archiving, authenticity versus
                     modification, and repetition versus ephemerality.

                     performing arts at the margins, given that the works are inherently ephemeral. The
                     case study was part of the DOCAM research program (2005-2010) led by the Daniel
                     Langlois Foundation in Montreal on the documentation and preservation of media arts.
                     The programme includes numerous partners, including museums. It builds on the
                     pioneering work of the Langlois Foundation and John Ippolito on the variable media
                     approach [<a class="ref" href="#depocas2003">Depocas et al. 2003</a>]. Jon Ippolito will then publish with Richard

                     technological obsolescence of works was raised. Pip Laurenson proposed new

                     [<a class="ref" href="#laurenson2006">Laurenson 2006</a>]. Faced with these questions, the researcher's
                     natural reflex is to identify existing solutions. Best practice guidelines and case
                     studies were published as part of international projects (Interpares, DOCAM, Caspar)
                     [<a class="ref" href="#bardiot2012">Bardiot 2012</a>]; researchers worked on specific ontologies [<a class="ref" href="#rinehart2007">Rinehart 2007</a>]; some artists - particularly choreographers - in
                     collaboration with scientists, proposed solutions for a work or set of works [<a class="ref" href="#bleeker2017">Bleeker 2017</a>]. However, no existing solution seemed able to solve the
                     concrete problems identified in the performing arts field. They can be summarized

                     paper [<a class="ref" href="#bardiot2009">Bardiot 2009</a>] proposing a conceptual model of a computer
                     solution articulating documents around the video recording of a performance. In
                     contrast to the practice of creating a specific interface for each performance, I
                     designed a software that can be applied to as many creative works as possible. As
                     my
                     concerns increasingly met those of cultural institutions confronted with the
                     obsolescence of technologies - and the costs that this entails in addition to the
                     difficulty of presenting works to the public - I decided to develop the software by
                     myself. At the end of 2012, I raised the first funds that enabled me to hire a team
                     of developers. Five years after the first draft, the situation had changed. The
                     issues of big data and digital traces mentioned above could no longer be ignored.
                     It
                     was necessary to go beyond the articulation of a documentary corpus around a video
                     recording. In the preparatory meetings that followed, the guiding principles of the
                     project, first entitled <cite class="title italic">Éclats</cite> (in reference to the
                     fragmentation and multiplicity of documents) and then <cite class="title italic">Rekall</cite> (in reference to the memory company in K. Dick's <cite class="title italic">We Can Remember It for You Wholesale</cite>), were clarified. From
                     the outset, Open Source was a self-evident option. Indeed, some funders such as the
                     French Ministry of Culture imposed the Open Source option. Beyond that, Open Source
                     is a prerequisite for the sustainability of the solutions developed. It would have
                     been antinomic and counterproductive to proceed otherwise in a project dedicated to
                     the preservation of art works.

                     to
                     simplify the preservation of performances. It uses the metadata present in all
                     documents of a performance in order to extract crucial data (author, date, place,
                     keyword) then used by data visualization tools to indicate behaviors. In this way,
                     Rekall provides an overview of the creation process and identifies the most important
                     documents (which will then have to undergo specific preservation measures). The
                     software can also be used during rehearsals (for example, to annotate documents,
                     review the history of a plot sheet), or once the creation is completed (to understand
                     its process, distinguish documents related to the work from those related to its
                     production). Rekall is cross platform. It is developed with the Qt development
                     framework. For each version of a document, Rekall extracts all available metadata
                     using the open source tool exiftool. The interface is in HTML5 and CSS3.

                     genetics of performances in a context of born-digital heritage and Big Data. These
                     two objectives may seem very distant at first sight. However, it is the same
                     materials (digital traces of the works) that are collected, analyzed and visualized
                     based on different modalities and time scales. In this way, the collection can take
                     place for the artists during the creative process itself, as the work stages
                     progress. A living archive emerges in perpetual movement. The researcher intervenes
                     once the process is completed, once the documents have somehow stabilized, frozen
                     to
                     become the traces of what has happened. Rekall must, therefore, be able to be used
                     from the onset of the first ideas of a show, during the creative process and then
                     after its creation, with a dual perspective of preservation of the work and
                     historiography.

                  <div class="ptext" id="p20">Very quickly, it became clear to us that we had to develop a multimodal environment
                     that included both digitized documents and natively digital documents. The digital
                     traces of the performing arts include texts, images, sounds, videos, computer
                     programs. A common practice of big data is to separate documents by file type and
                     work in the form of “silos” (e.g. text, image). Such processing prevents us from
                     obtaining an overview of the traces collected and from examining many phenomena such
                     as the evolution of an idea through different documents, from image to text, from
                     text to table, from table to video recording. Besides, it is essential to navigate
                     between the micro and macro dimensions, between close reading and distant reading,
                     between diachronic and synchronic representations. In other words, being able to
                     represent a process without erasing its complexity; to switch from data to file and
                     back again. Often, distant reading and data visualization involve a break between
                     the
                     source file and the data from which it is extracted. Maintaining this link is
                     fundamental for several reasons. The data are always reductive fragments and it is
                     important to be able to recontextualize them in order to interpret them better. The
                     transition from a trace to data is a reductive and interpretive operation. Reduction
                     also means making a precipitate of traces, which makes it possible to amplify and
                     exhale a phenomenon that would otherwise have remained invisible. The transformation
                     affords new insights into the tracks and allows us to detect clues that would
                     otherwise have gone unnoticed. The use of data visualization is essential in the case
                     of performance preservation to capture the main steps of the creative process and
                     to
                     identify the main files that will then need to be actively preserved, often on a
                     case-by-case basis. In a very concrete way, in a corpus of 10,000 documents, the
                     process of visualization must make it possible to identify the 50 documents that the
                     researcher must read in detail to analyze the work or that the artistic team must
                     migrate or emulate to continue touring.

                  <div class="ptext" id="p21">Among the traces of the performing arts, the video recording is a particular type
                     of
                     document. It has long been - and is still often - considered as a panacea regarding
                     documentation of the ephemeral performing arts. Provoking many debates since the
                     1960s, often considered as a “betrayal” of the original work [<a class="ref" href="#melzer1995a">Melzer 1995a</a>]
                     [<a class="ref" href="#melzer1995b">Melzer 1995b</a>], video recordings have now become commonplace. A video
                     recording is both an essential and a fragmented document. In its essential form, it
                     records bodies in movement and thus transforms performances into documents. In its
                     fragmented form, it gives only one point of view, presenting only a part of what
                     takes place on stage, generating temporal collusion through editing, adapting stage
                     lighting to the lighting conditions of the cameras. A commentary, that is to say,
                     an
                     annotation must necessarily accompany these modifications. Two types of strategies
                     are developed in order to overcome the shortcomings or biases of video recording:
                     inter-documentary (connecting the video-capture to a larger documentary corpus) and
                     intra-documentary (annotating the video-capture). These two approaches can be
                     usefully combined. They simultaneously play different roles with the document,
                     between the deepening and connecting roles.

                     multimodal environment, but also as a video annotation software, with three
                     complementary strategies: the creation of links between multiple documents offering
                     the possibility of commenting and illuminating the documents between them; the choice
                     of video recording as a backbone from which all other documents would be organized;
                     and the possibility of adding textual comments. Subsequently, these two aspects were
                     separated. The video annotation part about of Rekall has now become MemoRekall.

                     a
                     user-friendly web application that explains a video by annotating it and linking it
                     to external documents or web pages. The arrangement of documents, links and
                     annotations creates a new document, called a “capsule”, that can
                     be embedded into a web page. The capsules organization is developed from and around
                     video recordings in a hypertextual logic. MemoRekall can be used to create a
                     multimedia educational booklet, run a digital spectator school, edit a scientific
                     web
                     documentary or simplify the distribution of works. MemoRekall is developed in HTML5
                     /
                     CSS3 with a backend using PHP/MySQL technologies. The video player is developed in
                     HTML5, allowing it to be integrated into the main web browsers (Firefox, Safari,
                     Google Chrome). The personal user account was developed with the Symfony

                     of the works (MemoRekall). With Rekall, it’s possible to retrace the historic of a
                     file (but not the versioning, which can be done with complementary tools). In terms
                     of research, Rekall and MemoRekall are platforms suited to genetic analysis, close
                     and distant reading of a work, documentation and preservation of a performance.

                     development) and Thierry Coduys (consultant, designer of electronic devices for the
                     performing arts) joined the project. They already had a first common experience of
                     software development with IanniX, a real-time sequencer for digital art inspired by
                     UPIC (a former project by Iannis Xenakis). Throughout his artistic career, which led
                     him to IRCAM, Thierry Coduys has developed electroacoustic and computer devices for
                     numerous directors, composers (including Luciano Berio, Ivan Fedele, and Pascal
                     Dusapin) and choreographers. He was regularly confronted with the question of
                     touring, restaging and transmitting works with particularly complex technological
                     caracteristics. Guillaume Jacquemin and Guillaume Marais created the Buzzing Light
                     agency in 2009. Guillaume Jacquemin is an embedded systems engineer and is trained
                     through multiple experiences in interactive multimedia and digital art. Guillaume
                     Marais is an ergonomist and interaction designer and is trained in information
                     systems engineering. In addition to their complementary skills in programming and
                     ergonomics, Guillaume Marais and Guillaume Jacquemin were used to contributing to
                     artistic projects and had a keen appetite for contemporary music. It was an essential
                     factor: to develop Rekall, it was crucial to establish a dialogue around the key
                     issues of the software. We used an AGILE approach and progressed incrementally based
                     on user feedback.

                  <div class="ptext" id="p26">I am often asked why I have not chosen instead to work with a computer science
                     research laboratory. There are several answers to this question. One is that I needed
                     to be in a very operational, fluid and fast environment. Furthermore, it did not
                     appear that the project raised computer research issues. In 2012, in France, a
                     computer development project led by a theatre studies researcher was not always well
                     accepted by the academic community. Finally, on one hand, the funding obtained came
                     from funds for innovation in the field of culture (Pictanovo) and from cultural
                     institutions.<a class="noteRef" href="#d4e441">[3]</a> This gave great flexibility in hiring service providers. On the
                     other hand, the lack of research funding and the administrative management of the
                     project by a theatre (the Phénix scène nationale Valenciennes) and then, in 2015,
                     by
                     a publishing house (Subjectile) did not allow the hiring of a Ph.D. student or a
                     postdoc. Today, with the development of the digital humanities and the resulting
                     cultural change, the software development framework would probably be different. So
                     indeed, the contribution of Thierry Coduys, Guillaume Jacquemin and Guillaume Marais
                     were crucial. The results we obtained would have been very different with another
                     team that wouldn’t have had any experience with artistic creative processes. For
                     example, creating software that can be used by artists has several consequences. The
                     main point is that it must be as easy to use as possible and still meet the rigorous
                     requirements of researchers. This involved a reflection on interface design and
                     ergonomics and two essential decisions. The first is that Rekall had to operate
                     discreetly in the background on the assumption that artists have very little time
                     to
                     archive their work even if they are aware of its importance. The artistic team works
                     on its usual tools while Rekall records in the background all the manipulations that
                     are done as well as the users' working environment (the version of their OS, the open
                     applications, and their version) in order to collect all fundamental information from
                     a preservation perspective. It is essential to keep the most exact trace possible
                     of
                     the technological components and of the aesthetic and historical dimensions. At the
                     same time, it is important to describe the effects of these same components, in line
                     with the variable media approach in order to make them evolve and update [<a class="ref" href="#depocas2003">Depocas et al. 2003</a>]. The artistic team only opens the software when it needs
                     to have an overview, annotate certain documents, or go back over the history of the
                     files. The second decision is the lack of a specialized ontology. Past experiences
                     show that these ontologies are difficult to apply by non-specialists and, to
                     underline the point, they do not respond to all the situations encountered. The tool
                     has to be as labile as possible and able to accommodate all types of artistic
                     approaches. The only scheme used is the simplified Dublin Core scheme to describe
                     the
                     files (this scheme is expected to be implemented soon). In the same spirit, even if
                     we are open to the possibility of importing thesauri to index the files, we initially
                     favored folksonomy.

                  <div class="ptext" id="p27">Once the team and the first funding were gathered, the keywords of our working method
                     became collaboration, testing, and adaptation. During a first step, it took the form
                     of face-to-face working meetings on a monthly basis, and then less frequently. The
                     first exchanges were in the form of drawings and graphs. At the heart of our
                     discussions were the issues mentioned above and to which we tried to provide concrete
                     solutions in the form of usage scenarios. In other words, how were we to reconcile
                     theory and practice? A state of the art study was carefully examined, in particular,
                     the work initiated by William Forsythe and the research carried out at IRCAM, were
                     discussed at length. Once the issues and objectives were clearly defined, a first
                     development phase began, leading to a beta version at the end of 2013. There were
                     many iterations, Guillaume Marais and Guillaume Jacquemin working together on the
                     development and interface, Thierry Coduys and myself giving feedback. If I brought
                     a
                     researcher's point of view, Thierry Coduys brought the artistic team’s point of
                     view.

                     Peyret) and dance (Mylène Benoit) domains, in residence respectively at Le Fresnoy
                     and Le Phénix scène nationale Valenciennes (France). There both were the initial
                     partners of the project. On the one hand, we needed “real” data to work on a
                     tangible case. This was made possible by the <cite class="title italic">Re: Walden</cite>
                     project mentioned above. On the other hand, I wanted to be involved in a creative
                     process from the beginning to understand better how Rekall could fit in and what its
                     contributions could be. Mylène Benoit opened the doors of the rehearsals of <cite class="title italic">Notre Danse</cite>, a choreography created in 2014. Many informal
                     interviews with these artists and their teams have allowed us to clarify many aspects
                     of Rekall. Finally, workshops, as well as public presentations (study days,
                     conferences, talks), allowed us to confront different audiences (researchers,
                     artists, technicians) and to fine-tune the project. A new use, which we had not
                     considered, emerged: the possibility of using Rekall as a writing tool. This confirms
                     the flexibility of the platform. Nonetheless, to consider all the implications of
                     this new use would be a very important shift. At this stage of the project, we
                     decided not to address it directly. We took the idea into account for MemoRekall and
                     mentioned this possibility during workshops.

                     initial project. Rekall has known several versions - and we hope so, will know more.
                     The first phase, from the end of 2012 to November 2013, was based on the case study
                     of Jean-François Peyret's <cite class="title italic">Re: Walden</cite> project. The Rekall
                     team has been collecting documents, as well as those related to the different stages
                     of the creative process since 2006. This made it possible to develop the
                     data-visualization part of Rekall. Indeed, it quickly became apparent that the
                     software had to offer two main uses: data visualization and a timeline. The data
                     visualization interface presents the entire corpus in a multimodal environment and
                     allows the user to play with different views from the extraction of metadata from
                     the
                     files. The timeline interface allows organizing a selection of documents on a time
                     axis. One or more video recordings are used as the primary document to define the
                     time axis. It is then possible to play several video streams in parallel, which
                     allows for example to compare several rehearsals or a front and a zenithal view.
                     Timeline mode uses only a small selection of documents. It is principally designed
                     for document annotation purposes, to complement information that is not perceptible
                     and intelligible through data visualization.

                     artistic uses, I studied related research issues. Another development phase on the
                     timeline began in February 2014. In May 2014, a workshop at Le Fresnoy brought
                     together developers, technicians, and artists to discuss the development. Many points
                     were validated, notably on metadata processing and the general interface. Specific
                     functionalities related to the documentation of the creation process were specified,
                     some interface details were revised, and some functionalities simplified. This work
                     allowed the beta version to be released online on June 13, 2014 (see Figure 1).

                     an
                     online version. This new development took place in the fall of 2014. The code was
                     completely rewritten, and a V0 was published in November 2014. The user feedback and
                     beta test on the V0 led us to refine and simplify the interface and the various
                     functionalities, with a clear separation between data visualization and timeline.

                     a
                     demand for the general public and schoolchildren quickly appeared. The school
                     partners of the Phénix scène nationale Valenciennes wanted to have access to the
                     content created with Rekall on a website available to students. They also wanted
                     students to be able to document the works themselves collaboratively and directly,
                     either from documents provided by the theatres and artistic teams hosted or from
                     documents created by the students themselves. At the same time, a team of young
                     writers contacted us. They wanted to renew theater criticism by having a
                     collaborative writing tool that could be superimposed on a video recording available
                     and broadcasted on the Internet.

                  <div class="ptext" id="p34">This is why we started to develop MemoRekall at the end of 2014, with funding from
                     the French Ministry of Culture and other cultural institutions that joined the
                     project. All the work done on the timeline part of Rekall was used and simplified
                     to
                     the utmost. While Rekall remains for the moment a standalone software, MemoRekall
                     is
                     designed from the beginning as a web application accessible from a browser (see
                     Figure 3). In order to validate the software design, various workshops and training
                     sessions were organized in September 2015 with middle school and high school
                     students, higher education students, teachers and cultural professionals (more than
                     100 people participated in this phase of the project). Edwige Perrot, a theater
                     researcher and a teacher, joined the team to create capsules and lead the workshops
                     for school pupils. MemoRekall was made available to the public at the end of
                     September 2015. The web application has allowed us to solve codec problems that were
                     not solved with Rekall. We decided to release a Version 2 of the prototype in 2017
                     without the timeline interface. Rekall now focused on the data visualization part
                     and
                     processed a more significant number of documents simultaneously (about 6,000). This
                     first scaling up must be continued as it is not rare to gather more than 10 000
                     documents for one work as we have seen with <cite class="title italic">Re: Walden</cite>.
                     Also in 2017, Estelle Senay, network engineer, joined the team. A personal user
                     account to MemoRekall was added and a new website was deployed at the end of the
                     year. In 2018 the usage scenarios were fine tuned and training provided for
                     MemoRekall. If the web application is taken as an operational tool, Rekall is still
                     at the advanced prototype stage. A search for funding is underway to scale up the
                     system. Many features remain to be developed. For example, the performing arts
                     involve collaborative teams, it would therefore be useful to have different people
                     working together on a same Rekall project. At this stage, Rekall allows a
                     collaborative collection of the traces but lends itself to an individual analysis
                     of
                     these traces. This necessitates that collaborative tools be developed further for
                     Rekall.

                     univocal solution but for a complementarity of strategies: diachronic documentation
                     of works based on documentation that is as rigorous as it is precise, preserving a
                     historical and material anchorage; inter and intra-documentary annotation of video
                     recording, this trace that is now omnipresent; circulation between different reading
                     distances. The complex nature of performing arts makes it irreducible to a single
                     approach; any attempt at documentation is characterized by its incompleteness. What
                     these different strategies have in common is the redocumentarisation of traces. Each
                     time a reader consults, links or extracts data from digital traces, it re-documents
                     them. Re-playing, “re-enacting” a performance is necessarily today
                     to go through a performative act carried out within the digital traces. This
                     performativity is synonymous with instrumentation. We have thus proposed two
                     complementary tools, Rekall and MemoRekall, which could be used in wider fields such
                     as time based media art preservation, digital art history or electronic
                     publishing.

                     500 capsules have been produced. Since its first version in 2014, Rekall has been
                     downloaded several thousand times. The whole project has given rise to numerous
                     articles, talks, and workshops, in France and abroad. There are many development
                     opportunities, and new functionalities must be implemented to get as close as
                     possible to an answer to the questions raised by the digital traces of the performing
                     arts. Moreover, if the project was initially designed for the performing arts, its
                     scope may cover other artistic practices.

                  <div class="ptext" id="p37">The development of this project, based in a specific field and in the French context,
                     leads to several reflections. On the one hand, Rekall changes the genetic studies
                     of
                     the performing arts. It is now possible to take into account all the digital traces
                     of a creation process in a multimodal environment. Retreiving metadata with Rekall
                     allows distant reading and at the same time while a keeping a link to the original
                     file. It also allows close reading of the most important documents identified through
                     distant reading. For researchers of the performing arts this provides a new way to
                     circulate between micro and macro dimensions of a corpora. On the other hand,
                     MemoRekall provides for researchers a new publishing tool, articulating
                     video-recording, documents (archives or documents created by the researcher) and
                     annotations, and allows co-editing. The connection and complementarity between Rekall
                     and MemoRekall is a project in its own right, but certain “bricks” have already
                     been laid (common development core, compatible interfaces). Indeed, we are seeking
                     to
                     reconcile two approaches often considered to be opposed in digital history and the
                     treatment of digital traces. The first one shows the sources and superimposes
                     different strata to make them explicit. We find here the question of annotation and
                     a
                     critical work specific to the humanities. This approach is anchored in a practice
                     of
                     editorialization. The second approach extracts data sources and proposes to analyse
                     them by applying different computational methods. This approach is based on the école
                     des annales and the quantitative approach.

                     issue. It is also an institutional and cultural issue. For Rekall and MemoRekall,
                     this would mean finding a framework that allows for the maintenance, development,
                     and
                     hosting of open source and free software solutions. It is not the role of cultural
                     institutions that financed the project to put this responsibility on a small team
                     made up, by in large, of self-employed workers in, invarariably, precarious economic
                     situations. MemoRekall is now hosted by Huma-num (a French “Very Large Research
                     Infrastructure” - “Très Grande Infrastructure de Recherche”, TGIR) that
                     provides long term preservation of the capsules created with the web-application.
