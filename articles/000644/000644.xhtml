                  <p>In this reflection, I discuss my path into digital humanities scholarship through
                     Black studies. I share how I became involved in digital humanities in the 2000s as
                     a
                     graduate student who found that it offered answers to methodological problems I was
                     encountering in my research. Then, I examine how early career colleagues and I banded
                     together to create a space for Black studies and other ethnic studies fields within
                     digital humanities in the early 2010s. Finally, I propose that addressing race — and
                     its relationship to gender, sexuality, nation, disability, and colonialism, among
                     others — is a matter of scholarly integrity that must be put at the center of digital
                     humanities inquiry today.</p>

                  <div class="ptext" id="p1">I came to digital humanities through Black Studies, looking for answers to a question
                     — and found more questions. But the answer was always clear: we are the ones we’ve
                     been waiting for to create the space for digital humanities to more fully realize
                     the
                     promise of the democratization of knowledge and to improve representation of
                     minoritized communities in the digital cultural record. </div>
                  
                  <div class="counter"><a href="#p2">2</a></div>
                  <div class="ptext" id="p2">In the late 2000s, beginning my dissertation on what W.E.B. Du Bois called the “global color line,” I struggled with the limits of written
                     text as I tried to articulate flows of knowledge between social movements influenced
                     by Black radicalism. Paper seemed ill-equipped to contain what was coming to life
                     as
                     a vibrant, multidirectional exchange around the world. Every attempt to pin it down
                     seemed a pale (pun intended) representation of beautiful complexity that lived in
                     institutional and community archives. </div>

                  <div class="ptext" id="p3">One day, everything changed. Doing research in the Huey Newton Papers at Stanford
                     University, I came across subscriber rolls of <cite class="title italic">The Black
                        Panther</cite> newspaper, a globally circulated periodical from the Black Panther
                     Party. While many countries represented on the rolls were unremarkable given the
                     history of Black internationalism (Cuba, the USSR, Algeria), others were surprising
                     (Norway, Denmark, Poland). Perhaps, if I could put this data on a map, I’d have a
                     heuristic to think through ideas I struggled to commit to paper. A digital humanist
                     was born. </div>

                     were working in the burgeoning field knew that either.<a class="noteRef" href="#d4e197">[1]</a> While digital humanities has well-documented,
                     if contested, roots in areas like humanities computing and computer and writing, I
                     found digital humanities — and digital humanities found me — in its early years, not
                     long after the term “digital humanities” had been introduced through publication
                     of <cite class="title italic">The Blackwell Companion to Digital Humanities</cite> in
                     2004.<a class="noteRef" href="#d4e211">[2]</a>

                  <div class="ptext" id="p5">Becoming part of a conversation in its nascent moments, where terms of the engagement
                     were being hashed out in the early 2010s — and, unusually for academic discourse,
                     hashed out through Twitter hashtags — was empowering and discouraging in equal
                     measure, particularly when one comes to it as I did: as an answer to methodological
                     problems I encountered in Black Studies. I had not come to digital humanities through
                     the same routes of other digital humanists of my generation, many of whom were
                     graduate students at universities with senior digital humanities scholars, but by
                     accident.<a class="noteRef" href="#d4e223">[3]</a> Not having a pedigree
                     linking me to the emerging community of digital humanists was simultaneously
                     liberating and precarious. I was conscious — and anxious — that I didn’t have anyone
                     in the senior ranks to vouch for me,<a class="noteRef" href="#d4e229">[4]</a> but
                     I also had the freedom to raise concerns, at times pugnaciously, about where
                     discussions of race fit into digital humanities. During those early conversations
                     on
                     Twitter in the early 2010s, which accelerated the formation of digital humanities,
                     I
                     quickly realized that while two senior scholars — Amy Earhart and Tara
                     McPherson<a class="noteRef" href="#d4e236">[5]</a> — were asking trenchant questions about race, it
                     really wasn’t a topic that many white digital humanities wanted to touch. And, to
                     be
                     blunt, entering that conversation — particularly as a woman of color — was
                     terrifying.</div>

                  <div class="ptext" id="p6">Mercifully, I was not alone. While Twitter was a point of entry into the fray of
                     digital humanities, it was also where I began to find my people — other graduate
                     students of color, as well as senior allies and those in adjacent fields like new
                     media studies, who’d found their way to digital humanities and shared my concerns
                     about the ways that digital humanities elided questions of race and
                     colonialism.<a class="noteRef" href="#d4e241">[6]</a> We set about finding new
                     friends and building new worlds within digital humanities, hoping that the next
                     generation of graduate students working in Black studies and other ethnic studies
                     fields could find a place without having to fight to make a place. Starting in the
                     early 2010s, though this work remains ongoing, we created projects, organizations,
                     journals, and scholarship to clear space for digital humanities in many areas of
                     study — Black Studies, Caribbean studies, Latinx studies, Native and Indigenous
                     studies, postcolonial studies.<a class="noteRef" href="#d4e250">[7]</a>

                     address race in digital humanities in the early 2020s, these were tough conversations
                     in the late 2000s and early 2010s. As was explained to me in my early days in digital
                     humanities, the most visible, senior scholars in digital humanities had been toiling
                     in obscurity, their voices unheard, their scholarship misunderstood for so long. And
                     their work was finally being recognized — digital humanities had stepped onto the
                     red
                     carpet in our professional organizations, and it was <em class="emph">their</em> time. It was
                     not <em class="emph">our</em> time. </div>
                  
                  <div class="counter"><a href="#p8">8</a></div>
                  <div class="ptext" id="p8">I have never been swayed by arguments about whose “time” it is because power — in
                     this case, the power of academic discourse — operates precisely by dividing and
                     conquering competing claims. It forces a fictive sense of prioritization, the sense
                     that only one pressing need or concern can be at the forefront of conversation.
                     Instead, the question we should be examining is how addressing the operations of race
                     — and its relationship to gender, sexuality, nation, disability, and colonialism,
                     among others — is nothing less than a matter of scholarly integrity and must be put
                     at the center of digital humanities inquiry. </div>

                     this debate, I’m not sure anyone else is either. Today, digital cultural mapping
                     is such an accepted digital humanities practice, that it may seem odd that its
