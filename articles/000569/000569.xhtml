                  <p>
                     There is an increasing use of information visualization techniques in Digital Humanities
                     to support the analysis
                     of literary works. On the other hand, the rise of digital reading on the web as well
                     as the development of dedicated
                     e-book readers has triggered a variety of hardware and software solutions to provide
                     new reading environments and new
                     material engagements with textual forms. In this paper, we propose a new metaphor,
                     In-Out-In metaphor, to support the 
                     reading of literary works in a digital medium. Our model integrates information visualization
                     techniques with plain text
                     reading into the reading flow. This approach differs from the well-known dichotomy
                     between close and distant reading 
                     because its emphasis is not on supporting the analysis of the texts being read, but
                     on providing a smooth flow between
                     focus and digression, which naturally occurs during a reading experience. We present
                     a solution to read and explore the
                     <cite class="title italic">Book of Disquiet</cite> by Fernando Pessoa, an unfinished book composed of a set of modular texts that have
                     been edited in different
                     sequences and which can be read multi-sequentially. The research and design decisions
                     for the visual reader of the <cite class="title italic">Book of Disquiet</cite>
                     are meant to provide an appealing, rich and interactive online reading experience
                     through a web-based application, <a href="https://ldod.uc.pt/ldod-visual" onclick="window.open('https://ldod.uc.pt/ldod-visual'); return false" class="ref">LdoD Visual</a>. 
                     The implemented features apply information visualization techniques with an emphasis
                     on exploring the modular nature of the book.
                     Since this is a fragmentary literary work, its reading can be fragmentary as well,
                     but providing a smooth multiple flow reading experience.

                     work that was left unedited and unpublished by the author. In 1982, forty seven
                     years after Pessoa’s death (1935), its first edition was published
                     <a class="noteRef" href="#d4e232">[1]</a>. Since then, four major critical editions
                     of the book have appeared, showcasing significant disparities of interpretation
                     about how the book should be organized. Between 2012 and 2017, a team led by two
                     co-authors of this article (Manuel Portela and António Rito Silva) created the <cite class="title italic">LdoD Archive: A Collaborative Digital Archive of the Book of

                     realized the vision of an endlessly reconfigurable book. It is both a scholarly
                     digital edition and meta-edition that enables users to compare each version of the
                     <cite class="title italic">Book of Disquiet</cite> with all of the versions encoded in the
                     archive, and a virtual editing space designed with game-like principles for enabling
                     different types of users (experts, students, general readers) to make their own
                     editions and collections of the <cite class="title italic">Book of Disquiet</cite>. The stated
                     aim of this evolving archive is to experiment with computational forms of editing,
                     reading, and writing in ways that go beyond the bibliographic imagination

                  <div class="ptext" id="p2">The modularity of <cite class="title italic">The Book of Disquiet</cite> is, in fact, the
                     contingent result of material and historical features that tend to reinforce each
                     other: on one hand, each text is a self-contained unit that has no necessary
                     narrative continuity with other texts; on the other hand, there is no defined
                     ordering of the entire corpus of circa 600 pieces. Autograph textual units are also
                     in various stages of revision: first draft manuscripts, typescripts with manuscript
                     emendations, clean typescripts, twelve published texts. Pessoa only defined a few
                     textual clusters, and even those suffered changes over time during the two stages
                     of
                     composition (1913-1919; 1928-1934). Given this contingent modular nature of the
                     book, its fragments can be read regardless of any particular order, offering the
                     opportunity for a fragmentary reading of the book, that is, a practice of reading
                     that fosters divergent reading paths that can be built by the actual reader, instead
                     of following a typical sequential reading that is bound to happen in a rigidly
                     defined story sequence.</div>

                     between close and distant reading scales [<a class="ref" href="#janicke2015">Jänicke et al. 2015</a>], with the design of

                     as a reading medium [<a class="ref" href="#koolen2012">Koolen et al. 2012</a>]. We propose a new reading metaphor, the
                     In-Out-In metaphor, which integrates information visualization techniques with the
                     plain reading of the text, to support the focus-digress flow that structures the
                     embodied activity of the reader. By focus-digress flow we
                     mean that during the focus stage the reader is in the story, while the digress stage
                     corresponds to moments of self-consciousness of textual form, structure and
                     navigation, as well as associative thought processes, both of which interrupt

                     distinct aims in mind, including leisure reading, study and analysis, advanced

                     applied to a large domain of different areas, providing insight based on input data
                     with different perspectives, summarizing relationships, identifying and comparing

                     In this project, visualization has been conceived as a humanistic interface for
                     integrating different reading strategies and proving readers with a perception of
                     reading as the traversal of a semiotic space that is both topological and semantic,
                     and which is responsive to the readers’ agency [<a class="ref" href="#drucker2014">Drucker 2014</a>][<a class="ref" href="#murray2012">Murray 2012</a>].</div>

                     experience of a highly complex corpus of 600 texts. Its conception brings together
                     a
                     metaphoric model of the reading process, on one hand, and an algorithmic and

                        Visual</cite> as a reading interface, this article makes three related claims. We
                     argue that our computational model of reading interactions is adequate for
                     representing the multiplicity of reading traversals inherent in the <cite class="title italic">Book of Disquiet </cite>as a modular and open network of textual
                     sequences. We also claim that our model of the reading flow as a recurrent process
                     of immersion-emersion can be equated with the networked digital medium itself,
                     insofar as the continuous focus on strings of text required for immersion can be
                     smoothly integrated with the macrotextual logic of the visualizations facilitating
                     textual overviews, hypertextual connections, and frame jumps. Finally, we argue that
                     the ways for moving into, moving within, and moving out of the text provide a
                     satisfactory balance involving two scales of textual representation that could be
                     useful for other digital humanities projects of highly complex textual corpora. We
                     believe the ergonomic solution embodied in our reading interface explicitly
                     integrates close reading, hyper-reading, and machine reading [<a class="ref" href="#hayles2012">Hayles 2012</a>], and thus

                     sequential flow of textual strings on the page (they gravitate around the text, as
                     table of contents, footnotes, references, etc.), hypertext structures in digital
                     media alter the dynamics between self-contained and associative reading, as they can
                     place any textual string in direct relation to a multiplicity of other texts, thus
                     increasing the ratio of textual interruption. Links among disparate strings of text
                     become much more frequent, and readers follow networks of association in interrupted
                     and labyrinthine traversals. With the emergence of the World Wide Web as a
                     hypermedia environment in the 1990s and early 2000s, the integration of verbal text
                     into multimodal genres of communication continued to transform our media for
                     symbolic production and exchange. More recently, mobile social media and the
                     development of smartphones as multifunctional devices further extended this general
                     transformation of digital literacy. </div>

                     Moultrop and Dene Grigar (<span class="error"><a href="#moultrop2017">2017</a></span>) have asked four hypertext writers (Judy Malloy, John
                     McDaid, Shelley Jackson, and William Bly) to revisit their early work of the late
                     1980s and 1990s in order to recover the writing, programming, and reading mechanics
                     involved in their exploratory uses of specific machines and programs, including the
                     emerging conventions of the hyperlink as a resource for poetic and narrative

                     hypertext and algorithmic processes affect our reading expectations of texts as
                     holistic self-limited entities. The elusiveness of the textual whole is inherent in
                     the intricate topologies created not just by hyper-reading as an unbounded and

                     particularly relevant in the context of academic research or education. This tension
                     between continuity and discontinuity pervades all solutions, in which there is a
                     tradeoff between the smooth flow of reading and the possibility of analysis and
                     inquiry about what is being read. If we think of Digital Humanities as the coming

                     generate an abstract view of textual content, and as close reading techniques, which
                     rely mainly on annotations and the use of different colors and underlining styles
                     to

                     bridge these two perspectives so that the user can switch between close and distant
                     reading. This is mainly achieved by side-by-side visualizations of the text being
                     read and its meta-information, which make it possible to switch from a close reading
                     of a particular fragment to some kind of overview associated with specific metadata.

                     reading view where the text is represented because it has properties that are
                     analyzed in that distant reading mode [<a class="ref" href="#cheema2016">Cheema et al. 2016</a>]. This integration between

                     be
                     triggered, for example, by recalling what happened in previous chapters, picturing

                     description of a character or scenario, remembering a similar personal experience

                     comparison to a typical book where we have a rigidly defined story sequence, the<cite class="title italic">LdoD</cite> is a fragmentary literary work. This means that these

                     whole becomes a function of their reading acts. Self-contained textual units, when

                     and in-out-out-in subflows. An in-in subflow
                     corresponds to a situation when the user is accessing a fragment and accesses
                     another fragment, for instance, by switching to the previous page. This switch is
                     done according to the semantic criteria the user chose for
                     accessing the fragment, defined by the current user activity. For instance, if the
                     semantic criteria correspond to the set of fragments of a given category, the reader
                     will access another fragment belonging to the same category. An 
                     in-out-in subflow corresponds to a situation in which the user is
                     accessing a fragment, moves to the current user activity menu (to be described in
                     the next subsections) in which the reader has a complete view of the fragments
                     according to the same semantic criteria used to access the fragment being read. For
                     instance, if we consider the previous example, the complete view may show all
                     fragments that have the same category in the context of all fragments. An 
                     in-out-out-in subflow corresponds to a situation when the
                     reader stops reading, according to the current user activity, and chooses a new user
                     activity in which she continues to read.</div>

                     finding patterns, correlations and textual data insights, according to a
                     discontinuous and interruptive logic. Both of these reading practices are possible

                     activities' information visualization techniques, even though the first type of

                  <div class="ptext" id="p102">The <cite class="title italic">Book of Disquiet</cite> by Fernando Pessoa is an unfinished book
                     that can be read in any order. The modular nature of this fragmentary literary work
                     brings endless possibilities on how it can be traversed.The goal of this work was
                     to
                     design and implement a web-based application to read <cite class="title italic">The Book of
                        Disquiet</cite>, giving the reader an active role while reading and browsing
                     through the book's different fragments, defining user activities that make use of
                     information visualization techniques to encode different semantic criteria.</div>

                  <div class="ptext" id="p103">In order to achieve this, we researched on the use of information visualization
                     techniques applied to textual data and literature, and on the concept and tools for
                     e-books and web-based reading. Afterwards, we defined the in-out-in metaphor that was used as the guiding concept for whether or not
                     a certain architecture or feature choice met the objectives and served the overall
                     purpose of this work.</div>

                     a
                     perspective on how to read the book. A user activity is a combination of an
                     information visualization technique with a semantic criterion, where the latter is
                     used to classify the fragments and the former to visualize them according to the
                     classification. The solution architecture considers three types of user interfaces:
                     a user interface in which the user activity is selected; a global view in which the
                     fragments are visualized according to the chosen user activity; and a reading view
                     to support the reading and navigation between fragments, according to the chosen
                     semantic criteria.</div>

                     that it is possible to complete the defined tasks in the expected time and without
                     errors, and the utility tests also confirmed that the proposed metaphor meets the
                     experts’ vision of the book and how to explore its multiple paths of reading.</div>

                     the <cite class="title italic">LdoD Archive</cite> describes as “the simulation principle,”
                     that is, the ability to provide interactors with a reflexive engagement with the
                     textual environment [<a class="ref" href="#portela2020">Portela and Magalhães 2020</a>]. Through a recursive process of
                     going into the text and coming out of the text, readers are able to explore the <cite class="title italic">Book of Disquiet</cite> as a particular kind of reading experience
                     and they are also able to see how their acts of engaging with the text become
                     registered in the visualizations. The implemented visualization techniques thus
                     bring together the modularization of the text and the modularization of the reading
                     of the text.</div>

                     become an improved version of what it already accomplishes. One major improvement

                     preferably in the <cite class="title italic">LdoD Archive</cite>. This would be a logical
                     extension since the process of reading a book can take days, weeks or months.
                     Another improvement would be developing a feature to generate new virtual editions
                     according to specific reading paths. This would explore the <cite class="title italic">LdoD

                     conceptual design tool for modelling reading processes in digital media. The design
                     of interfaces for complex archives of literary materials based on this model would
                     have twofold benefits: limiting hypertextual disorientation, on one hand, and
                     supporting a meaningful transition between human and machine reading processes, on
                     the other, for both general and expert readers. In this light, the model of the

                     as a prototype of a specifically digital paratextual apparatus for the smooth and

                     until the late 1970s when they were acquired by the National Library of
                     Portugal. After this, the systematic cataloguing, editing, and
                     publication of his works became possible. Although several books had
                     been in circulation between the 1940s and the 1970s, namely those
                     including the poetry of his major heteronyms (Alberto Caeiro, Álvaro de
                     Campos, and Ricardo Reis), it was only in the 1980s that the critical
