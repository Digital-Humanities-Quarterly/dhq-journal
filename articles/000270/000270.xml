                <p>This paper presents the results of a study of 1,439 users of British History
                    Online (BHO). BHO is a digital library of key printed primary and secondary
                    sources for the history of Britain and Ireland, with a principal focus on the
                    period between 1300 and 1800. The collection currently contains 1,250 volumes,
                    and 120,000 web pages of material. During a website rebuild in 2014, the project
                    team asked its registered users about their preferences for searching and
                    browsing the content in the collection. Respondents were asked about their
                    current search and browsing behaviour, as well as their receptiveness to new
                    navigation options, including fuzzy searching, proximity searching, limiting
                    search to a subset of the collection, searching by publication metadata, and
                    searching entities within the texts such as person names, place names, or
                    footnotes. The study provides insight into the unique and often converging needs
                    of the site’s academic and genealogical users, noting that the former tended to
                    respond in favour of options that gave them greater control over the search
                    process, whereas the latter generally opted for options to improve the efficacy
                    of targeted keyword searching. Results and recommendations are offered.</p>

                    Online</title> (BHO) was seeking to rejuvenate its navigation and architecture
                after a decade in production and sought the direct feedback from its users to shape
                that process via a voluntary user survey of individuals who had registered accounts
                with the project. Volunteers were recruited through an email sent in May 2014 to all
                6,301 registered users of the site, which included those with paid subscriptions,
                but also those repeat users who opted to sign up for a free account to take
                advantage of bookmarking features. 1,439 people responded to the survey call,
                representing a response rate of 22.8%. This paper discusses the findings of that
                survey as well as how they provide us with new understanding of the different needs
                and expectations of academic historians and genealogical users of digital libraries
                and archives, providing a basis for future conversations on identifying user needs
                more broadly. </p>
            <p>BHO is a digital library of key printed primary and secondary sources for the history
                of Britain and Ireland, with a principal focus on the period between 1300 and 1800.
                The project is an initiative of the Institute of Historical Research, part of the
                University of London. The collection currently contains 1,250 volumes, and 120,000
                web pages of material (each comprising the equivalent of many <q>pages</q> of
                original printed work). The site has particular strengths in the late medieval and
                early modern periods up to about 1660, as well as a strong local history
                        collection.<note><title rend="quotes">About British History Online</title>,

                unique and typical of digitisation initiatives that contain primary or secondary
                source material.</p>


            <p>BHO is a product of an evolution in digitisation stretching back to early attempts at
                microfilming and microfiching in the last century, but also early digital text
                collections such as <title rend="italic">Project Gutenberg</title>
                <ptr target="#hart1971"/> as well as multimedia endeavours including the Electronic
                Beowulf project <ptr target="#kiernan1999"/>. It is also specifically the product of
                a set of British digitisation initiatives from the turn of the twenty-first century
                that focused on digitising British historical source material. These included <title
                    rend="italic">The Clergy of the Church of England Database</title>, <ptr
                    target="#burns1999"/>, <title rend="italic">The Old Bailey Online</title>
                <ptr target="#hitchcock2002"/>, and the <title rend="italic">Charles Booth Online
                    Archive</title>
                <ptr target="#donnelly2002"/> as well as <title rend="italic">Eighteenth Century
                    Collections Online</title>
                <ptr target="#anon1999"/> and <title rend="italic">Early English Books
                    Online</title>
                <ptr target="#anon2000"/> (see <ptr target="#hitchcock2008"/> for a fuller
                discussion of the digitisation landscape at the time). </p>
            <p>The approaches to digitisation, as well as searching, browsing, and access, naturally
                informed a subsequent wave of British historical digitisation projects, including
                most notably <title rend="italic">London Lives</title>
                <ptr target="#hitchcock2010"/> and <title rend="italic">Connected Histories</title>
                <ptr target="#hitchcock2011"/> and a number of commercial collaborations between the
                British Library and various partners, resulting in archives such as the digitised
                    <title rend="italic">Nineteenth Century Newspapers</title>
                <ptr target="#anon2007"/> and <title rend="italic">Burney Collection</title>
                <ptr target="#anon2009"/>. The project is also an important part of the technical
                revisionist reactions in the form of discrete re-curated datasets that eschew
                searchable databases entirely and instead focus on a mutable interpretation of a set
                of records as the new unit of dissemination <ptr target="#boulton2007"/>
                <ptr target="#crymbleetal2015"/>
                <ptr target="#howard2016"/>. </p>
            <p>These and similar projects have been engaged in ongoing conversations about search
                and browse that are more often expressed as websites or datasets than as journal
                articles. This paper takes those digital expressions and looks at it in the context
                of the extensive body of literature on user needs, as well as the findings of BHO’s
                own user survey on the search and browsing desires of its large user-base. </p>

            <p>After having launched in 2003, by early 2014 the site was beginning to show its age.
                At the time of writing, readers can find semi-functional archived copies of BHO via
                the <title rend="italic">Internet Archive</title>.<note><title rend="quotes">British

                Figure 1 shows a screenshot of the main page of the pre-development site. This old
                version of the site was navigable via keyword searching, or via browsing. Searching
                was the most popular option. The search feature compared to those found on most
                websites. At the time the rebuild began in early 2014, the site was navigable via a
                search box, powered by a physical Google Mini search server and based on common
                search algorithms used in 2010. Survey respondents from all three groups rated the
                search an average of 4 out of 5, suggesting they were happy (or at least
                comfortable) with the existing search capabilities.</p>

            <p>The search itself was possible because of the high quality transcriptions available
                in the BHO collection. The core collection had been built entirely using
                    <term>double-rekeying</term>, a process that involved two typists individually
                transcribing the texts, with the resultant work compared and differences between
                them reconciled manually. This resulted in a very high level of accuracy, as it is
                unlikely that two typists would make the same mistakes. The team believes that the
                content produced through double-rekeying has an accuracy level of more than 99.995
                        percent.<note><title rend="quotes">About British History Online</title>,

                double-rekeying approach, the corpus was relatively easy to keyword search - with
                the limits of keyword searching in mind, such as archaic spelling, abbreviations,

                    <q>administrative and legal</q> has been categorised distinctly from

                searching and browsing in a meaningful way, or to filter results by more than one
                tag. The options had become what Marcia Bates described as <quote rend="inline"
                    source="#bates2002">a hodgepodge of system elements working at
                    cross-purposes</quote> rather than an integrated searching and browsing
                environment <ptr target="#bates2002"/>.</p>
            <p>In order to improve these navigation options, the BHO team decided to seek feedback
                from its users on the types of features they wanted to be able to use to identify
                relevant records within the collection. Though the Internet is relatively young, a
                number of designers, computer scientists, and library and archive professionals have
                conducted research and written strategies for improving searching and browsing
                experiences for users of online collections. The studies include surveys such as the
                one conducted by BHO, as well as indirect monitoring of users with unobtrusive
                technologies such as eye-tracking or video recording <ptr target="#granka2004"/>;
                    <ptr target="#tullis2007"/>; <ptr target="#hill2011"/>. There are also a number
                of studies that implicitly gather feedback, using techniques such as what Agichtein
                and his colleagues called <quote rend="inline" source="#agichtein2006b"
                    >clickthrough interpretation</quote> (measuring which links someone chose to
                click on a given page) <ptr target="#agichtein2006b"/>; <ptr target="#joachims2007"
                />. Other forms of discrete monitoring include asking people to use computers fitted
                with tracking software <ptr target="#grace-martin2001"/>, analysing server logs <ptr
                    target="#bates1996"/>; <ptr target="#jansen2006"/>, or monitoring subjects in a
                lab setting <ptr target="#makinster2002"/>; <ptr target="#tsai2012"/>; <ptr
                    target="#hsu2014"/>. Claire Warwick and her colleagues, for example, conducted
                this form of discrete monitoring of web logs for the <title rend="quotes">Log
                    analysis of Internet resources in the Arts and Humanities</title> project, in an
                attempt to determine the digital use patterns of scholars in those fields <ptr
                    target="#warwick2008"/>. The growth in this implicit feedback analysis has
                contributed to the web analytics craze, in which free services such as <title
                    rend="quotes">Google Analytics</title> allow website owners to monitor their
                traffic and gather statistics on user demographics.<note><title rend="quotes">Google

                        >http://www.google.com/analytics</ref>.</note> Whether direct questionnaires
                or indirect monitoring are the most appropriate way to gather feedback is up for
                debate. Paul Samuelson argued instead for the power of <quote rend="inline"
                    source="#samuelson1948">revealed preference</quote>, which monitors what
                people want by looking at what they spend their money on <ptr
                    target="#samuelson1948"/>. As Harley and Henke warn, all approaches have their
                advantages and disadvantages; surveys may be inexpensive, but may not provide
                representative opinions, whereas analyses of transaction logs are less human and
                thus make it nearly impossible to infer the goals and intentions of users <ptr
                    target="#harley2007"/>.</p>
            <p>BHO opted for a survey because it was inexpensive and provided opportunities for a
                large cohort of users worldwide to offer their opinions in a targeted manner. This
                mode also allowed users to express preferences for new types of services that did
                not exist on the current website and may therefore be impossible to monitor by
                collecting data on current use. We also believed that it was important to listen to
                our users, many of whom had been using the service for a decade. As each new mode of
                searching or browsing requires additional metadata to be generated and stored about
                the records in the collection asking users in advance of their preferences made it
                possible to prioritise development.</p>
            <p>Searching and browsing within the context of information retrieval have long roots
                within discussions about libraries that extend far further back than the advent of
                the Internet. Should one search or browse to find the most pertinent resources for a
                project? The limits of the library itself – be that physical or digital – often
                impose limits on the researcher and make that decision for them. In the fictional
                fourteenth-century monastic library in Umberto Eco’s <title rend="italic">The Name
                    of the Rose</title>
                <ptr target="#eco2004"/>, it was the librarian who decided if you were worthy of
                finding what you sought. What you received from the restricted stacks in the
                labyrinth above the reading room came down to his judgment alone; he was the keeper
                of the knowledge as well as its search interface. As Barclay argued in 2010, that
                power relationship between librarian and reader remained until the middle of the
                twentieth century. He noted that browsable open stacks were not an <quote
                    rend="inline" source="#barclay2010">ancient scholarly right</quote>, but an
                invention that was <cit><quote rend="inline" source="#barclay2010">no older than the
                    baby-boomer faculty who so often lead the charge to keep books on
                campus</quote><ptr target="#barclay2010"/></cit>. Barclay sought to dispel what he called the myths of browsing,
                noting that the academic value of browsing the stacks was already compromised by the
                large number of missing and stolen books, books currently in use by other readers,
                and by the very fact that many people cannot be bothered to look at items on the top
                or bottom shelves <ptr target="#barclay2010"/>. Barclay believed that new electronic
                search capabilities would enable scholars to continue to find books held in remote
                storage.</p>
            <p>Some researchers long before Barclay saw the potential of search, including Bruce
                Schatz, who in 1997 predicted that by 2010 we would have <cit>
                    <quote rend="inline" source="#schatz1997">concept searching enabling semantic
                        retrieval across large collections</quote>
                    <ptr target="#schatz1997"/>
                </cit>. Schatz was a bit premature in his prediction, but concept or semantic
                searching has recently become more important, as it becomes clear that what we want
                from a collection is a relevant document rather than a document that contains a
                particular keyword. For Dan Cohen, to the question, <quote rend="inline"
                    source="#cohen2010">is Google good for history</quote>, his answer was simply: <cit>
                    <quote rend="inline" source="#cohen2010">of course</quote>
                    <ptr target="#cohen2010"/>
                </cit>. While Jesse Shera, writing in 1964 noted that <quote rend="inline"
                    source="#shera1964">the automation of libraries through the use of computers
                    and book-finding robots is 'pure fantasy'</quote>, the digital era has certainly
                needed to meet some of those challenges <ptr target="#shera1964"/>. Users of online
                archives and libraries need to be in possession of all the tools that they need to
                help find what they are after.</p>
            <p>Not everyone agreed with Dan Cohen’s enthusiasm; even as early as 1985, Champlin
                warned of the <quote rend="inline" source="#champlin1985">perils and
                    pitfalls</quote> of online search, arguing for the importance of print indexes
                and abstracts for researchers <ptr target="#champlin1985"/>. A survey of historians’
                preferences by Ian Andersen in 2004 showed that little had changed, with print-based
                finding aids and <q>informal leads</q> from colleagues or librarians the preferred
                information retrieval strategy of scholars in that study <ptr target="#anderson2004"
                />. Many scholars used browsing and shelf proximity as part of their information
                retrieval strategy. Richard Mott countered Barclay’s arguments about the limits of
                browsing by highlighting the practice of obtaining call numbers as a way of
                identifying an appropriate shelf to begin browsing. Mott believed that it was <cit>
                    <quote rend="inline" source="#mott2010">not uncommon for this browsing to yield
                        relevant sources that electronic searching alone misses</quote>
                    <ptr target="#mott2010"/>
                </cit>. This is the principle of serendipity in discovery. Stephen Ramsay calls it
                    <quote rend="inline" source="#ramsay2010">screwing around</quote>. For Ramsay,
                browsing is an important part of the scholarly process, which prevents us from
                focusing solely on the predefined literary canon. He urges us to take time to wander
                the library and grab things that seem like they might be interesting, as a means to
                discovering new knowledge or unexamined connections <ptr target="#ramsay2010"/>.</p>
            <p>Within the world of online libraries, Maxwell argued that simple browsing was more
                important than keyword searching <ptr target="#maxwell2010"/>. Grey and Hurko echoed
                those same warnings, suggesting that controlled subject searching was more effective
                than keyword searching for research, which of course necessitates a good set of
                controlled subjects built into the collection <ptr target="#grey2012"/>. Collins and
                her colleagues noted that researcher uptake of new digital modes of research
                depended heavily on what was considered normal and acceptable within their
                discipline <ptr target="#collins2012"/>. These disciplinary standards in history
                were well entrenched; in 2003, a survey of 278 historians by Dalton and Charnigo
                found that while 58% of respondents used websites for their research, only 3%
                believed it was the most important way they conducted research, lagging far behind
                traditional finding aids, footnotes, and archival or library catalogues <ptr
                    target="#dalton2004"/>; <ptr target="#hamburger2004"/>. The four million annual
                users of BHO suggests that acceptance of digital resources may have moved forwards
                in the past decade. Genealogists, despite tending to be older, have always been more
                willing to engage with digital sources than their academic historian cousins <ptr
                    target="#duff2001"/>. Nevertheless, the question remained: how do these users
                    <emph>want</emph> to be able to explore the collection in ways that they could
                not do on the pre-development version of the BHO website? </p>
            <p>Since its launch in 2003, BHO has developed a strong user-base that has been
                attracted to the historical content on the website. In the project year 2013-14
                (August – July), the site received more than 4-million visits from 2.7 million
                unique visitors. Most visitors are anonymous, however, BHO's users can largely be
                classified into three categories: academic historians, genealogists, and casual
                users. Each group comes to the site with different expectations and needs from the
                collection.</p>
            <p>Academic historians use the digital library to conduct historical research that is
                destined for peer-reviewed publication or postgraduate theses. Many of these users
                are attracted to the subscription-only materials such as the <title rend="italic"
                    >Calendar of State Papers</title>, or the <title rend="italic">Calendars of
                    Close Rolls</title>. This subscription content comprises twenty percent of the
                material on BHO, and is targeted at these academic users.<note><title rend="quotes"

                respondents (25%) classified themselves as academics or students. The majority of
                academic users were between the ages of 55 and 74 years, with people under the age
                of 55 accounting for most of the outliers (see Figure 2). Nearly six in ten
                identified as male.</p>
            <p>Genealogists or family historians are the second main group of users. They tend to
                use the site to look for details of their family's past, and are generally attracted
                to the <title rend="italic">Ordnance Survey Maps</title>, as well as the local
                history resources about the communities in which their relatives lived. 737
                respondents (51%) classified themselves as genealogists. Genealogical users were
                typically older than the academic users. The majority were between 55 and 74, but
                the largest group was older than 65, and there was a large group older than 75
                years. Very few users were under 45. The split between male and female respondents
                was equal, unlike amongst academics.</p>
            <p>The third group is best described as casual users, a large number of whom arrive via
                search engines or sites such as <title rend="italic">Wikipedia</title>
                <ptr target="#blaney2013"/>. The group includes journalists looking for stories,
                business owners interested in the heritage of their premises, historical video game
                makers researching historical context for upcoming projects, and people reading for
                enjoyment. 348 respondents (24%) decided not to classify themselves under one of the
                above headings or felt the headings did not apply to them. Their age profile most
                closely mirrors the academic users, and suggests that most of them are not amongst
                the genealogical group. Given the fact that most users heard about the survey via an
                email to the address they used to register with BHO, it is likely that many of the
                people in this category were repeat users. Because the needs and interests of the
                casual users are so diverse, they are the most difficult to pin down. While the
                discussion in this paper will include the views of the respondents from this group,
                they will not be the study’s core focus.</p>
            <p>As the average age of BHO users is older than the typical web user, age may be
                pertinent to a full understanding of the survey results and search and browse
                preferences. There is a large body of literature that studies the web needs of older
                web users, or <q>silver surfers</q> as they have been called in the past. Much of
                this research was done in the early years of the 2000s and focused on the cognitive,
                physical, and sensory decline of the elderly, as well as on ways to address the
                alleged <q>fear</q> older people have of technology <ptr target="#darin2000"/>; <ptr
                    target="#morrell2000"/>; <ptr target="#zajicek2001"/>; <ptr

                />; <ptr target="#hill2011"/>. This literature, most of it presumably written by
                academics under the age of 75, while good intentioned, can at times be patronising
                and is perhaps less apt for today’s <q>silver surfer</q> who may have been in his or
                her forties when the web first became popular, and thus has decades of experience
                with the Internet. From the perspective of the BHO project team, it was not so much
                the age of these users that was important, but how these different groups wanted to
                navigate online collections like BHO. </p>

            <p>To get a better understanding of respondents, users were asked how frequently they
                used the site. Results can be seen in Figure 3. The most common answer in all three
                groups was that they used the site <q>occasionally</q> (31% academics, 46%
                genealogists, 32% casual users). Academics were considerably more likely to think of
                themselves as regular users, opting for the <q>often</q> or <q>very often</q>
                categories twice for every genealogist respondent (37% academic versus 15%
                genealogist and 21% casual users).</p>

                <graphic url="resources/images/figure02.jpg"/>
            </figure>

            <p>A majority of all users were based in the UK or Ireland (66%), with casual users
                showing even higher levels of local use – See Figure 3. North Americans comprised 19
                percent of respondents, with academics proportionately more likely to be North
                Americans taking advantage of research materials that for them may have been
                overseas. Only 9 percent of respondents were from Oceania, with a clear majority of
                them using the site for genealogical reasons. Europeans were rare and generally were
                academics. Respondents from the rest of the world were very rare.</p>


            <p>The respondents of the survey are therefore of an older set of Internet users,
                typically over the age of 55, and mostly British and Irish. Academic users are more
                likely to be heavy users of the site, and are more male than female. Genealogical
                users are occasional visitors, and have no discernible gender variance. </p>

            <p>The rest of this paper discusses the project team’s findings derived from the survey. </p>

                <p>Respondents were asked about their current preference for finding information
                    stored online in sites like BHO (for full data see Appendix I), as well as their
                    wishes for the future (see Appendix II). With regards to current preferences,
                    respondents were asked whether they <q>never</q>, <q>rarely</q>,
                        <q>sometimes</q>, <q>often</q>, or <q>very often</q> used the following
                    discovery methods:</p>

                <p>Searching was more popular than browsing for all three user groups (see Figure
                    4). The ubiquity of search on the Internet means that keyword searching is
                    currently a must for digital libraries. In this case, that means full-text
                    searching whenever possible. Simple keyword searching was more popular than
                    advanced keyword searching for all three user groups. More than half of all
                    users ranked simple keyword searching as a popular option for them. There was
                    very little variation between the groups. Nine in ten respondents claimed at
                    least occasional use of this type of feature. Given the overwhelming level of
                    search on the Internet, the project team members are skeptical of the 44 people
                    (3.25%) who claimed <q>never</q> to use simple keyword searching on sites such
                    as BHO.</p>
                <p>Advanced keyword searching was also popular with most users, but was most popular
                    amongst academic users, of whom 53% claimed to often or very often use this form
                    of searching, and 83.5% at least sometimes did so. Academics are probably more
                    likely than the other groups to overestimate or overemphasize their use of this
                    feature, as it is generally viewed as the more <q>scholarly</q> approach, so
                    this finding should probably be viewed as user reporting of their preferences
                    rather than actual usage patterns. Genealogical users were slightly less likely
                    to use advanced searching, and used it considerably less often than simple
                    keyword searching. However, reported use in this group was still high. Casual
                    users were least likely to use advanced keyword searching, but a majority still
                    claimed to do so. Encouraging more uptake may require increased training, as one
                    respondent noted that <said>the advanced keyword searching has never worked for
                        me. There is not enough explanation</said>. Many academic users receive such
                    training as part of library short courses or induction training for new
                    students, but these options are less likely to find their way into the general
                    public’s hands. Despite these slight variations, the overall message is that
                    digital library users overwhelmingly like some form of keyword searching and
                    that both simple and advanced options are used by a majority of users.</p>
                <p>Though still supported by a majority of users, browsing was less popular than
                    searching and showed considerably more variation between the groups. Academic
                    users were more keen on browsing options, with more than a third declaring
                    browsing by subject a popular option, and marginally fewer stating the same of
                    browsing by publication. This suggests that academic users are interested in
                    using digital libraries to find and read copies of specific books, and that they
                    might be amenable to serendipitous discovery via a well-designed taxonomy system
                    of subject headings. This finding implies that Richard Mott’s arguments in
                    favour of using shelf proximity for finding relevant works in physical libraries
                    may also have value for users of digital libraries <ptr target="#mott2010"/>.
                    Academic interest in browsing also suggests a desire for thoroughness, to ensure
                    all possible relevant works have been discovered and exploited, and that a
                    search box cannot be trusted to reach that level of diligence.</p>
                <p>Genealogists were slightly more interested in browsing by subject than were
                    casual users, and both were slightly less interested than academics, but not
                    substantially so. However, there were significant differences in preferences for
                    browsing by title, with genealogical users far less interested in this form of
                    discovery (popular: 13.5%) than academics (popular: 30%) and casual users
                    (popular: 21%). This may be explained by the different goals of genealogical
                    users, most of whom are looking for answers or information about their family or
                    the communities in which they lived, and are not as interested in the source of
                    that information. A majority of genealogical users stated that browsing by
                    publication was an unfavoured option. Depending on the type of users a digital
                    library attracts, these differences in preference are important to consider when
                    building a service.</p>
                <p>Finally, users were asked about their preference for arriving at sites like BHO
                    via a library catalogue or an external site such as <title rend="italic"
                        >Wikipedia</title> or a search engine such as <title rend="italic"
                        >Google</title>. This option was overwhelmingly unfavoured, with a clear
                    majority in all three groups rejecting this idea. This outcome does not
                    necessarily preclude the importance of external linking, or of integrating
                    content from online libraries into library catalogues, and BHO’s anonymised
                    traffic logs suggest that this is an important driver of traffic. Some of the
                    comments left by survey respondents confirm this, with one person noting that
                    they often searched commercial search engines for <said>keywords that I know are
                        on your site</said>, bypassing the need to arrive first at BHO before diving
                    into the collection. While this may be an important supplementary source of
                    traffic for digital libraries, the survey results do suggest that most users
                    prefer to have the option of navigating a digital library via the site’s own
                    navigation system rather than relying on indexing or linking from elsewhere.
                    This suggests that users are interested in maintaining access to what have
                    become known as <term>siloed</term> websites containing discretely curated
                    collections, and are perhaps not yet on board with the movement towards
                    aggregated search websites such as <title rend="italic">Connected
                        Histories</title>, which allow users to search a number of repositories from
                    a single search box <ptr target="#hitchcock2011"/>.</p>

                <head>Rating of New Search Features</head>
                <p>In the past decade there have been a number of changes in search technology and
                    entity extraction, allowing people to focus their search results in new ways.
                    The BHO team curated a subset of these options that we felt were appropriate to
                    the historical collection under our management and respondents were asked to
                    rate the likelihood that they would use twelve search features if they were
                    added to the BHO website. The search features can be broken into four
                    categories:</p>

                    <p>A number of algorithms have been developed or are under development that seek
                        to improve search results, but also to give users the power to control
                        factors that help determine what matches are returned. Among those
                        increasingly familiar to users of digital libraries and archives are
                            <term>fuzzy searching</term> and <term>proximity searching</term>.</p>
                    <p>Fuzzy searching is common on websites containing poor quality optical
                        character recognition (OCR), which is an algorithmic means of converting
                        digital scans or photographs of text to machine readable and search engine
                        indexable text that can be searched by web users. A number of genealogical
                        websites and historical databases such as historical newspaper repositories
                        use fuzzy searching because the quality of the OCR is often quite poor. </p>
                    <p>Most commercial databases containing historical source material were produced
                        using OCR and have varying degrees of accuracy.<note>For more on OCR and
                            historical texts, see Michael Piotrowski, <title rend="quotes">Chapter

                        near-perfect accuracy levels, but the tests those companies conduct to make
                        those claims are almost certainly done using modern fonts on crisp white
                        sheets of paper and are perhaps more suited to the needs of a legal office
                        than a library or archives seeking to digitize historical materials en
                        masse. When the <title rend="italic">Australian Newspapers Digitisation
                            Program </title> (also known as <title rend="italic">Trove</title>),
                        undertook one of the world’s largest digitisation projects to date in 2007,
                        they discovered their historical newspapers introduced problems that the
                        commercial OCR software at the time had difficulty handling. These included
                        issues with deteriorating inks, highly complex layouts, and narrow space
                        between lines, columns, and gutters, as well as problems with the microfilm
                        that stored the newspapers being digitised. These microfilms may have been
                        second or third generation copies, poorly focused, and dirty or scratched
                            <ptr target="#holley2007"/>. Combined, these issues made OCR accuracy a
                        concern. </p>

                        had team members manually check for errors in the OCR of digitised newspaper

                        be split into three groups based on average character accuracy, the results

                    <p>For many, these numbers may seem high and are perhaps good enough. This is
                        particularly the case when we consider the scale of the task involved.
                        However, it is worth considering the following sentence has an 80% average
                        character accuracy:</p>
                    <p>Tnis ls whot eigkty percemt accurecy louks lilce</p>
                    <p>At that level of accuracy, a human reader should be able to make out the
                        sentence. But which keywords could you use to find it in a larger text? The
                        problem is not merely with the level of accuracy, but also with the level of
                        accuracy in key places; specifically, as a user you want to know that the
                        keywords you seek have been accurately transcribed by the software. In the
                        example above, using another measure known as <term>average word
                            accuracy</term>, the accuracy drops to 0%, making the transcription
                        nearly useless for anyone attempting a keyword search.</p>
                    <p>This is what ninety-eigkt percent accuracy looks like</p>
                    <p>This second example, at 98% average character accuracy, is certainly an
                        improvement, but still leaves those searching for “ninety-eight” without the
                        level of accuracy needed for their project. Fuzzy searching works by
                        incorporating spelling variations within its algorithm, focusing
                        specifically on combinations of characters for which there are known OCR
                        problems, such as <q>rn</q> (R N), which can often be interpreted as a lower
                        case <q>m</q> by the software. This increases the chance, but does not
                        guarantee that a user can overcome errors in automatic transcription (see
                            <ptr target="#myka1996"/>; <ptr target="#rares2009"/>). </p>
                    <p>The option is also helpful for users seeking family or place names that may
                        not have been spelled properly, were spelled phonetically, or may have used
                        archaic spelling. For example, the surname <q>Kedgley</q> might also be
                        spelled <q>Kegley</q>, <q>Kedglee</q>, or <q>Kidglie</q> and may still refer
                        to the same historical individual <ptr target="#titford2005"/>. A fuzzy
                        search algorithm trained using the <term>Soundex Algorithm</term> for
                        converting English words to their composite phonemes can make it possible to
                        fuzzy search for words that most likely sound like the search term but that
                        may look quite distinct <ptr target="#russell1918"/>. It is also
                        particularly helpful for early modern and medieval texts that were created
                        before the push to standardise the English language in the eighteenth
                        century. Techniques such as this often use Levenshtein distance, which can
                        aid in this process of identifying similar words. Levenshtein distance
                        calculates the number of changes it takes to turn one word into another. For
                        example, changing <hi rend="italic">Water</hi> into <hi rend="italic"
                            >Wine</hi> takes three changes (change <q>a</q> to <q>i</q>, <q>t</q> to
                            <q>n</q>, and remove <q>r</q>). A word with a Levenshtein distance of
                        three is almost certainly a distinct English word, but as in the example
                        above of <q>Kedgley</q> and <q>Kegley</q>, could be a useful way of
                        identifying good alternative results. </p>
                    <p>Though the texts in BHO were not transcribed via OCR and contain very high
                        levels of accuracy, many of them use medieval and early modern language, and
                        thus users could potentially benefit from a fuzzy search option. A large
                        majority of survey respondents agreed, with very little variation between
                        the three groups of users. Academics were slightly more likely than other
                        users to really want this feature, but support was high in all groups, with
                        more than half of respondents rating it <q>quite useful</q> or <q>I’d like
                            to have that</q> and only a quarter unsure about its benefits (see
                        Figure 5). The levels of support certainly suggest that builders of online
                        libraries should experiment with the value that fuzzy searching could
                        provide for their collection, or at least make the limits of their search
                        options clear if this feature is not available so that users are aware of
                        the potential pitfalls of relying on the search box.</p>

                    <p>Proximity searching is another algorithm designed to give users the power to
                        define search parameters <ptr target="#schenkel2007"/>. It is as yet less
                        common than fuzzy searching. The option allows users searching for multiple
                        keywords to limit the distance between them, ignoring results that appear
                        too far apart as well as helps searchers avoid overly specific search
                        parameters that might otherwise miss pertinent information. For example,
                        someone interested in Caroline of Brunswick, the wife of King George IV,
                        might search for <q>Caroline of Brunswick</q> as she was commonly known.
                        However, her full name was <q>Caroline Amelia Elizabeth of
                            Brunswick-Wolfenbüttel</q>, and a strict search for <q>Caroline of
                            Brunswick</q> would miss that result. By using a proximity search for
                            <q>Caroline</q> and <q>Brunswick</q> limited to within five or perhaps
                        ten words of one another, the match would find both patterns.</p>
                    <p>At the other extreme, proximity search is useful for preventing irrelevant
                        matches of unrelated words that appear far from one another in a text. This
                        is particularly useful for web pages containing whole chapters of text, or
                        perhaps even full books. These particularly long pages will be inordinately
                        likely to match a set of two or more keywords than will a short page, purely
                        based on the number of unique words. This means a user searching for <q>blue
                            dog</q> (without quotes) in the BHO website will currently be directed
                        to a chapter on the London village of Rotherhithe in <title rend="italic"
                            >Old and New London, Volume 6</title>, where both the words <q>blue</q>
                        and <q>dog</q> appear, but not in a context in which one is related to the
                        other. Instead, blue refers to <q>Blue Anchor Road</q>, and <q>dog</q>
                        refers to the <q>Dog and Duck</q> tavern, much further down the page <ptr
                            target="#walford1878"/>. This masks the real entry of interest: a
                            <q>blue dog</q> allegedly given to Thomas Cave by Thomas Cromwell on the
                            8<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> of July 1528 <ptr
                            target="#henryviii1528"/>.</p>
                    <p>As much of the collection on British History Online includes chapter length
                        works on a single webpage, this is a particular problem for users searching
                        for multiple terms, especially if one of those terms happens to be a fairly
                        common word in the collection, such as the name of a British place, or a
                        common noun. To ultimately solve these challenges, the makers of search
                        algorithms are turning towards semantic search options that looks for what
                        the user is actually interested in finding rather than the sometimes
                        ambiguous keyword they happened to type into the search box. Instead of
                        asking for documents containing a keyword, you could look for documents
                        about the concept embodied by that keyword, which may not contain the word
                        at all <ptr target="#crymble2015"/>. These techniques rely on gazetteers, or
                        lists of words that are associated with certain concepts. This leverages the
                        idea of the thesaurus: that there is more than one way to express an idea
                        with different words. The <title rend="quotes">Semantic Annotation and
                            Mark-Up for Enhancing Lexical Searches</title> or SAMUELS project
                        currently underway at the University of Glasgow is taking this approach as
                        it seeks to <cit>
                            <quote rend="inline" source="#alexander2015">deliver a system for
                                automatically annotating words in texts with their precise meanings,

                            <ptr target="#alexander2015"/>
                        </cit>. Instead of searching for one or two keywords, the algorithm can
                        search for dozens or hundreds of related terms at the same time, and present
                        the user with a wider range of potentially relevant materials. The SAMUELS
                        project relies on historical thesauri, putting the word in the context of
                        its surrounding words to assign it to a metaphor: a word or series of words
                        with an abstract meaning that captures the intent of the person expressing
                        that idea.</p>
                    <p>While these more advanced options are in development, in the meantime,
                        proximity searching gives users the power to set some limits on the matches
                        the search engine will find. Proximity searching saw very similar levels of
                        support amongst survey respondents to those expressed about fuzzy searching.
                        More than half chose the top two categories of preference, and again roughly
                        a quarter were unconvinced. Like fuzzy searching, academic users were
                        slightly more likely to say they would <q>really like to have</q> the
                        feature (31% academic; 20% genealogist; 24% casual users). This suggests
                        that some academic users in particular are looking to be given more control
                        over the types of results they receive from a search engine. </p>
                    <p>Whether or not it is feasible to integrate this type of advanced searching
                        option into an online library website largely depends upon its availability
                        as a setting choice on the search engine software employed by the project.
                        Open source search engine Apache Solr currently allows this type of feature
                        to be turned on by administrators, rather than built from scratch, so
                        parties developing online libraries should both interrogate the needs of
                        their users, but also the features available on various search engine
                        packages before investing in a solution.<note><title rend="quotes">Apache

                    <p>The opportunity to exclude certain parts of a collection from a search could
                        reduce the number of unwanted results rather dramatically for a user.
                        Respondents were asked how useful it would be to limit their searches to
                        certain types of content (only text, or only maps), to search only within a
                        series of works (such as the <title rend="italic">Survey of London
                        </title>or <title rend="italic">Calendar of Treasury Books</title> series),
                        or to search only <q>free content</q> (non-subscription

                        These particular questions were chosen with the BHO website in mind, but the
                        project team believes that they are representative of the broader desire to
                        have the ability to ignore part of the collection in the searching process.
                        Respondents to the survey generally viewed these limiting options
                        favourably. A majority of users in all user categories chose to rank all of
                        these options <q>moderately useful</q> or better (see Figure 6). </p>
                    <p>Searching by type of content was considered useful for all types of users,
                        with very little variation between them. One in five users in all categories
                        stated that they would <q>really like to have</q> the option to exclude
                        content of certain media types. Nearly seven in ten felt it was at least
                        moderately useful. The BHO collection contains a large textual corpus which
                        is split into <q>primary sources</q>, <q>secondary texts</q>, <q>guides and
                            calendars</q>, and <q>datasets</q>.<note><title rend="quotes">Browse

                        collection also contains a substantial set of historical maps, principally
                        the <title rend="italic">Ordnance Survey</title> maps of Britain, as well as
                        some early modern maps of London, which are necessarily more difficult to

                        user only interested in primary source material might therefore benefit from

                    <p>Searching within a bibliographic series was less popular than searching by
                        content type, and was considerably more popular amongst academic users than
                        genealogists. More than six in ten academics ranked this option <q>quite
                            useful</q> or better, compared to only four in ten genealogists. Nearly
                        thirteen per cent of genealogists said they would <q>never</q> use this
                        feature, again suggesting that for a genealogist, finding information about
                        a person or place of interest far exceeds the importance of where that match
                        came from. Casual users were much more like academics in their preferences,
                        suggesting that it is the genealogists who are unique in their attitudes
                        towards this option.</p>
                    <p>Limiting searches to <q>free</q> or non-subscription content was more
                        polarising than the other options. Academics were generally uninterested in
                        this option, with 17.5% claiming that they would never use this feature –
                        more than double the rate expressed by the other two groups. Genealogists
                        were far more likely to want this option, with nearly seven in ten rating it
                            <q>moderately useful</q> to <q>I’d really like to have this</q>. Casual
                        users’ preferences fell in between those of the other two groups. The
                        reactions to a <q>free content search</q> are perhaps the most interesting
                        of the options in this category, suggesting that academic users think that
                        they are prepared to access material even if it will incur a cost, as
                        thoroughness is of the utmost importance. Another explanation may be known
                        trends in BHO subscribers. A number of academic libraries around the world
                        subscribe to BHO on behalf of their staff and students, meaning that a
                        higher proportion of academic respondents may already have access to the
                        subscription material and therefore see no value in restricting their search
                        thus. The results could also suggest that many genealogical users may prefer
                        to remain in the dark about matches they cannot see, rather than find
                        themselves frustrated by a tantalizing match that will cost them money.
                        Without the option of following up with users, this is merely speculation,
                        but the clear differences in preference for this type of feature suggests
                        digital libraries and archives need to consider their audiences carefully
                        when deciding if they will integrate it.</p>

                                >http://www.loc.gov/standards/mods/</ref>.</note> If good metadata
                        standards are adhered to and good data collected, these fields could be
                        useful to people interested in searching the collection in particular ways.
                        For example, someone might want to search only the title of a book rather
                        than the full text of the entire collection. Or they may be looking for
                        works by a particular author, or published in a certain city, or by a
                        certain publisher. For a typical user, it may prove unhelpful to find only
                        work published by eighteenth century bookseller Thomas Cadell, but for the
                        right research project that ability may prove invaluable. </p>
                    <p>As extra metadata fields for a publication add extra time and therefore extra
                        cost to the cataloguing process, the value of this for a particular site
                        should be weighed carefully. Extra fields in the search interface also
                        require a way of integrating the option into the design of the site, and too
                        many such options may prove for a less effective user interface. To test the
                        appetite for this type of metadata field searching, the survey asked
                        respondents to rank the usefulness of being able to search by two such
                        fields: title, and publication date.</p>
                    <p>As can be seen in Figure 7, searching by title was a considerably more
                        popular option than searching by publication date. This is perhaps not
                        surprising, as the ability to search by title is consistent with options
                        available in many digital library catalogues. A large majority of academic
                        users, but also casual users, wanted the ability to search by title, while
                        far fewer genealogists wanted the option, which is again consistent with
                        genealogical needs to find content rather than to read widely. While the
                        survey could have asked about many other metadata fields, we felt that these
                        two represented an obviously and less obviously useful option, and the user
                        responses reflected that. This suggests that developers will want to choose
                        carefully which if any metadata fields are exposed to search options for
                        users, as some are unlikely to find wide user-bases.</p>

                    </figure>


                    <p>Tagging entities within the text also makes it possible to allow users to
                        search only those entities. For example, many genealogical websites have
                        tagged the names of people and places, knowing that these variables are
                        often useful for finding relatives. People with names that are the same as
                        common English words can be difficult to find without this option. This
                        requires identifying the entities in the corpus and annotating them or
                        indexing them first. This can be done in a semi-automated fashion using
                        named entity recognition, also known as <term>term extraction</term>, but to
                        achieve a high degree of accuracy, it often requires extensive manual markup
                        and editing <ptr target="#vanhooland2013"/>; <ptr target="#freire2012"/>.
                        Once all instances of names are extracted, this information can be opened up
                        for searching by the search engine administrator, but as it requires a
                        significant investment of time and money, it is important to determine
                        whether or not a community would find such a feature useful before
                        proceeding. Respondents to the survey rated five different entity extraction
                        options: searching by person name, searching by place, search by the date of
                        the subject matter covered in a work (as opposed to the publication date),
                        search using geographic coordinates (latitude or longitude), and search only
                        the footnotes (possibly useful for looking for references).</p>
                    <p>As can be seen in Figure 8, these were not universally popular, though apart
                        from searching by the date of the subject matter, opinions about each option
                        were almost universally consistent between the three user groups and have
                        thus been depicted together in the figure (full data in Appendix II).
                        Searching by person name and place name were incredibly popular options
                        across the board, with six in ten people stating they would <q>really like
                            to have this</q> option, and only 1 in ten showing little or no
                        interest. It was not surprising to see high levels of enthusiasm amongst
                        genealogical users, but it was more surprising that academics and casual
                        users were also interested in these features. This result suggests that
                        people are not <q>reading</q> books in these online environment as they
                        might in a physical library, but are instead looking for references to
                        specific people or places – though this cannot be fully substantiated from
                        the data available in this survey.</p>
                    <p>Searching by geographic coordinates and searching footnotes only were both
                        unpopular options. More than four in ten people said they would never use
                        the <q>geographic coordinates</q> search, and only about one in ten thought
                        it was a particularly good idea. Users are perhaps too used to the value of
                        keywords, and are not yet thinking in terms of being able to search for
                        works about a place that may not be explicitly mentioned in a text – eg,
                        within five miles of X. The footnotes only searching was only marginally
                        more popular with about fifteen percent of users wanting to see this
                        feature. Not surprisingly, academics were more likely to want to search just
                        the footnotes, presumably to identify other potential references worth
                        pursuing. About 43 percent of academics ranked the option <q>moderately
                            useful</q> or better, compared to only 30 percent of genealogists.</p>
                    <p>Finally, date of subject matter, which has been split into the three distinct
                        user groups in Figure 8, shows the academics and casual users with
                        remarkably similar preferences, as has often been the case throughout this
                        study. Both academics and casual users were fairly supportive of the ability
                        to search by the date of events discussed in the texts, with a clear
                        majority in favour, while only 45 percent of genealogists felt the same
                        way.</p>
                    <p>The outcome of this question shows that entity extraction is an incredibly
                        popular option for digital library users, but that not all forms are as
                        popular as others, so understanding the project’s user base is
                        important.</p>

                <head>Conclusions</head>
                <p>The results of this survey show that genealogists are primarily interested in
                    names of people and names of places related to their search. They do not seem to
                    be interested in reading material, or even what the source of the material is,
                    as long as it contains the details they are after. Searching free content only
                    was more important to genealogists than it was to academics and casual
                    users.</p>
                <p>Academic users are in many respects very similar to casual users. They, perhaps
                    unsurprisingly, tend to be drawn to more control over aspects of searching and
                    browsing that will allow them to scour a collection systematically. They seem
                    less willing to trust the search and browse features, so they claim to like
                    options that put them in control.</p>
                <p>Overall, all three groups have clear preferences for searching by name and by
                    place, and they are generally in favour of searching by the date of the subject
                    matter. They strongly support fuzzy searching and proximity searching. Whenever
                    possible, they prefer to conduct simple keyword searches, but they prefer
                    advanced searching to browsing – again implying they are after snippets rather
                    than a traditional reading experience. Being able to limit the search to
                    predefined subsets of the collection, including by content type or by
                    bibliographic series was popular.</p>
                <p>By contrast, they do not like to have to rely on external search engines or
                    library catalogues, and would rather interact directly with the navigation
                    features of the digital library. They saw little value in being able to search
                    by geolocation coordinates or to search within the footnotes of the collection
                    only. While they were in favour of searching by title, they were less interested
                    in searching by publication date, suggesting not all publication metadata was of
                    interest to users as an information retrieval strategy. While the age of the BHO
                    user-base was typically older than the average Internet user, age does not seem
                    to be an inhibiting factor in the preferences of these web users. Apart from
                    their self-reporting of their age, nothing in the findings suggests these
                    respondents are suffering from age-related disabilities that influence their
                    preferences, or that they are in any way less advanced Internet users than
                    someone much younger. Instead, the types of tasks they seek to undertake seem to
                    be the primary drivers of preference.</p>

                <p>These specific findings contribute to ongoing discussions of the needs of users
                    of digital collections more broadly. Because all collections have curators and
                    users, the findings are equally applicable to any field, from cultural heritage,
                    to private enterprise, to institutional repositories. For project managers, the
                    challenge is to ensure that the services for accessing the collection material
                    meet the needs and expectations of those users. The survey tells us the specific
                    wishes of distinct groups of BHO users, but it also points us to the underlying
                    theme: what do users want to do with the material in the collection?
                    Genealogists in the sample group were less concerned with where or how they
                    found something as long as they did find it. They were not using the site to
                    read as one might in a traditional library, nor were they conducting any form of
                    digital analysis. For them, the collection was a potential source of specific
                    information in their wider search for details about their family history.
                    Academics, on the other hand, wanted control over their research processes, and
                    were looking for tools that would let them take a systematic approach to both
                    search and browse. Therefore, it is not the fact that one group of historians is
                    academic and the other amateur that underlies the distinction between them. The
                    important factor is that the two groups have different goals and different
                    reasons for accessing the material in the first place. Understanding those needs
                    is a fundamental first step in designing a search/browse facility to let both
                    groups make the most of a collection, no matter what that collection contains.
                    This is something that any collection manager can take away, regardless of their
                    own target audiences. A self-assessment of how a typical user plans to use one’s
                    site is an important part of allocating energy and resources in the building and
                    re-building process. </p>
                <p>The specific results of this survey will also prove useful for collection
                    managers looking to discern which approaches might be most suitable for their
                    own audiences. Despite this value, the findings are not static; technology and
                    user expectations on the web are constantly shifting. As users increasingly
                    expect to be able to use digital content in digital analyses, be that data
                    mining, or linked data, the pressures on project teams to provide increasingly
                    open access and advanced search and browse options will continue to mount. In
                    the meantime, it is the project team’s hope that providing the findings of this
                    survey will prove useful for those building or redeveloping digital archives and
                    libraries, or digital collections more broadly. </p>

                <p>These quantitative results give a clearer picture of what users of digital
                    libraries are looking for and hoping to see in the searching and browsing
                    options available on websites such as BHO. However, the most important advice
                    received via the survey is much more qualitative and came from one of the
                    respondents, who pleaded: <said>Keep it simple please I don't want 100's of
                        options when I search for specific topics</said>. It is all down to
                    usability, after all.</p>
