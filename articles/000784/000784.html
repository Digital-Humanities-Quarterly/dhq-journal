Literature and Visualization (https://atlantecalvino.unige.ch/?lang=en), which combines literary criticism and data visualization, the paper reflects on the challenges in fusing the diverse methodologies applied by literary scholars (Unité d’italien, University of Geneva) and a team of designers (DensityDesign Lab, Polytechnic University of Milan). The paper describes the process that led from a research hypothesis of literary criticism, designed for Italo Calvino’s fictional work, to the creation of a series of visualizations: in particular, we will focus on the type of text analysis conducted for data collection. Questioning the most common distant reading approach, the Atlante Calvino project adopted a different kind of distance from the text, closer to the practices of scalable reading. The paper aims to reason about the acquisitions and limitations that characterize this method, assigning a new role to the researcher in the context of Digital Humanities. </p> <p>xx</p></div><h2>Table of contents</h2><ul class="toc toc_body"><li class="toc"><span class="headingNumber">1. </span><a class="toc toc_0" href="#index.xml-body.1_div.1">Introduction</a></li><li class="toc"><span class="headingNumber">2. </span><a class="toc toc_0" href="#index.xml-body.1_div.2">Objects</a></li></ul><!--TEI body--><div class="tei_body"><section class="teidiv0" id="index.xml-body.1_div.1"><header><h1><span class="headingNumber">1. </span><span class="head">Introduction</span></h1></header><p>Distant reading is one of the boldest ventures that has animated the landscape of literary criticism studies in recent decades. This methodology, inaugurated by Franco Moretti (2000) <span class="note" id="Note1"><span class="noteLabel">Note: </span>1</span> and later applied to various problems in literary criticism, has sparked an intense and controversial debate over time (Anderson, 2008; Herrmann, 2017; Weitin, 2017; Da, 2019; Dobson, 2021). Even Moretti himself has raised concerns, acknowledging that this practice often confirms results already acquired through traditional methodologies (Moretti, 2022). However, when we consider its merits, the most important one may be that it pushes us to handle literary texts in an entirely new way <span class="note" id="Note2"><span class="noteLabel">Note: </span>2</span> : we are dealing with a type of criticism that seeks a “defamiliarization, where the shift in perspective disrupts automatisms, scrapes away the patina of the obvious, and does not mechanically recognize phenomena but forces us to see them as if for the first time” (de Cristoforo and Ercolino, 2021, pp. 153-154). <span class="note" id="Note3"><span class="noteLabel">Note: </span>3</span></p><p>The distant reading approach can be summarized in this way: through a series of computational techniques, a repeated analysis is conducted on a very high number of texts; this analysis leads to a set of information that, in order to be studied, is represented through visualizations. This description is obviously hasty and superficial, but it allows us to identify the two innovative aspects of this methodology: instead of the text being read by the critic, it is read by the machine; the critic, as a result, will no longer read the text, but visualizations. <span class="note" id="Note4"><span class="noteLabel">Note: </span>4</span> Our discourse, developed from the project Atlante Calvino, focuses on the visual aspect of the issue and at the same time intends to depart from the automatic dimension of reading.</p><p>The project Atlante Calvino. Literature and Visualization, funded by the SNSF at the University of Geneva (Switzerland), took place from 2017 to 2021. Directed by Francesca Serra, it aimed to investigate a series of critical issues related to Italo Calvino’s narrative work through data visualization techniques. There were two main motivations behind Serra’s decision to conceive the project: first, after having extensively worked on Calvino, to whom she had dedicated two monographs (Serra, 1996; Serra, 2006) and several papers, she noted the risk of fossilizing the image critics had of the author. Calvino, one of Italy’s most important intellectuals of the 20th century, had been accompanied over the years by an increasing bibliography dedicated to him, further expanded by the recent anniversary of his birth. <span class="note" id="Note5"><span class="noteLabel">Note: </span>5</span> However, many of these essays are often characterized by a sense of déjà vu: a reverberation effect that presents established interpretations and ideas without a real drive to question what is already known. Therefore, adopting a Digital Humanities approach to explore the work of such a well-studied author can be effective in viewing it from a new perspective and renewing the paths of interpretation.</p><p>The second reason is that the Atlante Calvino project is an experimental field to develop a different practice of literary criticism combined with data visualization. On the one hand, we tried to prove that visual representations allow some literary issues to be addressed and resolved more effectively than through the traditional medium of critical writing itself. The other goal of the project was to enhance the qualitative aspects of the research as much as possible. It is well-known that literary studies, after encountering Digital Humanities, have mostly focused on numerical approaches, prioritizing quantitative aspects over interpretive ones. <span class="note" id="Note6"><span class="noteLabel">Note: </span>6</span> With Atlante Calvino, we sought to find a boundary space where both components are in constant dialogue but where “counting” is not necessarily the unique strategy. <span class="note" id="Note7"><span class="noteLabel">Note: </span>7</span> The project aimed not only to trace new paths for interpreting Calvino’s work but also to transform data visualization from a simple tool into a crucial node in the critical process, attempting to achieve the type of synergy increasingly desired in the current landscape of criticism (Hinrichs et al, 2019; Drucker, 2020; Windhager et al, 2019). This is done while avoiding the use of “visual design […] as a cosmetic retouch of important and complicated issues in an attempt to make them look simpler than they are” (Lupi, 2017).</p><p>Both motivations introduce fundamental methodological differences compared to the type of research usually conducted with a distant reading approach. First, the project is dedicated to a single author and his narrative work, drastically reducing the scale of the analysis. Even more significant is the way the relationship between computational tools and the researcher is calibrated: in our case, the data collection is not automatically operated by a machine, but it is manually conducted by the scholar, text by text. </p><p>To weave literary criticism with data visualization, two research teams participated in the project: a literary team from the University of Geneva, and the DensityDesign Lab from the Polytechnic University of Milan. <span class="note" id="Note8"><span class="noteLabel">Note: </span>8</span> After an intense three-year collaboration, an online platform was created (https://atlantecalvino.unige.ch/), which houses all the visualizations produced. However, the visualizations were not the only result achieved. As previously mentioned, these graphic artifacts were designed as glimpses into Calvino’s work, becoming cornerstones in strictly literary research that resulted in two doctoral theses. <span class="note" id="Note9"><span class="noteLabel">Note: </span>9</span> The process behind both outcomes is the real subject of this article.</p><p>This essay intends to focus on the type of text analysis conducted, with particular regard to the data collection during the intermediate phase, which led from the literary research question to the visualization. </p></section><section class="teidiv0" id="index.xml-body.1_div.2"><header><h1><span class="headingNumber">2. </span><span class="head">Objects</span></h1></header><p> </p></section></div><!--TEI back--><div class="tei_back"><ol class="listBibl"><li id="index.xml-bibl-d31e143"><div class="biblfree"></div></li></ol></div><div class="stdfooter autogenerated"><div class="footer"><!--standard links to project, institution etc--><a class="plain" href="/">Home</a> </div><address>Date: <br/><!--
