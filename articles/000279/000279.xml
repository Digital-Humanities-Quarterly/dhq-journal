                        <p>John Bradley has a long history of work in the digital humanities that
                            goes back to the 1970s with the creation of early batch-oriented text
                            analysis tool COGS at the University of Toronto. He was principal
                            developer of the TACT text analysis system for a personal computer
                            system at U of Toronto in the 1980s, and in the 1990s began, with
                            Geoffrey Rockwell, to explore the connection between tools like TACT and
                            humanities scholarship. A move to the Centre for Computing the
                            Humanities (now Department of Digital Humanities) at King’s College
                            London in 1997 liberated him to work more exclusively on Digital
                            Humanities issues, and resulted in a great deal of collaborative work
                            with humanist scholars through projects such as the People of Medieval
                            Scotland (<ref target="http://www.poms.ac.uk">www.poms.ac.uk</ref>),

                            all. He began the Pliny project at CCH/DDH, work that has produced a
                            stream of publications about scholarship and structure that goes back to
                            2007. After being officially made an academic in 2011 at KCL, John began
                            to think about retirement, and retired from DDH in 2015. He is now a
                            Visiting Senior Research Fellow with the department.</p>

                <p> In this paper we expand Stefan Gradmann’s question at WWW2012 <title

                        so?</title> to consider whether humanists, more generally than just
                        <soCalled>digital</soCalled> ones, might do thinking that is, at least to
                    some useful degree, <soCalled>in the graph</soCalled> too. Drawing on the
                    experience of the Pliny project, and recent work done within that project to
                    explore how Pliny materials might connect with the semantic web, we explore ways
                    in which structured <soCalled>graph-like</soCalled> thinking might be revealed
                    in — to <soCalled>peek out</soCalled> from — parts of humanities research that
                    is common to digital and non-digital humanists alike. Out of this, we propose a
                    number of different ways that scholars might engage with the Semantic Web, and
                    provide examples – arising from the building of a prototype extension to Pliny –
                    of how these engagements could be dealt with. We also explore the challenge of
                    ambiguity and incompleteness in scholarship, explain how 2D space operates in
                    Pliny to cope, to some degree at least, with these issues, and consider the
                    boundaries between the expressiveness of 2D space and the formal graph model of
                    the Semantic Web. We end by proposing several possible avenues for future work
                    that arise from our work so far.</p>

                <head>Introduction</head>
                <p>In his WWW2012 presentation Stefan Gradmann raised the question <title
                        rend="quotes">Thinking in the graph: will Digital Humanists ever do
                        so?</title>
                    <ptr target="#gradmann2012" loc="slide 2"/>. His aim there was to consider how
                    the Semantic Web <ptr target="#berners2001"/> and its data oriented technologies
                    such as RDF <ptr target="#cyganiak2014"/> might be applied to
                    humanities-oriented materials. Like Berners-Lee and others (see <ptr
                        target="#berners2009"/> and <ptr target="#berners2010"/>), he claimed that
                    digital humanists could exploit data made available through these approaches in
                    ways that would not have been practical in the past and thereby enable the
                    creation of entirely new research results.</p>
                <p>Given that he was speaking about the data-oriented Semantic Web, Gradmann
                    naturally took a data-oriented perspective in his paper, drawing on work done
                    with structured text and databases. In this paper, however, we intend to start
                    with what will appear to be a very similar question as his, but will view it
                    from what will become a very different starting point. As a result, we believe
                    that we will have things to say that are quite different from Gradmann. Indeed,
                    we think that however thought-provoking Gradmann’s <quote rend="inline"
                        source="#gradmann2012">thinking in the graph</quote> for <emph>digital humanists</emph>
                    might be, taking our perspective allows one to explore the perhaps even more
                    fundamental question: <q>Thinking in the graph:
                        will Humanists (more generally) ever do so?</q>. It is this more general
                    question that we will explore here.</p>
                <p>Perhaps the best bridge from Gradmann’s work into our own comes through what we
                    think of as the significant provocations contained in both the words
                        <q>thinking</q> and <q>graph</q> in Gradmann’s question. We will return to
                    the <q>thinking</q> part a little later in this paper, but let us start with the
                        <q>graph</q> word right away, since those readers who are not familiar with
                    the underpinnings of the Semantic Web might be puzzled by its appearance here.
                    The Semantic Web is an approach to dealing with globally distributed and
                    interconnected highly structured data. For any domain to which it is applied,
                    the material it represents is captured in an (often very large) set of simple
                    assertions which are recorded as <q>triples</q>. Each triple is made up of two
                    digital entities representing a <emph>subject</emph> and <emph>object</emph>
                    joined by a third digital object (called a <emph>predicate</emph>) that
                    expresses a connection between them. All three components of the triple can be
                    expressed as WWW URIs, which gives them a global scope. It turns out that a set
                    of interrelated triples-assertions of this kind can be represented in what is
                    called a mathematical <emph>graph</emph> – which is a collection of nodes with
                    connections between them. Indeed, a collection of such triples is called an
                        <emph>RDF Graph</emph> in RDF’s <title rend="italic">Concepts and Abstract
                        Syntax</title> document <ptr target="#cyganiak2014" loc="sections 1.1 and 3"
                    />. So, Gradmann's question is meant to focus our attention on whether digital
                    humanists can represent things that interest them in terms of highly structured
                    data (the assertions through triples) that can be represented satisfactorily
                    using a mathematical graph.</p>
                <p>Gradmann’s example of humanities materials in his talk are rather data-oriented
                    to start with, so one can readily see how using RDF provides an appropriate
                    representation of their materials. Indeed, we here at DDH have had more than 20
                    years of experience with data-oriented collaborative project work such as that
                    on structured prosopography (see <ptr target="#bradley2004"/> and <ptr
                        target="#pasin2015"/>, for example). We can certainly agree with Gradmann
                    that the products of our data-oriented projects also can be thought of as both
                    clearly useful products of humanities research that are useful to other
                    humanities researchers, and yet are compatible with this data-oriented approach.
                    Furthermore, by their nature as graph-oriented structured data they indeed have
                    the potential to be suitable for further processing in, say, mashups created by
                    independent researchers that might represent new research for the humanities in
                    the way that Gradmann talks about. However, we have already broadened Gradmann’s
                    phrase from <emph>digital humanities</emph> to <emph>the humanities</emph>, and
                    thus must include research work in the humanities outside of the specifically
                        <emph>digital</emph> humanities. The fundamental question, then, is how, if
                    at all, the more general processes and products of humanities scholarship (which
                    conventionally produces research product as texts and not as data) are
                    compatible with the Semantic Web’s graph representation which is centered on a
                    formalisation of highly structured data-like materials. </p>
                <p>This distinction between data-oriented humanities projects and other humanities
                    research is important because, as interesting as these data-oriented projects
                    are, one must surely say that these data-oriented projects require a way of
                    thinking about humanities materials that is quite foreign to the bulk of
                    humanist scholars. In fact, we do not believe that structured data resources
                    themselves, or mashup-like projects that combine data to form new expressions of
                    existing materials from them, can be called <emph>typical</emph> humanities
                    research. These structured data digital resource projects are things that most
                    conventional humanist scholars can hopefully appreciate to be of value, and
                    might well be things they would use as resources in their own work, but they are
                    not things that they would think of producing as research themselves. Indeed, it
                    is the very mathematical-like structural formality of these data-oriented
                    products that makes them seem rather foreign. Is there, then, a place for the
                    mathematical graph and its associated formal approaches for this majority of
                    scholars who view their principal research sources as primary and secondary
                    texts and do not produce resources that obviously work as graph-like datasets
                    but instead appear in the form of books and articles? </p>
                <p>Our ideas here grow out of our work on the <title rend="italic">Pliny</title>
                    project <ptr target="#pliny2009"/>, which was started by one of the authors
                    (Bradley) as far back as 2004 and which proposed a kind of digital framework to
                    support scholarship. <title rend="italic">Pliny</title> is meant to support
                    humanities scholarship, and, as we shall explain in this paper, reveals a way to
                    connect scholarship to the Semantic Web that takes quite a different tack from
                    the data-oriented Linked Data / Mashup paradigm implied by Gradmann’s 2012
                    paper. Instead, we believe that our approach suggests how a Semantic Web
                    framework (while still having a data-oriented focus) could be made to fit to an
                    interesting degree with scholarly research practice that is not apparently
                    data-oriented at all. Thus, much of the rest of this paper aims to explore, with
                        <title rend="italic">Pliny</title> as the exemplar, how this connection
                    between traditional scholarly practice (which is very different from the work
                    involved in the creation of our data-oriented resources) and Semantic Web and
                    Linked Data ideas might be usefully made.</p>
                <p>We offer this article, then, as a kind of thought piece about the connection
                    between traditional humanities scholarly thinking and formal models like
                    mathematical graphs. Like Gradmann, we also believe that there is a need for a
                    discussion not so much <cit>
                        <quote rend="inline" source="#gradmann2012">about infrastructure but about
                            epistemological foundations</quote>
                        <ptr target="#gradmann2012" loc="slide 29"/>
                    </cit>. Indeed, we believe that there is real work to be done to engage the
                    Semantic Web with humanities scholarship, and that it will best arise out of
                    thinking about how the epistemological underpinnings for traditional scholarship
                    might relate to the band of technologies often called Knowledge Representation,
                    and in particular to the formal structures the Semantic Web offers. We cannot
                    claim that our model, as described here, provides <emph>the definitive</emph>
                    answer to this issue, but it does provide at least a plausible
                        <emph>approach</emph> that can lead us to ask relevant questions about
                    possible connections between formal data and humanities scholarship, and, we
                    believe, deserves further investigation.</p>
                <p>In this paper, then, we first consider what we believe is a conventional view of
                    what constitutes humanities scholarship, and its expression as prose text. We
                    then look at how the <title rend="italic">Pliny</title> project has provided a
                    model that supports these activities. Then, we change the character of the
                    article from a somewhat theoretical reflection about research to explore one way
                    in which the work of scholarship, as <title rend="italic">Pliny</title> supports
                    it, might explicitly map to the formalisms of the Semantic Web. In this way we
                    propose a model of how the Semantic Web could connect formally with <title
                        rend="italic">Pliny</title>’s structures, and through them, to these
                    conventional, non-data oriented, parts of scholarship. Finally, we look at some
                    of the kinds of future work that could flow from our approach.</p>

                <head>Thinking and writing in humanities research</head>
                <p>As we have said above, for most humanists it is probably true that the work of
                    doing scholarly writing and its outputs may not seem to be at all compatible
                    with the formal structures of systems like the Semantic Web. We have, in <ptr
                        target="#Bradley2014"/>, touched upon some of the issues that explain why so
                    much humanist research is presented in terms of, as Hayden White explains it,
                        <q>a narrative prose
                        discourse</q>, and why language is used as the expression of this
                    research. It is precisely <emph>because</emph> it is <cit>
                        <quote rend="inline" source="#bodenhamer2008">imprecise and slippery</quote>
                        <ptr target="#bodenhamer2008" loc="224"/>
                    </cit> that it is used. See, for example, <ptr target="#louch1969"/> and <ptr
                        target="#rüsen1987"/> for a perspective on the nature of prose for
                    humanities research from a historiographical point of view. As we considered in
                        <ptr target="#Bradley2014"/>, this key use of text to represent the products
                    of research fits obviously rather uneasily with the clear binary-like Cartesian
                    structural approaches of all the conventional formal representation systems:
                    XML, databases, and the Semantic Web. </p>
                <p>Furthermore, these traditional views on what constitutes the fundamental aspect
                    of humanities research – reading and writing – might appear to many twenty-first
                    century <emph>digital</emph> humanists as representing exactly the aspects of
                    humanities research that are outside their domain of interest. Nonetheless, we
                    will make the case here that there is good reason to try to find potential
                    digital aspects of them that could fit with the perspective of a digital
                    humanities agenda. First, and perhaps most obviously, this is because even DH
                    techniques such as, say, those associated with Franco Moretti’s <emph>distant
                        reading</emph> – which relies on structured, formal data as input – are only
                    a part of an entire scholarly process and cannot be full replacements, by
                    themselves, for traditional scholarly methods – this even for DH researchers
                    themselves. The new data-oriented DH methods such as distant reading are often
                    cast as borrowing of aspects of scientific methodology for the humanities. In
                    the sciences, however, the use of scientific instruments and the collecting and
                    processing of data from them generally is not considered to be the be-all and
                    end-all of scientific work – one has to then publish articles that interpret
                    this data: articles that are published either in traditional science journals,
                    or perhaps nowadays online in major science research repositories. Indeed,
                    scientific progress is made through the publication of ideas that arise
                        <emph>from</emph> this data through the scientist’s thinking about, and
                    developing an interpretation of them. The final research product for much
                    data-oriented scientific research is still an article in scientific prose.</p>
                <p> In a similar way, formal data-driven DH approaches such as distant reading,
                    social network analysis, or text mining cannot eliminate, on their own, the need
                    for scholars to think about what they have found through these new techniques
                    and then to present their understanding of the significance that has emerged
                    from their exploration. It <emph>is</emph> true that, unlike traditional
                    humanists, the DH-driven scholar may not only be reading books as sources for
                    their research and may well be also drawing on these new DH approaches for
                    insights and ideas. However, Moretti's work using distant reading techniques to
                    explore the emergence of the form of the novel was not finished when the distant
                    reading DH-part, the number crunching and graphing, was completed. He still
                    needed to think about the meaning of his data and its analysis and indeed to
                    write it up in that most traditional of scholarly communications: the monograph
                        <ptr target="#moretti2005"/>. Furthermore, although his ideas arose, in
                    part, out of his engagement with formal data, they also came out of his more
                    general understanding of western literary and social culture. He put these two
                    kinds of understanding together, added some further substantial insights of his
                    own, and produced his book out of this effort. Moretti's practice is not unique.
                    For the great majority of DH researchers, the work of using the DH methodologies
                    and their tools/instruments (such as, say, those found in big data
                    methodologies) is not the whole story of their research activities either.
                    Significant intellectual work continues, following after the application of
                    these tools, in that phase of research between exploration and publication. So,
                    we intend in this paper to shift our gaze from the input/exploration part of the
                    research to the work that follows after it and that results in an original
                    written text as the product of the research – the external evidence of
                    scholarship. How do we fit it with a representation of scholarship that is
                    highly structured in the form that RDF and the other associated Semantic Web
                    technologies are?</p>
                <p>At first glance at least, as we remarked earlier, scholarly humanities writing as
                    the expression of research output does not appear to fit well with the
                    structured methodologies of the Semantic Web or with Gradmann’s question about
                    the place of graph-thinking in the humanities. Two things, however, begin to
                    hint at a <emph>place</emph> for structured data of the kind represented by the
                    Semantic Web (SW) in scholarly writing. If we look closely at most articles or
                    books presenting research in the humanities, we will usually see that there
                        <emph>is</emph> some formal structure at least implied in the text, both
                    directly evident (first) in the structure represented by the flow of the
                    argument, but also (second) in the identification and naming of themes, concepts
                    and their connections that are presented in them. These named themes and
                    concepts can begin, perhaps right off, to look something like things that can be
                    expressed and shared by Semantic Web technologies, particularly ontologies. They
                    at least hint at structure of the kind with which the Semantic Web operates.</p>
                <p>However, there is an important difference between these conceptual structures and
                    those that often are thought of as characterising the Semantic Web’s ontologies
                    and other semantic structures. The SW, through its ontology component, aims to
                    support machine-based selection and manipulation of data by providing a formal
                    representation of established knowledge about the world that is both based upon
                    a <emph>shared</emph> human understanding of it and that is simultaneously
                    accessible to the technology. Indeed, it is through this formalised shared
                    understanding of the structured data that much of the potential power of the
                    Semantic Web comes. In the SW the expression of this shared understanding of the
                    data is expressed in the formalisms of what are called computer
                        <emph>ontologies</emph>. Thomas Gruber's <ptr target="#gruber1993"/> early
                    description of an ontology as a shared common understanding of a collection of
                    materials expressed using a formal system reveals this approach, and indeed the
                    emphasis in the Semantic Web’s ontologies for a particular domain is almost
                    always centered on the formal definition of widely agreed terms and ideas.</p>
                <p>In contrast to this, however, as Guetzkow <foreign xml:lang="la">et al</foreign>
                    remind us in their article <title rend="quotes">What is Originality in the
                        Humanities and the Social Sciences?</title>
                    <ptr target="#guetzkow2004"/>, humanities scholars want to say something
                        <emph>new</emph> about their materials, and hence will generally not want to
                    refer simply to ideas contained in an existing mature intellectual framework
                    that could (perhaps — and only <q>perhaps</q>) be represented in a formal
                    Semantic Web ontology. As Guetzkow <foreign xml:lang="la">et al</foreign> state <cit>
                        <quote rend="inline" source="#guetzkow2004">[h]umanists and historians

                    </cit>. In their interviews of peer review panels in the humanities they found
                    that <cit>
                        <quote rend="inline" source="#guetzkow2004">panelists described originality

                    </cit>. Humanities scholars, then, are encouraged to develop their
                        <emph>own</emph> voice and perspective on their material that is different
                    from that currently established within their discipline. Their work will
                    usually, of course, be grounded in some existing ideas shared with academic
                    colleagues, but the best of it will also extend or perhaps even more
                    fundamentally break with past models by introducing new themes, concepts, or
                    connections. If it was possible – and this is a big <q>if</q> – to have a formal
                    representation of a set of widely shared ideas for a particular humanities
                    discipline (an ontology rich enough to capture the current understanding around
                    the issues of, say, colonialism), then an original piece of scholarship that
                    fits with this colonialism field might then be expressible <emph>in part</emph>
                    as a kind of linked data connection to these established concepts. Even then,
                    however, it will also almost certainly contain at least some material that is
                    original with the researcher and that does not link to any such existing shared,
                    formal, representation of the field. Indeed, perhaps one could claim that the
                    aim of all scholarship in the humanities and elsewhere is to challenge the
                    boundaries of shared knowledge and understanding. For this reason, materials
                    that represent new scholarship would seem inevitably to go outside the natural
                    domain of SW ontologies.</p>
                <p>Furthermore, although the output that presents this original research usually
                    eventually appears as prose text, the process to get to this presentation in
                    prose is not captured by simply sitting down one day and letting the paper
                    simply flow out. There is a process going on from which the ideas and how to
                    present them emerge. We will call this process <emph>interpretation
                        development</emph>, and the process of emergence that it represents is one
                    that takes ideas for this interpretation from vagueness to relative clarity. Any
                    structure for this interpretation does not just appear, fully formed, in the
                    author's head at the time the article was being written. It emerges after
                    substantial engagement with the materials with which s/he was working. Before
                    the article writing begins, but as a part of the research process that might
                    lead to the article, it is likely that the ideas are still only partially
                    formed, and cannot be expressed in the rigid formalisms of, say, a Semantic Web
                    ontology; indeed they most likely will not be initially ready for expression in
                    the seemingly less mathematically formal medium of written prose text either. At
                    this stage the ideas are in fact, let us say, <emph>pre-ontological</emph>, and
                    bringing Semantic Web ontology technologies into the picture at this point would
                    appear to bring formalism to bear too soon in the process of developing them.
                    Considerable thinking needs to happen after the engagement with the materials
                    being studied before an interpretation of these materials is mature enough to be
                    shared with others.</p>
                <p>We have just given some related reasons why the differences between humanities
                    scholarship and Semantic Web representation through graphs and ontologies might
                    seem to be insurmountable. Nonetheless, the rest of this article outlines the
                    approach taken by the <title rend="italic">Pliny</title> project that suggests
                    at least a possible way to think about connections between the Semantic Web and
                    this interpretation development activity, with its gradual development through
                    vagueness to clarity.</p>
                <p>Here, then, as promised, we return to Gradmann’s phrase that we introduced at the
                    beginning of this paper and to his use of the word <q>thinking</q> in it: for it
                    is in the work between the gathering of materials and the writing of a personal
                    interpretation of them that a lot of thinking has to happen. By exploring issues
                    in the formally challenging context of more mainstream research outputs –
                    articles, books, etc. – produced in the humanities and the kind of thinking that
                    goes into their production, we believe that one can discover places for
                    structure and graphs there as well. We believe that François Lachance’s
                    object-oriented, embodied, understanding of thinking (quoted at the top of this
                    paper) suggests something important about the thinking process that goes on in
                    traditional scholarship, and reveals an aspect of structure in that thinking
                    that can be latched onto. Although perhaps the outward expression of this
                    thinking-process may not at first look much like <soCalled>thinking in the
                        graph</soCalled> as it is usually modelled in the Semantic Web, it seems to
                    us that there are in fact bits and pieces of a graph approach that might well
                    peek out, as it were, from what we can discern there and these bits of a graph
                    model can suggest ways to consider, both positively and negatively, possible
                    connections between the graph, the Semantic Web, and traditional scholarly
                    thinking in the humanities. We intend to explore some of these bits of graph
                    model thinking that we believe are <soCalled>peeking out</soCalled> not so much
                    to provide definitive answers about how they work, but to encourage further work
                    by those familiar with the Semantic Web about the place of Semantic Web-like
                    formal structure in traditional, non-data oriented, scholarship, and how what
                    structure we find in it might be engaged to facilitate that aspect of
                    scholarship in the humanities.</p>

                    Interpretation</head>
                <p>Work on the <title rend="italic">Pliny</title> project <ptr target="#pliny2009"/>
                    began in 2004 and started with building a tool (also called <title rend="italic"
                        >Pliny</title>) that could support the <emph>process</emph> of doing
                    humanities scholarship. Although apparently often thought of as a kind of
                    annotation tool, <title rend="italic">Pliny</title> did not turn out to be
                    particularly about annotation, or at least not about annotation in isolation
                    from its place in scholarship. Instead, it came to represent how a digital
                    approach to annotation could fit with other thoughts about the representation of
                    ideas. In this view, digital annotation became only a starting point of
                    research, and <title rend="italic">Pliny</title> became a tool that aimed to
                    support a fuller range of humanities scholarship activities than those that an
                    annotation tool would have done by itself. Furthermore, the work with the ideas
                    that <title rend="italic">Pliny</title> was exploring led us to come to a view
                    about how the <q>thinking</q> parts of conventional scholarly methodology that
                    is used not only by non-DH humanists, but by DH-oriented humanists too, could be
                    usefully connected to the new DH instrument-oriented approaches such as text
                    visualisation, text mining, etc. and their tools (see <ptr target="#bradley2012"
                    />).</p>
                <p>Instead, then, of the <title rend="italic">Pliny</title> project being focused
                    only on the production of the <title rend="italic">Pliny</title> software, the
                    software has acted within the project as a thought-piece. It allowed us to
                    experiment rather broadly with questions of what place there might be for
                    technology in both fully conventional scholarship and those aspects of DH
                    practice that, although informed by new data and approaches, continues to also
                    follow conventional scholarly methods: observing, thinking about and
                    interpreting what one has seen, and presenting it. It is this aspect of what the
                        <title rend="italic">Pliny</title> software was for within the <title
                        rend="italic">Pliny</title> project that connects, we think, with Gradmann's
                    view <ptr target="#gradmann2012" loc="slide 29"/>, mentioned earlier, that an
                    investigation of the epistemological foundations of scholarship was where the
                    issues were located. The authors of this present paper are not equipped to write
                    here about epistemology in a philosophical way; however, we hope that the thrust
                    of this paper – indeed the work in <title rend="italic">Pliny</title> from near
                    its very beginnings in 2004 – has something to offer to this epistemological
                    discussion that Gradmann seems to think is necessary. The intent in our paper is
                    to draw attention to <title rend="italic">Pliny</title>'s model for the process
                    of scholarship – both conventional and DH-driven – and to explore how it might
                    connect to some degree with the new developments of knowledge representation in
                    the Semantic Web.</p>
                <p>Some of the early thinking that led to <title rend="italic">Pliny</title> appears
                    in <ptr target="#bradley2003"/>. However, thoughts about what kind of software
                        <emph>could</emph> be more broadly useful to humanities researchers became
                    clearer upon Bradley’s discovery of the work of Brockman <foreign xml:lang="la"
                        >et al</foreign> in their 2001 CLIR report entitled <title rend="italic"
                        >Scholarly Work in the Humanities</title>
                    <ptr target="#brockman2001"/>. There one could see the central place of reading
                    in scholarship, and the significance of notetaking while reading. Similar ideas
                    about scholarship and notetaking from the perspective of an historian also
                    appear in the work of Ann Blair in her studies on the history of notetaking <ptr
                        target="#blair2003"/>
                    <ptr target="#blair2004"/>. There she claims that personal notes constitute a
                        <cit><quote rend="inline" source="#blair2004">central but often hidden phase in
                        the transmission of knowledge</quote>
                    <ptr target="#blair2004" loc="85"/></cit>.</p>
                <p>A first lesson one finds in studies of what goes on in conventional scholarship
                    is that in almost any substantive humanities scholarly research venture one
                    expects to start out with only an ill-defined sense of the issues one is
                    interested in. Indeed, as far back as 1997 John Lavagnino observes this aspect
                    of notetaking when he observes that reading was not <quote rend="inline"
                        source="#lavignino1997">a mere collection of data</quote>. Instead, he claims that the
                    role of reading in scholarly research can be found in the fact that it <quote
                        rend="inline" source="#lavignino1997">generates reactions</quote> in the reader that
                        <quote rend="inline" source="#lavignino1997">subsequently</quote> (note the use of the
                    word) one could seek to <cit>
                        <quote rend="inline" source="#lavagnino1997">describe or explain</quote>
                        <ptr target="#lavagnino1997" loc="114"/>
                    </cit>. Thus, the mere act of <emph>taking</emph> of notes and/or annotation
                    does not, by itself, capture the central place of these notes in doing the
                    research. Instead, it is important to see how the notes might
                        <emph>subsequently</emph> assist their owner in the gradual development of
                    new ideas that would eventually become the primary result of the research
                    work.</p>
                <p>In this light we can see a problem with much of the current work on digital
                    annotation when it is applied to the task of supporting scholarship. On one
                    hand, several annotation tools have been developed to support simple digital
                    textual annotation – linking a bit of text that can act as a comment to
                    something you are reading. Although this is useful for, say, adding public
                    commentary to a text for teaching purposes (see discussion in this vein in <ptr
                        target="#bessette2015"/> and <ptr target="#dean2015"/>), by itself it
                    doesn't serve the needs of the researcher particularly well because, although it
                    could be used as a way to record responses to the text in the way Lavagnino
                    describes, that is all one can do with the annotations. It leaves the user there
                    – at the beginning of a process – without good broader access to these notes
                    that s/he can subsequently use. In contrast to this <q>textual</q> annotation
                    approach, other work has been carried out which has been given the general name
                    of <title rend="italic">Semantic Annotation</title> (e.g. <ptr
                        target="#grassi2013"/>. This approach has become another way to think about
                    annotation in the context of the Semantic Web and it allows one to link material
                    in a text to elements of a formal Semantic Web structure such as an ontology.
                    Unfortunately, as we explained above, Semantic Web annotation would seem to
                    bring in the formal structure of the linked ontology in too soon; trying to
                    apply an approach suitable for a predefined, formal, interpretive model to the
                    beginning of the process before – in the case of much research in the humanities
                    – a model is available. Although both <q>simple text</q> and <q>semantic</q>
                    annotation are useful tools, neither engages adequately by themselves with the
                    process of scholarly research.</p>
                <p>Much of a scholar’s subsequent work after annotation of a source involves
                    struggling with emerging vague, incompletely defined, ideas, and only after a
                    good period of time does some degree of clarity emerge, a process that we
                    described as <emph>pre-ontological</emph> earlier in this paper. Once one begins
                    to see interpretation building as this kind of a process, with perhaps a
                        <soCalled>clear-ish</soCalled> conception emerging near its end, the
                    question begins to reveal itself as being not only about formal models for the
                    completed interpretation, but also about how to model the process to help
                    someone <emph>develop</emph> it. What should a user interface and the formal
                    structure behind it be like in order to help a researcher while they are
                    developing their interpretation — moving from vagueness to a significant degree
                    of clarity?</p>
                <p>The work in <title rend="italic">Pliny</title>, then, was not only about how to
                    support the creation of notes in the first place, but then how these personal
                    notes could be made available to best support the kind of intensive and extended
                    thinking about the material that would go into the development of a new
                    interpretation of it. Once the computer is a repository for these notes, how can
                    it best deliver them to the user in ways that support the user's engagement with
                    them as they struggle to work out their own understanding of the materials?
                        <title rend="italic">Pliny</title> represents an attempt to achieve a
                    balance between conflicting needs: <list type="unordered">

                            and</item>
                        <item>it provides (through its provision of two dimensional spaces) a way to
                            cope with lack of clarity, ambiguity and vagueness.</item>
                    </list></p>
                <p>An early article about <title rend="italic">Pliny</title>
                    <ptr target="#bradley2008"/> presents <title rend="italic">Pliny</title>’s place
                    in scholarship as supporting three phases: (a) <emph>reading</emph> (more
                    recently expanded to include <emph>exploring</emph> by considering the place for
                    the use of software such as a text mining or visualisation tool as a source for
                    new materials), (b) <emph>developing</emph> a new interpretation, and then (c)
                        <emph>writing</emph> about it. <title rend="italic">Pliny</title> software
                    is an attempt to provide a tool to support not only the first annotation and
                    notetaking activity (phase a), but to also support the development of new ideas
                    that might be stimulated by these personal notes in a <soCalled>personal
                        space</soCalled> (phase b), and that would fit, when the ideas were mature
                    enough, into the writing that would bring these new ideas into the public sphere
                    in the form of a book or article (phase c). Figure 1 (similar to figure 3 in
                        <ptr target="#bradley2012"/>) schematically represents materials assembled
                    in a Pliny repository, showing how they might relate to these three activities
                    of scholarship.</p>
                <figure xml:id="figure01">
                    <head>Schematic representation of materials in Pliny.</head>
                    <graphic url="resources/images/figure01.png"/>
                </figure>
                <p>The left side of this figure shows the first phase: reading of both primary and
                    secondary literature for research, and (with a bow to DH interests such as text
                    mining or a visualisation) exploring some material using a computer application.
                    The diagram shows small boxes with links to spots in the source texts and in a
                    DH application display (here represented as a numerical graph). These are the
                    annotations created by the researcher as s/he reads and explores. Initially, at
                    least – attending to Lavagnino's comments earlier – the reader may well not be
                    in a position to attach specific formalisms to these materials since he or she
                    will not have developed the formalisms yet. So, instead, the notes are, most of
                    the time, likely to be bits of personally-written text that captures the <quote
                        rend="inline" source="#lavignino1997">reactions</quote> that the reader hopes to <quote
                        rend="inline" source="#lavignino1997">subsequently describe or explain</quote> (using
                    Lavagnino's words again) by developing a framework for them.</p>
                <p>The middle area corresponds to the interpretation development phase of the
                    research. Initially, in the earliest phases of the work there will not be any
                    objects there. However, as the researcher thinks about the materials s/he has
                    been exploring and works to understand them s/he will endeavour to organise
                    their thoughts into a collection of interrelated concepts, categories, or
                    topics. Thus, Figure 1 has in its middle area references to some of the notes
                    that were originally created by the researcher while reading. In this phase of
                    the research, however, they are reused by being organised under broad categories
                    or topics (only two are shown here, and labelled generically as <q>concept 1</q>
                    and <q>2</q> rather than with real names that a researcher would use). In
                    addition, these concepts or topics might well be supplemented by new notes that
                    represent new thinking by the researcher about these topics s/he has formally
                    identified. In <title rend="italic">Pliny</title> a note that started out as an
                    annotation (such as the one labelled in Figure 1 as <q>Note A</q>) can be also
                    referenced in the different context of one of the interpretation's concept
                    objects – it appears twice in this schematic because it then is displayed in two
                    places by <title rend="italic">Pliny</title> itself – first as an annotation
                    attached to the text where it was created, and then a second time when it also
                    appears as connected to the researcher's <hi rend="italic">concept 1</hi>. Note
                    that at this note/concept level the notes and their grouping into larger
                    structures begin to show the kinds of formalism that is compatible with
                    structured data.</p>
                <p>Finally, when the time is right (and presumably after significantly more than 2
                    concepts have been recognised), the researcher draws on the ideas she has formed
                    in the interpretation phase to put together materials (often papers) that
                    present them. Now, the work of organising the materials changes to be one that
                    supports the development of a text for an article that presents the ideas that
                    were developed in the interpretation. Although <title rend="italic"
                        >Pliny</title> in its publicly available form does not provide a tool to
                    directly link the materials it holds into the text of an article, there has been
                    some preliminary exploration in the <title rend="italic">Pliny</title> project
                    of how such a tool might operate – see <ptr target="#bradley2009"/>.</p>
                <p>While looking at Figure 1 we are encouraged to view scholarship as process, and
                    therefore think of this figure as, let us say, a snapshot of the data at a
                    particular point in time. This process is somewhat organic – more like how a
                    tree grows than how a building is built: <title rend="italic">Pliny</title> is
                    not, thus, <soCalled>project oriented</soCalled> in its support. In the same way
                    that a tree starts out small with only a couple of branches but gradually
                    becomes more complex as more branches are added, the <title rend="italic"
                        >Pliny</title> model accommodates a user who needs to start small: first
                    with notes created while reading, and then through the gradual development of
                    ideas in the interpretation stages. As it evolves over time material is likely
                    to develop from left to right, with (as we said earlier) much of the material at
                    first in the <soCalled>notetaking/reading</soCalled> area at the left. Each of
                    these three areas is likely, therefore, to develop at a different pace. Like a
                    tree, where some stems become important branches, and others do not, and yet
                    both substantial and minor branches coexist, ideas recorded in <title
                        rend="italic">Pliny</title>'s structure exist at any point in time in more
                    than one stage of development and sophistication, with the more successful ones
                    developing more substantially than the less successful. As with a tree, the
                    product of the research – its fruit – is not a one-time-only affair at the end,
                    but a continuing process during the life of the research and might occur many
                    times out of the research structure stored in <title rend="italic"
                    >Pliny</title>. Figure 1, then, does not represent the research at its end, but
                    at some point during its life in the same way that a photograph of a tree
                    represents the tree not as a finished product but as it is at some point in its
                    life.</p>
                <p>Although a tree is a useful metaphor here to capture the organic and ever
                    evolving nature of research, we need take care not to press the
                        <soCalled>research tree</soCalled> analogy too far. In particular, <title
                        rend="italic">Pliny</title>'s data model does not impose a hierarchical
                        <soCalled>tree like</soCalled> structure. It is closer to an ever changing
                        <emph>graph</emph> than a <emph>tree</emph>. It is perhaps what one might
                    call the <soCalled>organic</soCalled> nature of this graph that is useful to
                    remember out of this tree simile. We will have more to say about the
                        <soCalled>organic</soCalled> nature of Pliny data below. </p>

                <head>Annotation in Pliny</head>
                <p>In <title rend="italic">Pliny</title>'s conception of scholarly work new ideas
                    that emerge in the mind of the researcher often emerge out of their engagement
                    with materials in the world – often texts in books or articles, but also these
                    days perhaps software applications such as those that support text mining, or
                    text visualisation. The connection between these object-in-the-world and the
                    scholar's own thoughts are often made, as Lavagnino suggests above, through
                    annotation (or, more generally, notetaking). Thus, annotation is a part of the
                    entire <title rend="italic">Pliny</title> framework, and we have done work in
                        <title rend="italic">Pliny</title> to explore annotation and more generally
                    notetaking for a range of digital media, including both support for notetaking
                    for non-digital sources, annotation for media-oriented digital ones such as web
                    pages or PDF documents, and annotation within displays generated by software
                    applications. Indeed, we believe that <title rend="italic">Pliny</title>’s
                    approach could readily be extended to include support for annotation of temporal
                    media such as sound files or video. As a consequence, the <title rend="italic"
                        >Pliny</title> approach to annotation within software provides a framework
                    that extends ideas about annotation of media objects into thinking about how
                    scholarly interpretation connects to the new research method of, say, text
                    mining or visualisation. There is an extensive discussion of annotation for
                    other media and for non-media applications and its implication within the
                    context of the displays from software in <ptr target="#bradley2012"/>.</p>
                <p>Figure 2 shows an example of Pliny's approach to notetaking/annotation during
                    reading. Here someone has been adding notes to a PDF file of Willard McCarty's
                    2008 article <title rend="quotes">What's going on?</title>.</p>

                </figure>
                <p><title rend="italic">Pliny</title>y simulates the way annotations work on paper
                    in two ways. First, when a researcher opens an object in Pliny with annotations
                    on it, all the annotations are all immediately visible; nothing needs to be
                    clicked on to see any of them. Their immediate presentation like this helps the
                    reader remember <emph>all</emph> the thoughts s/he recorded on the page —
                    something that does not happen if the reader had to open each annotation one by
                    one. Second, annotations in <title rend="italic">Pliny</title> appear to float
                    on top of a printed text. Like annotation on paper, the <title rend="italic"
                        >Pliny</title> annotator can make entirely free use of that page to hold
                    his/her annotations and can exploit the spatial sense of the page as part of the
                    expressive toolkit for annotation. In <title rend="italic">Pliny</title>, then,
                    an annotation, as well as linking a target to the annotation, also has itself a
                    place in a 2D space provided by the material it annotates.</p>

                <head>Supporting the development of concepts</head>
                <p><title rend="italic">Pliny</title> is not only about annotating things, which
                    was, you recall, represented only in the left <q>reading / exploring</q> area of
                    Figure 1. How does <title rend="italic">Pliny</title> support the central phase
                    of research: the development of an interpretation? Different researchers might
                    well use different approaches to this task, and <title rend="italic"
                        >Pliny</title> is rather open ended in its support for this reason. However,
                    we can illustrate how Pliny helps the researcher through an example which takes
                    one particular approach. Here, the nature of research as a <emph>process</emph>
                    plays a rather more prominent role.</p>
                <p>One way to think about this process is as a gradual increase in structure: the
                        <title rend="italic">Pliny</title> user creates more structure in <title
                        rend="italic">Pliny</title> as the ideas become clearer and more structured
                    themselves. The best way to see some of the ways that this plays out inside of
                        <title rend="italic">Pliny</title> is to examine more closely the process
                    one could use to create a particular item about a topic called <q>uses of space
                        for study</q> – an example first shown, albeit fully formed, in <ptr
                        target="#bradley2008" loc="273"/>. Presenting what is actually a temporal
                        <emph>process</emph> such as this in a single illustration is not practical,
                    so the next sequence of 4 figures (Figures 3 to 7) provide a set of snapshots
                    taken over time of the Pliny space for <hi rend="italic">uses of space for
                        study</hi> to show the different stages of its development.</p>
                <p>In each figure in this sequence we have deliberately named each stage to echo
                    some aspects of the language of <title rend="italic">Scholarly
                        Primitives</title> as presented by John Unsworth in 2000 <ptr
                        target="#unsworth2000"/>. This paper has already touched on one of
                    Unsworth's primitives: <emph>annotating</emph>. However, like Carole Palmer, who
                    also makes reference to Unsworth's primitives in <ptr target="#palmer2009"/>,
                    but argues that her list is different because it comes from the somewhat
                    different perspective; our set of primitives diverge from Unsworth’s too, and
                    for similar reasons to hers.</p>

                </figure>
                <p>One begins by creating a holder for the topic, and naming it <q>uses of space for
                        study</q>. Then, the first step, shown in Figure 3, is
                        <emph>assembling</emph> material that seems to be relevant (corresponding in
                    part, perhaps, to Unsworth's <emph>discovering</emph> primitive). We see this
                    topic space in Figure 3. The topic is named, and there is a brief description of
                    the idea entered in the left area. However, the main place where the work is
                    done is in the larger 2D space to the right. The <title rend="italic"
                        >Pliny</title> user starts off by assembling references to things she is
                    interested in that relate to the topic: in this case four images that show space
                    being used in different ways. Then she adds a reference to a note on another
                    topic she has already created called <q>Visualisation</q>, which seems to relate
                    to this one. As of yet, all she knows is that these five items feel as if they
                    are connected to the idea of <hi rend="italic">uses of space for study</hi>.</p>

                    the researcher begins to notice some similarities in the use of space in two of
                    the images, and detects what feels like a contrasting similarity in the other
                    two. As a result, our researcher takes advantage of the possibility of proximity
                    in the 2D space to organise them a bit, placing those which seem to be similar
                    in some way close together. One can characterise this kind of activity as the
                    beginning of the task of <emph>organising</emph> your material. Perhaps some
                    part of this operation might broadly correspond to Unsworth's
                        <emph>comparison</emph> primitive.</p>
                <p>Note the importance of the 2D space for this task and the particular expressive
                    affordances it offers. Here, no explicit links between the items have yet been
                    asserted. Instead, there is a much more subtle and perhaps useful ambiguity
                    available in the 2D space for suggesting relationships between items in terms of
                        <emph>proximity</emph>. Putting two items close together suggests some
                    degree of connection without requiring that it be spelled out too

                    groupings become clear enough that she feels ready to give them names. She has
                    already sensed that she seems to have two groups of images, and she now sees

                        >Pliny</title>. First, <title rend="italic">Pliny</title> supports the
                        <emph>process</emph> of scholarship, not primarily the expression of its
                    products. <title rend="italic">Pliny</title>'s approach, supporting research
                    from annotation through concept development to write-up, provides a framework
                    that allows its user to move from largely unstructured ideas to a more formal
                    structure by supporting the way that this transition happens: starting off with
                    reading and notetaking, and then through the working with these notes and the
                    thinking about issues they raise to support the gradually emerging formalising
                    of new ideas. <title rend="italic">Pliny</title> is not project-oriented in its
                    support. It does not require that ideas develop in step towards a sense of
                        <soCalled>completion</soCalled>. Instead, the <title rend="italic"
                        >Pliny</title> user can combine ideas that emerge from different areas of
                    his/her work as she pleases. <title rend="italic">Pliny</title> accommodates the
                    co-existence of certain ideas that develop more completely with those that do
                    not. Materials in <title rend="italic">Pliny</title> need not ever be
                    finished.</p>
                <p>Second, <title rend="italic">Pliny</title> promotes the use of a 2D working space
                    as a central element in its set of affordances. In the context of annotation,
                    Pliny supports a 2D space for annotations that intentionally mimics annotation
                    on paper, and supports the idea that annotations, as tools to assist in
                    research, need to be fully visible whenever their resource is open. Two
                    dimensional space is also used as a central affordance to support the assembly
                    and organisation of materials into concepts, although actual practice of users
                    in <title rend="italic">Pliny</title> suggests that 2D-space's sense of
                    proximity, with its degree of ambiguity, is more useful at the beginning of the
                    effort to organise a particular topic then it is later as the concepts related
                    to the topic become clearer.</p>

                <head>Fitting Pliny to the Semantic Web</head>
                <p>Having looked at <title rend="italic">Pliny</title>'s way of modelling a part of
                    scholarly research, it is time to return to a major theme of this paper: how
                    does the formal structure behind <title rend="italic">Pliny</title>'s support
                    for annotation (figure 2) and concept development (figures 3 to 7) fit with the
                    formalisms of the Semantic Web? If we can see how the two worlds connect
                    together we have, to the extent that <title rend="italic">Pliny</title>'s formal
                    model captures a part of humanities scholarship, a way of thinking about how
                    scholarship fits with the formal world of the Semantic Web as well.</p>
                <p>The authors have explored this potential connection in a very practical way: by
                    creating a rudimentary extension to <title rend="italic">Pliny</title> in the
                    form of a <q>plugin</q> that supported the export of <title rend="italic"
                        >Pliny</title> materials into RDF and that brought the linked standard
                    representations of the semantic web back into <title rend="italic"
                    >Pliny</title>, and that thus allowed Semantic Web or Linked Data URIs to appear
                    as <title rend="italic">Pliny</title> resources. The next section of this paper,
                    then, presents the very specific way in which this prototype plugin represented
                    the mapping from <title rend="italic">Pliny</title> to the Semantic Web and back
                    again. Theoretical considerations may, of course, reveal more than one way to
                    think about how this connection might be expressed and exploited, but as a
                    consequence of the need to actually write code for this plugin, the authors here
                    have explored one particular expression of this connection. Nonetheless, this
                    pragmatic description of our plugin still opens up issues that connect back to
                    the more theoretical discussion we presented earlier in this paper, and we hope
                    readers will interpret this next, rather pragmatic and specific discussion, in
                    that light.<lb/></p>
                <p>Underlying the representation of Pliny materials in RDF is a rudimentary ontology
                    of Pliny's objects. Its major classes are: <list type="unordered">
                        <item><hi rend="italic">Resource</hi>: <title rend="italic">Pliny</title>
                            structures a user’s collection of materials as a set of Resources.
                            Resources are sub-classed to represent types of content objects such as
                            Web pages, PDF files or Image files. Pliny is designed to be extensible
                            to new data types, and usually any new data type becomes a subclass of
                            Resource. Importantly, a Pliny <hi rend="italic">note</hi> is also a
                            Resource.</item>
                    </list>
                    <list type="unordered">
                        <item><hi rend="italic">Note</hi>: As the name suggests, <hi rend="italic"
                                >Pliny</hi>’s notes serve the purpose of being containers for a
                            short bit of text (for example, textual annotations), but they also
                            provide a 2D space for storing references to other objects. Hence what
                            are described in Pliny documentation as <q>containment objects</q> (which usually become the holders for
                            concept items such as our <hi rend="italic">uses of space for study</hi>
                            example) are in fact also Notes. From a Semantic Web perspective, since
                            a note and a concept are clearly semantically different things, this
                            conflating of Notes and Concepts is an expressive limitation that could
                            be addressed in a future version of Pliny. Perhaps, in some future
                            version <title rend="italic">Pliny</title> would allow users to define a
                            set of related classes for kinds of containment objects: categories such
                            as <q>concepts</q>, or <q>persons</q>, etc.</item>
                        <item><hi rend="italic">Anchor</hi>: <title rend="italic">Pliny</title>
                            provides anchors (currently only rectangles, although this could be
                            extended to other shapes) to identify areas on 2D resources such as
                            images or PDF file pages. In an annotation interpretation of Pliny data,
                            a Pliny Anchor can be an annotation’s target.</item>
                        <item><hi rend="italic">Reference</hi>: Any resource (note/conceptual
                            object, image, PDF file, etc.) can be referenced from within another
                            resource. In the <hi rend="italic">uses of space for study</hi> example
                            above, for example, the inclusion of the <title rend="italic">Vico
                                Frontispiece</title> as an example of one of the uses of space was
                            done by means of a reference to the resource that held the frontispiece
                            image.</item>
                        <item><hi rend="italic">Reference type</hi>: References can be typed (we saw
                            the typing being applied in Figure 7). As we’ve seen, reference typing
                            enriches the semantic expressiveness substantially, and a <title
                                rend="italic">Pliny</title> user can define any reference type s/he
                            wants, defining, for instance, types such as <q>is an example of</q>, or
                                <q>is a commentary on</q>. Thus, reference types could become the
                            basis for a user-based ontology separate from Pliny’s entity ontology we
                            are describing here since, as we shall see, they can be viewed as a set
                            of predicates in exported RDF triples. In addition, when used in the
                            context of annotation, the reference type can also be usefully
                            interpreted as a <soCalled>kind</soCalled> of annotation.</item>
                    </list> Now that we have done some thinking about <title rend="italic"
                        >Pliny</title>’s data as RDF data, two quite obvious questions arise:</p>
                <list type="unordered">
                    <item><hi rend="italic">Reaching out to the Semantic Web</hi>: How can the data
                        that we have shown as accumulating inside of <title rend="italic"
                            >Pliny</title> be transformed into RDF, the language of the Semantic
                        Web, and</item>
                    <item><hi rend="italic">Drawing in from the Semantic Web</hi>: how can the
                        linked data in the Semantic Web be most usefully connected with the model of
                        scholarship that <title rend="italic">Pliny</title> presents?</item>
                </list>
                <p>We first explore the <title rend="italic">Reaching out</title> part; mapping
                        <title rend="italic">Pliny</title>'s representation of an interpretation to
                    the Semantic Web world. To do this we look first at the part of <title
                        rend="italic">Pliny</title> that supports annotation of digital objects (as
                    shown in Figure 2) to see how these annotations might map to the Semantic Web,
                    and then we explore how the concept development part of <title rend="italic"
                        >Pliny</title> (shown in Figures 3 to 7) could map to there as well.</p>
                <p>About annotations: in order to explore the annotation functions like those in
                    Figure 2 we made our prototype RDF export mechanism use the OA annotation
                    ontology (<ptr target="#OA2013"/> and <ptr target="#sanderson2013"/>), extending
                    and updating some previous work (<ptr target="#jackson2010"/>) that also
                    explored how to map Pliny data to (the older) OAC ontology. The task was not
                    entirely trivial because <title rend="italic">Pliny</title>'s annotation tools
                    (for, say, images and PDF files) were not designed to model simple annotations
                    in terms of objects such as notes and targets. Instead, <title rend="italic"
                        >Pliny</title>’s underlying model operates in terms of target areas, notes,
                    and links between them all placed in the 2D space. This approach supports the
                    sense of annotation that mirrors annotation on paper, as described earlier, but
                    also enables a richer set of relationships between a collection of notes,
                    targets and connections between them than just notes attached to targets, which
                    is the sense of annotation given in the OA. Our RDF exporter, then, had to take
                    data described in these more general terms and express them as annotations that
                    were conformant with the OA.</p>
                <p>Because of space constraints on this paper, it is not possible to explore in
                    detail how this mapping was done, but an example will suffice. Figure 8 shows a
                    slightly simplified version of the RDF (turtle notation) generated by our
                    exporter for the annotation called <q>claiming interdisciplinary</q> (showing in
                    the top right of Figure 2). This data could be published through a triplestore
                    for public use, although this has not been done at this point in time. As we
                    hope the prefix expansion makes clear in the figure, the <hi rend="italic"
                        >jb</hi> prefix identifies data that belongs to a particular <title
                        rend="italic">Pliny</title> user, and would be a different prefix for a user
                    with a different name.</p>
                <figure xml:id="figure08">
                    <head>RDF and Pliny annotation</head>
                    <graphic url="resources/images/figure08.png"/>
                </figure>
                <p>The fragment labelled <q>A</q> describes the PDF file that has been annotated.
                    This item, identified with a URI jb:resource-99, is identified as a <hi
                        rend="italic">PDF object</hi> (elsewhere defined as a subclass of a Pliny
                    resource), and is then assigned attributes that are largely self-explanatory.
                    Fragment <q>B</q> contains the RDF for the bit of text that has been applied as
                    an annotation. This resource is identified as a <hi rend="italic">Note</hi>,
                    with a name and contents as shown. Fragment C defines the target of the
                    annotation, which is here an area on a page in the PDF file. We use the
                        <q>fragment selector</q> model given in the Open Annotation specification
                        (<ptr target="#sanderson2013" loc="section 3.2"/>). Finally fragment D
                    defines the annotation by connecting the target area and the Pliny note. The
                    annotation entity is identified as jb:lo-119, and is typed as a
                        <code>RelatesTo</code>. <code>RelatesTo</code> is one of the <hi
                        rend="italic">reference types</hi> that the user has defined, and is
                    identified as a subclass of an <code>oa:Annotation</code> elsewhere in the
                    generated RDF.</p>
                <p>Figure 8 perhaps gives a sense of how the annotation parts of Pliny have data
                    that can map to the Semantic Web via the Open Annotation ontology. However, as
                    Figures 3-7 show, Pliny is not only about annotation. The construction of this
                    personal interpretation for <hi rend="italic">uses of space for study</hi> is
                    not an annotation exercise – if it was, what is being annotated? Thus, we cannot
                    use the Open Annotation ontology to model what is going on in Figures 3 to 7.
                    How is this material handled in any translation to RDF?</p>
                <p>First, as <ptr target="#bradley2008" loc="274–6"/> points out, the data structure
                        <title rend="italic">Pliny</title> uses behind these displays can be thought
                    of, to some extent at least, as a graph with typed nodes and links. As mentioned
                    earlier in this paper, this same kind of mathematical graph is the foundation
                    model for RDF <ptr target="#cyganiak2014" loc="section 3"/>, and it turns out
                    that Pliny's own graph model maps quite comfortably into RDF's <title
                        rend="quotes">subject predicate object</title> representation. As a
                    consequence, the RDF exporter we built used a different translation strategy for
                    data from these 2D <q>concept spaces</q> than for <q>annotation spaces</q>. The
                    key was to focus on the relationship between the note and its holder in the 2D
                    space. The <hi rend="italic">Visualisation</hi> concept shown in Figure 7 is
                    referenced by the <hi rend="italic">uses of space for study</hi> concept, and
                    its reference there is typed as a <hi rend="italic">related</hi> item. The
                        <title rend="italic">Vico Frontispiece</title> image is shown as <hi
                        rend="italic">an example of</hi> the <hi rend="italic">Topological use of
                        space</hi>, and the <hi rend="italic">Topological</hi> item, itself, <hi
                        rend="italic">is A</hi> use of space for study. </p>
                <p>The mapping from the objects in the Pliny space to RDF triples, is actually
                    rather straightforward. A fragment of the generated RDF is shown in Figure
                    9.</p>
                <figure xml:id="figure09">
                    <head>RDF representation of a Pliny Topic</head>
                    <graphic url="resources/images/figure09.png"/>
                </figure>
                <p>We have now discussed reaching out from <title rend="italic">Pliny</title>
                    <emph>to</emph> the Semantic Web. What happens when we think about what was
                    called earlier <hi rend="italic">drawing in</hi>: bringing aspects of the Linked
                    Data/Semantic Web world into the user's scholarly space by making them available
                    in <title rend="italic">Pliny</title>'s workspace? One can see two rather
                    different kinds of linking activities. The first is very similar to Semantic
                    Annotation which is touched on very briefly earlier in this paper, but the
                    second was based on the idea of reaching out <emph>into</emph> the graph-like
                    linked data world to consider and annotate parts of that web as it currently
                    exists. This second type of connection makes part of the Semantic Web itself an
                    object for study in its own right.</p>
                <p>First we can see in Figure 10 our <title rend="italic">Pliny</title> RDF plugin’s
                    support for annotation with Semantic Web objects (<title rend="quotes">semantic
                        annotation</title>) in action. Here it is used to link some parts of the
                    illustration to concepts from <title rend="italic">DBPedia</title>. This figure,
                    similar to figure 2 in <ptr target="#bradley2008" loc="268"/>, is of the
                    frontispiece from Vico's <title rend="italic">New Science,</title> and, as it
                    did in the earlier illustration, uses annotation to identify several of the
                    philosophical concepts represented in the image.</p>

                <p>In the 2008 figure, the concepts such as <title rend="italic"
                    >Metaphysics</title>, or <title rend="italic">The Trinity</title> were all
                    labelled and identified as concepts with internal Pliny objects. Our RDF
                    extension, however, allowed us to refer instead to URIs that represented the
                    concepts in the global Semantic Web: here we can see several of these concept
                    objects (<title rend="italic">The Trinity</title>, <title rend="italic"
                        >Philosophy</title> and <title rend="italic">Metaphysics</title>) are
                    actually references to their corresponding URIs within DBPedia. These
                    links/annotations to Semantic Web URIs that identify these concepts co-exist
                    with other kinds of objects: here we also see commentary in the form of notes,
                    as well as links to other concepts such as the <title rend="italic">Natural
                        World</title> and the <title rend="italic">Civil World</title> which the
                    user has not chosen to connect to the Semantic Web as URIs. To make it possible
                    for a user to locate a global URI for concepts like <title rend="italic">the
                        Trinity</title>, we developed a rudimentary query mechanism (shown on the
                    top left side of Figure 10) as a prototype tool that allowed the user to query
                    any SPARQL endpoint (here, to <title rend="italic">DBPedia</title>) to find URIs
                    within it that had <code>rdfs:label</code>s containing a given word – here
                        <q>Philosophy</q>. Then, having found a suitable URI in the results of the
                    query, the user could simply drag it from the list onto the <title rend="italic"
                        >Vico Frontispiece</title> image to generate a reference to it. This kind of
                    reference to concepts by referencing a URI on the Semantic Web is, of course,
                    exactly Semantic Annotation of the kind we touched on very briefly earlier in
                    this paper.</p>
                <p>The second kind of engagement of the Semantic Web world – which we described as
                    making a part of the Semantic Web as <q>an object of study</q> involves the use
                    of the structure of the Semantic Web itself as a resource for one's scholarship.
                    This can, again, be thought of as annotation, but not in terms of annotating
                    text or an image with Semantic Web URI's (as Semantic Annotation does), but the
                    other way round: annotating the graph of the Semantic Web with personal
                    materials, references to personal research concepts and with the user’s own
                    thoughts as notes, etc. Instead of (as Semantic Annotation does) annotating
                    documents with references to the Semantic Web, we here annotate the Semantic Web
                    personally with references to elements of a personal collection of documents and
                    notes.</p>
                <p>We built a prototype tool for this that suggests how this somewhat more radical
                    engagement with linked data and the Semantic Web might work: see <ref
                        target="#figure11">Figure 11</ref>. The display is a little crude still
                    since the software that implements it is still at the prototype stage – but it
                    is suggestive of what one could mean by making the Semantic Web an object of
                    study in the <title rend="italic">Pliny</title> sense. </p>

                </figure>
                <p>Our prototype can be directed to any RDF repository that supports SPARQL, and
                    here it shows a part of <title rend="italic">DBPedia</title>'s web of linked
                    data as a graph – here centred around <title rend="italic">DBPedia</title>’s URI
                    for the Second World War's Yalta conference (shown on the screen in orange).
                    Most of the displayed graph is a representation of the RDF triples that <title
                        rend="italic">DBPedia</title> holds and that connect to the central <title
                        rend="italic">Yalta Conference</title> URI, and these closely related URIs
                    appear simply as little boxes that identify related <title rend="italic"
                        >DBPedia</title> objects. However, a few of DBPedia's URIs are actually URLs
                    to web pages, and one is a URL to a photograph taken during the conference. We
                    built a small component (shown bottom left) that allows the user to tell our
                    Pliny display about this. Although the layout here is still crude, we hope that
                    the graphical presentation suggests how one might present this web of
                    objects.</p>
                <p>What is interesting here are the objects shown (on the screen) in green. These,
                    although mixed in here with the mainly RDF data from <title rend="italic"
                        >DBPedia</title>, are instead Pliny objects created by the Pliny user as a
                    personal commentary on this part of the Semantic Web, and displayed here as
                    intermingled with it. Some are notes that comment on <title rend="italic"
                        >DBPedia</title> materials (such as the note that observes that the FRUS
                    item referenced in <title rend="italic">DBPedia</title> is a <q>really interesting document</q> (shown near
                    the top right). Two of them are links to a web pages (top right) and to an image
                    (bottom right) that is not referenced in the <title rend="italic"
                        >DBPedia</title> materials. You can think of them as personal annotations
                    added to this small corner of the Semantic Web.</p>
                <p>In the same way that <title rend="italic">Pliny</title> allows users to
                    personally annotate a web page, an image, or a PDF file with responses at the
                    moment they have them and then later use these notes in personal deliberations,
                    one can here annotate the Semantic Web with personal responses to parts of it,
                    and can then fit these reactions into later thinking. The intermingling of
                    Semantic Web URIs with Pliny objects in this prototype display allows for the
                    creation of a personal space between, but connecting, objects being annotated
                    and the public Semantic Web.</p>

            <div>
                <head>RDF and 2D Space</head>
                <p>The reader can probably see by now that 2D space plays a significant role in
                        <title rend="italic">Pliny</title>. First, 2D space has a relatively obvious
                    role in <title rend="italic">Pliny</title>’s annotation support since an
                    annotation <hi rend="italic">target</hi> for an image or page of a PDF file is
                    defined by an area on a 2D image or PDF file 2D page. As shown in the example
                    from Figure 8, their position is expressed in RDF through the mechanism that the
                    OA provides for this: the <code>oa:fragmentSelector</code> construct (area C).
                    However, there are other objects in Figure 2 to which Pliny also gives a spatial
                    position: the annotation notes themselves. The placement on the page of these
                    annotation notes is not exported at present by our code because its
                        <code>oa:Body</code> definition – used to represent the contents of the
                    annotation notes – provides no mechanism for expressing it. Therefore, although
                    of course the spatial layout for these notes could still have been exported as
                    RDF, they could not be presented purely in terms of the OA ontology.</p>
                <p>Having discussed the place of 2D space in the annotation parts of Pliny, we need
                    also to think about its use elsewhere. The most obvious other use – as a tool to
                    support an emerging interpretation (shown in Figure 3 to 7) – makes 2D space
                    into a central mechanism by which fuzziness and ambiguity is accommodated. It
                    provides an open, flexible, structure for organising materials, and offers some
                    particular affordances, most obviously <hi rend="italic">spatial proximity</hi>
                    (but others too: see the discussion in <ptr target="#bradley2008"/>, as a means
                    of expressing unclear relationships between objects. Figure 4 shows the use of
                    spatial proximity in this way most clearly. By putting objects close together
                    the user tentatively suggests some sort of connection between them without
                    needing to pin down too much yet what this connection might be. Although the
                    structuring affordances shown in Figures 5, 6 and 7 add further richness to the
                    data recorded in this space, and reduce the need for 2D's particular expressive
                    characteristics such as spatial proximity, even in the final image (Figure 7) of
                    this sequence the expressive elements provided by 2D space have not been fully
                    eliminated. The layout of the objects there provides a kind of visual
                    enhancement of the presentation of the idea that, say, merely presenting the
                    same associations hierarchically, would not possess.</p>
                <p>Think again about the 2D space shown in Figure 4 where the user organised the
                    four images into two groups to reflect a perceived, but yet unclear,
                    relationship between them. If this area was exported into RDF, one would see the
                    references to the four images appearing but there would be no evidence of any
                    possible connection between them, even though the user is consciously using
                    spatial proximity to represent possible connections. The actual placement of the
                    four objects, in terms of their X-Y co-ordinates can certainly be expressed in
                    the RDF. However, even if we added code that would record their placement, the
                    possible connection the user is intending to present by her arrangement is still
                    only at best implicit in the RDF. The tentative connections are presumably
                    evident to the Pliny user (she is deliberatively using the 2D space’s sense of
                    proximity to suggest these possible connections, after all), but this possible
                    connection is not yet formalised in the data structure. In contrast, as soon as
                    containment is brought into the picture to more formally express the
                    relationships (see Figure 5), the relationship between the two sets of objects
                    is also made explicit in the exported RDF.</p>
                <p>Does this matter? Does it matter that the user is exploiting the 2D space to
                    express something about the materials without, as it were, telling <title
                        rend="italic">Pliny</title> formally about it? Indeed, does this present a
                    serious challenge to the task we have proposed in this paper: to find a place
                    for <q>graph thinking</q> in scholarly interpretation development? We think the
                    issue is not as bad as it might at first appear to be. This is because although,
                    in <title rend="italic">Pliny</title>, spatial proximity, with its advantage of
                    vagueness of expression, plays a role in assisting its user during their early
                    thinking about a topic, it seems clear that the process of interpretation around
                    a topic involves a gradual replacing of vague understandings with clearer, more
                    precise, formulations of ideas. Thus, although as we have seen one could argue
                    that the whole idea of spatial proximity (rather than spatial positioning) is to
                    some extent incompatible with standard RDF expressiveness, it is also likely
                    that in fact 2D proximity becomes a less prominent element of expressiveness as
                    the process of developing this concept is carried out in Figures 3-7. Although
                    our RDF exporter does not export spatial position data for concept objects, as
                    the ideas develop further (in the later figures in our <hi rend="italic">uses of
                        space for study</hi> example) they become expressed by other means, and
                    these other representations <emph>are</emph> already preserved by our RDF
                    exporter. As a concept becomes more mature, it would seem that the spatial
                    information becomes less important as a carrier of information, and the graph
                    representation by itself begins to carry more of the substance of the
                    material.</p>

                <head>Possible Future Work</head>
                <p>Although we believe Pliny’s approach opens up the subject of how one might fit
                    formal Semantic Web modelling with a broad range of fundamental humanities
                    research processes, we cannot claim here that we have a mature and complete
                    approach ready to go. One way to continue research is to explore how the issue
                    has been considered in other fields, such as in mathematics or the sciences.
                    Here, our article’s reviewers have made several suggestions of work that might
                    bring relevant insights.</p>
                <p>First, work has been done in the area of teaching of mathematics to explore how
                    students develop a richer understanding of mathematical principles. See, for
                    example, <ptr target="#gravemeijer1999"/> and <ptr target="#lange2008"/>.
                    Second, interesting work has been done under the category of <title
                        rend="quotes">Personal Knowledge Models</title> in <ptr target="#völkel2011"
                    />, and this PhD thesis draws together a rich bibliography of related work
                    primarily from a Computer Science perspective. Third, one reviewer noted that
                    the topic of differences between the expressive possibilities of different media
                    raises an interesting perspective on our issues here, and suggested <ptr
                        target="#elleström2014"/> and <ptr target="#eide2015"/> for further reading.
                    Finally, one issue raised in this paper is the tension between humanities
                    research and formal models; often mathematical models of the kind that underpin
                    many concepts in science. Here, <ptr target="#nersessian2008"/> has been
                    suggested by one reviewer as a good starting point.</p>
                <p>Returning to our work with Pliny, obviously, further work needs to be carried out
                    in a broad range of different areas, including the place of spatial proximity in
                    the formal model, or the issues around exploring the semantic web itself as an
                    object for study. </p>
                <p>We provide here four further examples of areas for development and/or research:
                        <list type="unordered">

                        <item>extending <title rend="italic">Pliny</title> to include a tool to

                        <item>dealing with materials that change over time.</item>
                    </list> We discuss each of these examples below as possible future work that,
                    although not yet done, is suggestive of some research potential in this
                    area.</p>
                <div>
                    <head>Adding more RDFS semantics to <title rend="italic">Pliny</title></head>
                    <p>If one uses <title rend="italic">Pliny</title> to develop an emerging
                        conception such as that suggested by our <hi rend="italic">uses</hi> example
                        (illustrated by Figures 3 through 7), it would seem that one could reach a
                        level for formalism that begins to connect semantically to conceptions in
                        RDFS <ptr target="#brickley2014"/> and even the Owl Ontology language <ptr
                            target="#OWL2012"/>. However, RDFS allows for the expression of more
                        kinds for formal relationships than <title rend="italic">Pliny</title>
                        currently supports, so perhaps one interesting way forward would be to add
                        more of RDFS concepts into <title rend="italic">Pliny</title>. Users can
                        already define new types in <title rend="italic">Pliny</title> as a way to
                        express kinds of relationships between objects, and you can see this in
                        operation in Figure 7. Indeed, in our prototype RDF export we interpreted
                        Pliny’s <q>relationship types</q> as RDF Properties, and it would be easy to
                        extend Pliny’s rather rudimentary typing model into a hierarchical
                        organisation organised under RDFS’s <code>subPredicate</code> concept.
                        Similarly, it would be relatively straightforward to extend Pliny’s
                        note/container model to make them operate as RDFS Classes, including support
                        for sub-Classing. If domain/range specification mechanisms were also added,
                            <title rend="italic">Pliny</title> would provide an environment that
                        would allow for a user to progress from very general note taking to working
                        with almost all the formalism of RDFS to express an ontology for their
                        material in a single, integrated, environment. Although we have not tried to
                        extend <title rend="italic">Pliny</title> in this way, it seems to us that
                        the process involved could be quite straightforward.</p>

                        argumentation and writing</head>
                    <p>The reader has probably noticed that <title rend="italic">Pliny</title> does
                        not actually get to the final phase of research: the actual writing up of
                        the article. <title rend="italic">Pliny</title> suggests a formal model for
                        a scholar/user’s concepts etc., and proposes a third phase (shown in Figure
                        1) that uses <title rend="italic">Pliny</title>’s existing tools to help
                        users assemble materials from their <title rend="italic">Pliny</title> data
                        into objects that would represent materials for a written article.
                        Furthermore, materials from <title rend="italic">Pliny</title> can already
                        be exported in a form that a word processor can use, so a transfer from
                        concepts and resources in <title rend="italic">Pliny</title> into a writing
                        process is already possible to some limited extent. However, once this is
                        done the formally expressed links from the resultant writing to the concepts
                        and resources <title rend="italic">Pliny</title> holds are, of course, left
                        behind. That is as far as the current <title rend="italic">Pliny</title>
                        model gets, and our own experience of writing with <title rend="italic"
                            >Pliny</title>’s support suggests that there is a large amount of work
                        that the writer needs to do after the materials have been assembled in
                            <title rend="italic">Pliny</title>’s article-specific areas to turn
                            <title rend="italic">Pliny</title>’s representation of concepts into
                        prose text. Can <title rend="italic">Pliny</title> be extended to provide
                        better support for this part of the work by presenting mechanisms that
                        better preserve the connections between the representation of concepts that
                        it already holds with the article that in the end presents them? We have not
                        done much work in this area (although see <ptr target="#Bradley2014"/> for
                        some early thinking). </p>
                    <p>Much of this work on <title rend="italic">Pliny</title> will involve a better
                        understanding of what a scholar is actually doing when s/he turns the
                        concepts in <title rend="italic">Pliny</title> into written text. Earlier in
                        this paper we made a brief reference to the structure of an argument, and
                        there are hints of what this process might consist of in <ptr
                            target="#brockman2001"/>. Thus, providing integrated tools to allow the
                        user to interactively develop an argument would appear to be a sensible way
                        to proceed. Are there ways in which the argument structure can be usefully
                        represented as structured data? One possible approach is to build tools that
                        work with existing formal argument modelling models.</p>
                    <p>One such model is CIDOC-CRM’s CRMInf (<ptr target="#CRMInf2015"/> and <ptr
                            target="#doerr2011"/>) ontology. CRMInf’s website says that it provides
                        an ontology to model argumentation and inference and claims that in this way
                        it provides a formal language for <cit>
                            <quote rend="inline" source="#CRMInf2015">making the inference structure
                                (such as a mathematical proof) and the belief in this structure
                                implicit to the argumentation event</quote>
                            <ptr target="#CRMInf2015"/>
                        </cit>. And, indeed, one of the important tasks of a written paper is surely
                        to present a position on some subject in terms of an argument, with
                        inference as one of the modes of expression of that argument.</p>
                    <p>One possible problem with the use of CRMInf to support writing in the
                        humanities is that argumentation, or indeed scholarly writing more generally
                        in the humanities, does not necessarily always progress by means of
                        inference and deduction. Martin Mueller’s recent comment in the discussion
                        about CRMInf in Humanist (starting in Humanist 28.812) asking if such an
                        approach <quote rend="inline" source="#mueller2015">would ever help a
                            literary critic make sense … of Shakespeare’s Sonnet 116</quote> (in
                            <ptr target="#mueller2015"/>) we think raises, albeit obliquely, the
                        same issue. We suspect that Mueller does not believe that CRMInf’s model of
                        formal inference is, in fact, the principal way by which classic humanities
                        scholarship is carried out or expressed. Indeed, theorists like Joris van
                        Zundert <ptr target="#vanzundert2014"/> have argued that there are humanists
                        who <quote rend="inline" source="#vanzundert2014">tend to reason
                            abductively</quote> rather than deductively or by inference. If so, a
                        tool to assist these individuals with the preparation of text that was
                        driven by arguments based on formal deduction might be of limited value. </p>
                    <p> As far as <title rend="italic">Pliny</title> is concerned, we have begun, as
                        very preliminary thinking in this area, to conceive of a new tool for <title
                            rend="italic">Pliny</title> that would be a bit like a word processor,
                        but would also present some visualisation of an argument structure and would
                        also allow a user to preserve links into his/her <title rend="italic"
                            >Pliny</title> structure from the article’s text. We are attracted at
                        present to the rather loose conception of how an article’s ideas become
                        organised that was briefly presented in Douglas Engelbart’s famous 1962
                            <title rend="italic">Augmentation</title> Report <ptr
                            target="#engelbart1962" loc="81–88"/>. There Engelbart expresses a
                        looser sense of dependence rather than rigorous inference, by observing that
                        any particular idea in an article is often dependent upon one or more ideas
                        that had been presented earlier. Engelbart calls these dependency
                        relationships <hi rend="italic">antecedents</hi>, and his approach does
                        resonate with our own experience of writing the article: that part of the
                        task is getting the flow of the text right in ordering things so that for
                        any idea presented its antecedents are also present and presented in
                        advance. Perhaps we might start further work here by exploring Engelbart’s
                        softer-edged <soCalled>antecedent</soCalled> approach in addition to
                        CRMInf’s more formal and induction-oriented model.</p>

                    <head>Publishing Pliny structure: personal and private materials</head>
                    <p>A third major area of further research that emerges from the ideas in this
                        paper arises when one thinks about whether the publishing of a <title
                            rend="italic">Pliny</title> structure representing aspects of its user’s
                        interpretation can be, in and of itself, considered as a research product.
                        As we mentioned earlier, the idea of publishing, or more informally sharing
                        in some way, some <title rend="italic">Pliny</title> materials is a
                            <emph>little</emph> like the idea Gradmann proposes when he talks of
                        publishing <quote rend="inline" source="#gradmann2012">personal digital curation
                            workflows</quote>. However, although the characterising of <soCalled>curation workflows</soCalled> as the objects
                        being published works well for Gradmann’s Linked-Data and Mashup model, it
                        does not work as well for <title rend="italic">Pliny</title>’s personal
                        conceptual space context. Our example presented above, the <hi rend="italic"
                            >uses of space for study</hi> concept, and others one might create in
                            <title rend="italic">Pliny</title>, simply <emph>are not</emph> a <soCalled>curation workflows</soCalled>. However, the
                        question still remains about whether materials that are created in <title
                            rend="italic">Pliny</title> are themselves publishable: sharable as data
                        with others in a form that is adequately representative of the ideas they
                        present. The work described here does take us one step in this direction in
                        that, as we have seen, we have done some basic thinking about this when we
                        defined how <title rend="italic">Pliny</title>’s data could be exported as
                        RDF. However, what issues around making <title rend="italic">Pliny</title>
                        personal data structures public still remain?</p>
                    <p>Part of the challenge here relates to what we called earlier the <hi
                            rend="italic">organic</hi> nature of <title rend="italic"
                        >Pliny</title>’s data, and the fact that a <title rend="italic"
                            >Pliny</title> repository will hold a mix of both unfinished-personal
                        material which is not intended for sharing and mature material that could be
                        made public and sharable with others. Here, the <soCalled>fruit of the
                            tree</soCalled> analogy for scholarly research products mentioned
                        earlier is somewhat misleading. Nature packages up mechanisms within the
                        tree’s fruit that, once it is dropped to the ground, allows it to produce a
                        new tree entirely independently of its tree-parent which created it. An
                        apple by itself is sufficient (with soil, sunshine and water) to produce a
                        new apple tree. Thus, although, as the parallel suggests, our
                            <soCalled>organic</soCalled> graph might indeed contain areas that could
                        be published as <soCalled>fruit</soCalled> for the use of other researchers,
                        the graph model does not impose an independence of these publishable
                        components from other objects in a user’s <title rend="italic">Pliny</title>
                        repository, and in this sense is quite different from the kind of
                        self-contained packaging that the apple represents. Instead, one of Pliny’s
                        concept objects, such as our <hi rend="italic">uses of space for study</hi>
                        object, does not stand on its own – it is in fact almost entirely created
                        out of references to <emph>other</emph> parts of its creator’s space.
                        Furthermore, as we have indicated above, any user’s <title rend="italic"
                            >Pliny</title> repository will contain a mixture of mature material and
                        less polished material. How does one assist the <title rend="italic"
                            >Pliny</title> user in managing this issue: making public enough related
                        material so that the exported material can be made sense on its own, and yet
                        excluding personal material that is not ready for public viewing.</p>
                    <p>The issue of private vs public material has been worked on in connection with
                        annotation, and contains some thinking that is relevant to the larger
                        picture, beyond annotation alone, of <title rend="italic">Pliny</title>’s
                        data structures too. We are thinking here of the work by Catherine Marshall
                        back in the early 2000s that is still cited today. See, in particular, her
                        suggestive study of the nature of digital annotation practices for personal
                        and for shared use in <title rend="quotes">Exploring the relationship
                            between personal and public annotations</title>
                        <ptr target="#marshall2004"/>. More recent related work can be seen in <ptr
                            target="#congleton2009"/>, where the researchers asked students to mark
                        up maps that would be shared with different kinds of groups, ranging from
                        small groups the students knew to larger groups that they did not. Marshall
                        and Bush’s observation, included in the <ptr target="#congleton2009"/> work,
                        was that when people took what had been a set of personal annotations and
                        decided to make them public they first eliminated most of them, and for the
                        ones to be made public they carried out significant additional work to
                        polish them for publication.</p>
                    <p>Not all Pliny’s materials are annotations, but nonetheless, we assume here
                        that the process a user might go through in turning personal materials into
                        public will be similar to that shown in the annotation studies. Hence, for
                            <title rend="italic">Pliny</title> the issue arises from how the system
                        might help the <title rend="italic">Pliny</title> user manage his/her
                        collection of materials with regard to what should be made public and what
                        should not, especially given the organic nature of the data Pliny users
                        create. RDF 1.1’s concept of <hi rend="italic">named graphs</hi> (see <ptr
                            target="#carroll2004"/>) might fit with this issue.</p>

                    <head>Dealing with materials that change over time</head>
                    <p>One curious tension in RDF is that in a world of continued changing
                        materials, RDF’s representation seems to be surprisingly static. There is no
                        sense of timestamping of triples, for example, and no way to attribute
                        triples to individuals who asserted them. Indeed, triples act as
                        second-class objects within RDF with no way to attach attributes of any kind
                        to them. RDF’s <soCalled>reification</soCalled> process (see <ptr
                            target="#nguyen2014"/> for a discussion) is meant to deal with this
                        issue to some extent, but is, at least as of yet, poorly semantically
                        defined and thus poorly supported by software that supports RDF. This lack
                        of a sense of time in Semantic Web technologies is what provokes a static
                        sense of data in RDF representations. Considering that one would think that
                        public data would be constantly evolving and changing over time and could
                        contain the conflicting views of many different individuals from around the
                        globe, this is surprising. In all fairness, however, perhaps it is true that
                        RDF was simply not meant to deal with time-related issues when it was
                        designed, and it was then expected when RDF was created that more work in
                        this area, as in others, was still necessary.</p>
                    <p>Of course, although <title rend="italic">Pliny</title>, unlike the Semantic
                        Web, is focused more on the individual than a global world of data, it has
                        to deal with time too, since a scholar user’s ideas represented in <title
                            rend="italic">Pliny</title> also continue to evolve, meaning that, like
                        the semantic web more generally, the graph component of the <title
                            rend="italic">Pliny</title> dataset also changes constantly.</p>

                        good overview of the issue and possible approaches to deal with it. We are
                        particularly interested in the connection between communities of graph
                        contributors and temporal graphs talked about there. <ptr

                <head>Conclusions</head>
                <p>With this paper we hope to start some discussions about aspects of how the
                    Semantic Web might fit with a broad range of research activities as they are
                    practiced in humanities scholarship. Semantic annotation – an approach to
                    information handling that offers some appeal as one way to connect
                    reading-as-scholarship with the structures of the Semantic Web – provides only
                    one perspective on how this scholarship-Semantic Web connection might work. As
                    it turns out, although not originally conceived of in Semantic Web terms, <title
                        rend="italic">Pliny</title> provides a model for formalising several aspects
                    of traditional scholarship that centre on note-taking and concept development,
                    and which are still largely compatible with RDF data structures: in particular
                    RDF's graph representation. This <soCalled>graph part</soCalled> of <title
                        rend="italic">Pliny</title>, by providing a conceptual link with the
                    Semantic Web, allows us to think in a relatively rich way about the possible
                    interactions between actual scholarly practice and the Semantic Web than more
                    Semantic Web driven approaches such as semantic annotation does. Furthermore, we
                    have also explored a little how the process of the emergence of ideas in
                    scholarship is not entirely well served by graph-oriented Semantic Web
                    constructs, and how a different model – two-dimensional space – provides at
                    least one alternative way to think about how to support the process of emergence
                    of ideas. </p>
                <p><title rend="italic">Pliny</title>'s model, by focusing on supporting the
                        <emph>process</emph> of scholarship rather than the representation of its
                    end results, also provides a framework which allows us to engage with the
                    question of how interpretation building, as it might actually be done by
                    scholars, can be better fit with the potential of the Semantic Web. This fitting
                    together must be an important thing to keep in mind if we wish to crack into the
                    mainstream world of scholarship with the Semantic Web – to see how and to what
                    extent scholarship, as it is carried out by most scholars, can be part of <quote
                        rend="inline" source="#gradmann2012">thinking in the graph</quote> as Gradmann put it.
                    Any approach to capture scholarly practice primarily via the highly formalised
                    parts of the Semantic Web through approaches such as semantic annotation does
                    not readily engage with the key work of humanities scholarship: the development
                    of a new personal perspective on a body of material, and – if the idea is
                    persuasive to others – its gradual adoption into the body of shared thinking in
                    a particular humanities discipline. </p>
                <p>In fact, we think that <title rend="italic">Pliny</title>’s model of scholarship
                    support, while revealing aspects of scholarly work that are graph-like and
                    compatible with the Semantic Web, also reveals limitations that are inherent in
                    a graph-based data model. In particular, incompleteness and ambiguity – central
                    facts of life in most scholarship – are handled in Pliny's user interface by the
                    provision of a true 2D working space, and we have suggested in this paper how
                    proximity in 2D space can be used to deal with at least some aspects of
                    incompleteness and ambiguity in a formal digital representation. However, we
                    have also shown that the essence of 2D spatial proximity, as an element of
                    expression by a scholar, does not fit entirely comfortably with RDF and the
                    Semantic Web. Position data can be readily expressed in RDF, but once there it
                    cannot be used by itself to exploit in standard Semantic Web ways the
                    significance of, say, spatial proximity as a relationship between two items.
                    Interestingly, however, <title rend="italic">Pliny</title>’s approach
                        <emph>also</emph> suggests that as the ideas become mature and enriched the
                    2D aspect of their representation becomes less significant. Thus, for those
                    mature items apparently not much information is lost when spatial information is
                    ignored. However, for less fully formed items – where 2D proximity is still
                    playing a significant semantic role – this might be more of an issue.</p>
                <p><title rend="italic">Pliny</title>'s approach, with its particular way to assist
                    a scholar through a process of developing his/her understanding, provides a data
                    model which combines a graph representation (which fits well with current trends
                    in formal structured data in the Semantic Web) with the use of 2D space as an
                    exploratory tool (which provides a mechanism to deal with ambiguity and lack of
                    clarity that is an inevitable result of the process of developing an
                    interpretation of a body of materials, but which fits significantly less well
                    with the Semantic Web). <title rend="italic">Pliny</title>, with its attempt to
                    model the scholarly process in the way it does, encourages one to think about
                    how intellectual work in the humanities might better fit with the broad world of
                    open, linked data. In this way, it allows us to think about, as Gradmann
                    suggested <ptr target="#gradmann2012" loc="slide 22"/>, a <quote rend="inline"
                        source="#gradmann2012">scholarly use of semantic technology</quote> that
                    moves <quote rend="inline" source="#gradmann2012">beyond emulation of
                        Annotation</quote>. It also offers us one way to think about how to move the
                    discussion of representing humanities research in terms of the Semantic Web to
                    one that is based upon the epistemological issues that Gradmann claims is <quote
                        rend="inline" source="#gradmann2012">where the issues are
                    located</quote>.</p>
