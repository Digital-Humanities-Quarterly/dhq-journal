                  <p>The goal of this article is to critically reflect on the practical and
                     epistemological challenges of doing historical research in the digital age. The
                     analysis is based on a case study of the Doctoral Training Unit (DTU) “Digital History and Hermeneutics”, an interdisciplinary
                     research and training programme that was established at the Luxembourg Centre
                     for Contemporary and Digital History (C²DH) of the University of Luxembourg. The
                     DTU is designed as interdisciplinary <em class="term">trading zone</em> that applies the
                     method of “thinkering” – the tinkering with technology combined with the
                     critical reflection on the practice of doing digital history. Based on this case
                     study, the article addresses the question of how to constitute an
                     interdisciplinary trading zone in practice and how to situate this trading zone
                     in physical working environments, like a Digital History Lab and shared office
                     space.

                           That is that people from different domains don’t understand each other.
                           There is quite a wall. Because when you have been studying a topic from
                           a paradigm of your discipline for a long time, and others are dealing
                           with similar things but in a totally different way, then there are
                           certain blockages between them. And there has always been a curiosity to
                           be the trader between those different domains. I think what we are doing
                           here is to explore the digital tools to build bridges. [...] [However]
                           people are not willing to come out of their comfort zone often.

                     </blockquote> With these words, a PhD
                     student described the ambitions but also the challenges of the Doctoral Training
                     Unit (DTU) “Digital History and Hermeneutics”: a
                     four-year interdisciplinary research and training programme that was established
                     at the Luxembourg Centre for Contemporary and Digital History (C²DH) of the
                     University of Luxembourg in March 2017. The DTU aims to provide an experimental
                     space, in which different communities of practice and their epistemic cultures
                     negotiate new forms of knowledge production and dissemination in the field of
                     digital history.<a class="noteRef" href="#d4e231">[1]</a> The programme
                     involves thirteen PhD students with different disciplinary backgrounds, varying
                     from history, philosophy, linguistics, geography, archaeology, computer science
                     and human-computer interaction. One of the central aims of the DTU as such is to
                     form a “trading zone”, a space for interactions and negotiations between
                     these different knowledge domains, in order to explore how the emergence of
                     digital research technologies and infrastructures has impacted the practices of
                     doing historical research.

                        the humanities and the computer sciences during the last decades, this is

                        this article indicates well. Using the case study of the DTU, we aim at
                        discussing a number of critical questions that resonate with the topic of
                        this special issue: How to build bridges between different knowledge domains
                        in a specific research environment? How to stimulate interdisciplinary
                        collaboration and to get scholars out of their disciplinary or
                        methodological comfort zones? What is at stake in such interdisciplinary
                        trading zones? Who are the traders – and what is being traded? Investigating
                        these questions is not only relevant for the field of digital history, but
                        for the wider domain of digital humanities at large: many DH research
                        projects involve collaboration across different disciplinary fields and
                        domains. While much theoretical work is being done on interdisciplinarity in
                        digital humanities (e.g. [<a class="ref" href="#klein2015">Klein 2015</a>], [<a class="ref" href="#deegan2012">Deegan and McCarthy 2012</a>], [<a class="ref" href="#stehr2000">Stehr and Weingart 2000</a>]), the questions of
                        how to constitute an interdisciplinary trading zone in practice and how to
                        situate this trading zone in physical working environments remain largely
                        underexplored.

                        research practices. The shift from “digital history 1.0”, which was
                        basically about analysing digital sources with traditional historical
                        research methods, to “digital history 2.0”, which requires more

                        in an interdisciplinary setting.

                        Digital History Lab of the University of Luxembourg and the C²DH “open
                        space”, could play a role in the formation of trading zones and serve
                        as platforms for interdisciplinary knowledge production and dissemination.
                        It will be argued that physical spaces, like a common office and laboratory,
                        as research and training environments can be conductive for
                        interdisciplinary collaboration and exchange as well as for stimulating
                        processes of “thinkering”: the playful experimentation with digital
                        tools and technologies for historical research. We argue that training
                        infrastructures enabling hands-on collaboration are constructive for both

                        however, is dependent on various factors, such as time investment, research
                        profiles, and the willingness to cross disciplinary and discursive
                        boundaries. Reflecting on these matters, this article provides insights that
                        are beneficial for scholars, administrators, curriculum developers and heads
                        of research units in the field of digital history and the wider domain of

                           into three consequent phases: a DH incubation phase (first year), a DH
                           problematization phase (second and third year), and a final phase of

                           only focus on the first phase, the DH incubation phase, which aimed to
                           familiarize the interdisciplinary group of PhD students with a critical
                           mass of digital methods and tools. For this purpose, nine specific
                           skills trainings were organized within the DTU framework: Text Mining;
                           Digital Source Criticism; Database Structures; Introduction to

                           encourage the PhD students to critically reflect on the use of digital

                           team meetings. Next to the open space, the Centre has installed a cosy

                  <div class="ptext" id="p17">The DTU has explicitly been designed as a “trading zone”, as an experimental
                     place for knowledge transfer and exchange between different communities of
                     practice. In the case of the DTU, these include the knowledge domains of
                     history, philosophy, linguistics, geography, archaeology, computer science and
                     human-computer interaction. The concept of trading zone originates from history
                     of science and sociology of knowledge, where it has been used to analyse how
                     different communities of practice interact when working in an interdisciplinary
                     setting [<a class="ref" href="#collins2007">Collins et al. 2007</a>]
                     [<a class="ref" href="#galison1996">Galison 1996</a>]. Communities of practice can be defined as groups
                     of people who collectively engage in shared learning activities and base their
                     group identity on a shared craft, domain and practice [<a class="ref" href="#lave1991">Lave and Wenger 1991</a>]

                     interdisciplinary trading zone: (1) the notion of
                     <em class="term">interdisciplinarity</em>, (2) the notion of a <em class="term">common
                        ground</em> or <em class="term">common language</em> within interdisciplinary
                     trading zones, and (3) the notion of <em class="term">locality</em> or collaborative
                     space to facilitate interactions between communities of practice. By zooming in
                     on these three aspects of digital history trading zones, this part explores how
                     the DTU framework has been experienced by the PhD students and which “boundary
                     objects” we can identify between the distinct disciplinary traditions
                     within the DTU.

                        between or across different disciplinary fields or domains. Digital history
                        can be framed as an interdisciplinary field or domain of the wider
                        discipline of history, as digital historians have been “incorporating” methods and tools from the domain of computer

                        interdisciplinarity concerns the epistemological reflection on the nature of
                        these digital tools and technologies. The DTU explicitly deals with both
                        methodological and theoretical forms of interdisciplinarity.

                        and perspectives from different knowledge domains. As one of the PhD
                        students states: we are all “coming from different
                        [disciplifignary] backgrounds, [...] have different point[s] of view,

                        was formed within the DTU framework, in which a digital humanist, linguist
                        and digital heritage specialist worked together in reconstructing the
                        historic landscape of Larochette Luxembourg for a joint article. Bringing in
                        different perspectives and forms of expertise was very beneficial for them,
                        as one of the collaborators explained:

                              together. And [the linguist] said: “Look at the
                              street signs, you can see that this is named after the field
                              that stood here; and look, the church was here because this car
                              park is called graveyard.” While [the digital heritage
                              specialist] said, “If you look at the property
                              boundaries between the houses, you can see where the city wall
                              used to be.” While [the digital humanist] stated: “If you just take like three steps to the side
                              here, your perspective totally changes.” [...] Everybody
                              was literally bringing their view of landscape into it.

                           in interdisciplinary collaboration because of a certain need for
                           expertise from another field. A PhD student argues: “Everybody is an expert in a certain field. And if I need something
                           or if I have questions, it’s easy to approach people and ask them
                           what to do.” (interview, PhD 9, philosopher). Likewise,

                           application. And then they can collaborate” (interview, PhD
                           1, computer scientist). Some interdisciplinary collaborations go beyond
                           the mere methodological exchange and applicability of data, but involve
                           a debate about the epistemological underpinnings of disciplinary
                           traditions and schools of thought. A computer scientist in the group
                           states:

                                 use the help of a historian: what kind of questions come to mind

                           not only provide new opportunities. It can also be challenging in

                           to analyse historical data computationally, for instance, one needs to
                           be able to build a database and work with it. According to a digital
                           historian in the group this is actually one of the most important skills
                           in digital history: “Simply because we [as
                           historians] have always worked with source material. When we
                           enhance that source material with meta-data, and add this
                           meta-data to a database, we can see more patterns and may
                           discover a lot more than just by looking at the material
                           itself” (interview, PhD 4, digital historian).
                           However, the same digital historian also warned that if you think like a
                           computer scientist [too much], “you start seeing
                           things in ones and zeros; whereas reality is often more complex. I
                           think that this complexity is not always thought of in computer
                           science” (interview, PhD 4, digital historian). Despite of
                           the new opportunities offered by computer scientists, the “humanist way of thinking and knowledge”
                           shouldn’t be sacrificed in interdisciplinary trading zones (interview,
                           PhD 3, digital archaeologist). When being asked to reflect on the future
                           of digital history, one of the digital humanists in the group argues:
                           
                           <blockquote>
                              <p>... we have a discourse [at the moment]
                                 that technology is good, because it can help you if you already
                                 have a humanist mind. But if you don’t, it’s not going to help
                                 you develop one. You just base your entire career on these
                                 tools. [...] The most relevant skill [in interdisciplinary
                                 collaboration] remains the same that has always been, which is
                                 understanding: the humanities approach. (interview, PhD

                           investment. While they were potentially interesting, one of the PhD
                           students remarked that “the [main] goal is to finish

                           skills were necessarily applicable to their individual PhD research
                           projects – which indeed varied significantly in terms of topic, scale,
                           type of data, method and approach. In fact, the trainings were mostly
                           evaluated based on their applicability and usefulness for the PhD
                           student’s own research. It made one of the PhD students argue that the
                           skills trainings had “to be elective, because they
                           are not relevant for everyone. If you would just put everyone in the
                           same room and make them study, make them learn, it’s not productive
                           I think. It’s just a waste of time” (interview, PhD 10,
                           linguist). The PhD student further explained:

                                 session on text mining, you cannot make a person capable of text
                                 mining just after one day. And the same goes about databases. I
                                 know that some [of the PhD students] have experience with SQL. I
                                 attended the training and all I came out with was just a general
                                 understanding of how databases work. [...] So, it was just an
                                 introduction. I think that those trainings, if they had the
                                 purpose of bringing everyone to the same level, they didn’t do
                                 that. And they couldn’t by definition, by the time frame, by the
                                 level. [...] because everyone has different projects. Not

                        <div class="ptext" id="p35">Clearly, the DTU incubation phase did not serve everyone equally. The
                           question whether the skills trainings should be compulsory or not, was
                           extensively debated within the DTU Management Team as well as by the
                           complete project team during evaluation meetings. Eventually, half-way
                           the first year of the project it was decided to make the trainings no
                           longer compulsory but optional, so the PhD students could choose which
                           trainings were relevant to attend for themselves. The idea to establish
                           a common ground among the PhD students by means of a series of skills
                           trainings in digital humanities research practices, in other words, led
                           to some form of resistance. The DH incubation phase was experienced as
                           an enforced trading zone and, subsequently, led to a renegotiation of
                           the DTU’s training programme, framework and aims.

                     <div class="ptext" id="p36">A third characteristic of a trading zone is <em class="term">locality</em>. According
                        to historian of science Peter Galison, locality is central to the definition
                        of a trading zone, which he defines as “an arena in
                        which radically different activities could be locally, but not globally,
                        coordinated”
                        [<a class="ref" href="#galison1996">Galison 1996</a>, 690]. Digital humanists, in contrast,
                        often describe or qualify the recent intersection of the humanities and the
                        computer sciences as a “generalizable global
                        phenomenon” (see for a discussion [<a class="ref" href="#kemman2016">Kemman 2016</a>]).
                        While digital research infrastructures and online communication technologies
                        have certainly fostered new forms of collaboration at a distance, our
                        interest was to study the situated and local research practices.

                           One of the project’s distinguishing and grounding principles was to have
                           one shared open office space instead of having team members work in
                           different departments and locations. The concept of the open plan
                           office, typically “a shared room occupied by more
                           than four people, where desks are arranged in groups, and where
                           there are few barriers between desks”
                           [<a class="ref" href="#irving2016">Irving 2016</a>, 26], can be traced back to the 1920s
                           [<a class="ref" href="#baldry1997">Baldry 1997</a>]. After the 1960s, the open plan office
                           became implemented more widely in workspace design (see for a brief
                           history [<a class="ref" href="#irving2016">Irving 2016</a>, 26–8]). In academia, however,
                           this development is relatively new. While individual cellular offices
                           remain the norm, there have been movements towards “more open work environments” since the early 2000s [<a class="ref" href="#parkin2011">Parkin et al. 2011</a>]. This trend was pushed, among others, by new
                           managerial and financial paradigms (promoting flexible use of space and
                           cost efficiency [<a class="ref" href="#baldry2012">Baldry and Barnes 2012</a>]) as well as “demands for more collaborative and interdisciplinary
                           research”
                           [<a class="ref" href="#pinder2009">Pinder et al. 2009</a>, 5]. Research in the fields of social
                           psychology and organizational studies shows that group interactions
                           benefit indeed from close proximity: being physically near one another
                           is constructive for (interdisciplinary) collaboration, communication and
                           exchange (see, for instance [<a class="ref" href="#kiesler2002">Kiesler and Cummings 2002</a>], [<a class="ref" href="#hinds2002">Hinds and Kiesler 2002</a>], [<a class="ref" href="#olson2002">Olson et al. 2002</a>, 114]).<a class="noteRef" href="#d4e982">[11]</a> With this theory in

                           being situated in one collaborative working space as a group stimulated
                           exchanges within the team. A PhD student states: “I
                           think it’s thanks to the open space that we collaborate. Thanks to
                           the fact that we work in a similar department” (interview,
                           PhD 1, computer scientist). Another PhD student emphasized the
                           importance of physical proximity, which the C²DH open office provides as
                           a working environment: “It’s important to be near
                           each other. Yes, it creates an opportunity to do something
                           [together]” (interview, PhD 3, digital archaeologist). Of
                           course, “virtual” spaces or platforms of communication, like Skype,
                           Facebook and Slack, also provide possibilities for collaboration and
                           exchange: “You don’t have to be in the same [space
                           in order to collaborate]. I mean, you can use Skype, use different
                           [media], you can even call. [However] it’s easier when you are in
                           the same space” (interview, PhD 2, historian). One of the
                           downsides of communication via online platforms is that it comes with
                           certain conventions, which could make it more difficult to approach
                           someone else in the group:

                                 involve any risks to just easily talk to people. Collaborations
                                 almost always start through chats, I think. Well, okay, you can
                                 send an official email as well, but in my experience starting
                                 off with official emails doesn’t work with people who already
                                 have enough interesting things to do. (interview, PhD 3,

                           students prefer to have a quiet space as working environment, where they
                           can concentrate and work on their own without disturbing others: “If I really have to concentrate on something, if I’m
                           writing something, I prefer to have a space of my own. Because I
                           also feel kind of self-conscious, like I’m disturbing the others if
                           there’s stuff I need to do” (interview, PhD 7, digital
                           heritage specialist). More participants note that people in the open
                           space “can’t work really with all the chatting going
                           on” (interview, PhD 3, digital archaeologist) and signal the
                           fact that “people are wearing headphones all day
                           just to prevent others from disrupting them from their own
                           project” (interview, PhD 10, linguist). Some PhD students, on
                           the other hand, prefer to have some background noise: “Most people don’t like the open space because it’s too
                           loud. I [personally] don’t like the open space, because it’s too
                           quiet” (interview, PhD 6, digital humanist). The examples
                           make clear how difficult it is to meet the expectations of everyone when
                           it comes to a common working environment.

                           fact that ten out of the thirteen PhD students of the DTU have a second
                           office in the research institute, department or internal research groups
                           that their supervisor is affiliated to. The wide variety of disciplinary
                           research affiliations created a certain administrative and institutional
                           confusion for some of the PhD students, especially in the beginning of

                           students experienced in the open space. It allowed them to divide
                           between specific working environments in relation to types of work that
                           for instance required more concentration:

                           the supervisors played an important role in this issue as well. The

                           constructive for the building of a trading zone. Certainly, it didn’t
                           help the formation of a certain group identity with the project team. A
                           historian in the group reflected about the second offices in terms of a
                           “loss” for the DTU:

                           as expected might be related to the fact that the DTU missed a common
                           research project in which all PhD students would have to participate.
                           Collaborations between PhD students rather happened “bottom up” and
                           at smaller scale based on shared (thematic) research interests or

                        relationships to include is not just a technical, but also a conceptual
                        exercise. For example, in an internal collaboration on gender in computer
                        science conferences, thinking about data categories and relationships led to
                        a problem of how to cluster data in a database for making useful queries.
                        Structuring data by means of an “ontology” and “entity relationship
                        diagram” finally resulted in a graphical representation of the
                        relations between certain data entities and their attributes (Figure 5).
                        However, what exactly constitutes an “entity”, “relation” or
                        “attribute” is subject to human interpretation and therefore not
                        always self-evident:

                           <p>For example, first we were
                              thinking about putting the “People” category [...] in the
                              “Individuals” table, but then we saw this would work better
                              as a separate table. We first created the diagram on paper, and also
                              visualized/sketched our database tables to make the structure more
                              clear and understandable for ourselves (report Database

                        with database structures, text mining algorithms and data visualization
                        techniques in order to analyse, visualize and interpret their historical
                        sources and to discover certain meaningful patterns, relations or anomalies.
                        However, as historians of science and technology have argued before, using a
                        tool is “neither good, nor bad, nor neutral”
                        [<a class="ref" href="#kranzberg1986">Kranzberg 1986</a>, 544], but also shapes our practices and

                        by means of databases and ontologies inevitably involves some form of
                        transformation, translation and interpretation, which is necessary to

                           source criticism explored the transformation process from a historical
                           source to data by means of hands-on exercises. In the exercises,
                           participants needed to digitize a historical source themselves – a
                           historical text, analogue photo, audio recording, or 3D object. This
                           made them conscious about the ontological shift in the digitization
                           process and how this impacts their research practices. One of the
                           participants realised “how actual pieces of reality
                           are transformed from a historical type of knowledge to [a]
                           quantified one during the process of digitisation, and how inanimate
                           the data loss is” (report Digital Source Criticism, group 1,

                                 scanning books, to digitising pictures, audio or 3D material.
                                 [...] Before the workshop I hadn’t thought about if or how

                           qualities. Due to the transformation from material source to data, they
                           argued, “it is not a physical object anymore [...]
                           we can’t touch, taste and smell the photo [...] weigh the picture or
                           feel what kind of texture the paper is made of” (report
                           Digital Source Criticism, group 1). Another report mentions the loss of
                           “scale, colour, size, materiality, scent, sound,
                           historical sensation and context, storage, preservation,
                           restoration, price, accessibility, emotional / commercial /

                           Criticism, group 4). Reflecting on what such loss of material qualities
                           could mean for the historian in the hermeneutic research process, one of
                           the PhD students states in the report:

                                 for example cut and paste different pieces of audio, it is
                                 almost impossible to trace if or when parts were changed. This
                                 creates problems for historical research as it is almost
                                 impossible to know what the original file was. (report

                        <div class="ptext" id="p58">On the other side, people noticed how the digitization process not only
                           led to a potential loss of information, but could also enhance the
                           possibilities for research and investigation: a digitized source “allows digital touch-ups, zooming, and other new
                           functionalities” (report Digital Source Criticism, group 2).
                           Digitization, in other words, makes the source more accessible and
                           searchable: “Being able to zoom in, the background
                           of the picture becomes somewhat clearer and shows us that there is a
                           window in the back of the photograph. Although we manipulate the
                           picture by zooming in to get a closer look, we don’t lose the
                           ‘original’ data file of the picture” (report Digital
                           Source Criticism, group 1). However, as another report argues: “greater accessibility [...] would turn out to be
                           useless if digitised sources lack the necessary metadata”
                           (report Digital Source Criticism, group 2). It exemplifies the
                           importance of source criticism as a key competence of doing history in

                           of the transformation from data to database. Especially the skills
                           training on Database Structures discussed how the transformation from

                           interpretation and understanding. One of the participants raised the
                           question as follows:

                              <p>Databases represent data
                                 in a highly structured way. This means that we had to bring our
                                 raw data into a structured form. We did this by creating an
                                 ontology. [However] if the database is set up with the help of
                                 this ontology, it can be difficult to reconstruct the decisions
                                 that led to the creation of the ontology and the database. In
                                 this way, it could be the case, that some potentially valuable
                                 information is lost. (report Database Structures, PhD 9,

                           database structures may impact research results, not only in terms of
                           their indexical logic and semantic hierarchy, but also in terms of
                           missing or corrupted information. Close reading is therefore necessary
                           to complement – or possibly to contradict – certain results produced by
                           distant reading methodologies. As some of the PhD students argue:

                                 remained unresolved. Most problems relate to missing data, and
                                 sometimes it is very hard to define family relations when people
                                 do not have a name (i.e. three sisters, my father). One possible
                                 solution would be an added field called “other names” (i.e.

                                 back to my data files I noticed that I did not see certain
                                 faults that were still in the data files that I used. This
                                 constituted for example empty cells that were not supposed to be
                                 empty, countries or parts of a country that were not streamlined
                                 [such as] the use of “UK” when England is mentioned, but
                                 writing “UK Scotland” when the correspondent was from a

                                 visually it is [therefore] important that you double-check all

                        “transformative trading zones” are intrinsically related, it is
                        helpful to distinguish between the different dynamics involved.

                     <div class="ptext" id="p65">We have discussed how interdisciplinary exchange and collaboration comes with
                        a significant time investment. Since the PhD students have to finish their
                        individual PhD dissertations within three to four years, this puts a certain
                        constraint or limitation on the amount of time that they can invest in
                        interdisciplinary interactions. In other words, from the beginning of the
                        DTU, there has been an ongoing tension between the individual PhD research
                        on the one side and the collaborative aims of the DTU as interdisciplinary
                        project on the other. The tensions between individual and collaborative work
                        were to a certain degree mirrored and even reinforced by institutional
                        tensions between the C²DH – as host institute of the DTU – and the other
                        research institutes or departments that ten of the thirteen PhD students
                        (and their supervisors) are affiliated to. The dynamics between the various
                        institutional affiliations led to centrifugal forces, challenging the shared
                        open space as initial trading zone for the project.

                        of disciplinary tensions in the “transformative trading zone”. Although
                        the DTU skills trainings were potentially helpful to establish a common
                        ground and so stimulated interdisciplinary exchanges and connections among
                        the PhD students, they also came with some form of interdisciplinary
                        resistance. Not only on the side of the PhD students, but also on the side
                        of the supervisors and instructors of the skills trainings.

                        proved basically to be a challenge of communication. In fact, the skills
                        trainings have made discursive differences between disciplines explicit. It
                        is through the collaborative work that the different epistemic traditions
                        become visible and make people aware of the implicit traditions of their
                        community of practice. By experiencing these differences and making them a
                        topic of reflection, the “enforced trading zone” at the beginning of
                        the DTU slowly but steadily changed into a “transformative trading
                        zone” which was able to adapt to the specific needs and interests of
                        the PhD students involved. Sometimes, even a new terminology or
                        “interlanguage” appeared, bridging (discursive) disciplinary
                        boundaries. In one of the self-reflexive reports on the skills training on
                        GIS-analysis, for example, a participant describes an original historical
                        map as a “non digital-born source”:

                              “anchor” the historical map to the digital one. In this way, <em class="emph">a

                     <div class="counter"><a href="#p68">68</a></div>
                     <div class="ptext" id="p68">We can draw at least three concrete lessons learned. The first lesson is the
                        meaning of spaces and places of collaboration and communication for
                        interdisciplinary projects. When organizing an interdisciplinary doctoral
                        training unit, most of the attention often goes to the creation of an
                        interesting training programme or curriculum. Based on our reflections of
                        the Digital History Lab and the C²DH open space as situated research and
                        training environments, however, we found that the spatial dimension is just
                        as important for establishing an interdisciplinary trading zone. A second
                        lesson concerns the governance of this trading zone, in particular the
                        disciplinary and institutional disparity resulting from the dynamics between
                        the C²DH, as the host institution of the DTU, and the various disciplinary
                        research institutes that the PhD students and their supervisors are
                        affiliated to. Unlike some of the literature on interdisciplinarity in
                        digital humanities, we learned that the value of bridging disciplinary gaps
                        in a digital history project is actually not a given – even among the DTU
                        team members. For this, perhaps, the supervisors could have played a more
                        stimulating role in the centralization of the DTU as an interdisciplinary
                        project. A third lesson is that the tension between the individual PhD
                        research and the aims of the DTU as a collaborative project could be solved,
                        at least partly, by designing common research projects within the DTU
                        framework right from the beginning. Although some bottom-up and small scale
                        collaborations already emerged in the first year, and new ones have been
                        formed in the second year as well, the question is whether such internal
                        group collaborations could have been stimulated more, or whether this would
                        have created just another instrumentalization of interdisciplinary
                        collaboration similar to the DH incubation phase.

                     <div class="counter"><a href="#p69">69</a></div>
                     <div class="ptext" id="p69">In conclusion, we argue that the formation and transformation of
                        interdisciplinary trading zones depends on various factors, including time
                        investment, collaborative spaces and research infrastructures, communication
                        skills, research profiles, and scholars willingness and ability to cross
                        both spatial and disciplinary boundaries. Getting PhD students out of their
                        disciplinary “comfort zone” and making them fit for an
                        interdisciplinary “trading zone” thus comes with a lot of challenges.
                        Instead of striving for a homogeneous and fully collaborative
                        “interlanguage trading zone” - which possibly remains a theoretical
                        option rather than a realistic possibility - we argue that digital history
                        trading zones should actually embrace their own diversity, heterogeneity and
                        hybridity [<a class="ref" href="#zaagsma2013">Zaagsma 2013</a>]. Because, as Peter Weingart has
                        argued, “interdisciplinarity is not the promise of
                        ultimate unity, but of innovation and surprise by way of recombining of
                        different parts of knowledge, no matter which”
                        [<a class="ref" href="#weingart2000">Weingart 2000</a>, 41]. The creative uncertainty that
                        results from such engagement clearly fosters new questions and curiosity –
                        which should be the aim and motivation of any scientific endeavour.

                     a digital historian, who collaborated to analyse the role of gender
                     in computer science conferences by means of digital classification
                     of research areas based on topic modelling. Another

                     collaboration between a digital humanist, digital heritage
                     specialist and linguist, dealing with the 3D reconstruction of the
