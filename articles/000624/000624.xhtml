                  <p>The difficulty of integrating the data, metadata, and classification schemes produced
                     across a wide geographic, historical, and cultural variety of institutional sites
                     and
                     practices was a major impetus for the creation of Linked Data (LD). The promise was
                     to make diverse sets of data interoperable through subscription to an array of
                     standardizations while leaving the original data intact. These operational
                     requirements enable interoperability at the expense of specificity, and require
                     considerable resources for implementation. While LD supports connection and access
                     across disparate data sets, it is not focused on the intellectual issues that have
                     to
                     do with enabling the correlation and comparison of diverse ontologies, or preserving
                     and exploring their epistemic and cultural specificity — issues essential to
                     humanistic study. In addition, LD is exclusively concerned with linguistic data, and
                     can hence not be applied to information that is expressed in graphical form.
                     Contrastingly, the Heterochronologies project regards temporality as a concept
                     expressed epistemically through various culturally-specific, authoritative
                     ontologies, which are instantiated by graphical representations such as chronologies
                     and timelines. The project concentrates on extracting computationally tractable
                     structured data from historical images so that the underlying ontologies may be
                     compared without subsuming them into a hegemonic data model. In this sense, the
                     Heterochronologies project is an exercise in comparative ontology. </p>

                  <div class="ptext" id="p1">Structured data in graphical formats present certain challenges for computational
                     systems rooted in language (Semantic Web) and metrics (quantitative data); and yet,
                     many forms of information are expressed in graphical form as instantiations of
                     ontologies that originate from specific cultural values and points of view. The
                     history of graphic expressions for time-keeping stretches from early tallies of the
                     phases of the moon to current automated systems for tracking temporal phenomena at
                     nano-to-macro scales; these temporal records often serve practical purposes, but they
                     also encode belief systems. This is reflected in the sequential cycles of the Mayan
                     “Long Count” calendar and the Judeo-Christian tradition of dividing time into
                     periods “before” and “after” the birth of Christ. In Western culture,
                     Biblical chronologies dominated representations of human history until the advent
                     of
                     “deep time,” which was introduced by James Hutton and others in the late 18th
                     century as part of the emerging science of geology. Hutton inherited a time scale
                     that had been in place from late antiquity, codified through such widely-used
                     references as the work of Bishop James Ussher. In his radical extension of time’s
                     scale, Hutton altered the ideological as well as metrical frameworks for historical
                     understanding. The graphical formats in which these schemes are expressed are
                     structured data, but do not readily lend themselves to direct processing by
                     computational means.</div>
                  
                  <div class="counter"><a href="#p2">2</a></div>
                  <div class="ptext" id="p2">For research that acknowledges these historical shifts in understanding and
                     representing time, identifying which chronologies adhere to a scientific
                     understanding of time is not the main concern. Every graphical expression of a
                     chronological scheme is historical evidence of a descriptive system, which is useful
                     to scholarship concerned with how time has been conceived in particular historical
                     contexts. Though geology requires a different chronological framework than that of
                     Dakota Winter Counts or early Roman calendar systems, each of these schemes expresses
                     culturally specific understandings and epistemologies of chronology which demonstrate
                     unique approaches to accounting for chronological events. Respect for the specificity
                     of these schemes and for the cultural otherness of diverse past and present
                     viewpoints is essential for the study of human knowledge in its multiplicity of
                     forms. However, it is not trivial to translate this respect for ontological
                     difference into sense-making and analytic tools. </div>
                  
                  <div class="counter"><a href="#p3">3</a></div>
                  <div class="ptext" id="p3">With this respect for specificity, and its computational representation as a guiding
                     concern, the Heterochronologies project puts forth a few fundamental notions. First,
                     it proposes to treat graphical representations of time as structured data that can
                     be
                     made tractable, analyzed, and used comparatively in a digital environment; this is
                     a
                     humanist project that requires innovative digital intervention. Second, it supports
                     the systematic analysis of disparate chronologies with an attention to their unique
                     cultural differences. Indeed, this project was motivated by the conviction that
                     different chronologies should be studied without subsuming them into a single
                     standard or framework. In this regard, it is a project in dialogue with Linked Data
                     initiatives that specify crosswalks into a uniform standard as a way to make data
                     interoperable. The logical and procedural standardizations established by the Linked
                     Data model — RDF standards for structures, domain ontologies for semantics, and
                     vocabularies for authority control — lose sight of the specificity and cultural
                     contexts of the originating data models by requiring the approximated translation
                     of
                     existing semantic structures into prescribed ones. We believe an ethical issue is
                     raised by this translation and its subtle but actual assertion of a hegemonic
                     approach.</div>
                  
                  <div class="counter"><a href="#p4">4</a></div>
                  <div class="ptext" id="p4">A key functionality that inspired the Heterochronologies design, and which allows
                     it
                     to enable interoperability while avoiding translation, is the ability to specify
                     <em class="term">floating correlations</em>, or discrete relationships between points in
                     different schemes of representation that enable them to be compared. The idea of a
                     <em class="term">floating correlation</em> is that specific points in differently
                     structured schemes can be linked without requiring that the systems share a structure
                     or metric. The single point of correlation allows the rest of the scheme to ‘float’
                     with its own extension. For example, depictions of the Leonid Meteor Showers of 1833
                     appear in multiple chronological record keeping systems, each of which is constructed
                     according to its own time scale, with distinct start and end points, and different
                     valuations of the event. The relative position of the Showers in each chronological
                     system can be specified as a floating correlation, and thereby compared across
                     systems, each as its own cultural expression of time. A key benefit of this approach
                     is that it enables the comparison of chronologies relative to an event depicted in
                     each, rather than to a unifying scheme of representation; relationality is allowed
                     to
                     emerge from the data, rather than as a consequence of the establishment of an <em class="emph">a
                        priori,</em> unifying scheme which inevitably imposes cultural connotations and
                     biases. For example, Egyptian dynastic periodization can be matched with geological
                     events and Olympiads without all of these needing to be expressed in the Gregorian
                     calendar, and the Winter Counts do not have to take the birth of Christ as the start
                     point for their reference frame.</div>
                  
                  <div class="counter"><a href="#p5">5</a></div>
                  <div class="ptext" id="p5">The aforementioned notions have been operationalized through several activities, or
                     goals, in the Heterochronologies project. The first is by studying chronological
                     systems in their graphical expression to understand how they periodize, value, mark,
                     and represent historical time; in other words, the first activity is to study the
                     graphical structure of these chronologies as intellectual objects. The second is
                     using this study as an exercise in comparative ontologies within their original
                     formulation; the point of this is to make ontologies <em class="emph">legible</em> as
                     ideological documents that can be <em class="emph">read </em>as value-producing systems. This
                     goal is bound to a third, which is using graphical methods of analysis as research
                     tools — analyzing formal, schematic, and visual representations of ontologies as the
                     basis of systematic inquiry into their characteristics. The final goal is to provide
                     a digital platform for organizing chronological information for research or
                     pedagogical purposes. Such a software environment supports the analysis of
                     chronological systems and their graphical forms, including how they periodize, value,
                     mark, and represent historical time. This goal resulted in the development of a
                     prototype for a Time Capsule work environment that includes a Collection of examples
                     and a Chrono-Referencing system for organizing floating correlations in a digital
                     platform. </div>

                  <div class="ptext" id="p6">Overall, the unique contribution of the Heterochronologies project has to do with
                     the
                     methodological approach through which it treats visual representations of time as
                     structured data that may be serialized in a JSON data structure to enable cross-case
                     comparison without requiring the subsumption of the various logical and semantic
                     elements that compose such representations into a hegemonic system. In other words,
                     this project allows correlation of data that is expressed graphically by chronologies
                     — historic, contemporary, existing, and not yet created — while preserving the
                     specific characteristics of their originating contexts of production. In this sense,
                     though this project is focused on chronologies, the methodological approach and
                     analysis are meant to be extensible to other kinds of ontologies. While we developed
                     this project and the tool in which it culminates with the general public in mind,
                     its
                     scope is to support any and all research projects that make visual temporal
                     representations their object. Academic researchers, librarians, teachers, students,
                     and lay persons are all potential users of the Time Capsule tool we present in this
                     paper.</div>

                        this project aims to support. First, the value expressed by graphical
                        representations of time — i.e., timelines and chronologies — is a function of the
                        relationship between <em class="emph">frames</em> and <em class="emph">elements</em> within them
                        [<a class="ref" href="#drucker2009">Drucker 2009</a>]. A frame is a defining boundary – graphical or
                        conceptual – which can establish a unifying scheme of reference or an
                        epistemological context that supports an arrangement of elements a) in relation to
                        one another; and b) in accordance with certain logical rules and semantic
                        conventions. Elements arranged in relation to a frame express underlying data
                        structures and values, enabling them to <em class="emph">provoke sense-making</em>
                        according to ontological and epistemological regulations that they enact.<a class="noteRef" href="#d4e276">[1]</a>

                     <div class="ptext" id="p8">For the purposes of this project, we regard frame and elements as formally
                        distinct types of objects serving interdependent roles that can be represented
                        computationally. Following the premise that graphical elements are involved in
                        part-to-whole and part-to-part relations, and that their meaning is instantiated
                        by those relations, any part considered for analysis should also be analyzed in
                        relation to other parts and wholes that inform its significance. Furthermore, the
                        formal distinction between frame and elements should be respected by and reflected
                        in the digital environment to enable comparison, including the operations
                        supported by the system as well as the underlying computational aspects at both
                        logical and syntactical level. This enables the project to support comparison

                        artifactual representations of time charged with humanistic and symbolic value.
                        Consequently, comparison between representations of time should not forgo the
                        meaning or specificity of values proper to each. However, rhetorical aspects of
                        chronologies, as well as their contextual and historical circumstances of
                        production and use, are difficult to represent in data structures that could be
                        analyzed and compared. Formal data structures — especially generalizable ones —
                        are not particularly suited to encoding certain features of graphical expression.
                        Aesthetic dimensions of color, tone, or line weight may be easily overlooked — not
                        to mention such features as a Cherubim holding curtains aside to reveal an
                        information-bearing element (Fig. 1). These features play a fundamental role in
                        the interpretation of individual chronologies, evidencing their production and use
                        as cultural artifacts. Acknowledging this, this project is committed to respecting
                        and preserving rhetorical aspects of chronologies when transposing into
                        computational representations. This requires not only considering them at all
                        stages of the project development, but also acknowledging their significance as
                        terms that enable comparison.</div>

                     <div class="ptext" id="p10">As mentioned, one way this project departs from Linked Data is its commitment to
                        comparison, connection, and enrichment of data through emergent semantic
                        interlinking, rather than requiring entities and relations to conform to a
                        uniform, prescriptive set of definitions established in advance of their analysis.
                        The ways in which Linked Data establish relationality are problematic, in that the
                        translation of local entities, whether logical or semantic, into LD seldom
                        resolves in the direct correspondence of synonyms — a fact for which LD makes no
                        provisions. The result is loss of information at frame and element levels, which
                        inevitably contributes to the misrepresentation of artifacts, their features,
                        their meaning and their overall specificities. This is not conducive to the
                        instantiation of meaningful comparisons, since the entities being compared are not
                        the original ones. Furthermore, the act of subsuming entities into a dominating
                        system has hegemonic effects, in the sense that a given system can preclude the
                        representation of ideas that do not fit into its scheme. In this sense, operating
                        under such premises results in a loss of accuracy, relevance and specificity,
                        indeed a loss of <em class="emph">difference</em>, in order to acquire of a degree of

                        each system — i.e., its mode of presentation, graphical features, and cultural
                        contexts — while supporting correlations and comparisons. The project is designed
                        so that operations carried out by the system enable comparison of representations
                        without the need to either translate or subsume individual chronologies and
                        comparative processes into a dominating epistemological paradigm.
                        <em class="term">Constitutive difference</em> is to be identified and respected without
                        being reduced, both within individual representations and in the comparative act.
                        Constitutive difference suggests that specificity is inherent in an artifact, but
                        able to be abstracted from its particular features into a systematic means of
                        comparison. Our approach to using this concept was to create a descriptive
                        vocabulary from graphical images that could be used as the basis of a diagrammatic
                        structure from which quantitative metrics could be derived. For example, a
                        temporal unit in a biblical timeline would have a different graphical and thus
                        quantitative value than in a geological one, but its value within the source
                        graphic could be specified within the system of frames, axes, spans, intervals,
                        and other components by which it was constituted. While this sounds abstract, it
                        was meant to provide a way to generate quantitative value within each graphical
                        example on its own terms.</div>

                     <div class="ptext" id="p12">One intuitive approach to comparing graphical representations of time that
                        respects constitutive difference is to align these representations around
                        chronological events that they have in common. To reiterate, this approach invokes
                        the concept of <em class="term">floating correlation</em> across points of reference in
                        distinct contexts, chronologies, and representations, rather than within a single
                        unifying framework. By establishing common points of reference across contexts,
                        distinct chronologies can be aligned and synchronized relative to these reference
                        points. The already-mentioned 1833 Leonid meteor shower is one such common point
                        of reference: it is an event that has been witnessed, recorded, and represented in
                        different yet similar ways by a number of cultural groups, and for this reason it
                        provides the opportunity to compare multiple representations of time by aligning
                        them according to a common feature. By aligning Native Americans’ Winter Counts
                        (Fig. 2, Fig. 3, Fig. 4) records of the Leonid meteor shower, the temporal view of
                        events is extended in a way that enables comparison of structural, logical and
                        topical elements across different contexts of representation and documentation.
                        Points for alignment may be identified using automated processes of data analysis,
                        but the Heterochronologies system is designed to support the manual selection of
                        fixed events, since it is conceivable that users might want to specify such points
                        in their analyses.</div>

                        of chronological comparison. For instance, a linear representation that displays
                        the succession of ancient Egyptian dynasties cannot be synched with Minard’s
                        representation of Napoleon’s 1812 march to and retreat from Moscow (Fig. 5)
                        because of lack of common temporal reference points. Similarly, other temporal
                        representations may, conceivably, express fundamentally different conceptions of
                        time — e.g., linear versus circular/cyclical — that may not be able to be related
                        through alignment of fixed events. With a lack of common temporal measures and
                        structures, distinct representations of time are temporally incommensurable.
                        However, other features may still be compared even in such cases: formal,
                        structural, semantic, logical, rhetorical; types of data structures,
                        distributions, intervals, quantity and quality of data points, and so on. Some
                        timelines and chronologies may be aligned because they share, for instance, the
                        same definition of years, months, days, or periods of time. Therefore, in the

                        comparable features of disparate chronologies, they do not ensure that these
                        chronologies can be easily synchronized. For instance, the “Painting” and
                        “Plumbing” tasks listed in the Ganntt chart of Fig. 6 (items 9 and 7 from
                        the bottom, respectively) may be formally represented as having been completed at
                        the same time, but the metric is not sufficiently granular to support correlation
                        of information at a level that could guarantee precise synchronicity — the bars
                        and bands are too crude. While activities that take place in time are represented
                        here within time buckets or divisions, the actual unfolding of the activity may
                        not happen within such discrete separations. In fact, time can be subdivided
                        infinitely, and determining the points on which comparisons can be made within
                        such divisions raises metaphysical as well as epistemological problems. At one
                        extreme, the chronology titled “Eternity to Eternity”
                        (Fig. 7) provides an edge case for thinking about the types of comparisons which
                        can be enabled and supported when different extensions of time are put in
                        relation. The challenge of periodization within such an incalculable time scale
                        poses certain paradoxes — can the infinite be segmented when the start and end
                        points referenced are basically indeterminate? These challenges quickly shift from
                        theoretical abstractions to practical dilemmas in creating data representations.
                        How can such subdivisions of “eternity” be translated into specified intervals in
                        a JSON format? </div>

                           graphical representation of time. The selection of the problem set was informed
                           by the need to a) create a representative selection of approaches in terms of
                           scale, graphical structure, cultural points of view, and other features, and to
                           b) collect edge cases that would challenge, complicate, or otherwise highlight
                           key conceptual or formal aspects of chronologies. The problem set was not meant
                           to be exhaustive in any way, but rather to raise problems for existing
                           approaches that concern the Heterochronologies project, and in this sense to
                           provide fundamental constraints that must be considered for comparing diverse
                           representations of time. These are from Western, Russian, Chinese, Native
                           American cultures, and date from the early Renaissance (with roots in
                           antiquity) through to the early 20th century. Throughout research, we referred
                           to the images in this problem set to iteratively develop conventions for
                           describing the logical, graphical, and semantic structures entailed by
                           representations of time. The problem set includes both

                           representations of historical events — and <em class="term">timelines</em> — continuous
                           temporal phenomena in a unified linear format. Although the images in the
                           problem set share certain features of continuous and linear representations of
                           time, we selected examples that posed challenges for comparison; thus, while
                           some of the images are more strictly concerned with temporal relations, others

                           visual elements in the chronologies. Because a programming language is designed
                           to support the specification of a wider variety of functionalities than the

                           pedagogy. A key principle guiding this design is that components of a
                           chronology are often incommensurable across chronologies, but they can be
                           correlated — either as specific dates or in reference to common temporal
                           events. The challenge here is to perform analysis on linguistic, graphic, or
                           pictorial contents, while still accounting for the structural and syntactic
                           idiosyncrasies of graphical representations. To showcase this approach, we
                           designed mock-ups of a Time Capsule software environment that illustrate how a

                           that enables floating correlation and temporal synchronization between
                           chronologies. Chrono-References are chronological systems in common use that we
                           selected to serve as substitutable schemes of reference for chronological
                           analysis. These include Gregorian, Julian, Christian, Islamic, Jewish, Egyptian
                           (dynasties), Winter counts, Mayan, and Chinese calendar systems. A second set
                           might include geological time periods (Archean, Cambrian, Ordovician etc.),
                           anthropological/archaeological ones (Bronze Age, Iron Age and so on linked to
                           specific geographical locations), and other domain specific, discipline or
                           task-driven schemes, such as carbon dating. To demonstrate how
                           chrono-referencing might operate, we present the Time Capsule mock-up with a
                           sample of chronologies called a Collection, annotated with Chrono-References.
                           The purpose of the Collection is to demonstrate how a computational framework
                           for comparing chronologies could operate in practice and extend to other

                           languages that are used to specify visual elements, such as the <cite class="title italic">D3</cite> and <cite class="title italic">three.js</cite>
                           JavaScript libraries. These code libraries involve a) a syntax for drawing
                           graphical elements; b) certain pre-made functions that produce more complex
                           visual elements, and c) in the case of <cite class="title italic">D3</cite>, a data
                           visualization system that enables <em class="emph">binding</em> data to graphical
                           elements, and then adjusting them dynamically. Libraries like <cite class="title italic">D3</cite> can be used to produce a wide variety of
                           visualizations using the same components and similar techniques, although with
                           some unifying constraints. To develop a computational visualization with this
                           code library, a programmer envisions certain graphics and functionalities, and
                           then works backward to identify functionalities provided by the library that
                           could produce this result. We envision this method of ‘working backwards’ as an
                           approach to devise a markup language that would allow for comparison between
                           existing visualizations. In short, if we can design a new language to produce a
                           variety of different visualizations, this language can also be used to compare

                           visualizations out of computational elements. The method of devising a
                           programming syntax raised fundamental design considerations concerning how to
                           specify and relate graphical and structural elements. For example, the axis
                           object in the Gantt chart (Fig. 6) could be treated as a ‘global’ object with
                           attributes that other elements in the chart could ‘inherit;’ <em class="emph">or</em> it
                           could be defined as a ‘local’ object with its own unique attributes. Through
                           identifying and discussing design considerations such as this, we assessed the
                           trade-offs and implications for comparing chronologies through these methods.
                           Here, a central concern was to ensure that the constraints and patterns of a
                           programming syntax did not over-determine our scheme of description and
                           comparison. In the case of the axis, for example, the axes were not defined as
                           ‘global’ objects, which would be a convenience for programming, because that
                           would impose a computational design pattern onto the visualization that it does
                           not specify. In all instances, the Heterochronologies environment worked to
                           avoid subsuming specificity and difference into either generality or
                           uniformity.</div>

                           possible attributes it could have. One of these class attributes —
                           <em class="emph">crossed</em> — joined elements together so that they could represent
                           multiple attributes of data (also called ‘dimensions’), which would then enable
                           plotting data according to these elements. For the Gantt chart, the axis and
                           table were ‘crossed’ so that data with an axis attribute and a table attribute
                           could be populated among them. Other attributes like segments could take
                           another element as a property, allowing for a kind of nesting or inheritance

                           process — recognizing that much of the programming was extracted from the
                           graphical features, not merely projected onto them. Through the devised syntax,
                           graphical and structural elements that could be represented with the same

                           language developed, it became clear that it would be easier to view the
                           specified graphical and structural elements relationally in visual form,
                           instead of as displays of code. This was the motivation for the third approach
                           in the methodology: to draw relational diagrams of the chronologies and their
                           components. At this time, another provisional taxonomy of components was
                           defined that persisted throughout our experiments and discussions.</div>

                           Experiments with the ways in which basic elements could be combined to make new
                           elements draw out these combination sequences. As the diagrams developed
                           iteratively, the taxonomy of components that could represent the patterns was
                           updated. In an approach similar to the development of the programming syntax,
                           the iterative design of the relational diagrams raised considerations and
                           challenges for creating a scheme of chronology comparison and consequently
                           prompted further discussion. At this point, a crucial distinction was made
                           between <em class="emph">spans</em>, or graphical extensions that imply directionality
                           or continuity, and <em class="emph">sets</em>, which are graphical groupings of other
                           elements that do not imply directionality and continuity. Conventions developed
                           for specifying non-directional relationships between these elements which were
                           still able to account for structural hierarchies that they implied.</div>

                           similarities among them. [See Figures 9, 10, and 11 below.] A graphical system
                           was iteratively designed to enable these structures to be compared in a
                           simplified and intuitive way. In the final graphical system, textual
                           descriptions of elements (e.g., axis, span) are summarized with symbolic
                           glyphs. Instead of representing relationships between structural elements with
                           lines, which tended to imply directionality, overlapping regions are used to
                           indicate constraints that certain elements impose on others, and graphical
                           conventions indicate high-level properties of these constraints, like their

                           <em class="emph">grapho-logical analysis</em> of chronologies: the use of a notation
                           system to summarize structural features of chronological representations for
                           visual comparison. The concept of grapho-logical analysis is that of extracting
                           quantitative metrics from the specific structures of chronological
                           representations, which enables these structure to be analyzed and visualized.
                           In other words, it is a method of abstracting structured data from schematic
                           images, which can then be examined for further analysis. By identifying
                           relationships between frame, span, interval, tick-marks or units and other
                           graphic features, and then specifying them in a notation system, the value of
                           any particular element can be analyzed and visualized relative to the

                           representations that involve different specifications or indices of time, but
                           comparable structures for representing time nonetheless. In a biblical time
                           frame, for instance, Creation is dated to 4004 BCE. This allows for an explicit
                           calculation of the year of Christ’s birth and the present, from Adam to Noah
                           and by extension, spans of time in the present. By contrast, the use of
                           historical timeline for events from the colonization of America to the first
                           presidents of the United States is designed on grid that spans only about two
                           hundred years from 1607 to 1800. The units in the second chronology are
                           decades, but they imply a relation to the Gregorian calendar and the birth of
                           Christ as the 0 year. The two timelines can be compared graphically, with the
                           relative value metrically computed. A presidential term of four years has a
                           value when it is located in a span of two hundred years. The same two hundred
                           years of history has a different relative value within a six thousand year span
                           (or within the endless expanse of eternity).</div>

                           This supports correlation — using the zero year or using the time span of the

                           Eternity” (Figure 8). The method allows us to see (literally, in
                           visual form) the relationship of one schema to another while also understanding
                           the relative quantitative value of events within each. Presidential terms might
                           diminish in significance relative to the span of eternal timescale, or, by
                           contrast, demonstrate the value of the specific granularity of measures. What
                           is the value of a year? It can be calculated relative to the span to which the
                           year belongs. Generating such metric values supports comparison and correlation
                           — the representation of <em class="emph">constitutive difference </em> — without forcing
                           either scheme to be represented in terms of the other. The approach gets at the
                           specifics of value in each scheme (four years of two hundred, two hundred years
                           of six thousand). In this way, grapho-logical analysis offers a schematic
                           presentation of the information and visualizes the relative scales in an

                        specifying degrees of uncertainty. Some degrees of uncertainty are merely a factor

                     <div class="ptext" id="p38">In parallel with developing a descriptive and analytic vocabulary, the project
                        made use of various graphical methods for analyzing the structures and
                        representation of chronologies. An initial question was whether formal data could
                        be extracted automatically from the visual representations, by using optical
                        character recognition (OCR) or other approaches to automated graphical analysis,
                        or whether formal data could be specified by a custom notation system. Specifying
                        the requirements of such formal approaches to data extraction and representation
                        of structure led to the development of a grapho-logical notation system designed
                        to facilitate and represent comparison and correlation of structural components.
                        Grapho-logical analysis supports a connection between graphical images (timelines
                        and chronologies) and logical structures that can be represented in computational
                        terms, enabling their subsequent visualization and analysis. This addressed the
                        challenge of identifying the ways in which the formal structures of chronologies
                        could be represented as logical structures that are legible to computational
                        processing. By determining the components of the logical structure, the typology
                        of relationships among the components, and ways for these components of the formal
                        structure to become a data structure, this method addressed ways in which a data
                        structure could be abstracted and/or extracted directly from an image.</div>

                     <div class="ptext" id="p39">The grapho-logical approach to comparison also provides a formal notational scheme
                        as a shorthand for display of that analysis within the Time Capsule workspace (see
                        figures below). Grapho-logical analysis is based on the components and factors of
                        comparison outlined above (axes, orientation, spans, events, and segments). For
                        instance, start-points and end-points of an axis provide a crucial feature on
                        which to make correlations. (The space of time from Creation to the Flood, for
                        instance, is different from that defined by fixed dates such as 1700-1890 or that
                        indicated by a span from Eternity to Eternity.) One crucial tenet of belief
                        guiding the project has been that graphical methods of analysis are primary modes
                        of knowledge production, and demonstrating this is important. The graphical
                        elements of the original documents are considered essential information, even when
                        they are abstracted into a second-order grapho-logical system. This notation
                        scheme is analytic (it shows how the relation of structural features in the
                        chronologies can be understood in a distilled, diagrammatic, mode) and
                        representational (it encodes that analysis in a visual shorthand). It is designed
                        to represent <em class="emph">constitutive difference </em>across representations, rather
                        than to indicate the structure of these representations definitively.</div>

                        a computational framework was devised that could assist researchers in
                        identifying, annotating, and analyzing these features. Such a framework would
                        allow for the specification of points within a chronological system to be isolated
                        for correlation with other chronologies, as well as the visualization of these
                        correlations and their characteristics. As noted earlier, the Leonid meteor

                     Capsule includes recognition of a basic epistemological concern with constitutive
                     difference. Such difference stems from the structural, logical, semantic, and
                     rhetorical features of these representation (intrinsic difference). In order to
                     conduct a meaningful comparison, differences among representations may be identified
                     (extrinsic difference). Intrinsically non-Boolean relations represented in some
                     chronologies (those that cannot be adequately expressed in explicit, formal terms)
                     also need to be respected within the formalization process. Regardless of whether

                     problems with the conceptual prototype. Some are theoretical, or epistemological,
                     such as the method for representing infinity in a data structure, or for representing
                     simultaneity or synchronicity. These are philosophical issues as much as technical
                     ones. A practical matter is how to segment the chronologies, and what the
                     justification for segmentation might be in any instance. The semantics of
                     segmentation invoke the description of units of time, mentioned above (days,
                     lifetimes, solar cycles, and other temporal units) with their symbolic as well as
                     metrical value. Unresolved issues worth mentioning here are related to the challenges
                     posed by the visual motifs of graphical representations which play an important
                     rhetorical role but are not part of the formal temporal notation system; these
                     qualities of inflection and style in lettering, drawing, line treatment, iconography,
                     mythical figures, and allegorical images which, while incidental to the logical

                  <div class="ptext" id="p46">Indeed, a thorough analysis of chronologies ought to consider structural, logical,
                     semantic, and graphical elements. The structural elements include the value of formal
                     position, graphical zones that map onto visual zones for machine learning, framing
                     or
                     boundary delimitation, components seen relationally down to the item level, and
                     various syntaxes of part to whole of specific features. Initially, these were
                     subjected to an automated image analysis process, akin to OCR, that pointed at
                     graphical entities. This identified various semantic features, including components
                     that lend themselves to topic modeling, statistical analysis, and to humanistic
                     interpretative study within the ideological, material, and cultural contexts of which
                     they are an expression and in which they are embedded. The graphical qualities thus
                     gave rise to a combined typology of schematic forms, understood diagrammatically as
                     images that perform work, obtain value through their structure (e.g., the rooted tree
                     and the un-rooted tree; the matrix/grid and the cycle), and are available to a
                     combination of automated and human analysis. The extent to which the analysis of
                     graphical form can be fully automated remains to be seen, as naturally many features
                     that give the chronologies their visual and cultural specificity will not lend
                     themselves to computational analysis without reduction to a point that renders the

                  <div class="ptext" id="p47">The goals of the Heterochronologies system have been to analyze visual
                     representations of time — chronologies and timelines — as meaningful cultural and
                     historical objects in a way that preserves their specificity. Chronologies perform
                     semantic and syntactic work of embodying historically and culturally specific
                     understandings of the boundaries and values of temporal events. To analyze chronology
                     with this in mind, a method of graphical analysis of frames, axes, components, and
                     features was developed along with an elaboration of a semantics of time units (days,
                     lifetimes, periods etc.). The use of graphical methods of schematic logical analysis
                     was part of this work, demonstrating the value of visual approaches as an
                     intellectual component of research and study. The need for a computational framework
                     to support interactive analysis of chronologies arose from the use of these graphical
                     methods to establish parameters on which value at any particular point could be
                     assessed through correlation, rather than through a crosswalk into a reductively
                     uniform system. Finally, the project worked to develop a design prototype for a Time
                     Capsule work environment that allows graphical correlation, annotation, and visual
                     comparison for pedagogical and research purposes. </div>

                     conceptual development of the Heterochronologies project is an experiment in
                     approaching problems of knowledge representation through graphical objects and visual
                     methods. This is an opening to innovative work in digital scholarship. Chronologies
                     are graphical, pictorial representations of data over time. They express semantic
                     value within a defined frame, both through the use of structural and logical data
                     representation techniques, as well as iconography. Contrastingly, the re-mediation
                     of
                     those artifacts under the graphical scheme we created extracts value from the
                     pictorial and transposes it to a higher, conceptual, diagrammatic level. By
                     abstractly describing the structures that compose and instantiate the artifacts, the
                     diagrammatic display enables the relations that define the semantic values to come
                     to
                     the fore, and the entities involved in those relations to be thusly described

                     description of the artifacts through a vocabulary of components, it is not hegemonic
                     in that it intentionally concentrates on constitutive difference rather than
                     translation. The project systematically and deliberately avoided establishing a
                     single overarching temporal frame to which all other chronologies would be
                     referenced. The inventory of Chrono-Referencing schemes supports correlation and
                     comparison, so that chronologies do not have to be subsumed into a unified or single
                     standard. While this project remains in prototype and proof of concept phase,
                     considerable analytic work and design has been accomplished with regard to
                     fundamental principles of graphical methods of analysis, chronologies as a specific
                     case for comparative ontologies, and the idea of a computational framework that
                     supports interactions in a software environment for research and pedagogy. This work
                     is exemplified by the Time Capsule, which demonstrates the design of an extensible
                     Library and set of Chrono-Referencing tools. The concepts being proved here are
                     currently being developed as working prototypes.</div>

                     further analysis of the relation between frame and elements informed by formal
                     logic and analytic philosophy traditions reveals how the frame ultimately
                     models the reality in which elements exist. Specifically, as it pertains to the
                     environment it circumscribes, the frame is responsible for answering the
                     question “what is,” in that it identifies the entities that exist within
                     itself and thereby grants them ontological status. However, it also defines the
                     nature of those entities by characterizing and modelling the semantic relations
                     in which they are involved and consequently the rules that dictate their
                     participation in those relations; by defining the essence and quality of
                     elements, rules and relations, it establishes the metaphysics of the graphical
                     representation. The conjunction of ontological and metaphysical definitions
                     results in the emergence of the epistemological paradigm (and constraints) the
