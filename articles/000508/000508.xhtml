                  <p>Computers have the capacity to transpose the pixels, shapes, and other features of
                     visual
                     material into sound. This act of data correlation between the visual and the audial
                     produces a new artifact, a sonic composition created from the visual source. The new
                     artifact, however, correlates precisely to data in the original, thus allowing for
                     fresh
                     ways of perceiving its form, content, and context. Seeming to distort the visual object
                     into an aural one paradoxically allows an observer to observe the visual evidence
                     anew,
                     with more accuracy. A kind of generative, synesthetic criticism becomes possible by
                     cutting across typical boundaries between the visual and the audio, the optic and
                     the
                     aural. Listening to as well as looking at visual artifacts by way of digital
                     transpositions of data enables better close readings, more compelling interpretations,
                     and
                     deeper contextual understandings. Building on my earlier scholarship into image glitching,
                     remixing, and sonification, this essay investigates a photograph of Joan Baez performing
                     at the Greek Amphitheater in Berkeley, California, during the early 1960s. The image
                     comes
                     from my project on the Berkeley Folk Music Festival and the history of the folk music
                     revival on the West Coast of the United States. Here, the use of digital image
                     sonification becomes particularly intriguing. While we cannot magically recover the
                     music
                     being made in the photograph, we can more closely attend to the ghosts of sound within
                     the
                     silent snapshot. Digital image sonification does not recover the music itself, but
                     it does
                     help to amplify issues of gender, power, embodiment, spectacle, performance, hierarchy,
                     and performance in my perceptions of Baez making music in the photograph. Using the
                     ear as
                     well as the eye to scan the image for its multiple levels of meaning leads to unsuspected
                     perceptions, which then support more revealing analysis. In digital image sonification,
                     a
                     cyborgian dance of data, signal, image, sound, history, and human perception emerges,
                     activating visual materials for renewed scrutiny. In doing so, this mode of AudioVisual
                     DH
                     activates the scholarly imagination in promising new ways.

                  <div class="ptext" id="p1">In the photograph (<a href="#figure01">Figure 1</a>), we see the famous folksinger
                     Joan Baez performing at the Greek Amphitheater on the University of California-Berkeley
                     campus, but of course, we cannot hear her. Taken on a summer night during the early
                     1960s,
                     the image contains a moment when musical sound was being produced, but as an artifact,
                     it
                     remains silent. The photograph visually conveys a grand sense of performative scale.
                     Snapped from high up in the audience by an unknown photographer, we look down on Baez
                     from
                     stage right at the 8,500-seat venue. She stands under the stark white spotlight, just
                     a
                     series of blurry shapes far away on stage. You can recognize her iconic blouse and
                     knee-length skirt, her long brunette hair, and her acoustic guitar, but that is about
                     all.
                     She sings in a space modeled after the Ancient Theater of Epidaurus, funded by newspaper
                     magnate William Randolph Hearst, and opened in 1903 in service of the idea that Berkeley
                     was becoming a new fount of democracy, the “Athens of the West.” If you
                     know some of the context for this image, you might think about how you are looking
                     at a
                     young, radical woman, barely out of her teens, who has become a folk music revival
                     celebrity. If you also know Baez's music, you might hear faint echoes of Baez's signature
                     soprano vibrato and fingerpicked acoustic guitar in your mind's ear as you look at
                     the
                     photograph. If you know the San Francisco Bay Area, you might remember the delicious
                     crispness or downright chill of a spring or summer evening in that region, the fog
                     rolling
                     in over the bay toward the Berkeley Hills. Otherwise — or even if you do have those
                     sonic
                     and sensorial resources available — you are left only with a mute image.

                     or at
                     least think more productively about photographs of musical performance or of sound
                     being
                     made? We cannot magically recover the sounds of Joan Baez performing in some miraculous
                     feat of archeological excavation (at least not yet), but the tactic of what I call
                     digital
                     image sonification offers one example of how computation can enhance better close
                     reading,
                     more compelling interpretation, and deeper contextual understanding of pictures of
                     sound —
                     indeed of pictures in general. While archeologists and a number of historians involved
                     in
                     digital humanities have been rightfully interested in recovering or modeling acoustic
                     environments from the past, what I refer to as image sonification is drawn more from
                     media
                     studies concerns about what a digital photograph is.<a class="noteRef" href="#d4e189">[1]</a> When a photograph is optically scanned and
                     transformed into an image file, we can correlate its pixels, shapes, and other features
                     to
                     sound, creating an audio version of the image. As media studies scholar Wolfgang Ernst
                     points out, "For the computer, the difference between sound and image, if it is counted,
                     would count only as the difference between data <em class="emph">formats</em> [ital. in original]."
                     The transpositional possibilities become useful for synesthetic modes of audiovisual
                     DH.
                     As Ernst puts it, "Digital memory ignores the aesthetic differences between audio
                     and
                     visual data and makes one interface (to human ears and eyes) emulate another" [<a class="ref" href="#ernst2013">Ernst 2013</a>, 66]. There are many aspects of the image we could sonify,
                     and, to be sure, there is no essential one better than another necessarily. As Taylor
                     Arnold and Lauren Tilton note in their research on what they call "distant viewing"
                     of
                     large visual corpora, "Raw pixel intensities hold no meaningful information out of
                     context" [<a class="ref" href="#arnold2019">Arnold 2019</a>, 3]. Nonetheless, even for one image — maybe
                     especially for one image — multiple modes of experiencing data can produce new knowledge
                     through the defamiliarization of the artifact [<a class="ref" href="#shklovsky2017">Shklovsky 2017</a>].
                  </div>
                  
                  <div class="counter"><a href="#p3">3</a></div>
                  <div class="ptext" id="p3">Defamiliarization involves the purposeful alienating of a text in order to glimpse
                     its
                     inner workings and larger implications more perceptively. Originating as a new kind
                     of
                     modernist literary analysis, it is not far removed from Bertolt Brecht's "distancing
                     effect" or tactics in surrealist art-making or Walter Benjamin's efforts to develop
                     new
                     modes of alienated aesthetic analysis in response to the "age of technological
                     reproducibility" [<a class="ref" href="#brecht1964">Brecht 1964</a>, 91–99]
                     [<a class="ref" href="#benjamin1968">Benjamin 1968</a>, 217–252]. Image sonification also joins the
                     long-running digital humanities interest in "deformance," in which strategic acts
                     of
                     altering a text produce new versions with revealing differences to the original —
                     indeed,
                     sometimes questioning what we even mean by the concept of an "original" [<a class="ref" href="#mcgann2012">McGann 2012</a>]
                     [<a class="ref" href="#sample2012">Sample 2012</a>]. At some level, all digital humanities efforts, even the most
                     committed to positivistic statistical analysis, involve this kind of distortion of
                     the
                     empirical record. As Lisa Gitelman has taught us, "raw data is an oxymoron," and all
                     data
                     are "always already new" [<a class="ref" href="#gitelman2006">Gitelman 2006</a>]
                     [<a class="ref" href="#gitelman2013">Gitelman 2013</a>]. To be sure, there are truths to discover, but when it comes
                     to analyses of images and sounds, the truths are often multi-perspectival, multivocal,
                     and
                     rarely self-evident. By actively and critically playing with the representations produced
                     as and through data, using computers to aid in the process of hearing images as well
                     as
                     viewing them, we can seek out fuller, richer interpretations of the materials we study.
                     We
                     can listen more deeply to what we are seeing.<a class="noteRef" href="#d4e239">[2]</a></div>
                  
                  <div class="counter"><a href="#p4">4</a></div>
                  <div class="ptext" id="p4">To sonify image data is to flip the contemporary obsession with data visualization,
                     in
                     which data of any kind are converted into what Franco Moretti famously called "graphs,
                     maps, trees" [<a class="ref" href="#moretti2007">Moretti 2007</a>]. If we stop privileging the optic, the viewer —
                     now the listener — can pivot between the visual and the audial. This places the two
                     halves
                     of the audiovisual binary into dialogue with each other. After all, if we already
                     visualize sound when creating digitally produced spectrograms of frequencies, why
                     not
                     sonify pixel information? New details and fresh interpretive possibilities, ideas,
                     meanings, and implications emerge when one studies photographs by combining optical
                     and
                     audial perception together in new synesthetic modes of analysis. Understood this way,
                     image sonification offers an underexplored, exploratory audio tactic that can lead
                     to
                     discoveries about visual sources. As Kevin L. Ferguson argued in the 2019 <em class="emph">Debates in
                        the Digital Humanities,</em> "Rethinking our viewing practices in a digital

                  <div class="ptext" id="p7">One fascinating quality of image sonification is that sound transforms space into
                     time,
                     creating an intensification of the spatial relations captured in the photograph by
                     sequencing them temporally. The very dimensions of a two-dimensional photograph now
                     have
                     aural depth and presence.<a class="noteRef" href="#d4e319">[5]</a> This is a useful
                     way in which to enter into thinking about qualities of audience-performer relationships
                     that the photograph might quite literally flatten or even obscure or only suggest
                     vaguely
                     in visual form. For me, the most productive parameter to play with was the frequency
                     scale
                     logarithmic base. Set to a higher scale, it produced more of a whisper when the
                     sonification reached the figure of Baez center stage. Set to a lower scale, it produced
                     a
                     series of chirps and whistles. Mostly, however, the darkness of the image save for
                     Baez
                     under the spotlight turned out to be intriguingly quiet. Lack of sound can, after
                     all, be
                     part of image sonification and AudioVisual DH analysis too.<a class="noteRef" href="#d4e324">[6]</a> The sound murmured across the dark areas of the photograph. Only when it
                     arrived at the illuminated figure of Baez did it create a small bubble of sound with
                     the
                     frequency scale logarithmic base set to 2.0 (<a href="#figure02">Figure 2</a>) or
                     burst out with a quick set of windy, echoing whistles with the frequency scale logarithmic
                     base set to roughly 1.2 (<a href="#figure03">Figure 3</a>). As if to announce her
                     spectral presence, far away from the top of the Greek Amphitheater where the photographer
                     was, both sonifications alerted me to the dynamics of her presence on stage, a distant
                     figure under a stark white spotlight, but also the focus of attention.

                  <div class="ptext" id="p8">Two themes emerged the more I listened to the sonifications and looked at the photograph.
                     First, despite the ideals of the folk revival as a decentralized, communal, democratic
                     movement, the sonification intensified the distinction between Baez‚ the emerging
                     celebrity on stage, and the audience. Second, I began to wonder more about the stakes
                     of
                     Baez as a female performer within the revival. On the first theme, the sonification
                     amplified how this was no campfire "Kumbaya" session, but rather a spectacle at scale,
                     with a star on stage who drew everyone's attention and the masses listening to and
                     looking
                     at her under the stark white spotlight. Compare, for instance, to another image
                     sonification of the audience, probably taken from before or after the same concert
                     (<a href="#figure04">Figure 4</a> and <a href="#figure05">Figure 5</a>). In this
                     one, the sonification was much noisier, picking up the many patterns of heads, shirts,
                     spotlights, and parts of the Greek Amphitheater. Here is scattered attention, the
                     dispersed buzz of people before or after shared concentration on a conventional concert
                     recital performance. Taken together, the image sonifications of the two images signaled
                     how the photographs of Baez at the Greek represent key tensions in the early 1960s
                     folk
                     revival. On the one hand, it sought to be anti-commercial and anti-hierarchical, shifting
                     music-making from the power differentials between entertainer and audience to a shared
                     experience of musical communion. On the other hand, its popularity led to increasingly
                     conventional modes of presentation, precisely entertainment, a commercial undertaking
                     with
                     all the imbalances between a star and passive spectators.
                  </div>
                  
                  <div class="counter"><a href="#p9">9</a></div>
                  <div class="ptext" id="p9">Baez, who became perhaps the iconic female figure of the revival, was particularly
                     caught
                     up in these tensions. A second theme about gender erupted from the image sonification.
                     At
                     times, she tried to follow in the footsteps of Pete Seeger, adopting progressive and
                     radical political causes or following in his collective singalong concert tradition;
                     at
                     other times, she embraced the role of a distant icon of the revival. On stage at the
                     Greek, the sonification alerts us to the contradictions she sustained as a performer.
                     She
                     is but a whisper in one sonification, a little burst of whistles in the other. In
                     both,
                     the larger darkness almost swallows her up sonically in the epic space of the Greek
                     Amphitheater. And yet she is also the only part of the image to generate sound, especially
                     in the whistle sonification. This reminds us that it is Baez, who focuses attention
                     from
                     the audience, holds forth at the sole microphone we glimpse in the photograph. She
                     is the
                     only figure under the spotlight. Save for a quick whisper of sound from the proscenium
                     of
                     the stage and an illuminated walkway to the side of the stage, we only hear her in
                     the
                     sonifications.

                  <div class="ptext" id="p10">And what of the sound generated from the image itself in this particular experiment?
                     The
                     ghostly, hollow quality of one sonification and the whistle blips of the other caused
                     me
                     to ponder the difference between Baez, the person, and Baez, the performer, how one
                     was
                     always lurking within the other. A spectral absence within a charismatic performance,
                     the
                     actual Baez offers an embodied presentation of authenticity that is oddly disembodied.
                     The
                     sonifications amplified for me a young woman was thrust into the spotlight of the
                     folk
                     revival at the height of its popularity. She had to negotiate the constraints of gender
                     within the folk revival milieu. As such, Baez was able to hold forth, convene an audience,
                     speak her musical truth, and articulate progressive political ideas publicly. At the
                     same
                     time, Baez was reduced within the revival. One would see this a few years later in
                     her
                     relationship on stage and in the music business to Bob Dylan, with whom she started
                     performing around the time this image was taken. While he pushed forward with the
                     freedom
                     to reinvent himself, claim the mantle of the high modernist artist, Baez was often
                     limited
                     to gendered roles of the girlfriend, harmony singer, or placed in a kind of virginal

                     that all the sonification revealed was what, to a critical eye, the image already
                     visualized. Precisely on both counts. The fuss of going through the process of
                     sonification is not to get away from the contextualized interpretation of image data,
                     but
                     rather to read data that constitute the photographic artifact more probingly, carefully,
                     and insightfully (or is it now insoundfully?). By shifting from visual to aural form,
                     one
                     can get closer to the fullness of what the artifact itself contains, what it suggests
                     as
                     some of its meanings and implications. Moving from merely optic investigation to a
                     synesthetic movement between image and sound, between the optic and the visual, allows
                     for
                     far richer analysis, a more adventurous inquiry into even one photograph.

                  <div class="ptext" id="p12">Overall, digitally listening to as well as looking at photographs allows for greater
                     potential access to underlying performative, emotional, spatial, embodied, and contextual
                     dimensions captured in imagery. As art historian Tina M. Campt writes about her
                     non-digital approach to looking at photographs from the African Diaspora so too for
                     digital image sonification: “When the practice of listening is not
                     just about hearing but an attunement to different levels of photographic
                     audibility,” what emerges is “an attunement to sonic
                     frequencies of affect and impact.” The human sensorium is not neatly divided
                     between eye and ear.<a class="noteRef" href="#d4e389">[7]</a> It is capable of new perceptions from the synesthetic interplay between the
                     visual and the audial. Listening to images can lead to, as Campt puts it, an “ensemble of seeing, feeling, being affected, contacted, and moved beyond
                     the distance of sight and observer”
                     [<a class="ref" href="#campt2017">Campt 2017</a>, 41–42]. Campt is most interested in discerning
                     subjectivities of Black fugitivity and futurity in the photographs she examines. Image
                     sonification expands the repertoire she outlines by bringing the power of digital
                     computation to this project, using it to treat photographic data not as totalized
                     empirical facts, but rather as sources of multidimensional meanings that bring one
                     more
                     deeply into the images less discernable aspects.

                  <div class="ptext" id="p13">Digital image sonification, pursued through the method I am proposing, also offers
                     an
                     avenue for crisscrossing between "distant" and "close" reading in digital humanities
                     scholarship. As Alan Liu predicted in 2012, "one of the next frontiers for the digital
                     humanities will be to discover technically and theoretically how to negotiate between
                     distant and close reading" [<a class="ref" href="#liu2012">Liu 2012</a>, 17]. Sound can convey subtle
                     qualities of timbre, tone, interrelationships between different elements, and other
                     kinds
                     of information that visual, textual, or statistical data do not display as effectively
                     [<a class="ref" href="#schedel2014">Schedel 2014</a>]. So too, sound presents particular qualities for
                     negotiating the divide between distant and close reading because it represents space
                     as
                     time. This allows for the compacting of large amounts of information into a quick
                     signal,
                     allowing one to listen "at scale." It also, paradoxically, produces the ability to
                     magnify
                     minutiae by rendering data temporally, forcing an observer to take in details more
                     slowly,
                     as I did with the multiple sonifications of the Joan Baez photograph. Capable of going
                     big
                     or small with data, digital image sonification asks us to seek truth without resorting
                     to
                     overly simplistic and reductive assertions of objectivity. In the immersive "acoustic
                     space," as Edmund Carpenter and Marshall McLuhan called it, "sight isolates" while
                     "sound
                     incorporates," as another scholar, Walter Ong, famously contended. "Whereas sight
                     situates
                     the observer outside what he views, at a distance," Ong argued, "sound pours into
                     the
                     hearer" [<a class="ref" href="#ong1982">Ong 1982</a>, 70]

                     compartmentalization of the senses into sight and sound as discrete entities, which
                     is
                     precisely why thinking synesthetically about the interplay between the two might be

                     space between the visual and the aural — a fruitful perceptual interzone for

                  <div class="ptext" id="p14">Finally, digital image sonification presents an example of how AudioVisual DH can
                     push
                     forward research in digital history and archival thinking as part of digital humanities
                     writ large. By heightening the perception of fleeting feelings and sensations from
                     archives of the past, we might realize Bethany Nowviskie's call for “speculative
                     collections,” lively play with repository holdings to activate the dormant
                     meanings of artifacts [<a class="ref" href="#nowviskie2016">Nowviskie 2016</a>]. To my eye and ear, turning the Baez
                     photograph in which music was being made back into sound summoned forth some of the
                     “archival liveness” that Tom Schofield and colleagues picture digital
                     technologies capable of accomplishing [<a class="ref" href="#schofield2015">Schofield 2015</a>]
                     [<a class="ref" href="#ward2019">Ward 2019</a>]. Rather than merely reproduce the knowledge of the archive
                     flatly, rather than only looking at the past only through the surface of the archive's
                     gaze, image sonification delves more deeply and precisely into data to transpose it
                     into
                     new keys, to open up history's evidentiary record for what might be present — or absent
                     —
                     from sight alone. We cannot hear the music Joan Baez was making at the Greek Amphitheater
                     that night in the early 1960s, but we can hear the stakes of her music-making more
                     potently when we sonify the photograph of her. Digital image sonification invigorates
                     both
                     the content and the context of the image. Issues of gender, power, embodiment, spectacle,
                     performance, hierarchy, performance, and more emerge. Synesthetically pivoting between
                     the
                     visual and the audio in a cyborgian dance of data, signal, image, sound, history,
                     and
                     human perception, image sonification activates an artifact's data in fresh, audiovisual
                     ways. In doing so, it also activates the scholarly imagination.
