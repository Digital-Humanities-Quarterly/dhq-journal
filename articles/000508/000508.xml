      <dhq:abstract>
        <p>Computers have the capacity to transpose the pixels, shapes, and other features of visual
          material into sound. This act of data correlation between the visual and the audial
          produces a new artifact, a sonic composition created from the visual source. The new
          artifact, however, correlates precisely to data in the original, thus allowing for fresh
          ways of perceiving its form, content, and context. Seeming to distort the visual object
          into an aural one paradoxically allows an observer to observe the visual evidence anew,
          with more accuracy. A kind of generative, synesthetic criticism becomes possible by
          cutting across typical boundaries between the visual and the audio, the optic and the
          aural. Listening to as well as looking at visual artifacts by way of digital
          transpositions of data enables better close readings, more compelling interpretations, and
          deeper contextual understandings. Building on my earlier scholarship into image glitching,
          remixing, and sonification, this essay investigates a photograph of Joan Baez performing
          at the Greek Amphitheater in Berkeley, California, during the early 1960s. The image comes
          from my project on the Berkeley Folk Music Festival and the history of the folk music
          revival on the West Coast of the United States. Here, the use of digital image
          sonification becomes particularly intriguing. While we cannot magically recover the music
          being made in the photograph, we can more closely attend to the ghosts of sound within the
          silent snapshot. Digital image sonification does not recover the music itself, but it does
          help to amplify issues of gender, power, embodiment, spectacle, performance, hierarchy,
          and performance in my perceptions of Baez making music in the photograph. Using the ear as
          well as the eye to scan the image for its multiple levels of meaning leads to unsuspected
          perceptions, which then support more revealing analysis. In digital image sonification, a
          cyborgian dance of data, signal, image, sound, history, and human perception emerges,
          activating visual materials for renewed scrutiny. In doing so, this mode of AudioVisual DH
          activates the scholarly imagination in promising new ways.</p>

        <p>In the photograph (<ref target="#figure01">Figure 1</ref>), we see the famous folksinger
          Joan Baez performing at the Greek Amphitheater on the University of California-Berkeley
          campus, but of course, we cannot hear her. Taken on a summer night during the early 1960s,
          the image contains a moment when musical sound was being produced, but as an artifact, it
          remains silent. The photograph visually conveys a grand sense of performative scale.
          Snapped from high up in the audience by an unknown photographer, we look down on Baez from
          stage right at the 8,500-seat venue. She stands under the stark white spotlight, just a
          series of blurry shapes far away on stage. You can recognize her iconic blouse and
          knee-length skirt, her long brunette hair, and her acoustic guitar, but that is about all.
          She sings in a space modeled after the Ancient Theater of Epidaurus, funded by newspaper
          magnate William Randolph Hearst, and opened in 1903 in service of the idea that Berkeley
          was becoming a new fount of democracy, the <soCalled>Athens of the West.</soCalled> If you
          know some of the context for this image, you might think about how you are looking at a
          young, radical woman, barely out of her teens, who has become a folk music revival
          celebrity. If you also know Baez's music, you might hear faint echoes of Baez's signature
          soprano vibrato and fingerpicked acoustic guitar in your mind's ear as you look at the
          photograph. If you know the San Francisco Bay Area, you might remember the delicious
          crispness or downright chill of a spring or summer evening in that region, the fog rolling
          in over the bay toward the Berkeley Hills. Otherwise — or even if you do have those sonic
          and sensorial resources available — you are left only with a mute image.</p>
        <p>Is there more here than meets the eye? If so, can AudioVisual DH help us access it, or at
          least think more productively about photographs of musical performance or of sound being
          made? We cannot magically recover the sounds of Joan Baez performing in some miraculous
          feat of archeological excavation (at least not yet), but the tactic of what I call digital
          image sonification offers one example of how computation can enhance better close reading,
          more compelling interpretation, and deeper contextual understanding of pictures of sound —
          indeed of pictures in general. While archeologists and a number of historians involved in
          digital humanities have been rightfully interested in recovering or modeling acoustic
          environments from the past, what I refer to as image sonification is drawn more from media
          studies concerns about what a digital photograph is.<note>On archeological approaches, see

            <ptr target="#einix2014"/>
            <ptr target="#lafrance2006"/>. This research is particularly inspired by Wolfgang
            Ernst's theoretical insights, although he might not entirely agree with my turn back to
            questions of cultural history. See <ptr target="#ernst2013"/><ptr target="#ernst2016"/>.

              <ptr target="#sontag1977"/>
            <ptr target="#barthes1981"/>.</note> When a photograph is optically scanned and
          transformed into an image file, we can correlate its pixels, shapes, and other features to
          sound, creating an audio version of the image. As media studies scholar Wolfgang Ernst
          points out, "For the computer, the difference between sound and image, if it is counted,
          would count only as the difference between data <emph>formats</emph> [ital. in original]."
          The transpositional possibilities become useful for synesthetic modes of audiovisual DH.
          As Ernst puts it, "Digital memory ignores the aesthetic differences between audio and
          visual data and makes one interface (to human ears and eyes) emulate another" <ptr
            target="#ernst2013" loc="66"/>. There are many aspects of the image we could sonify,
          and, to be sure, there is no essential one better than another necessarily. As Taylor
          Arnold and Lauren Tilton note in their research on what they call "distant viewing" of
          large visual corpora, "Raw pixel intensities hold no meaningful information out of
          context" <ptr target="#arnold2019" loc="3"/>. Nonetheless, even for one image — maybe
          especially for one image — multiple modes of experiencing data can produce new knowledge
          through the defamiliarization of the artifact <ptr target="#shklovsky2017"/>.</p>
        <p>Defamiliarization involves the purposeful alienating of a text in order to glimpse its
          inner workings and larger implications more perceptively. Originating as a new kind of
          modernist literary analysis, it is not far removed from Bertolt Brecht's "distancing
          effect" or tactics in surrealist art-making or Walter Benjamin's efforts to develop new
          modes of alienated aesthetic analysis in response to the "age of technological
          reproducibility" <ptr target="#brecht1964" loc="91–99"/>
          <ptr target="#benjamin1968" loc="217–252"/>. Image sonification also joins the
          long-running digital humanities interest in "deformance," in which strategic acts of
          altering a text produce new versions with revealing differences to the original — indeed,
          sometimes questioning what we even mean by the concept of an "original" <ptr
            target="#mcgann2012"/>
          <ptr target="#sample2012"/>. At some level, all digital humanities efforts, even the most
          committed to positivistic statistical analysis, involve this kind of distortion of the
          empirical record. As Lisa Gitelman has taught us, "raw data is an oxymoron," and all data
          are "always already new" <ptr target="#gitelman2006"/>
          <ptr target="#gitelman2013"/>. To be sure, there are truths to discover, but when it comes
          to analyses of images and sounds, the truths are often multi-perspectival, multivocal, and
          rarely self-evident. By actively and critically playing with the representations produced
          as and through data, using computers to aid in the process of hearing images as well as
          viewing them, we can seek out fuller, richer interpretations of the materials we study. We
          can listen more deeply to what we are seeing.<note>For a discussion of deep listening and
            critical play in the digital humanities, literary studies, linguistics, and sound
            studies, see <ptr target="#clement2015" loc="348–357"/>. Examples of the sonification of
            other sorts of data besides images include <ptr target="#joque2011"/>
            <ptr target="#laumeister2015"/>
            <ptr target="#foo2014"/>
            <ptr target="#schedel2014"/>.</note></p>
        <p>To sonify image data is to flip the contemporary obsession with data visualization, in
          which data of any kind are converted into what Franco Moretti famously called "graphs,
          maps, trees" <ptr target="#moretti2007"/>. If we stop privileging the optic, the viewer —
          now the listener — can pivot between the visual and the audial. This places the two halves
          of the audiovisual binary into dialogue with each other. After all, if we already
          visualize sound when creating digitally produced spectrograms of frequencies, why not
          sonify pixel information? New details and fresh interpretive possibilities, ideas,
          meanings, and implications emerge when one studies photographs by combining optical and
          audial perception together in new synesthetic modes of analysis. Understood this way,
          image sonification offers an underexplored, exploratory audio tactic that can lead to
          discoveries about visual sources. As Kevin L. Ferguson argued in the 2019 <emph>Debates in
            the Digital Humanities,</emph> "Rethinking our viewing practices in a digital
          age…requires an investment in experimental, theoretical methods that run counter to the
          rationalist uses of quantitative data often employed in DH work" <ptr
            target="#ferguson2019" loc="336"/>. If we shift from the aggrandizement of the
          statistical as well as the tyranny of the visual to more adventurous digital
          considerations of artefactual representation — if we embrace Fred Gibbs and Trevor Owens'
          foundational digital humanities call for a more critically aware and creatively expansive
          "hermeneutics of data" — we can activate the ear as well as the eye to perceive more
          accurately and revealingly a fuller interpretive picture of the past <ptr
            target="#gibbs2013"/>.</p>
        <p>I have argued elsewhere that digital image sonification offers a provocative method for
          pursuing a fresh historical understanding of archival photographs. In my earlier essay, I
          particularly noticed in particular how image glitching and sonification produced new
          interpretive perspectives on race in the US folk music revival <ptr target="#kramer2018b"
          />. In this essay, I turn my eyes and ears to questions of gender, space, performance, and
          democracy in music performance at the height of the early 1960s folk revival <ptr
            target="#kramer2018a"/>. Once again, I am struck most of all by the capacity of digital
          image sonification to amplify the stakes of photographic representation.<note>For
            overviews of the history of the folk music revival, see <ptr target="#cantwell1997"/>
            <ptr target="#filene2000"/>
            <ptr target="#cohen2002"/>
            <ptr target="#donaldson2014"/>
            <ptr target="#wald2015"/>.</note> The visual comes alive in a different register when
          transformed via its presence as pixels into sound. Hearing what we are viewing asks us to
          see a photograph anew. The ear aids the eye in perceptual reorientation. New perceptions
          provide opportunities for more perceptive interpretations.</p>
        <p>As an experiment, I placed the Joan Baez image into an application, Photosounder, created
          by programmer Michel Rouzic.<note>For more information, visit the website for <ref
              target="http://photosounder.com"><emph>Photosounder</emph></ref>. </note> Photosounder
          reads images left to right and correlates pixel brightness to frequencies of pink noise,
          with lower, quieter pitches generated by darker pixels and higher, chirpier pitches
          created by brighter areas of a digital image. There are a few parameters one can
          manipulate, but generally, it is a very simple image sonification program, only hinting at
          the variations with which one might experiment. Even so, what resulted was a kind of sonic
          x-ray of the image that brought out not so much the music Baez was making when the
          photograph was taken, but rather, to my ears, the dynamics of space and gender in her
          performance at the Greek Amphitheater.</p>

        <p>One fascinating quality of image sonification is that sound transforms space into time,
          creating an intensification of the spatial relations captured in the photograph by
          sequencing them temporally. The very dimensions of a two-dimensional photograph now have
          aural depth and presence.<note>For more on the social construction of spatial relations
            handled through digital methods, see <ptr target="#white2010"/>.</note> This is a useful
          way in which to enter into thinking about qualities of audience-performer relationships
          that the photograph might quite literally flatten or even obscure or only suggest vaguely
          in visual form. For me, the most productive parameter to play with was the frequency scale
          logarithmic base. Set to a higher scale, it produced more of a whisper when the
          sonification reached the figure of Baez center stage. Set to a lower scale, it produced a
          series of chirps and whistles. Mostly, however, the darkness of the image save for Baez
          under the spotlight turned out to be intriguingly quiet. Lack of sound can, after all, be
          part of image sonification and AudioVisual DH analysis too.<note>One immediately thinks of
            John Cage's famous thinking about silence as useful here. See <ptr target="#cage1961"
            />.</note> The sound murmured across the dark areas of the photograph. Only when it
          arrived at the illuminated figure of Baez did it create a small bubble of sound with the
          frequency scale logarithmic base set to 2.0 (<ref target="#figure02">Figure 2</ref>) or
          burst out with a quick set of windy, echoing whistles with the frequency scale logarithmic
          base set to roughly 1.2 (<ref target="#figure03">Figure 3</ref>). As if to announce her
          spectral presence, far away from the top of the Greek Amphitheater where the photographer
          was, both sonifications alerted me to the dynamics of her presence on stage, a distant

        <p>Two themes emerged the more I listened to the sonifications and looked at the photograph.
          First, despite the ideals of the folk revival as a decentralized, communal, democratic
          movement, the sonification intensified the distinction between Baez‚ the emerging
          celebrity on stage, and the audience. Second, I began to wonder more about the stakes of
          Baez as a female performer within the revival. On the first theme, the sonification
          amplified how this was no campfire "Kumbaya" session, but rather a spectacle at scale,
          with a star on stage who drew everyone's attention and the masses listening to and looking
          at her under the stark white spotlight. Compare, for instance, to another image
          sonification of the audience, probably taken from before or after the same concert (<ref
            target="#figure04">Figure 4</ref> and <ref target="#figure05">Figure 5</ref>). In this
          one, the sonification was much noisier, picking up the many patterns of heads, shirts,
          spotlights, and parts of the Greek Amphitheater. Here is scattered attention, the
          dispersed buzz of people before or after shared concentration on a conventional concert
          recital performance. Taken together, the image sonifications of the two images signaled
          how the photographs of Baez at the Greek represent key tensions in the early 1960s folk
          revival. On the one hand, it sought to be anti-commercial and anti-hierarchical, shifting
          music-making from the power differentials between entertainer and audience to a shared
          experience of musical communion. On the other hand, its popularity led to increasingly
          conventional modes of presentation, precisely entertainment, a commercial undertaking with
          all the imbalances between a star and passive spectators.</p>
        <p>Baez, who became perhaps the iconic female figure of the revival, was particularly caught
          up in these tensions. A second theme about gender erupted from the image sonification. At
          times, she tried to follow in the footsteps of Pete Seeger, adopting progressive and
          radical political causes or following in his collective singalong concert tradition; at
          other times, she embraced the role of a distant icon of the revival. On stage at the
          Greek, the sonification alerts us to the contradictions she sustained as a performer. She
          is but a whisper in one sonification, a little burst of whistles in the other. In both,
          the larger darkness almost swallows her up sonically in the epic space of the Greek
          Amphitheater. And yet she is also the only part of the image to generate sound, especially
          in the whistle sonification. This reminds us that it is Baez, who focuses attention from
          the audience, holds forth at the sole microphone we glimpse in the photograph. She is the
          only figure under the spotlight. Save for a quick whisper of sound from the proscenium of
          the stage and an illuminated walkway to the side of the stage, we only hear her in the
          sonifications.</p>
        <p>And what of the sound generated from the image itself in this particular experiment? The
          ghostly, hollow quality of one sonification and the whistle blips of the other caused me
          to ponder the difference between Baez, the person, and Baez, the performer, how one was
          always lurking within the other. A spectral absence within a charismatic performance, the
          actual Baez offers an embodied presentation of authenticity that is oddly disembodied. The
          sonifications amplified for me a young woman was thrust into the spotlight of the folk
          revival at the height of its popularity. She had to negotiate the constraints of gender
          within the folk revival milieu. As such, Baez was able to hold forth, convene an audience,
          speak her musical truth, and articulate progressive political ideas publicly. At the same
          time, Baez was reduced within the revival. One would see this a few years later in her
          relationship on stage and in the music business to Bob Dylan, with whom she started
          performing around the time this image was taken. While he pushed forward with the freedom
          to reinvent himself, claim the mantle of the high modernist artist, Baez was often limited
          to gendered roles of the girlfriend, harmony singer, or placed in a kind of virginal
          Madonna stereotype within the folk movement <ptr target="#baez2009"/>
          <ptr target="#hadju2001"/>.</p>
        <p>All that just from some pink noise generated by pixel brightness? Some might complain
          that I am "reading" too much into the sonification. Others might contend the opposite:
          that all the sonification revealed was what, to a critical eye, the image already
          visualized. Precisely on both counts. The fuss of going through the process of
          sonification is not to get away from the contextualized interpretation of image data, but
          rather to read data that constitute the photographic artifact more probingly, carefully,
          and insightfully (or is it now insoundfully?). By shifting from visual to aural form, one
          can get closer to the fullness of what the artifact itself contains, what it suggests as
          some of its meanings and implications. Moving from merely optic investigation to a
          synesthetic movement between image and sound, between the optic and the visual, allows for
          far richer analysis, a more adventurous inquiry into even one photograph.</p>
        <p>Overall, digitally listening to as well as looking at photographs allows for greater
          potential access to underlying performative, emotional, spatial, embodied, and contextual
          dimensions captured in imagery. As art historian Tina M. Campt writes about her
          non-digital approach to looking at photographs from the African Diaspora so too for
          digital image sonification: <quote rend="inline">When the practice of listening is not
            just about hearing but an attunement to different levels of photographic
            audibility,</quote> what emerges is <quote rend="inline">an attunement to sonic
            frequencies of affect and impact.</quote> The human sensorium is not neatly divided
          between eye and ear.<note>As Jonathan Sterne notes, the separation and classification of
            the human sensorium into five distinctive senses is a historical outcome of the
            Enlightenment, not a timeless biological phenomenon. See <ptr target="#sterne2003"
            />.</note> It is capable of new perceptions from the synesthetic interplay between the
          visual and the audial. Listening to images can lead to, as Campt puts it, an <quote
            rend="inline">ensemble of seeing, feeling, being affected, contacted, and moved beyond
            the distance of sight and observer</quote>
          <ptr target="#campt2017" loc="41–42"/>. Campt is most interested in discerning
          subjectivities of Black fugitivity and futurity in the photographs she examines. Image
          sonification expands the repertoire she outlines by bringing the power of digital
          computation to this project, using it to treat photographic data not as totalized
          empirical facts, but rather as sources of multidimensional meanings that bring one more
          deeply into the images less discernable aspects.</p>
        <p>Digital image sonification, pursued through the method I am proposing, also offers an
          avenue for crisscrossing between "distant" and "close" reading in digital humanities
          scholarship. As Alan Liu predicted in 2012, "one of the next frontiers for the digital
          humanities will be to discover technically and theoretically how to negotiate between
          distant and close reading" <ptr target="#liu2012" loc="17"/>. Sound can convey subtle
          qualities of timbre, tone, interrelationships between different elements, and other kinds
          of information that visual, textual, or statistical data do not display as effectively
            <ptr target="#schedel2014"/>. So too, sound presents particular qualities for
          negotiating the divide between distant and close reading because it represents space as
          time. This allows for the compacting of large amounts of information into a quick signal,
          allowing one to listen "at scale." It also, paradoxically, produces the ability to magnify
          minutiae by rendering data temporally, forcing an observer to take in details more slowly,
          as I did with the multiple sonifications of the Joan Baez photograph. Capable of going big
          or small with data, digital image sonification asks us to seek truth without resorting to
          overly simplistic and reductive assertions of objectivity. In the immersive "acoustic
          space," as Edmund Carpenter and Marshall McLuhan called it, "sight isolates" while "sound
          incorporates," as another scholar, Walter Ong, famously contended. "Whereas sight situates
          the observer outside what he views, at a distance," Ong argued, "sound pours into the
          hearer" <ptr target="#ong1982" loc="70"/>
          <ptr target="#carpenter1960" loc="64–69"/>.<note>With thanks to Robert Cantwell <ptr
              target="#cantwell1997"/> for reminding me of Ong's theories of sound and its
            significance.</note> Scholars such as Emily Thompson, Jonathan Sterne, Veit Erlmann,
          Alexandra Supper, and Karin Bijsterveld have since complicated simplistic
          compartmentalization of the senses into sight and sound as discrete entities, which is
          precisely why thinking synesthetically about the interplay between the two might be most
          productive as an AudioVisual DH tactic <ptr target="#erlmann2014"/>

          <ptr target="#thompson2002"/>
          <ptr target="#thompson2013"/>.<note>Many works in sound studies are useful for thinking
            beyond the optic without fetishizing the ear as a supposedly better sense. See also <ptr
              target="#corbin1998"/>

            <ptr target="#smith2004"/>
            <ptr target="#novak2015"/>.</note> Digital image sonification brings us into an image's
          form and content, but because we are doing so synesthetically, digital image sonification
          also alienates us from what we hear and see, poising us in an intermedial and intermediary
          space between the visual and the aural — a fruitful perceptual interzone for
          consideration, interpretation, and intellectual discovery.</p>
        <p>Finally, digital image sonification presents an example of how AudioVisual DH can push
          forward research in digital history and archival thinking as part of digital humanities
          writ large. By heightening the perception of fleeting feelings and sensations from
          archives of the past, we might realize Bethany Nowviskie's call for <soCalled>speculative
            collections,</soCalled> lively play with repository holdings to activate the dormant
          meanings of artifacts <ptr target="#nowviskie2016"/>. To my eye and ear, turning the Baez
          photograph in which music was being made back into sound summoned forth some of the
            <soCalled>archival liveness</soCalled> that Tom Schofield and colleagues picture digital
          technologies capable of accomplishing <ptr target="#schofield2015"/>
          <ptr target="#ward2019"/>. Rather than merely reproduce the knowledge of the archive
          flatly, rather than only look at the past only through the surface of the archive's gaze,
          image sonification delves more deeply and precisely into data to transpose archival
          knowledge into new keys. It opens up history's evidentiary record for what might be
          present — or absent — from sight alone. We cannot hear the music Joan Baez was making at
          the Greek Amphitheater that night in the early 1960s, but we can hear the stakes of her
          music-making more potently when we sonify the photograph of her. Digital image
          sonification invigorates both the content and the context of the image. Issues of gender,
          power, embodiment, spectacle, performance, hierarchy, performance, and more emerge.
          Synesthetically pivoting between the visual and the audio in a cyborgian dance of data,
          signal, image, sound, history, and human perception, image sonification activates an
          artifact's data in fresh, audiovisual ways. In doing so, it also activates the scholarly
          imagination.</p>
