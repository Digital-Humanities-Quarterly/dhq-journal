          <p>Digital image sonification offers one example of how AudioVisual DH can
          enhance better close reading, more compelling interpretation, and deeper
          contextual understanding of pictures of sound — indeed of pictures in general.
          When an image is optically scanned and transformed into a JPG file, we can
          correlate its pixels, shapes, and other features to sound, creating an audio
          version of the image. These transpositional possibilities become useful
          for synesthetic modes of analysis. Even for one image, sonifying image data
          produces new paths to knowledge through the defamiliarization, distancing,
          alienation, and deformance of a visual artifact into audial form. Building
          on earlier scholarship of my own on image sonification and glitching, I use
          a photograph of Joan Baez performing at the Greek Amphitheater in Berkeley,
          California, during the early 1960s, taken from my project on the Berkeley Folk
          Music Festival and the folk music revival on the West Coast. I investigate
          how digital image sonification amplifies issues of gender, power, embodiment,
          spectacle, performance, hierarchy, and performance in the Baez photograph.
          While we cannot recover the music she was making during the performance, we
          can use our ears as well as our eyes to scan the image for its multiple levels
          of meaning, implication, and perspective. New perceptions of the photograph
          lead to more perceptive analyses. Synesthetically pivoting between the visual
          and the audio in a cyborgian dance of data, signal, image, sound, and human
          perception, image sonification activates the photograph's data in fresh ways.
          In doing so, it adds to the repertoire of AudioVisual DH tactics for activating
          the scholarly imagination.</p>

              Festival Collection, Charles Deering McCormick Library of Special Collections,
              Northwestern University Libraries, n.d. (possibly 1963), photographer unknown,

          </figure>
        <p>In the photograph, we see the famous folksinger Joan Baez performing at
        the Greek Amphitheater on the University of California-Berkeley campus, but
        of course, we cannot hear her. Taken on a summer night during the early 1960s,
        the image contains a moment when musical sound was being produced, but as an
        artifact, it remains silent. The photograph visually conveys a grand sense
        of performative scale. Snapped from high up in the audience by an unknown
        photographer, we look down on Baez from stage right at the 8,500-seat venue.
        She stands under the stark white spotlight, just a series of blurry shapes far
        away on stage. You can recognize her iconic blouse and knee-length skirt, her
        long brunette hair, and her acoustic guitar, but that is about all. She sings
        in a space modeled after the Ancient Theater of Epidaurus, funded by newspaper
        magnate William Randolph Hearst, and opened in 1903 in service of the idea that
        Berkeley was becoming a new fount of democracy, the "Athens of the West." If
        you know some of the context for this image, you might think about how you are
        looking at a young, radical woman, barely out of her teens, who has become a
        folk music revival celebrity. If you know Baez's music, you might hear faint
        echoes of Baez's signature soprano vibrato and fingerpicked acoustic guitar in
        your mind's ear as you look at the photograph. If you know the San Francisco
        Bay Area, you might remember the delicious crispness or downright chill of a
        spring or summer evening in that region, the fog rolling in over the bay toward
        the Berkeley Hills. Otherwise — or even if you do have those sonic and sensorial
        resources available — you are left only with a mute image.</p>
        <p>Is there more here than meets the eye? If so, can AudioVisual DH help us
        access it, or at least think more productively about photographs of musical
        performance or of sound being made? We cannot magically recover the sounds
        of Joan Baez performing in some miraculous feat of archeological excavation
        (at least not yet), but the tactic of what I call digital image sonification
        offers one example of how computation can enhance better close reading, more
        compelling interpretation, and deeper contextual understanding of pictures
        of sound — indeed of pictures in general. While archeologists and a number of
        historians involved in digital humanities have been rightfully interested
        in recovering or modeling acoustic environments from the past, what I refer
        to as image sonification is drawn more from media studies concerns about
        what a digital photograph is.<note>On archeological approaches, see
        <ptr target="#wall2014"/>
        <ptr target="#einix2014"/>
        <ptr target="#lafrance2006"/>. This research is particularly inspired
        by Wolfgang Ernst's theoretical insights, although he might not entirely
        agree with my turn back to questions of cultural history. See
        <ptr target="#ernst2013"/><ptr target="#ernst2016"/>.

        <ptr target="#sayers2018"/>
        <ptr target="#chun2005"/>. On the history of photography, see classic studies such
        as <ptr target="#sontag1977"/>
        <ptr target="#barthes1981"/>.</note>When a photograph is optically scanned
        and transformed into a JPG file, we can correlate its pixels, shapes, and
        other features to sound, creating an audio version of the image. As media
        studies scholar Wolfgang Ernst points out, "For the computer, the difference
        between sound and image, if it is counted, would count only as the difference
        between data <emph>formats</emph> [ital. in original]." The transpositional
        possibilities become useful for synesthetic modes of audiovisual DH. As
        Ernst puts it, "Digital memory ignores the aesthetic differences between
        audio and visual data and makes one interface (to human ears and eyes)
        emulate another" <ptr target="#ernst2013" loc="66"/>.
        There are many aspects of the image we
        could sonify, and, to be sure, there is no essential one better than another
        necessarily. As Taylor Arnold and Lauren Tilton note in their research on what
        they call "distant viewing" of large visual corpora, "Raw pixel intensities
        hold no meaningful information out of context"
        <ptr target="#arnold2019" loc="3"/>.
        Nonetheless, even for one image — maybe especially for one image — multiple modes
        of experiencing data can produce new knowledge through the defamiliarization of
        the artifact <ptr target="#shklovsky2017"/>.</p>
        <p>Defamiliarization involves the purposeful alienating of a text in order
        to glimpse its inner workings and larger implications more perceptively.
        Originating as a new kind of modernist literary analysis, it is not far removed
        from Bertolt Brecht's "distancing effect" or tactics in surrealist art-making
        or Walter Benjamin's efforts to develop new modes of alienated aesthetic
        analysis in response to the "age of technological reproducibility"
        <ptr target="#brecht1964" loc="91–99"/>
        <ptr target="#benjamin1968" loc="217–252"/>.
        Image sonification also joins the
        long-running digital humanities interest in "deformance," in which strategic
        acts of altering a text produce new versions with revealing differences to
        the original — indeed, sometimes questioning what we even mean by the concept
        of an "original"
        <ptr target="#mcgann2012"/>
        <ptr target="#sample2012"/>. At some level, all
        digital humanities efforts, even the most committed to positivistic statistical
        analysis, involve this kind of distortion of the empirical record. As Lisa
        Gitelman has taught us, "raw data is an oxymoron," and all data are "always
        already new" <ptr target="#gitelman2006"/> <ptr target="#gitelman2013"/>.
        To be sure, there are truths to
        discover, but when it comes to analyses of images and sounds, the truths are
        often multi-perspectival, multivocal, and rarely self-evident. By actively and
        critically playing with the representations produced as and through data, using
        computers to aid in the process of hearing images as well as viewing them, we
        can seek out fuller, richer interpretations of the materials we study. We can
        listen more deeply to what we are seeing.<note>For a discussion of deep listening and
        critical play in the digital humanities, literary studies, linguistics, and
        sound studies, see <ptr target="#clement2015" loc="348–357"/>.
        Examples of the sonification
        of other sorts of data besides images include
        <ptr target="#joque2011"/>
        <ptr target="#laumeister2015"/>
        <ptr target="#foo2014"/>
        <ptr target="#schedel2014"/>.</note></p>
        <p>To sonify image data is to flip the contemporary obsession with data
        visualization, in which data of any kind are converted into what Franco Moretti
        famously called "graphs, maps, trees" <ptr target="#moretti2007"/>.
        If we stop privileging
        the optic, the viewer — now the listener — can pivot between the visual and the
        audial. This places the two halves of the audiovisual binary into dialogue with
        each other. After all, if we already visualize sound when creating digitally
        produced spectrograms of frequencies, why not sonify pixel information? New
        details and fresh interpretive possibilities, ideas, meanings, and implications
        emerge when one studies photographs by combining optical and audial perception
        together in new synesthetic modes of analysis. Understood this way, image
        sonification offers an underexplored, exploratory audio tactic that can
        lead to discoveries about visual sources. As Kevin L. Ferguson argued in the
        2019 <emph>Debates in the Digital Humanities,</emph> "Rethinking our viewing
        practices in a digital age…requires an investment in experimental, theoretical
        methods that run counter to the rationalist uses of quantitative data often
        employed in DH work" <ptr target="#ferguson2019" loc="336"/>.
        If we shift from the aggrandizement
        of the statistical as well as the tyranny of the visual to more adventurous
        digital considerations of artefactual representation — if we embrace Fred Gibbs
        and Trevor Owens' foundational digital humanities call for a more critically
        aware and creatively expansive "hermeneutics of data" — we can activate the
        ear as well as the eye to perceive more accurately and revealingly a fuller
        interpretive picture of the past <ptr target="#gibbs2013"/>.</p>
        <p>I have argued elsewhere that digital image sonification offers a provocative
        method for pursuing a fresh historical understanding of archival photographs.
        In my earlier essay, I particularly noticed in particular how image glitching
        and sonification produced new interpretive perspectives on race in the US
        folk music revival <ptr target="#kramer2018b"/>.
        In this essay, I turn my eyes and ears to
        questions of gender, space, performance, and democracy in music performance
        at the height of the early 1960s folk revival <ptr target="#kramer2018a"/>.
        Once again, I
        am struck most of all by the capacity of digital image sonification to amplify
        the stakes of photographic representation.<note>For overviews of the history of the
        folk music revival, see
        <ptr target="#cantwell1997"/>
        <ptr target="#filene2000"/>
        <ptr target="#cohen2002"/>
        <ptr target="#donaldson2014"/>
        <ptr target="#wald2015"/>.</note> The visual comes alive in a
        different register when transformed via its presence as pixels into sound.
        Hearing what we are viewing asks us to see a photograph anew. The ear aids the
        eye in perceptual reorientation. New perceptions provide opportunities for more
        perceptive interpretations.</p>
        <p>As an experiment, I placed the Joan Baez image into an application,
        Photosounder, created by programmer Michel Rouzic.<note>For more information about
        <ref target="http://photosounder.com"><emph>Photosounder</emph></ref>.</note>
        Photosounder reads images left to right and correlates pixel brightness to
        frequencies of pink noise, with lower, quieter pitches generated by darker
        pixels and higher, chirpier pitches created by brighter areas of a digital
        image. There are a few parameters one can manipulate, but generally, it is a
        very simple image sonification program, only hinting at the variations with
        which one might experiment. Even so, what resulted was a kind of sonic x-ray
        of the image that brought out not so much the music Baez was making when the
        photograph was taken, but rather, to my ears, the dynamics of space and gender
        in her performance at the Greek Amphitheater.</p>

        </figure>
        <p>One fascinating quality of image sonification is that sound transforms
        space into time, creating an intensification of the spatial relations captured
        in the photograph by sequencing them temporally. The very dimensions of a
        two-dimensional photograph now have aural depth and presence.<note>For more
        on the social construction of spatial relations handled through digital
        methods, see <ptr target="#white2010"/>.</note>
        This is a useful way in which to enter into thinking about qualities of
        audience-performer relationships that the photograph might quite literally
        flatten or even obscure or only suggest vaguely in visual form. For me, the
        most productive parameter to play with was the frequency scale logarithmic
        base. Set to a higher scale, it produced more of a whisper when the
        sonification reached the figure of Baez center stage. Set to a lower scale,
        it produced a series of chirps and whistles. Mostly, however, the darkness
        of the image save for Baez under the spotlight turned out to be intriguingly
        quiet. Lack of sound can, after all, be part of image sonification and
        AudioVisual DH analysis too.<note>One immediately thinks of John Cage's
        famous thinking about silence as useful here. See <ptr target="#cage1961"/>.</note>
        The sound murmured across the dark areas
        of the photograph. Only when it arrived at the illuminated figure of Baez did
        it create a small bubble of sound with the frequency scale logarithmic base set
        to 2.0 (<ref target="#figure02">Figure 2</ref>) or burst out with a quick
        set of windy, echoing whistles with
        the frequency scale logarithmic base set to roughly 1.2
        (<ref target="#figure03">Figure 3</ref>). As if to
        announce her spectral presence, far away from the top of the Greek Amphitheater
        where the photographer was, both sonifications alerted me to the dynamics of
        her presence on stage, a distant figure under a stark white spotlight, but also
        the focus of attention.</p>

        <p>Two themes emerged the more I listened to the sonifications and looked
        at the photograph. First, despite the ideals of the folk revival as a
        decentralized, communal, democratic movement, the sonification intensified the
        distinction between Baez‚ the emerging celebrity on stage, and the audience.
        Second, I began to wonder more about the stakes of Baez as a female performer
        within the revival. On the first theme, the sonification amplified how this
        was no campfire "Kumbaya" session, but rather a spectacle at scale, with a
        star on stage who drew everyone's attention and the masses listening to and
        looking at her under the stark white spotlight. Compare, for instance, to
        another image sonification of the audience, probably taken from before or
        after the same concert (<ref target="#figure04">Figure 4</ref> and
        <ref target="#figure05">Figure 5</ref>). In this one, the sonification was
        much noisier, picking up the many patterns of heads, shirts, spotlights, and
        parts of the Greek Amphitheater. Here is scattered attention, the dispersed
        buzz of people before or after shared concentration on a conventional concert
        recital performance. Taken together, the image sonifications of the two images
        signaled how the photographs of Baez at the Greek represent key tensions in
        the early 1960s folk revival. On the one hand, it sought to be anti-commercial
        and anti-hierarchical, shifting music-making from the power differentials
        between entertainer and audience to a shared experience of musical communion.
        On the other hand, its popularity led to increasingly conventional modes of
        presentation, precisely entertainment, a commercial undertaking with all the
        imbalances between a star and passive spectators.</p>
        <p>Baez, who became perhaps the iconic female figure of the revival, was
        particularly caught up in these tensions. A second theme about gender erupted
        from the image sonification. At times, she tried to follow in the footsteps of
        Pete Seeger, adopting progressive and radical political causes or following in
        his collective singalong concert tradition; at other times, she embraced the
        role of a distant icon of the revival. On stage at the Greek, the sonification
        alerts us to the contradictions she sustained as a performer. She is but a
        whisper in one sonification, a little burst of whistles in the other. In both,
        the larger darkness almost swallows her up sonically in the epic space of the
        Greek Amphitheater. And yet she is also the only part of the image to generate
        sound, especially in the whistle sonification. This reminds us that it is Baez,
        who focuses attention from the audience, holds forth at the sole microphone we
        glimpse in the photograph. She is the only figure under the spotlight. Save for
        a quick whisper of sound from the proscenium of the stage and an illuminated
        walkway to the side of the stage, we only hear her in the sonifications.</p>
        <p>And what of the sound generated from the image itself in this particular
        experiment? The ghostly, hollow quality of one sonification and the whistle
        blips of the other caused me to ponder the difference between Baez, the
        person, and Baez, the performer, how one was always lurking within the other.
        A spectral absence within a charismatic performance, the actual Baez offers
        an embodied presentation of authenticity that is oddly disembodied. The
        sonifications amplified for me a young woman was thrust into the spotlight
        of the folk revival at the height of its popularity. She had to negotiate the
        constraints of gender within the folk revival milieu. As such, Baez was able
        to hold forth, convene an audience, speak her musical truth, and articulate
        progressive political ideas publicly. At the same time, Baez was reduced within
        the revival. One would see this a few years later in her relationship on stage
        and in the music business to Bob Dylan, with whom she started performing around
        the time this image was taken. While he pushed forward with the freedom to
        reinvent himself, claim the mantle of the high modernist artist, Baez was often
        limited to gendered roles of the girlfriend, harmony singer, or placed in a
        kind of virginal Madonna stereotype within the folk movement.<note>One
        immediately thinks of John Cage's famous thinking about silence as useful here.
        See <ptr target="#cage1961"/>.</note></p>
        <p>All that just from some pink noise generated by pixel brightness? Some
        might complain that I am "reading" too much into the sonification. Others
        might contend the opposite: that all the sonification revealed was what, to
        a critical eye, the image already visualized. Precisely on both counts. The
        fuss of going through the process of sonification is not to get away from
        the contextualized interpretation of image data, but rather to read data
        that constitute the photographic artifact more probingly, carefully, and
        insightfully (or is it now insoundfully?). By shifting from visual to aural
        form, one can get closer to the fullness of what the artifact itself contains,
        what it suggests as some of its meanings and implications. Moving from merely
        optic investigation to a synesthetic movement between image and sound, between
        the optic and the visual, allows for far richer analysis, a more adventurous
        inquiry into even one photograph.</p>
        <p>Overall, digitally listening to, as well as looking at photographs, allows
        for greater potential access to underlying performative, emotional, spatial,
        embodied, and contextual dimensions captured in imagery. As art historian
        Tina M. Campt writes about her non-digital approach to looking at photographs
        from the African Diaspora, "When the practice of listening is not just about
        hearing but an attunement to different levels of photographic audibility,"
        what emerges is "an attunement to sonic frequencies of affect and impact."
        The human sensorium is not neatly divided between eye and ear.<note>As Jonathan
        Sterne notes, the separation
        and classification of the human sensorium into five distinctive senses
        is a historical outcome of the Enlightenment, not a timeless biological
        phenomenon. See <ptr target="#sterne2003"/>.</note> It is
        capable of new perceptions from the synesthetic interplay between the visual
        and the audial. Listening to images can lead to, as Campt puts it, an "ensemble
        of seeing, feeling, being affected, contacted, and moved beyond the distance
        of sight and observer" <ptr target="#campt2017" loc="41–42"/>.
        Campt is most interested in
        discerning subjectivities of Black fugitivity and futurity in the photographs
        she examines. Image sonification expands the repertoire she outlines by
        bringing the power of digital computation to this project, using it to treat
        photographic data not as totalized empirical facts, but rather as a source
        of multidimensional meanings that bring one more deeply into the images less
        discernable aspects.</p>
        <p>Digital image sonification, pursued through the method I am proposing, also
        offers an avenue for crisscrossing between "distant" and "close" reading in
        digital humanities scholarship. As Alan Liu predicted in 2012, "one of the
        next frontiers for the digital humanities will be to discover technically and
        theoretically how to negotiate between distant and close reading"
        <ptr target="#liu2012" loc="17"/>.
        Sound can convey subtle qualities of timbre, tone, interrelationships
        between different elements, and other kinds of information that visual,
        textual, or statistical data do not display as effectively <ptr target="#schedel2014"/>.
        So
        too, sound presents particular qualities for negotiating the divide between
        distant and close reading because it represents space as time. This allows for
        the compacting of large amounts of information into a quick signal, allowing
        one to listen "at scale." It also, paradoxically, produces the ability to
        magnify minutiae by rendering data temporally, forcing an observer to take
        in details more slowly, as I did with the multiple sonifications of the
        Joan Baez photograph. Capable of going big or small with data, digital image
        sonification asks us to seek truth without resorting to overly simplistic
        and reductive assertions of objectivity. In the immersive "acoustic space,"
        as Edmund Carpenter and Marshall McLuhan called it, "sight isolates" while
        "sound incorporates," as another scholar, Walter Ong, famously contended.
        "Whereas sight situates the observer outside what he views, at a distance,"
        Ong argued, "sound pours into the hearer"
        <ptr target="#ong1982" loc="70"/>
        <ptr target="#carpenter1960" loc="64–69"/>.<note>With thanks to Robert Cantwell
        <ptr target="#cantwell1997"/>
        for reminding me of Ong's theories of sound and its significance.</note>
        Scholars such as Emily Thompson, Jonathan
        Sterne, Veit Erlmann, Alexandra Supper, and Karin Bijsterveld have since
        complicated simplistic compartmentalization of the senses into sight and sound
        as discrete entities, which is precisely why thinking synesthetically about
        the interplay between the two might be most productive as an AudioVisual DH
        tactic

        <ptr target="#thompson2013"/>.<note>Many
        works in sound studies are useful
        for thinking beyond the optic without fetishizing the ear as a supposedly
        better sense. See also

        <ptr target="#novak2015"/>.</note> Digital
        image sonification brings us into an image's form and content, but because
        we are doing so synesthetically, digital image sonification also alienates us
        from what we hear and see, poising us in an intermedial and intermediary space
        between the visual and the aural — a fruitful perceptual space for consideration,
        interpretation, and intellectual discovery.</p>
        <p>Finally, digital image sonification presents an example of how AudioVisual
        DH can push forward research in digital history and archival thinking as part
        of digital humanities writ large. By heightening the perception of fleeting
        feelings and sensations from archives of the past, we might realize Bethany
        Nowviskie's call for "speculative collections," which is to say ways in which
        computers can enable lively play with repository holdings to activate the
        dormant meanings of artifacts <ptr target="#nowviskie2016"/>.
        To my eye and ear, turning the
        Baez photograph in which music was being made back into sound summoned forth
        some of the "archival liveness" that Tom Schofield and colleagues picture
        digital technologies capable of accomplishing <ptr target="#schofield2015"/>
        <ptr target="#ward2019"/>.
        Rather than merely reproduce the knowledge of the archive
        flatly, rather than only looking at the past only through the surface of the
        archive's gaze, image sonification delves more deeply and precisely into data
        to transpose it into new keys, to open up history's evidentiary record for what
        might be present — or absent — from sight alone. We cannot hear the music Joan Baez
        was making at the Greek Amphitheater that night in the early 1960s, but we can
        hear the stakes of her music-making more potently when we sonify the photograph
        of her. Digital image sonification invigorates both the content and the context
        of the image. Issues of gender, power, embodiment, spectacle, performance,
        hierarchy, performance, and more emerge. Synesthetically pivoting between the
        visual and the audio in a cyborgian dance of data, signal, image, sound, and
        human perception, image sonification activates an artifact's data in fresh,
        audiovisual ways. In doing so, it also activates the scholarly imagination.</p>
