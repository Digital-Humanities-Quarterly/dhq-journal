                     shapes of institutions, labs, centres, and other places and spaces of research,
                     including those of the digital humanities (DH). The continuing success of such
                     research largely depends on a commitment to open access and open source
                     philosophies that broaden opportunities for a more efficient, productive, and
                     universal design and use of knowledge. The Electronic Textual Cultures
                     Laboratory (ETCL; <a href="etcl.uvic.ca" onclick="window.open('etcl.uvic.ca'); return false" class="ref">etcl.uvic.ca</a>) is a
                     collaborative centre for digital and open scholarly practices at the University
                     of Victoria, Canada, that engages with these transformations in knowledge
                     creation through its umbrella organization, the Canadian Social Knowledge
                     Institute (C-SKI), that coordinates and supports open social scholarship
                     activities across three major initiatives: the ETCL itself, the Digital
                     Humanities Summer Institute (DHSI; dhsi.org), and the Implementing New Knowledge
                     Environments (INKE; inke.ca) Partnership, including sub-projects associated with
                     each. Open social scholarship is the practice of creating and disseminating
                     public-facing scholarship through accessible means. Working through C-SKI, we
                     seek ways to engage communities more widely with publicly funded humanities
                     scholarship, such as through research creation and dissemination, mentorship,
                     and skills training.

                     research practices including collaboration, knowledge dissemination, and
                     engagement. Over the last few decades, the scholarly landscape has been steadily
                     shifting toward embracing open scholarship, defined as the “wide and broad dissemination of scholarship by a variety of interconnected
                     means (e.g., technology, licensing) aiming to broaden knowledge and reduce
                     barriers to access to knowledge and information”
                     [<a class="ref" href="#veletsianos2016">Veletsianos 2016</a>, 16]. Open scholarship comprises open
                     access publications, open educational resources, open data, and open source
                     software, among other things, and provides the foundation for an evolving
                     research culture that privileges broad accessibility and participation by
                     academics and non-academics. Committing to open scholarship practices is an
                     ethical and practical option for scholarly communication and knowledge creation
                     [<a class="ref" href="#guedon2008">Guédon 2008</a>], fulfilling the mandate of scholarship to
                     create, share, and disseminate knowledge [<a class="ref" href="#cohen2010">Cohen                 2010</a>]

                     result when practitioners can draw from, borrow, repurpose, and build on
                     already-developed research and data.

                     participatory research culture as <span class="hi italic">open social
                        scholarship</span>. As a concept, open social scholarship has grown from roots in
                     open access and open scholarship movements, the digital humanities’
                     methodological commons and community of practice [<a class="ref" href="#siemens2016">Siemens 2016</a>],
                     contemporary online practices, and citizen scholarship. The Implementing New
                     Knowledge Environments (INKE) Partnership has defined open social scholarship as
                     “creating and disseminating research and research
                     technologies to a broad, interdisciplinary audience of specialists and
                     non-specialists in ways that are accessible and significant”
                     [<a class="ref" href="#powell2017">Powell et al. 2017</a>, 3]. Within this conception of the term, open
                     social scholarship manifests in different ways, including by developing,
                     sharing, and implementing research in ways that consider the needs and interests
                     of both academic specialists and communities beyond academia. Open social
                     scholarship also provides opportunities to co-create, interact with, and
                     experience openly available cultural data. Moreover, this type of engagement
                     encourages the exploration, development, and creation of public tools and
                     technologies under open licenses to promote wide access, education, use, and
                     repurposing. Overall, open social scholarship practices enable productive
                     dialogue between academics and non-academics, resisting what is often perceived
                     as a closed circuit of academic knowledge. Refiguring scholarly communication as
                     open access to knowledge enables the public to occupy a more central position in
                     community-engaged university practices; in turn, this has the potential to lead
                     to more democratic and participatory knowledge production.

                     [<a class="ref" href="#jones2014">Jones 2014</a>]. Digital humanists often encourage open social
                     scholarship by using technology to engage with members of the public through
                     projects that involve crowdsourcing or citizen scholarship [<a class="ref" href="#ridge2013">Ridge 2013</a>]
                     [<a class="ref" href="#rockwell2012">Rockwell 2012</a>]. Additionally, DH operates through highly
                     collaborative structures [<a class="ref" href="#siemens2010b">Siemens et al. 2010</a>] spanning
                     cross-departmental and -campus research, and often extending between
                     collaborators in different universities, countries, or even continents. This,
                     then, grounds open social scholarship in both physical and virtual spaces,
                     harnessing the benefits of both. The coming together of researchers in a
                     physical space allows for the development of shared values and common ground
                     around values of openness, which can then be extended through virtual networks
                     of researchers. The continuing success of such research largely depends on a
                     commitment to these philosophies that broaden opportunities for more efficient,
                     productive, and universal design and use of knowledge.

                  <div class="ptext" id="p4">Consequently, this paper is based on the premise that there is a correlation
                     between the developing knowledge landscape and the structure of an intellectual
                     centre, especially when it is committed to “open” values
                     (e.g., open access, source, data, knowledge); the evolution of the knowledge
                     landscape necessarily affects the intellectual structures built upon it.
                     Specifically, we focus on the Electronic Textual Cultures Lab (ETCL;
                     etcl.uvic.ca) — a collaborative centre for digital and open scholarly practices
                     at the University of Victoria, Canada — and demonstrate how the lab’s
                     “intellectual space” has shifted to espouse open social
                     scholarship in research, skills training, and community-oriented initiatives in
                     response to a changing knowledge landscape. The ETCL’s “intellectual space” is
                     based in the physical lab but operates through in-person and virtual
                     collaborations across different initiatives and projects. Within this
                     intellectual space, we engage with intersecting areas of new media, digital
                     humanities, open access, and digital publishing. Leading scholarly communication
                     researcher Kathleen Fitzpatrick (2019) contextualizes these many threads within
                     a framework of public engagement, calling for a shift in mindset toward what she
                     calls “generous thinking”:

                           academic work. We can build programs and networks and platforms that do
                           not just bring the university to the world, but also involve the world

                     connection between academics and the public they serve. The ETCL is attempting
                     to make such connections with its local and global communities — acknowledging
                     that perspectives on research and its engagement, like the important
                     relationships that bring us together in collaboration with others, change over
                     time. To this end, we have adopted a versatile lab structure and infrastructure:
                     today in support of open social scholarship in the many branches of the ETCL,
                     but previously in support of research-related antecedents to this current
                     focus.

                     cultural change toward more open, accessible, and inclusive practices. The
                     second part of this paper will address how the ETCL’s intellectual space and

                     research, teaching, and service aims by launching the Canadian Social Knowledge
                     Institute (C-SKI), the umbrella organization that facilitates the ETCL itself,
                     as well as the Digital Humanities Summer Institute (DHSI) and Implementing New
                     Knowledge Environments (INKE). Overall, we aim to demonstrate how the place and
                     space of a research lab can engage communities more widely with publicly funded
                     humanities output, including through research creation and dissemination,
                     mentorship, and skills training.

                     for decades now. But in the early 2000s, this activity became formalized under
                     the banner of “digital humanities.” As Matthew Kirschenbaum
                     remarks in his foundational article “What Is Digital
                     Humanities and What Is It Doing in English Departments?,” the 2001
                     debate over the naming of an anthology — <cite class="title italic">A Companion to
                        Digital Humanities</cite> (2004), co-edited by Ray Siemens, Susan
                     Schreibman, and John Unsworth — is often considered to be the point when the
                     digital humanities was officially named as such [<a class="ref" href="#unsworth2010">Unsworth 2010</a>].
                     Founded in 2004 by Siemens, the ETCL was an early-established DH lab. Currently
                     led by Ray Siemens as Director, Alyssa Arbuckle as Associate Director, Randa El
                     Khatib as Assistant Director (Open Knowledge Initiatives), Luis Meneses as
                     Assistant Director (Technical Development), and Jannaya Friggstad Jensen as
                     Assistant Director (Coordination and Operations), the lab serves as an
                     intellectual centre for the activities of about 40 local faculty, staff,
                     students, visiting scholars, and community members, and more than 150 since
                     inception. Through a series of highly collaborative relationships, the ETCL’s
                     international community comprises more than 300 researchers and more than 50
                     collaborative partners.

                  <div class="ptext" id="p8">The ETCL was initially modeled on the structure of successful university-based
                     science research labs, adapted for DH researchers. In 2012, Lynne Siemens and
                     Ray Siemens outlined a number of research lab models in “Notes from the Collaboratory,” a presentation at the annual
                     international Digital Humanities conference. In this piece, Siemens and Siemens
                     generally divide collaborative research modes into collaboratories and
                     faculty-directed laboratories. Collaboratories, also known as “centres
                     without walls,” are shared spaces for researchers who create,
                     contribute to, and draw from common resources such as databases and
                     supercomputers within an overarching research area, although their direct
                     research projects may be different [<a class="ref" href="#siemens2012">Siemens and Siemens 2012</a>, 1]. Other
                     models for collaboration include those of a multiple-researcher directed
                     “co-laboratory” and single-researcher director
                     “collaborat-ory,” both of which are adaptable to a
                     humanities context [<a class="ref" href="#glasner1996">Glasner 1996</a>, 111]
                     [<a class="ref" href="#siemens2012">Siemens and Siemens 2012</a>, 1]. The ETCL’s current structure is an
                     expansion of the faculty-directed laboratory, where the lab’s overall success is
                     measured through outputs that meet “standard academic and
                     funding agency benchmarks that [include] measurable research resource
                     intake, provision of teaching and service, and research outputs, such as
                     books, articles, conference papers, and other types of production, more
                     DH-oriented research outputs in the form of tools and prototype development,
                     and further issues”
                     [<a class="ref" href="#siemens2012">Siemens and Siemens 2012</a>, 2]. Although still relying on the
                     faculty-directed structure outlined in 2012, the ETCL has significantly expanded
                     its team and operational model since that time; it currently operates under the
                     leadership of the director and directorial team who all produce academically
                     measurable outputs, in part as a means to reach formal targets tied to grant
                     funding and ongoing use of research space [<a class="ref" href="#cantwell2011">Cantwell                 2011</a>]. These
                     measurable outputs are integral to the continuous operation of a lab [<a class="ref" href="#siemens2012">Siemens and Siemens 2012</a>].

                     [<a class="ref" href="#lewis2015">Lewis et al. 2015</a>, vii] and have noted that the landscape of
                     scholarship has changed dramatically in just a few years, encompassing a new set
                     of methodologies, tools, and research materials that enable researchers to ask
                     new types of questions but also require new sets of skills [<a class="ref" href="#lewis2015">Lewis et al. 2015</a>, viii]. We have seen ourselves situated in this
                     milieu from the start — as a type of digital scholarship centre essential in
                     this new scholarly landscape because we offer space, both physical and social,
                     for collaboration and access to technology and technological expertise that is
                     often not available elsewhere on campus.

                     institutions, but generally speaking, a common function regardless of size and
                     scope is to be a hub for digital scholarship that facilitates and provides both
                     physical and virtual space for collaboration, access to tools and resources, and
                     services for researchers broadly defined, including students, faculty, and staff
                     from across campus and citizen scholars from the local community. Discussion
                     about digital scholarship centres within the academic community tends to focus
                     on the role of institutional libraries in establishing centres and supporting
                     digital scholarship (see [<a class="ref" href="#cox2016">Cox 2016</a>]). Libraries are uniquely
                     appropriate sites for digital scholarship centres because they serve all
                     departments and faculties, making them a central hub for research within an
                     institution and a neutral space for interdisciplinary collaboration [<a class="ref" href="#bergstrom2016">Bergstrom 2016</a>]
                     [<a class="ref" href="#lippincott2013">Lippincott et al.                 2013</a>]
                     [<a class="ref" href="#sinclair2014">Sinclair 2014</a>]. In addition, academic libraries are already
                     innovators in digital scholarship, and librarians have expertise to collaborate
                     with researchers and support digital scholarship projects. Rebecca Dowson notes,
                     for example, that Simon Fraser University Libraries’ Research Commons model
                     developed in response to changes in the scholarly landscape, supporting digital
                     scholarship just as the Information Commons model supports the transition from
                     print to digital research resources and the Learning Commons model supports
                     learning and academic communication (2016). Dowson points out that, although
                     Research Commons support different kinds and stages of research creation, and
                     are therefore not necessarily sites of digital scholarship, “the two concepts share a number of core values, including an ethos of
                     openness, interdisciplinarity, collaboration, and focus on knowledge
                     creation and new modes of production”

                     [<a class="ref" href="#lewis2015">Lewis et al. 2015</a>]. For example, the ETCL is situated in the Digital
                     Scholarship Commons of the McPherson Library at the University of Victoria. The
                     Digital Scholarship Commons is a space for community training in digital tools
                     and methodologies, interdisciplinary work, and presentations; it also houses the

                     instructional design provide service and support for faculty members and their
                     projects. Many times, lab, centre, and commons all denote the same thing, and,
                     at times, the choice of one over the other is made because of local preferences
                     or issues such as administratively-controlled vocabularies.

                  <div class="ptext" id="p12">Although there is no standard nomenclature for digital scholarship centres, they
                     can generally be categorized in two ways: commons-type centres and lab- or
                     makerspace-type centres. Commons-type centres tend to be service-driven,
                     providing access to shared resources much like the collaboratory model described
                     above, and serving the entire institutional community and often the local
                     community as well [<a class="ref" href="#siemens2012">Siemens and Siemens 2012</a>, 1]. Many have stronger
                     relationships with the social sciences and humanities research communities than
                     with other disciplines, possibly because similar resources for STEM (Science,
                     Technology, Engineering and Mathematics) disciplines are available elsewhere on
                     campus [<a class="ref" href="#bergstrom2016">Bergstrom 2016</a>]
                     [<a class="ref" href="#ippoliti2016">Ippoliti 2016</a>]. In contrast, digital scholarship labs and
                     makerspaces are generally open to a specific group of researchers only and may
                     focus on DH specifically, although, like the ETCL, they often engage with the
                     associated researchers from across the university and the local community as
                     well. Lab-type centres tend to be research-driven, aligning them with the
                     faculty-directed “co-laboratory” and
                     “collaborat-ory” models discussed above, although many —
                     again, like the ETCL — also embrace some service and teaching functions related
                     to their research mandates. Some educational programming is common across all
                     types of digital scholarship centres, including workshops and other training
                     programs and talks by in-house or visiting speakers. Many centres also provide
                     access to technologies that are otherwise difficult for their community to
                     access, such as 3D printing equipment and software, virtual reality technology,
                     specialized software and, importantly, training and technological support.
                     Typical services offered by commons-type centres to the entire university
                     community, for example, include consultation, data preservation, support for
                     digital scholarly communication, and metadata creation and management [<a class="ref" href="#ippoliti2016">Ippoliti 2016</a>].

                     comprising numerous centres uniquely designed to meet the needs of their
                     particular institutional community. Regardless of their idiosyncrasies, these
                     centres can be broadly categorized as either commons-type or lab-type.

                     are open to the entire university community. They offer collaborative learning
                     spaces, pedagogical support, research collaboration and consultation, workshops,
                     events, and scholarly communication support, including for open scholarship.
                     Examples of these centres in Canada include the Digital Scholarship Lab at Brock
                     University, Lab NEXT at the University of Calgary,<a class="noteRef" href="#d4e481">[1]</a> the Innovation Commons at McGill University, the
                     Centre for Digital Scholarship at the University of New Brunswick, and the
                     Digital Scholarship Commons at the University of Victoria (the larger group of
                     which the ETCL is a part). York University’s Digital Scholarship Centre appears
                     unique insofar as it is open to the entire university community, but is located
                     within the library serving students and researchers in the Humanities and Social
                     Sciences, Fine Arts, and Environmental Studies. In its focus on a particular
                     research community within the university, York’s centre is like many other
                     commons-type digital scholarship centres that are located in the university
                     library but open to specific groups of researchers, particularly graduate
                     students, postgraduate researchers, and faculty. This type of centre offers many
                     of the same services and programming as those described above, but is geared
                     toward supporting research and publication — including open forms of publication
                     — rather than undergraduate learning, although most welcome undergraduate
                     students who are part of a faculty-led project. Some examples of these
                     research-focused commons-type centres include the Lewis &amp; Ruth Sherman
                     Centre for Digital Scholarship at McMaster University, the Digital Research
                     Centre at the University of Saskatchewan, the Research Commons at Simon Fraser
                     University, UBC’s Advanced Research Computing, the Humanities Computing and
                     Media Centre at the University of Victoria, the University of Windsor’s Centre
                     for Digital Scholarship, and the University of Guelph’s Digital Scholarship
                     support program, which — unlike the other centres — is a cluster of services
                     based in the library rather than a physical space within it. Brock University
                     has a second digital scholarship centre — the Centre for Digital Humanities —
                     that offers many similar services to its Digital Scholarship Lab, but outside of
                     the library and for students in specific Humanities programs only.

                     centres tend to be highly collaborative and interdisciplinary. Although they are
                     generally faculty-led and research oriented, most also offer talks, workshops,
                     and other programming open to the university community. The ETCL and the Centre
                     for Digital Humanities at Ryerson University are examples of labs with interests
                     in teaching and training, as well as open scholarship. Some are located within
                     university libraries and learning centres, such as the ETCL, the University of
                     Alberta’s Canadian Institute for Research in Computing and the Arts (CIRCA), and
                     the Digital Humanities Innovation Lab (DHIL) at Simon Fraser University, while
                     others are not. Many focus on specific themes or clusters of themes, or
                     otherwise target specific community needs. The Centre de recherche
                     interuniversitaire sur les humanités numériques (CRIHN) at the University of
                     Montréal, for example, brings together digital humanities researchers from
                     several universities in Québec, while Western University’s Cultureplex Lab
                     enables collaboration between humanities scholars, entrepreneurs, computer
                     scientists, and engineers. Other examples of lab-type digital humanities centres
                     in Canada include the University of British Columbia’s Emerging Media Lab (EML),
                     the AMP Lab at UBC Okanagan, Carleton University’s Hyperlab, the University of
                     Ottawa’s Humanities + Data Lab, and the MeTA Digital Humanities lab at Vancouver
                     Island University. As this brief survey reveals, each of these digital
                     scholarship centres is unique in structure and focus; they all, however,
                     emphasize interdisciplinarity and collaboration within the Canadian research
                     context.

                  <div class="ptext" id="p16">In this vital and thriving context of digital scholarship in Canada, and
                     especially in consideration of ETCL’s move to the UVic Digital Scholarship
                     Commons in January 2017, it is important to note that ETCL has expanded in size
                     and scope as part of its evolution over time. Although we still undertake many
                     digital humanities projects and initiatives — most notably by facilitating the
                     annual Digital Humanities Summer Institute — many ETCL constituents are now
                     active in open social scholarship through theoretical and practical engagements,
                     as described in the following section. The ETCL is not the only digital
                     humanities group to shift focus toward more open and more social practices. In
                     fact, this movement could be considered as emblematic of a larger cultural
                     change in the field. Among other venues, this shift is emphasized in the
                     thematic community focus of representative collections like <cite class="title italic">Collaborative Research in the Digital Humanities</cite>

                     feminism; and Williams (2012) on the value of accessibility. Many digital
                     humanities practitioners are reconsidering their role in local, national, and
                     international contexts that extend beyond the academic world. Such a
                     disciplinary turn toward matters of social justice, collaboration, and social
                     media acknowledges a changing tide of consciousness around how the humanities is
                     constituted as an academic field, as well as what its role is (or could be) in
                     the larger social sphere.

                     with select current and past members in order to reflect formally on the
                     developments and infrastructural changes of the ETCL and to plan the lab’s next
                     steps. In addition to our thinking about how the intellectual space of the ETCL
                     is interconnected, the outcome of this exercise was to reflect our shifting
                     direction by updating the ETCL mandate, mission, and values statements. Our ETCL
                     mandate is to be “a collaborative centre for digital and
                     open scholarly practices. We are a multidisciplinary team of faculty, staff,
                     students, and visiting scholars who engage on- and off-campus partners
                     through research, skills training, and community-oriented
                     initiatives”
                     [<a class="ref" href="#etclhome">ETCL Home Page n.d.</a>]. Our mission is to engage, facilitate, and promote
                     cross-community digital initiatives at the University of Victoria, as well as in
                     the larger regional, national, and international contexts by cultivating the
                     practices and values of open social scholarship [<a class="ref" href="#etclhome">ETCL Home Page n.d.</a>]. These
                     tie into our values — namely our dedication to community-driven scholarship that
                     recognizes collaborative models of knowledge sharing; open practices in digital
                     research, production, and dissemination; the intellectual development and
                     well-being of our communities; shared mentorship, accountability, and support
                     across multiple disciplines, professions, and groups; and inclusive and ethical
                     practices, as outlined in the DHSI Statement on Ethics and Inclusion (see [<a class="ref" href="#dhsi">DHSI Statement on                 Ethics and Inclusion 2015, 2016</a>]) [<a class="ref" href="#etclvalues">ETCL                 Values n.d.</a>]. These values reflect the
                     ETCL’s main direction over the last few years: to understand and practice open
                     social scholarship.

                  <div class="ptext" id="p19">Another goal of the ETCL visioning meeting was to propose various infrastructural
                     models that may best describe how C-SKI transfuses its open social scholarship
                     mandate to other aspects of the lab. Two models that seemed particularly
                     relevant were “lab as incubator” and “lab as tree.” Not to be confused with
                     “academic incubator,” which typically refers to an
                     informal space to develop partnerships between students / the university and
                     non-university / industry-based representatives or investors with the goal of
                     facilitating entrepreneurship [<a class="ref" href="#gensler">Gensler n.d.</a>], the “lab as incubator” reflects the ETCL’s goal of developing and
                     sustaining an environment that cultivates open social scholarship. The incubator
                     metaphor also reflects the idea that a lab should be a positive space for growth
                     — in our case, one that has facilitated ETCL, DHSI, and INKE to develop into
                     their current forms, and also to embrace a larger frame of collaborative
                     research with others as they move toward open social and scholarship themselves.
                     The second model, “lab as tree,” represents something
                     living and growing that serves as a foundation and support for new growth. A
                     tree also depends on communication between all of its constituent parts, and
                     more accurately reflects the sub-branches that grow out of the separate
                     branches. As early as the 13th century, trees have been employed as metaphors
                     for structuring and categorizing knowledge, such as in Ramon Llull’s structuring
                     of the sciences in <cite class="title italic">Arbor Scientiae</cite> (1295), or Tree

                  <div class="ptext" id="p20">The tree metaphor for organization and categorization has been widely employed as
                     a strategy to aid thinking and categorization in numerous disciplines,
                     especially the sciences, in fields like biology [<a class="ref" href="#mindell2013">Mindell 2013</a>],
                     and is often used in computing [<a class="ref" href="#forisek2013">Forišek and Steinová 2013</a>, 20].
                     Additionally, the tree metaphor at once reflects the deep, 16-year roots of the
                     ETCL at both the University of Victoria and in the DH community. In either
                     representation, as an incubator or the trunk of a tree, the lab is a
                     foundational element that supports the whole. By extending this metaphor of
                     “lab as tree,” the rest of this article will

                     <div class="ptext" id="p22">According to Amy Earhart (2015), DH labs resemble science labs in that they
                        “contain equipment utilized by digital humanists,
                        emphasize collaborative research, and focus on theoretical and applied
                        research”; however, they also train and mentor students and
                        faculty, “serving as pedagogical and outreach or service
                        arms dedicated to growing work within the field” — tasks that are
                        typically carried out by separate bodies in the sciences [<a class="ref" href="#earhart2015">Earhart 2015</a>, 392]. Another difference between science
                        and DH labs that applies to the ETCL is the different layout of the two:
                        “[w]hile science labs are often clustered by area,
                        equipment or topic, digital humanities labs are often broader,
                        multipurpose, and more inclusive by both design and funding
                        limitations”
                        [<a class="ref" href="#earhart2015">Earhart 2015</a>, 392]. The ETCL’s intellectual space
                        operates in both physical place and virtual space. The physical place is
                        grounded in the ETCL and its associated programs, which are described below.
                        The physical layout of the ETCL comprises a large room with multiple
                        workstations and meeting spaces. The open setup promotes collaboration, as
                        do the meeting spaces that are used for ETCL team members and partners
                        beyond the lab. Equipment, such as 3D printers, scanners, and software can
                        be used by everyone working in the lab. There is also a lab library that
                        includes many print texts on digital humanities, digital scholarship,
                        publishing, and open scholarship, among other topics including many in the
                        traditional, historical humanities. Based in the physical place, the virtual
                        space comprises a network of associated researchers and communities beyond
                        the lab. ETCL members have confirmed that despite the growth of virtual
                        tools (such as Skype, listservs, emails, project coordination websites,
                        etc.), face-to-face interactions in a physical space remain important [<a class="ref" href="#daft1987">Daft et al. 1987</a>]
                        [<a class="ref" href="#siemens2010a">Siemens 2010</a>]. By meeting in this context, the network of
                        ETCL members and affiliates develop common ground and shared values. Having
                        shared values means that we can more easily communicate with each other and
                        be more connected as a network able to support mutual goals related to open
                        social scholarship [<a class="ref" href="#bos2010">Bos et al. 2010</a>]

                        all happens,” since it is the physical place in which we
                        cultivate the ETCL’s intellectual space, organize DHSI, and develop the
                        research infrastructure that supports a significant portion of INKE’s
                        intellectual direction and activity; these are discussed as separate
                        branches below. Beyond coordinating DHSI and INKE, the lab also supports
                        multiple projects of its own and largely functions as a mechanism for
                        community building across and beyond campus. In part this occurs through
                        multiple speaker series — including the Nuts and Bolts discussions designed
                        to focus on the pragmatics of digital research and the Digital Scholarship
                        on Tap interdisciplinary lecture series that brings together researchers to
                        share their different disciplinary perspectives on a common topic (e.g.,
                        digital mapping), each evolving out of years of earlier, less formal
                        presentations about ongoing research that typically took place mid-day and
                        to which people brought their packed lunches and ate while they listened and
                        discussed. Through these collegial talks and discussions, the lab builds a
                        community around developments in digital scholarship, research, and teaching
                        in an increasingly digitized world. The ETCL also supports activities in
                        open social scholarship through the Open Knowledge Program, through which it
                        opens up the physical place of the lab for fellows across campus, and from
                        the local and global communities. In what follows we discuss the Open
                        Knowledge Program and how it relates to or embodies the ETCL’s open social
                        scholarship ethos.

                        call to engage the public more actively. Engagement is considered both in
                        terms of opening the space of the institution and in reorienting its focus
                        towards more public-facing scholarship, culminating in the rise of the
                        public humanities [<a class="ref" href="#brown1995">Brown 1995</a>]
                        [<a class="ref" href="#jay2012">Jay 2012</a>]. More recently, this call has been answered by
                        projects that draw on citizen scholarship, citizen science, and other forms
                        of community-engaged scholarship, made easier with the development of more
                        user-friendly and accessible technologies [<a class="ref" href="#bonney2009">Bonney et al. 2009</a>]

                        [<a class="ref" href="#hoy2013">Hoy and Johnson 2013</a>]. We see this shift toward more publicly-engaged
                        scholarship as an opportunity to open up the physical place of the ETCL to
                        university and community members and to expand the dissemination of
                        lab-related research through more public-facing scholarly communication
                        channels. One of the ways the lab embraces this shift is through the Open
                        Knowledge Program (<a href="https://etcl.uvic.ca/okp/" onclick="window.open('https://etcl.uvic.ca/okp/'); return false" class="ref">https://etcl.uvic.ca/okp/</a>), launched in 2017 from earlier
                        informal origins, which comprises a suite of activities that include the
                        Open Knowledge Practicum, the Open Knowledge Practicum@DHSI, and the Open

                     <div class="ptext" id="p25">The Open Knowledge Practicum invites non-lab affiliates from the local on-
                        and off-campus community in the Greater Victoria Region to bring their own
                        public-facing project interests and research into the lab. As of spring
                        2020, the practicum is in its fourth year, and consists of four-month
                        fellowships, although fellows may choose to extend their practicum for more
                        than one term. The lab’s role is to provide support, consultation, and
                        mentorship and to strategize research plans with fellows. As part of the
                        practicum, fellows are also offered honorariums, often in the form of DHSI
                        tuition scholarships that provide training in technical and theoretical
                        areas necessary to fellows’ projects. Fellows contribute to Wikipedia and
                        publish their projects in online, public venues, and are also involved in
                        the day-to-day lab life and events on and off campus. Recently, the Open
                        Knowledge Practicum has expanded to support faculty partnerships, where the
                        ETCL houses larger projects and their lead investigators in the lab, while
                        providing support, training, and mentorship to the student researchers
                        working on that project through fellowship positions.

                        to DHSI attendees and instructors. During the practicum, fellows develop a
                        well-defined project related to their work, with the goal of sharing the
                        project in a public venue such as Wikipedia. Honorariums for this fellowship
                        constitute accommodation and per diems, meant to support those travelling to

                        discipline at UVic to develop an aspect of their thesis, dissertation, or
                        any other formal project, with the support of the ETCL’s community and
                        resources. Like other programs in this stream, residents will contribute
                        some aspect of their project to an online, public venue, and will more
                        generally be exposed to the value of making scholarship accessible. The
                        residency is also meant to give graduate students a more formal experience
                        of working in a DH lab and help them develop digital skills by offering two
                        DHSI spots for each residency; together, these skills are meant to help
                        graduate students complete their projects but also help them develop
                        experience and transferable research skills in preparation for the job

                        is conscious about trying to keep the physical place of the lab open and

                        of the institute. DHSI is a productive environment for acquiring and
                        developing digital humanities skills via knowledge transfer, networking,
                        collaboration, and community building. Launched in 2001, DHSI offers the
                        largest digital humanities curriculum in the world. It originated at
                        Malaspina University-College (now Vancouver Island University) as a
                        collection of early-career scholars who wished to build a supportive
                        community of practice around computational applications in the arts and
                        humanities; it was supported there by the Centre for Digital Humanities
                        Innovation, a predecessor of ETCL. Moving to the University of Victoria in
                        2004 when the ETCL was established there, DHSI grew from its roots as an
                        informal event (which we might today call an unconference) that initially
                        drew some 20–30 people to, by 2019, a formal institute with an annual
                        planning and operation cycle drawing some 850+ participants, with an
                        involved international collegiate of approximately 4,500 alumni. Since we
                        were unable to hold an in-person DHSI in 2020 due to the coronavirus disease
                        (COVID-19), the workshops and featured speakers originally scheduled for
                        DHSI 2020 were postponed to 2021. However, in lieu of the in-person
                        gathering, we hosted our first ever virtual institute, DHSI 2020—Online
                        Edition, that moved several affiliated events online, including the DHSI
                        Conference and Colloquium and Alliance of Digital Humanities (ADHO) Special
                        Interest Group for DH Pedagogy and Training mini-conference, the Project
                        Management in the Humanities conference, the RTL (Right to Left) workshop,
                        and an EPoetry event #GraphPoem [<a href="https://dhsi.org/dhsi-2020/" onclick="window.open('https://dhsi.org/dhsi-2020/'); return false" class="ref">DHSI 2020 — Online Edition</a>]. The event took place in the first
                        two weeks of June and brought together over 1200 participants from around
                        the world. Similarly, in 2016 we worked with the Electronic Literature
                        Organization (ELO) to host its annual international conference with DHSI, in
                        2017 with the Society for the History of Authorship, Reading, and Publishing
                        (SHARP) for its annual international conference, and in 2018 with the
                        Council on Library and Information Resources’ Digital Library Federation
                        (CLIR DLF) as well as the Symposium for Indigenous New Media.

                        a recognized intermediary space for scholars, researchers, and students to
                        connect with colleagues from other disciplines and professions in and around
                        the digital humanities. Through a mix of courses, workshops, colloquiums,
                        conference activities, and networking events, participants meet to share
                        their research, interests, and expertise across traditionally divergent
                        lines of knowledge creation. DHSI’s participants include those on the
                        academic track seeking skills training and professionalization
                        opportunities, but they also readily come from outside the university
                        setting, such as those involved with cultural heritage activities, working
                        for the government or in the private sector, or simply curious non-academic
                        researchers or citizen scholars who want to acquire new skills and learn

                        which exists on a number of levels, is that we welcome those who wish to
                        participate, from all backgrounds and interests. Many attendees are awarded
                        significant tuition scholarships to offset the cost of participating in the
                        institute. At times upward of 30% (~300) of attendees receive tuition
                        scholarships from DHSI or assistance from related external sponsorship. In
                        this way, we can offer opportunities that might not exist otherwise and
                        support participants by providing tangible means to help them attend and
                        participate in the institute. We also encourage course proposals from
                        members of our community; called “community courses,”
                        these offerings are intended to align with current interests, passions, and
                        areas of expertise among those in our group. Further, in its intellectual
                        direction, since 2017 DHSI has brought open scholarship into a pedagogical
                        setting by offering a number of courses that engage open scholarship and

                        offering. For the sixth time, in January 2020 we hosted DHSI events at the
                        annual Modern Language Association (MLA) convention. The first workshop,
                        “DH Curious? Digital Humanities Tools and
                        Technologies for Students, Emerging Scholars, Faculty, Librarians, and
                        Administrators,” offered novices in DH a broad overview of
                        theoretical and hands-on branches of DH tools, methodologies, and
                        pedagogical engagements. The workshop attracted a broad audience including
                        graduate students, faculty, librarians, and administrators from different
                        disciplinary backgrounds. In 2020 we also offered a new workshop, “Digital Humanities and Open Scholarship: An
                        Introduction,” which focused on open access tools, open
                        scholarship policy, open annotation, and Wikipedia. Similar training is
                        offered at the annual Congress of the Humanities and Social Sciences as

                     <div class="ptext" id="p37">As a collaborative approach to affecting change in scholarly communication
                        through open social scholarship practices, the INKE Partnership draws from
                        contemporary theory and practice predicated on the understanding that those
                        in the Humanities and Social Sciences (HSS) could and should re-orient their
                        work to be much more engaged with the public at large. All of INKE’s
                        research questions and activity clusters are informed by conceptions of
                        evolving scholarly communication, opening access to research, and creating
                        knowledge in more social ways. With the rise of networked technologies and
                        major computing infrastructure, we witness rapid and substantial changes in
                        knowledge creation — every year brings new possibilities and increased
                        levels of innovation. This is reflected across academic and societal
                        developments that change the way knowledge is produced, shared, distributed,
                        and developed, such as open access and online publishing, the rise of
                        digital scholarship, personal (and often mobile) computing devices, social
                        media, citizen scholars, and shifting information access regulations. The
                        widespread production and adoption of online tools and platforms, such as
                        Wikipedia, presents an opportunity for the public and HSS researchers to
                        participate in shared knowledge-based activities, as well as in inclusive
                        and representative public spaces.

                     <div class="ptext" id="p38">One way that INKE provides open social scholarship infrastructure is by
                        prototyping the Canadian HSS Commons, an online network that connects
                        academics and broader communities. Inspired by the Modern Language
                        Association’s Humanities Commons platform (<a href="https://hcommons.org/" onclick="window.open('https://hcommons.org/'); return false" class="ref">https://hcommons.org/</a>), the
                        Canadian HSS Commons fosters an environment for Canadian HSS researchers to
                        share and access research, publications, and resources, as well as form
                        communities, forge collaborations, create data, and use digital scholarship
                        tools. This commons includes a subject repository for open access
                        publications that assigns digital object identifiers (DOIs) upon upload and
                        follows FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interactive, Reusable) guidelines for
                        data management; a project development environment that can integrate with
                        Google Drive or Dropbox; individual user profiles, with federated
                        login/identity authorization, including with ORCID; blogging capabilities;
                        and mechanisms to support subject interest groups and member interactions
                        (e.g., profile building, messaging). The Canadian HSS Commons offers an
                        alternative to problematic commercial repositories: it is a not-for-profit,
                        open access, and Canada-specific version of an HSS scholarly communication
                        and interaction platform. By making Canadian humanities and social science
                        research data and tools visible and accessible, we encourage a culture that
                        builds on already-developed applications and information rather than
                        repeatedly reinventing the wheel.

                     question is a commitment to remain dynamic, with an infrastructure provided by
                     ETCL and C-SKI that allows us to grow into a more open lab and to readjust to
                     the most effective models that reflect this commitment within a DH lab context.
                     Over the last three years, we have formalized this shift in the physical place

                     community members and support a wide variety of public-facing projects. We also
                     continuously foster interdisciplinary local communities through our speaker
