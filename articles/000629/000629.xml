        <!--Include a brief abstract of the article-->
        <p> Knowledge mapping combines network analysis and data visualization to summarize research
          domains and illustrate their structure. In this paper, we present a framework for ethical
          and effective visualization of knowledge networks, which we developed while building a
          knowledge map of climate communication research. Using the climate communication knowledge
          map as an example, we highlight the practical and ethical challenges encountered in
          creating such visualizations and show how they can be navigated in ways that produce more
          trustworthy and more useful products. Our recommendations balance tensions between
          qualitative and quantitative and objective and subjective aspects of knowledge mapping.
          They demonstrate the importance of critical practices in the development of knowledge
          maps, illustrate the intertwined nature of analysis and results in such projects, and
          emphasize the constructedness of the resulting visualization. We argue that the only way
          to produce an effective knowledge map is to produce an ethical one, which requires
          attention to the ways trust and accountability can be produced at every step of analysis
          and production. This extends the literature on ethical visualization in digital humanities
          projects by offering a clear example of the utility of a critical approach for a
          traditional, science-oriented knowledge mapping project. </p>

        <head>1. Introduction</head>
        <p>Scholars have long been captivated by the idea that knowledge generation is outpacing
          their ability to keep up, necessitating creative techniques and solutions to organize,
          manage, and access information. From scientist Vannevar Bush’s memex<note> An external
            brain for forming and tracking relational knowledge <ptr target="#bush1945"/>. </note>
          to futurist Richard Buckminster Fuller’s Geoscope,<note> A macroscope for harnessing
            disparate data and visualizing it on a global surface, to support problem definition and
            problem solving <ptr target="#fuller1981"/>.</note> researchers have envisioned
          high-tech tools for information management and knowledge creation since before the advent
          of big data. Today, well into the era of hyperlinked text and geographic information
          systems not unlike the miracle tools envisioned by 20th century inventors, making
          knowledge on even very specific areas of scholarship tractable remains a complicated
          challenge. As scholarly knowledge continues to grow, so does interest in quantitative
          techniques for summary, survey, and synthesis of knowledge domains.</p>
        <p>Knowledge mapping is one such survey and synthesis technique. It combines data
          visualization and network analysis to depict large collections of information spatially,
          as if they were a landscape viewed from above. Knowledge mapping is a general term for an
          analysis informed by and applied in multiple areas of scholarship, including information
          science <ptr target="#borner2010"/>, literature <ptr target="#moretti2007"/>, history
            <ptr target="#graham_etal2015"/>, and bibliometrics <ptr target="#chen2016"/>. These
          maps are at once analytical, managerial, and communicative: analytical because they
          provide tests of network theories and because bibliometric data was one of the earliest
          sources of big data for such analyses; managerial because they guide decision-making,
          funding allocation, and evaluation; and communicative because they aim to support
          discovery and guide hypothesis formation by depicting knowledge as a collaborative,
          interlinked whole. Knowledge maps are simultaneously rhetorically powerful (because they
          make visual arguments) and ethically fraught (because visual arguments presented in such
          charts are often accepted as objective fact), but knowledge mapping techniques have not
          yet been brought into conversation with recent work in digital humanities surrounding
          ethical visualization and data feminism <ptr target="#dignazio2019"/>; <ptr
            target="#dignazio_etal2020"/>; <ptr target="#hepworth2017"/>; <ptr
            target="#hepworth2020"/>. </p>
        <p>Ethical visualization is the practice of acknowledging and mitigating the potential for
          harm that is inherent to particular visualizations <ptr target="#hepworth_etal2018"/>.
          Ethical visualization and data feminism require consideration of the whole data pipeline,
          from acquisition to analysis to visualization, and attention to the ways in which some
          perspectives are marginalized, omitted, or elided <ptr target="#dignazio_etal2016"/>; <ptr
            target="#dignazio_etal2020"/>. Both traditions require not only acknowledging the
          potential negative effects of a visualization or drawbacks of a particular dataset, but
          actively working to mitigate them in a way that increases understanding while minimizing
          harm <ptr target="#cairo2014"/>. Given nascent discussions in bibliometrics about the
          potential harm perpetuated by uncritical application of bibliometric techniques for
          evaluation, it is an important time to bring critical practices into conversations about
          knowledge mapping <ptr target="#bornmann2017"/>; <ptr target="#conway2014"/>; <ptr
            target="#donovan2019"/>; <ptr target="#furner2014"/>; <ptr target="#rolf2021"/>; <ptr
            target="#zuccala2016"/>. </p>
        <p>In this paper, we demonstrate how principles of ethical visualization and data feminism
          can be applied in the development of a knowledge map to produce a more trustworthy and
          more useful product. We do this by providing a detailed account of the path we followed to
          build a knowledge map of climate communication research, highlighting practical challenges
          encountered in creating such a visualization and how ideas from ethical visualization
          literature helped navigate them. Specifically, we: (1) demonstrate the importance of
          critical practices in the development of a complex type of chart, (2) illustrate the
          intertwined nature of analysis and results in big data projects, and (3) take a first step
          toward a feminist bibliometrics informed by critical work in digital humanities. This
          addresses a previously identified need for clear guidance on the visual communication of
          knowledge networks <ptr target="#conway2014"/>; <ptr target="#garilova_etal2019"/>. It has
          relevance for digital humanists working with knowledge networks and bibliometricians
          seeking practical strategies for mitigating harmful externalities of evaluative
          bibliometrics. It also enriches ongoing conversations in the digital humanities about
          ethical visualization and data feminism with examples of how frequently ethical choices
          arise in a data visualization project. </p>
        <p>Ultimately, we emphasize the constructedness of these types of visualizations, showing
          why a purely quantitative, purely objective depiction of a knowledge network is neither
          possible nor particularly useful. We argue that the best way to produce an effective
          knowledge map is to produce an ethical one, which requires attention to the ways trust and
          accountability can be produced at every step of analysis and production. </p>

        <head>2. Knowledge mapping</head>
        <p>Knowledge maps are powerful tools for planning, collaborating, teaching, and
          communicating, because they depict metaknowledge about how topics and problems are
          structured <ptr target="#borner2010"/>; <ptr target="#evans_etal2011"/>.
            <term>Metaknowledge</term> – literally, knowledge about knowledge – may sound like a
          dangerously totalizing <q>god trick,</q> but it can in fact be understood as a concept
          gesturing at the positionality and situatedness of all knowledge, and the necessity of
          combining multiple partial perspectives to understand a system <ptr target="#haraway1988"
          />; <ptr target="#dignazio2019"/>. Sociologists James A. Evans and Jacob G. Foster define
          metaknowledge as the result of <quote rend="inline">critical scrutiny of what is known,
            how, and by whom</quote> and suggest that we might best understand what metaknowledge is
          by thinking about what we, as individual scholars with particular trainings, career paths,
          and expertise, think about as we read a journal article in order to <quote rend="inline"
            >index a broader context of ideas, [scholars], and disciplines</quote> – the kind of
          knowledge gained from being a participant in a system through time <ptr
            target="#evans_etal2011" loc="721"/>; <ptr target="#kwan2002"/>. Knowledge maps offer an
          alternative way to gain a similar kind of qualitative understanding via quantitative
          techniques, affording viewers an intuitive summary of a large collection of information
            <ptr target="#lima2011"/>; <ptr target="#moretti2007"/>; <ptr
            target="#vangeenen_etal2020"/>. Metaknowledge is important because it sparks abduction,
          or diagnostic-style logic, where experts may arrive intuitively at a conclusion based on
          partial information combined with their existing understanding of the system and situation
          at hand, and where knowledge may be generated instead of simply synthesized <ptr
            target="#brooke2017"/>; <ptr target="#douven2017"/>; <ptr target="#graham_etal2015"/>. </p>
        <p>While it may be preferable to gain metaknowledge the traditional way, by participating in
          a knowledge system over a lifetime, this is not always practical or possible. Knowledge
          maps act as a tool which – just like regular maps of landscapes – are useful for sharing
          information, for planning where to go and how to get there, for noticing patterns or
          pathways that might not have been apparent to boots on the ground, and for coordinating
          collective effort in the face of complexity. They support switching between general
          knowledge and specific pieces of information and evidence, an ability which has been
          identified as a fundamental practice of critical scholarship <ptr target="#edmond2018"/>;
            <ptr target="#moretti2007"/>; <ptr target="#kwan2002"/>. Their utility comes even though
          knowledge offered by such a bird’s eye view is clearly different from the kind gained
          through personal experience, immersion, and reflection <ptr target="#evans_etal2011"/>;
            <ptr target="#moretti2007"/>. Essentially, it is worth simultaneously being cautious
          about the algorithmic ways in which knowledge maps synthesize big citation data and
          present it as knowledge, while also emphasizing the incredible utility of this form for
          producing, transmitting, and constructing collective knowledge <ptr
            target="#dignazio_etal2016"/>; <ptr target="#dignazio2019"/>. Bibliometrician David A.
          Pendlebury summed this up effectively when he observed a need for 
          <quote rend="inline">charting a path between the simple and false and the complex and unusable</quote>
          <ptr target="#pendlebury2019" loc="549"/>.</p>
        <p>When constructed in partnership with residents from the mapped research domain, knowledge
          maps can prompt identification and reassessment of taken-for granted assumptions and
          highlight forces shaping problem definition in a field. In fact, examples of this work in
          climate domains are what initially inspired our attempt to map the climate communication
          research landscape <ptr target="#canon_etal2022"/>. For example, informationist
          Christopher Belter and climate scientist Dian Seidel <ptr target="#belter_etal2013"/>
          created network visualizations to reveal (dis)connections in geoengineering knowledge,
          using sparse network charts to show how some planetary systems receive more focus than
          others, and that lack of information exchange between areas of study means there may be
          inadequate consideration of potential interactions between different geoengineering
          strategies. Another example is the work of psychologist Laura Kati Corlew and her team
            <ptr target="#corlew_etal2015"/>, who successfully used social network analysis to build
          a knowledge sharing and resource discovery tool for climate professionals in the Pacific
          Islands.</p>
        <p>These projects are notable because they leverage knowledge maps as communication and
          collaboration tools while being sensitive to audience needs and effects on those depicted
          in the visually powerful network charts. Rather than viewing analysis as an endpoint,
          these studies distill the information spaces into clear visualizations for interested
          audiences. Knowledge maps should be built from this perspective, to be both useful and
          usable and to assist viewers in extracting meaning from information spaces and analyses
          that may otherwise be esoterically complex. </p>
      </div>

        <head>3. Designing the climate communication knowledge map</head>
        <p>The climate communication knowledge mapping project was initially situated in the
          tradition of science mapping, a kind of knowledge mapping undertaken by computer
          scientists and network analysts. Science mapping uses bibliometric data to reveal the
          structure of a knowledge domain by creating networks of papers or authors linked by
          citations or collaborations. However, despite having domain expertise in climate
          communication and fluency in network analysis techniques (often considered the ideal for
          this type of project), we immediately ran into ethical and practical challenges that were
          not well addressed in the science mapping literature, perhaps because too much emphasis is
          placed on the objectivity of network maps, the assumed impartiality of algorithmic
          curation, and the potential of data speaking for itself <ptr target="#conway2014"/>; <ptr
            target="#dignazio2019"/>; <ptr target="#dignazio_etal2020"/>; <ptr
            target="#hepworth2020"/>; <ptr target="#white_etal1998"/>; <ptr target="#yang_etal2016"
          />. In our project, limited technological resources necessitated static depictions of the
          knowledge network, data quality precluded purely algorithmic curation, and it was
          frequently unclear how fundamental tasks like disambiguation and layout should be
          approached when the goal was to create a useful knowledge map (instead of just to arrive
          at an analytical result). In this section, we describe in detail the challenges
          encountered in building the climate communication knowledge map and point out how
          attention to conversations in ethical visualization and data feminism provided needed
          guidance on navigating them. </p>
        <p>Perhaps because of the impact of scientific approaches to visualization on knowledge
          mapping, a significant amount of data in knowledge mapping projects is not pre-processed
          before it is visualized. It is thought that network analysis itself controls for any
          errors or ambiguities in the underlying data <ptr target="#chen2016"/>. If ambiguities do
          exist in the network map, conventional wisdom holds that resulting irregularities cancel
          each other out, and overall conclusions are not affected <ptr target="#fegley_etal2013"/>;
            <ptr target="#white_etal1998"/>. We did not find this to be the case in our knowledge
          map, especially when imagining how it might be useful and trustworthy for climate
          communicators. If the first thing a user notices when looking at a knowledge map is a data
          error (such as a single leading scholar being split into multiple author nodes), it cannot
          be expected that the user will trust other elements of the knowledge map. Given that the
          point of a knowledge map is to support reasonable inferences about the structure and
          function of the research domain, it is a serious problem if data issues affect
          interpretation. Engineer Jinseok Kim’s research reveals the nature and extent of factors
          that distort knowledge maps <ptr target="#kim_etal2014a"/>; <ptr target="#kim_etal2014b"
          />; <ptr target="#kim_etal2016"/>; <ptr target="#kim2019"/>. For example, datasets rife
          with author name ambiguities appear <term>scale-free</term>,<note>
            <term>Scale-free</term> means that the structural patterns evident in the network
            persist regardless of the size of the network. This is often explained by a process
            called preferential attachment, where newcomers to the network tend to connect to
            existing network members who already have a high number of connections (an example of a
              <q>rich-get-richer</q> phenomenon). In the example of a citation network, certain
            papers accumulate high numbers of citations while others are never cited.</note> a
          feature long thought to characterize citation networks <ptr target="#desolla1965"/>, when
          in fact they aren’t. Consequences to both the mapped research community and to theorists
          studying network processes can be profound when data visualizations uncritically display
          conclusions that may be based on irregularities in the data, and when funding decisions
          are made based on this data. As a result, the bulk of our paper focuses on data
          processing, and the ethical considerations that may be glossed over when the network
          analysis itself is the jumping off point for a knowledge mapping study.</p>
        <p>In this section, we undertake the important data feminist approach of showing our work
            <ptr target="#dignazio_etal2020"/>. We provide a complete description of how we produced
          the climate communication knowledge map, attempting to be transparent about elements of
          data preparation and visualization design that are not generally discussed in published
          literature, but which are of vital importance in following an ethical and accountable
          process of visualization design <ptr target="#callaway_etal2020"/>; <ptr
            target="#dignazio_etal2020"/>; <ptr target="#hepworth_etal2018"/>. All described data
          management and network analysis was conducted in Python with metaknowledge <ptr
            target="#mclevey_etal2017"/> and NetworkX <ptr target="#hagberg_etal2008"/>.
          Visualization was performed with Gephi <ptr target="#bastian_etal2009"/>. </p>
        <div>
          <head>3.1 Data search and selection</head>
          <p>Data for the knowledge map came from Clarivate’s Web of Science database, selected for
            its accessibility despite known gaps in its coverage and because previous work suggests
            that it entails about 50% as much cleaning and curation time as Scopus and about 5% as
            much as Google Scholar <ptr target="#andres2009"/>; <ptr target="#harzing2015"/>; <ptr
              target="#meho_etal2007"/>. Though it would have been preferable to combine multiple
            datasets to get the broadest possible bibliometric survey of climate communication
            literature, there are significant practical challenges to combining relational citation
            data from different databases. We used a search query 
          	<code>(TS = (climat* NEAR chang* AND communicat*))</code> 
          	from a previous systematic review of climate communication,
            conducted by an expert in the field <ptr target="#moser2016"/>. This was intended to
            ensure that this knowledge map complemented previously accepted delineations of the
            climate communication field and would therefore hopefully be more trustworthy to members
            of the mapped research domain. Query-based data selection for any knowledge mapping
            study faces a trade-off between <term>recall</term> (getting every single relevant item)
            and <term>relevance</term> (making sure no single irrelevant item is included), and it
            is always a concern that excluded materials are not evenly distributed across the field
            in question. The Web of Science search yielded 5,934 results on July 31, 2020. </p>
          <p>One of the reasons data is not generally cleaned before analysis is the expectation
            that selecting and extracting the <term>giant component</term> (the largest set of
            connected nodes in a network) will filter papers that don’t belong (because they’ll be
            in disconnected communities). In the climate communication knowledge network, some
            combination of one-time participation by many researchers, the nebulous border between
            climate science, environmental science, and climate communication, and the broad
            application of some permutation of the terms <q>climate,</q>
            <q>communication,</q> and <q>change</q> in nearly every academic discipline meant that
            the giant component included many irrelevant items when constructed with the complete
            Web of Science data pull (<ref target="#figure01">Figure 1</ref>). </p>
          <p>We explored programmatic filtering strategies to prune the irrelevant data, but these
            all failed, to the point that it seemed much more time would be spent fine-tuning an
            algorithm specifically suited to disambiguating this one dataset than it would take to
            disambiguate it manually. Manual (human) review resulted in the removal of ~50% of the
            returned records (2,997 retained; 2,937 removed). Though in some ways it seemed alarming
            to remove half of the returned data, it also seemed misleading not to do so, because
            clearly irrelevant items (for example, papers about inter-model communication of climate
            signals, effects of climate change on insect pheromonal communication, and changes in
            workplace communication climates) distorted the visualized network (<ref
              target="#figure01">Figure 1</ref>). This highlights the impossibility of achieving an objective
            delineation of a particular research area from an unprocessed dataset and the need to
            rely on human judgment in data visualizations even at these early stages. This process
            of data preparation opens a knowledge mapping analysis up to perpetuating harm in two
            ways: first, that whether an algorithm or a human applies inclusion/exclusion criteria,
            some error is likely to occur, and second, that the underlying data does not adequately
            or equally represent the breadth of scholarship in a particular knowledge domain. To
            mitigate this, we added annotations to our final product (<ref target="#figure06">Figure 6</ref>)
            intended to guard against interpretation of the knowledge map as a complete picture of
            every possible research output in the climate communication space. </p>

          <head>3.2 Author name disambiguation</head>
          <p>Because we wanted to produce a knowledge map of collaboration patterns within climate
            communication scholarship, we projected the bibliometric data from Web of Science into a
            co-authorship network, where nodes are individual scholars and links are formed between
            them when they write papers together. To present a clear co-authorship network, it is
            necessary to disambiguate author names <ptr target="#fegley_etal2013"/>; <ptr
              target="#harzing2015"/>; <ptr target="#milojevic2013"/>; <ptr
              target="#strotmann_etal2012"/>. Co-authorship network analysis rests on the assumption
            that there is one node for everyone in the network, but in reality, names are frequently
            split (identifying a single author as multiple authors) or merged (collapsing multiple
            individuals into a single mega-researcher) <ptr target="#harzing2015"/>; <ptr
              target="#milojevic2013"/>. This can be due to inconsistent name spelling (for example
            the occasional omission of a middle initial), name change (for example due to a change
            in marital status), or database limitations and errors. Merged names are such a problem
            in bibliometrics that many databases contain entries for mega-authors who appear to
            publish multiple papers every day for years on end <ptr target="#harzing2015"/>.
            Clearly, the process of author name disambiguation has enormous ramifications for whose
            contributions are legible or visible in a knowledge network, and whose are not. Recent
            efforts to use unique author identifiers such as ORCIDs may eventually solve this
            problem, but they are not yet used widely enough to offer a practical author
            disambiguation solution.</p>
          <p>Author network studies wishing to disambiguate name data face a choice: implement
            algorithmic disambiguation strategies of varying complexity or undertake the
            time-consuming process of manually disambiguating the data. Simple algorithmic
            disambiguation is the norm, partly due to research suggesting that more computationally
            or time intensive approaches don’t improve results <ptr target="#milojevic2013"/>.
            Manual disambiguation is rare, though not unheard of; some find the time investment
            comparable to designing an algorithm, at least for up to about five thousand authors
              <ptr target="#burckhardt2017"/>; <ptr target="#fegley_etal2013"/>; <ptr
              target="#strotmann_etal2009"/>. </p>
          <p>The simplest algorithmic approaches are <q>first initial</q> disambiguation and <q>all
              initial</q> disambiguation. A pattern of initials is selected and all names are
            converted to match this pattern (for example, a full author name being converted to
            first initial and full last name). First initial disambiguation is the most common but
            also the most fraught: split individuals change network statistics less overall than do
            merged authors, and first initial disambiguation’s weakness is that it merges many
            authors <ptr target="#fegley_etal2013"/>; <ptr target="#strotmann_etal2012"/>. When
            authors are merged, their actual networks combine with others, sometimes resulting in
            the appearance of bridges connecting areas of the network that are actually distinct and
            making the mega-author seem like an important synthesizer of knowledge at a level that
            may not reflect reality <ptr target="#kim_etal2016"/>. Networks containing many merged
            individuals become smaller, less transitive, denser, more productive, and more connected
            (or more frequently connected) than they actually are, and will have larger giant
            components <ptr target="#kim_etal2014b"/>; <ptr target="#kim_etal2016"/>; <ptr
              target="#fegley_etal2013"/>. Initials-based disambiguation has been shown to introduce
            error into the entire gamut of statistics describing network structure and function,
            including those assessing author productivity, collaboration patterns, and cohesion <ptr
              target="#kim_etal2016"/>. Given the potential for harm inherent in miscalculating
            network statistics, both for evaluated individuals and for their broader knowledge
            community, we explored and visualized networks resulting from each of these
            disambiguation approaches so that we could make a clear determination of which strategy
            to use.</p>

            <figDesc>Four examples of disambiguated datasets where each Giant Component is compared
              directly with the full coauthor network. Each example of the full network is a
              circular arrangement of uncoupled light gray nodes with the brightly colored giant
              component laid overtop. Each example of the disambiguated data shows only the linked
              nodes.</figDesc>
          </figure>
          <p>Very different pictures emerged when each of the four different disambiguation
            approaches was applied (<ref target="#figure02">Figure 2</ref>). Though the overall network is
            smaller, many more nodes are included in the <q>First Initial</q> giant component than
            in <q>Full Name,</q> with <q>All Initials</q> falling somewhere in the middle. <ref
              target="#table01">Table 1</ref> provides quantitative support for these visual impressions. The
            number of authors contained in the giant component and the number of links connecting
            them changes significantly, by hundreds of individuals in the overall network and by
            over a thousand individuals in the associated giant components. Most notable in <ref
              target="#figure02">Figure 2</ref> is the fact that a salient feature of the manually disambiguated
            network, the bridge that spans from the left to the right of the giant component without
            traveling through the core, is not as clear in any of the networks generated from
            algorithmic disambiguation. But each of the networks appears individually reasonable,
            both from a network standpoint and a climate communication one. This makes it clear how
            researchers could (wittingly or unintentionally) select a disambiguation strategy that
            conveys a particular message. In this case, the <q>First Initial</q> network suggests
            thriving exchange and dense connection, <q>All Initials</q> offers better-defined
            clusters, and <q>Full Name</q> presents neat divisions between communities with just a
            few bridges between. It’s therefore important to be attentive to how interpretations may
            be influenced by visualization choices. </p>

          <p>Studies do not agree about which algorithmic disambiguation method is most effective at
            approximating the true network, though it’s been shown that between 8-39% of individuals
            in a dataset can be affected by merging or splitting <ptr target="#kim_etal2016"/>; <ptr
              target="#milojevic2013"/>. Estimates to quantify the amount of error often use
              <q>First Initial</q> disambiguation as the lower limit of the range of error on the
            actual number of authors in the database, and , <q>All Initials</q> as the upper limit,
            but they do not usually visualize the resulting differences to see how more qualitative
            structural conclusions may be affected. Clearly, the success of a disambiguation
            strategy depends on meta-characteristics of the dataset itself. The most common example
            of this is the near-impossibility of using initials-based disambiguation on datasets
            with high participation from individuals with Chinese or Korean last names <ptr
              target="#harzing2015"/>; <ptr target="#kim_etal2014b"/>; <ptr target="#kim_etal2016"
            />; <ptr target="#milojevic2013"/>; <ptr target="#strotmann_etal2012"/>.</p>
          <p>Even if it were possible to estimate the average distortion effects from different
            approaches to algorithmic disambiguation, it would be hard to predict which authors
            would be the most affected, meaning that analysis choices may have differential effects
            on different communities of scholars. Even if only a small percentage of error is
            introduced overall, that error may be distributed unevenly across the network, raising
            real concerns about whose and what types of contributions may be emphasized or obscured.
              <ref target="#figure03">Figure 3</ref> shows how different authors’ network positions are affected
            by different disambiguation strategies: node size changes (e.g., the node for S.
            Dessai), as does community membership (e.g., the node for S. Lewandowsky) and the
            visibility of underlying data errors (e.g., two nodes for E. Maibach linked together).
            The relative importance of nodes acting as brokers (large nodes here have high
            betweenness, one measure of a brokering role) changes too, and lumped or split authors
            open or close network pathways and affect community delineation. <ref target="#table02"
            >Table 2</ref> shows how overall rankings of authors change order as nodes are merged or split. </p>
          <p>If the goal of the network analysis is to be useful to the people represented, this
            sort of error can’t be waved away as acceptable distortion, and the only way to
            understand how such error affects an analysis is to visualize it and see. Though author
            disambiguation is rarely framed as an ethical issue, it clearly is one, as
            disambiguation strategies affect not only author rankings but the structural roles of
            authors in a network and the apparent structural function of the knowledge domain as a
            whole. In this case, we mitigated potential harm caused by inaccurate evaluations by
            building our final visualization on the manually disambiguated author dataset (though
            it’s important to note, there are almost certainly errors even in this carefully curated
            dataset). However, most knowledge mapping projects will not have the benefit of a
            manually disambiguated dataset to compare to. In those cases, the best thing to do is
            understand the potential consequences of choosing different disambiguation strategies
            and avoid over-interpreting the results.</p>

          <head>3.3 Network layout</head>
          <p>Several strategies have been developed for transforming networks into 2D visualizations
              <ptr target="#leydesdorff2014"/>; <ptr target="#petrovich2020"/>. As with geographic
            maps, all strategies simplify and therefore distort certain aspects of the underlying
            data, meaning they should be undertaken intentionally and transparently to mitigate
            potential harm <ptr target="#monmonier1991"/>; <ptr target="#welles_etal2015"/>. In this
            study, we applied graph theory informed transformations, which use relationship strength
            to infer the distance between nodes <ptr target="#leydesdorff_etal2011"/>. Layout
            algorithms use physics calculations to position nodes optimally, by first distributing
            them randomly in space and then balancing the repulsion between them, the attraction
            caused by links, and the gravity of the center of the graph, until an equilibrium is
            reached <ptr target="#denooy_etal2011"/>; <ptr target="#fruchterman_etal1991"/>. Because
            the resulting network maps have similar intuitive visual force to a geographic map, they
            are subject to being produced and accepted uncritically.</p>
          <p>Both researchers and viewers can be misled by network layouts that suggest patterns
            where there are none <ptr target="#denooy_etal2011"/>. For example, the <term>Force
              Atlas layout</term> allows longer edges between nodes than does the <term>Fruchterman
              Reingold layout</term>, which emphasizes cohesion <ptr target="#leydesdorff_etal2011"
            />. <ref target="#figure04">Figure 4</ref> illustrates how this changes the visual impression of the
            climate communication research network. Further complicating this is the possibility to
            mix and match layouts to achieve results that are different again from either layout
            method alone. Ultimately, it may be necessary to manually edit data to avoid misleading
            patterns such as criss-crossing links or overlapping nodes that could suggest incorrect
            inferences about network topology <ptr target="#welles_etal2015"/>. However, manual
            edits may distort embedded visual conventions which are based on math, such as distance
            representing dissimilarity, and so again these should be undertaken cautiously <ptr
              target="#stephens_etal2016"/>. </p>
          <p>For the climate communication knowledge map, we selected a layout produced by the Force
            Atlas algorithm and performed a small amount of editing to space out overlapping nodes
            and make the community size more interpretable to the human eye. In this case, our
            decision was less about mitigating potential harm and more about increasing
            understanding for viewers of the knowledge map while portraying the communities as
            legible groups of individuals. However, <ref target="#figure05">Figure 5</ref> makes it clear that
            some layouts will emphasize connectivity and cohesiveness, and others will emphasize
            distance, despite that they are views of the same set of nodes and relationships. This
            illustrates that there is no option to choose an objective view of a network dataset, so
            the onus is on the researcher to make layout choices intentionally, as these arguments
            can have consequences for individuals and communities depicted. It also shows that just
            like datasets, tools for visualizing data can make implicit arguments which must be
            considered carefully.</p>

              crossing. The bottom layout combines the stragegies of the top and middle layouts by
              separating color-coded connections first, and then rendering them as a dense, circular

          <head>3.4 Community detection</head>
          <p>After the network layout is complete, it is customary to divide the nodes into
            communities using algorithms such as Louvain community detection, a modularity
            maximization algorithm that identifies communities by finding groups of nodes sharing
            frequent connections within their group, but as few as possible connections to other
            communities <ptr target="#blondel_etal2008"/>. Even scientifically minded knowledge
            mappers tend to acknowledge that interpreting the results of a community detection
            algorithm is an iterative process, and as much an art as a science. Interpretation
            generally draws on non-network attributes (for example, researcher discipline) as well
            as network metrics like those in <ref target="#table01">Table 1</ref>, to explicate the identified
            community structure. In the climate communication dataset, traditional strategies like
            summarizing purely by author keywords were minimally successful, as single occurrences
            of keywords were the norm (e.g., one primary community had 511 author-provided keywords
            describing 240 published works, but 388 of the keywords were used only once).</p>
          <p>This illustrates the conundrum of categorization that is well-recognized in ethical
            visualization and data feminism: by placing nodes into groups, the knowledge map makes a
            strong argument that there is some inherent quality of those nodes that justifies their
            grouping, despite that the underlying data is not always so decisive. This is especially
            so when the network has been filtered to represent connections above a certain strength,
            such as authors that have collaborated at least twice, or papers that have been cited
            together at least ten times. This common practice eases the computational task of
            creating and analyzing the networks, but it also makes it easier to identify communities
            that seem much less interconnected than they actually are (or, conversely, give too much
            weight to connections which are strongly present based on the visualized logic, but
            which may be essentially meaningless in the real world). <ref target="#figure05">Figure 5</ref>
            demonstrates how clear communities become at different levels of filtering, offering
            another example of how seemingly technical choices made in knowledge network design make
            implicit arguments. Another way of saying this is that determinations of exactly what is
            signal and what is noise in a network dataset are subjective considerations. </p>
          <p>In the climate communication knowledge map, we attempted to moderate the visual force
            of the communities by providing extensive annotations on their composition, and by
            resisting giving the three <q>core</q> communities particular names that were simply not
            justified by their heterogeneous compositions. </p>

          <head>3.5 Ground truth or trust?</head>
          <p>Each of the previous sections has emphasized the constructedness of knowledge maps,
            demonstrating that every step in the production of a knowledge map entails subjective
            and value-laden judgments which foreground or obscure elements of the depicted knowledge
            domain and therefore run the risk of perpetuating different types of harm. Issues of
            data selection, disambiguation, layout, and community detection processes combine to
            make it difficult to validate or ground truth a network map. But it’s worth asking,
            given the constructedness and subjectivity of a knowledge map, whether a ground truth
            would even be meaningful. </p>
          <p>The traditional sense of a ground truth – going to a particular spot on a landscape and
            confirming that reality matches modeled values – is probably going to fail for knowledge
            maps. Though they should absolutely be intelligible to members of the depicted
            community, it is unlikely that every scholar would agree with the version of reality
            presented in the chart. Knowledge maps approximate a consensus about knowledge structure
            based on authorship and citation data, but this is knowledge on average. Individual
            experts may or may not agree, and the knowledge map may not be a good representation of
            an individual’s subjective experience of the knowledge domain, or even of the specific
            connections depicted based on their existing co-author relationships, since a network
            represents a diversity of connections as a single type of link. In the absence of a
            ground truth, perhaps a more important question to ask is how a network visualization
            can become trustworthy.</p>
          <p>While building the climate communication knowledge map, we learned that the only way to
            produce trustworthy maps is to have attention to ethical dimensions and potentials for
            harm at every step of the design process. This can be accomplished with vigilance for
            implicit arguments made by customary analysis choices and tools, with the inclusion of
            annotations and caveats in the visualization, and by remaining constantly aware that any
            purely data-driven view of a knowledge domain will be partial. The key utility of
            ethical visualization perspectives in the development of the climate communication
            knowledge map was to push back against our worries that we were somehow biasing our
            results in an inappropriate way by making these human-driven choices surrounding data
            curation and presentation. In the next section, we offer suggestions for how to apply
            these perspectives in future knowledge mapping projects. </p>

        <head>4. Strategies for ethical and effective visualization of knowledge networks</head>
        <p>Ethical and effective visualizations of knowledge networks must inspire trust in two key
          groups: people depicted in the knowledge map, and people using the map to acquire
          knowledge or make decisions. We draw on our experience in the climate communication
          knowledge mapping project and on previous work on ethical visualization in the digital
          humanities to offer ethical visualization strategies for network data and knowledge maps
          specifically. This represents an important step in <q> downscaling </q> recommendations
          from ethical visualization and data feminism to demonstrate their application and utility
          in specific projects. We encourage readers to consult other literature on ethical
          visualization (especially <ptr target="#lima2011"/> and <ptr target="#garilova_etal2019"/>
          for discussions of additional visual conventions specific to the design of network
          charts.</p>
        <p>Our recommendations are intended to assist researchers in balancing tensions between
          quantitative and qualitative, and objective and subjective, aspects of knowledge mapping.
          We advocate a humanistic approach to visualization design, recognizing that working with
          this type of data successfully requires coupling quantitative fluency with the more
          humanities-oriented practice of contextualizing findings, and tolerance for and
          transparency around the trial-and-error approach necessary to creating a useful product
            <ptr target="#conway2014"/>; <ptr target="#dragga_etal2011"/>; <ptr
            target="#drucker2011"/>; <ptr target="#hepworth_etal2018"/>; <ptr
            target="#stephens_etal2016"/>. As the climate communication knowledge mapping project
          illustrates, a purely quantitative, purely objective depiction of a knowledge network is
          neither possible nor particularly useful. </p>
        <div  xml:id="four-one">
          <head>4.1 Understand knowledge maps as both process and product</head>
          <p>Knowledge maps have a dual purpose: they are a tool used in studying knowledge domains,
            and a visual artifact representing those domains. The first focuses primarily on
            creating knowledge and insight for the immediate researchers involved and can be best
            understood as a process. The second focuses primarily on assisting others in gaining
            insight into the mapped domain, and can be best understood as a product. However, as the
            climate communication knowledge map makes clear, these two types of knowledge mapping
            are generally impossible to separate: knowledge mapping proceeds in an iterative and
            exploratory fashion, where impressions gained in experimenting with different analyses
            and layouts inform the final version of the map, and where the layout of the map informs
            a researcher’s conclusions. Franco Moretti described this as a 
            <quote rend="inline">heterogeneity of problem and solution</quote> in distant reading; we argue that the
            same applies to knowledge mapping <ptr target="#moretti2007"/>. In the case of the
            climate communication knowledge map, the desire to create a particular kind of product
            (a useful and trustworthy knowledge map to support collaboration and discovery in a
            particular knowledge community) influenced the process of data preparation and analysis,
            for example leading to the decision to manually disambiguate data, which in turn
            affected analytical results. </p>
          <p>The intertwining of product and process does not guarantee that a good product will
            follow from a sound process (or that an apparently good product was generated with a
            sound process). For example, we often observe knowledge maps developed primarily to
            facilitate analysis being included in research reports. In these cases, researchers have
            generally extracted meaning from the visualization to support their interpretations.
            However, without adjustment, these visualizations often remain incomprehensible to those
            outside the research team. We suggest that ethical and effective knowledge mappers
            should remain aware of how process and product intertwine in a knowledge mapping
            project, and how this can both enhance and trouble the process of producing a knowledge
            map for use beyond the research team. </p>

        <div>
          <head>4.2 Translate and annotate knowledge maps</head>
          <p>Anecdotally, we learned while developing and sharing the climate communication
            knowledge maps that despite their visual and rhetorical force, viewers are often unsure
            how to understand these charts. We also learned that, once viewers felt they understood
            what the nodes and connections and color scheme meant, they quickly formed and held onto
            inaccurate impressions about what the chart conveyed. While it is not possible to
            moderate the rhetorical force of a visualization entirely, it is possible to embed
            guidelines and caveats for interpretation that guide viewers towards the interpretations
            intended by the visualization designer. This does not preclude the viewer reaching their
            own conclusions; rather, it fulfills the promise of a knowledge map as a communication
            tool. Ethical and effective knowledge mappers should take the opportunity to translate
            and annotate a knowledge map, asking themselves which insights have the most rhetorical
            force, and which may need to be moderated with caveats. This is why the knowledge maps
            presented in this paper include textual information about their genesis and
            interpretation. </p>

          <head>4.3 Account for implicit arguments made by network theory, tools, and data
            sources</head>
          <p>A common practice in data feminism is to disclose the positionality of the researchers,
            so that viewers of the resulting data visualizations might understand how researchers’
            perspectives and life experiences may influence their understandings of the phenomena
            portrayed. We encourage knowledge mappers to consider not just their own positionality,
            but the positionality of network theory, tools, and data sources when drawing
            conclusions from a knowledge mapping project.</p>
          <p>First, it is necessary to consider the implicit arguments made by networks themselves.
            A network chart necessarily conveys a message of connection, especially since
            unconnected elements are generally omitted from analysis. Network thinking is
            fundamentally structuralist, meaning that it privileges relationships over attributes
            and affords the system a level of agency that it may or may not have <ptr
              target="#conway2014"/>; <ptr target="#gouchenour2011"/>; <ptr target="#moretti2007"/>.
            A consequence of this structuralist lens is that disconnection is seen as undesirable,
            and distinctions between quality and quantity are often blurred <ptr
              target="#gouchenour2011"/>. The focus on quantitatively (but possibly not
            qualitatively) strong connections (after all, there are many ways to become connected in
            a coauthor network that do not necessarily represent close collaboration) extends to the
            way networks are generally depicted, showing nodes connected only above a certain link
            strength threshold (as in <ref target="#figure05">Figure 5</ref>). The assumption that weak
            connections are just noise to be removed, and that strong connections are the defining
            structural feature of a network, means this type of analysis may miss cutting-edge or
            non-standard knowledge patterns. </p>
          <p>Subsequently, it is important to disclose the tools used for analysis and, especially,
            for visualization. Because the visualization tools actively shape the conclusions of the
            analysis (<ref target="#four-one">as discussed in 4.1</ref>), it is important to be transparent about how this may
            have occurred even if the effects are not apparent to the research team <ptr
              target="#vangeenen_etal2020"/>. None of this threatens the utility of network analysis
            as a tool for understanding a system of related data, but it should serve as a reminder
            of network thinking’s assumptions, so they are not incorporated uncritically into a
            knowledge map. An ethical and effective knowledge mapper should be aware of inherent
            implications stemming from choices about the theory, tools, and data sources which feed
            into resulting visualizations. </p>

          <head>4.4 Consider impacts on people depicted</head>
          <p>Knowledge networks are often assumed to be exempt from privacy concerns because they
            are constructed from published works. It’s important to remember that a network
            (especially the co-author networks presented in this paper) is made up of individual
            people. Certain nodes may assume standout roles that wouldn’t be apparent in a list of
            search results or even in tabular data, and certain patterns of connection may occur
            that do not represent current relationships and collaborations. Because there is no
            objective way to characterize node roles or performance, or even which nodes truly
              <q>belong</q> in a network, caution is warranted in <q>calling out</q> specific people
            depicted, or associating merit with network position alone <ptr target="#furner2014"/>.
            It may sometimes be preferable to display anonymized data (for example by grouping nodes
            into communities) to guard against incorrect or harmful interpretations about
            individuals. </p>
          <p>On the other hand, it’s precisely the transparency and associated lack of anonymity
            that can make knowledge network tools useful. Laura Kati Corlew and her team relied on
            this in building a network mapping and knowledge discovery tool for climate workers in
            the Pacific Islands <ptr target="#corlew_etal2015"/>. The correct balance of privacy and
            publicity will need to be determined on a project-by-project basis. Asking questions
            about who benefits from the network depiction of participants can help navigate these
            tensions <ptr target="#conway2014"/>. In the case of the climate communication knowledge
            map, we felt that attention to data selection and disambiguation mitigated some concerns
            about privacy for network participants and so we labeled key nodes with names. Climate
            communicators are likely familiar with these scholars and can use them as landmarks to
            support orientation and sense-making while they interact with the knowledge map.</p>
          <p>As knowledge maps proliferate, they may be used increasingly for evaluation and
            analysis, and so an ethical and effective knowledge mapper should consider the potential
            ramifications of such a map having a life of its own after publication, and the possible
            agendas users might bring to interpretation of these visualizations, especially when
            choosing to use personally identifying data in a knowledge map. </p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <head>4.5 Put your cards on the table</head>
          <p>The final strategy for ethical and effective visualization of knowledge networks is
            inspired by data feminism’s maxim of showing one’s work <ptr target="#dignazio_etal2020"
            />. We encourage ethical and effective knowledge mappers to put their cards on the table
            alongside their produced visualizations. This means being completely transparent about
            what you did, why you did it, and how you did it, but also about what insights you
            identify or arguments you wish to make with your produced visualization. Work in ethical
            visualization and data feminism has shown real drawbacks to obscuring the work done to
            produce a data visualization, to attempting to let data speak for itself. Ethical and
            effective knowledge mappers must resist the temptation to keep analysis and
            interpretation behind the curtain, recognizing that doing so may hinder precisely the
            type of knowledge creation and discovery they are likely trying to support. </p>
          <p>The first way to put your cards on the table is to make analysis decisions transparent,
            as we have done in this article. This may be done in scholarly publications, or in
            metadata and annotations accompanying published visualizations. Like disclosing
            positionalities, articulating the strategies used to create visualization products
            reveals implicit impressions the designer may not have been aware of, but which could be
            important to viewers. Sharing this information safeguards transparency by aiding other
            researchers in creating similar maps, should they wish to. </p>
          <p>The second way to put your cards on the table is to tell the story you as the
            researcher see in the visualization. What insight were you seeking that led you to build
            the knowledge map? Did you find evidence for it, or against it? Narratives explicate
            network structure and concepts in an intuitive way, guiding viewers to reasonable scales
            of interpretation and guarding against out-of-context presentations of the knowledge
            network. They can also shed light on what the system diagram on its own might not reveal
            clearly, such as a possible function of or reason for absent links between authors or
            communities. </p>
          <p>There is a fine line to walk here, given that the point of visual communication is
            simplicity. Over-annotating a visualization might make it harder to engage with. We
            attempted to address this in our final knowledge map (<ref target="#figure06">Figure 6</ref>) by
            providing a below-the-fold presentation of narrative context for the network. Other
            network projects, especially interactive ones, may discover additional ways to support
            the juxtaposition of narrative and network. </p>

        <head>5. Conclusion</head>
        <p>We began this paper with the observation that scholars have long been captivated by the
          quest to develop high-tech tools for information management and knowledge synthesis. From
          the vantage point of the 21st century, we recognize that the success of these tools is not
          simply a matter of technological progress, but one that requires ethical thought. Just as
          a network mapping platform like Gephi provides the technical tools for working with big
          network data, an ethical visualization framework provides the ethical tools for reducing
          the harm and increasing the impact of knowledge maps – essentially, for making them
          deliver on their promise of augmenting our perceptual abilities when faced with large and
          complex information spaces. In this paper, we have drawn on lessons learned in the climate
          communication knowledge mapping project to offer strategies for ethical and effective
          visualizations of knowledge networks. This approach acknowledges the potential for harm
          that comes with such visualizations and works actively to mitigate it. Taking an ethical
          approach to knowledge mapping is vital because the choices made in such an analysis
          determine whose and which contributions are ultimately legible. </p>
        <p>We have attempted to provide guidelines for knowledge mappers seeking to support users in
          synthesizing and selecting meaningful insights from the mapped domain. Our recommendations
          balance tensions between qualitative and quantitative and objective and subjective aspects
          of knowledge mapping. They demonstrate the importance of critical practices in the
          development of knowledge maps, illustrate the intertwined nature of analysis and results
          in such projects, and emphasize the constructedness of the visualization. We show the only
          way to produce an effective knowledge map is to produce an ethical one, which requires
          attention to the ways trust and accountability can be produced at every step of analysis
          and production.</p>
        <p>This framework for ethical visualization of knowledge networks contributes to early
          conversations about a feminist bibliometrics and demonstrates the direct relevance of
          digital humanities tools to work carried out across diverse other fields. Connecting
          bibliometrics literature with digital humanities discourse invites more qualitative and
          interpretive perspectives into bibliometric knowledge mapping, demonstrating that the
          data-centric and science-focused techniques frequently applied to knowledge network
          visualization may fail to produce a useful and impactful portrait of a knowledge domain
          without attending to these ethical concerns. A central purpose of this paper is to offer a
          clear example of the utility of a critical approach to knowledge mapping in a traditional
          knowledge mapping project. </p>
        <p>The idea of separating wheat from chaff is a common trope in knowledge mapping. While
          knowledge mapping can absolutely facilitate discovery of relevant or applicable knowledge,
          assuming this is its key strength overlooks its real potential. Essentially, a
          system-level depiction may provoke a reassessment of what is wheat and what is chaff, and
          recognition that these designations are situation-dependent. As knowledge production
          increases and we continue to rely on quantitative and visual tools to help us navigate
          information spaces, it may be best to abandon the threshing trope and instead adopt a more
          kaleidoscopic model of knowledge mapping’s goals. Knowledge maps provide meaningful and
          multipurpose ways for individuals to explore a knowledge domain, and different individuals
          may need to turn the kaleidoscope in unique ways to find useful or compelling information
          and explanations which gel with, and usefully complement, their own experiences of a
          knowledge network. </p>
