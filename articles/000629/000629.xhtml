                  <p> Knowledge mapping combines network analysis and data visualization to summarize research
                     domains and illustrate their structure. In this paper, we present a framework for
                     ethical
                     and effective visualization of knowledge networks, which we developed while building
                     a
                     knowledge map of climate communication research. Using the climate communication knowledge
                     map as an example, we highlight the practical and ethical challenges encountered in
                     creating such visualizations and show how they can be navigated in ways that produce
                     more
                     trustworthy and more useful products. Our recommendations balance tensions between
                     qualitative and quantitative and objective and subjective aspects of knowledge mapping.
                     They demonstrate the importance of critical practices in the development of knowledge
                     maps, illustrate the intertwined nature of analysis and results in such projects,
                     and
                     emphasize the constructedness of the resulting visualization. We argue that the only
                     way
                     to produce an effective knowledge map is to produce an ethical one, which requires
                     attention to the ways trust and accountability can be produced at every step of analysis
                     and production. This extends the literature on ethical visualization in digital humanities
                     projects by offering a clear example of the utility of a critical approach for a
                     traditional, science-oriented knowledge mapping project. </p>

                  <div class="ptext" id="p1">Scholars have long been captivated by the idea that knowledge generation is outpacing
                     their ability to keep up, necessitating creative techniques and solutions to organize,
                     manage, and access information. From scientist Vannevar Bush’s memex<a class="noteRef" href="#d4e221">[1]</a>
                     to futurist Richard Buckminster Fuller’s Geoscope,<a class="noteRef" href="#d4e226">[2]</a> researchers have envisioned
                     high-tech tools for information management and knowledge creation since before the
                     advent
                     of big data. Today, well into the era of hyperlinked text and geographic information
                     systems not unlike the miracle tools envisioned by 20th century inventors, making
                     knowledge on even very specific areas of scholarship tractable remains a complicated
                     challenge. As scholarly knowledge continues to grow, so does interest in quantitative
                     techniques for summary, survey, and synthesis of knowledge domains.</div>

                  <div class="ptext" id="p2">Knowledge mapping is one such survey and synthesis technique. It combines data
                     visualization and network analysis to depict large collections of information spatially,
                     as if they were a landscape viewed from above. Knowledge mapping is a general term
                     for an
                     analysis informed by and applied in multiple areas of scholarship, including information
                     science [<a class="ref" href="#borner2010">Börner 2010</a>], literature [<a class="ref" href="#moretti2007">Moretti 2007</a>], history
                     [<a class="ref" href="#graham_etal2015">Graham, Milligan, and Weingart 2015</a>], and bibliometrics [<a class="ref" href="#chen2016">Chen 2016</a>]. These
                     maps are at once analytical, managerial, and communicative: analytical because they
                     provide tests of network theories and because bibliometric data was one of the earliest
                     sources of big data for such analyses; managerial because they guide decision-making,
                     funding allocation, and evaluation; and communicative because they aim to support
                     discovery and guide hypothesis formation by depicting knowledge as a collaborative,
                     interlinked whole. Knowledge maps are simultaneously rhetorically powerful (because
                     they
                     make visual arguments) and ethically fraught (because visual arguments presented in
                     such
                     charts are often accepted as objective fact), but knowledge mapping techniques have
                     not
                     yet been brought into conversation with recent work in digital humanities surrounding
                     ethical visualization and data feminism [<a class="ref" href="#dignazio2019">D’Ignazio 2019</a>]; [<a class="ref" href="#dignazio_etal2020">D’Ignazio and Klein 2020</a>]; [<a class="ref" href="#hepworth2017">Hepworth 2017</a>]; [<a class="ref" href="#hepworth2020">Hepworth 2020</a>]. </div>

                     harm that is inherent to particular visualizations [<a class="ref" href="#hepworth_etal2018">Hepworth and Church 2018</a>].
                     Ethical visualization and data feminism require consideration of the whole data pipeline,
                     from acquisition to analysis to visualization, and attention to the ways in which
                     some
                     perspectives are marginalized, omitted, or elided [<a class="ref" href="#dignazio_etal2016">D’Ignazio and Klein 2016</a>]; [<a class="ref" href="#dignazio_etal2020">D’Ignazio and Klein 2020</a>]. Both traditions require not only acknowledging the
                     potential negative effects of a visualization or drawbacks of a particular dataset,
                     but
                     actively working to mitigate them in a way that increases understanding while minimizing
                     harm [<a class="ref" href="#cairo2014">Cairo 2014</a>]. Given nascent discussions in bibliometrics about the
                     potential harm perpetuated by uncritical application of bibliometric techniques for
                     evaluation, it is an important time to bring critical practices into conversations
                     about
                     knowledge mapping [<a class="ref" href="#bornmann2017">Bornmann 2017</a>]; [<a class="ref" href="#conway2014">Conway 2014</a>]; [<a class="ref" href="#donovan2019">Donovan 2019</a>]; [<a class="ref" href="#furner2014">Furner 2014</a>]; [<a class="ref" href="#rolf2021">Rolf 2021</a>]; [<a class="ref" href="#zuccala2016">Zuccala 2016</a>]. </div>

                  <div class="ptext" id="p4">In this paper, we demonstrate how principles of ethical visualization and data feminism
                     can be applied in the development of a knowledge map to produce a more trustworthy
                     and
                     more useful product. We do this by providing a detailed account of the path we followed
                     to
                     build a knowledge map of climate communication research, highlighting practical challenges
                     encountered in creating such a visualization and how ideas from ethical visualization
                     literature helped navigate them. Specifically, we: (1) demonstrate the importance
                     of
                     critical practices in the development of a complex type of chart, (2) illustrate the
                     intertwined nature of analysis and results in big data projects, and (3) take a first
                     step
                     toward a feminist bibliometrics informed by critical work in digital humanities. This
                     addresses a previously identified need for clear guidance on the visual communication
                     of
                     knowledge networks [<a class="ref" href="#conway2014">Conway 2014</a>]; [<a class="ref" href="#garilova_etal2019">Gavrilova, Kudryavstev, and Grinberg 2019</a>]. It has
                     relevance for digital humanists working with knowledge networks and bibliometricians
                     seeking practical strategies for mitigating harmful externalities of evaluative
                     bibliometrics. It also enriches ongoing conversations in the digital humanities about
                     ethical visualization and data feminism with examples of how frequently ethical choices
                     arise in a data visualization project. </div>

                  <div class="ptext" id="p5">Ultimately, we emphasize the constructedness of these types of visualizations, showing
                     why a purely quantitative, purely objective depiction of a knowledge network is neither
                     possible nor particularly useful. We argue that the best way to produce an effective
                     knowledge map is to produce an ethical one, which requires attention to the ways trust
                     and
                     accountability can be produced at every step of analysis and production. </div>

                     dangerously totalizing “god trick,” but it can in fact be understood as a concept
                     gesturing at the positionality and situatedness of all knowledge, and the necessity
                     of
                     combining multiple partial perspectives to understand a system [<a class="ref" href="#haraway1988">Haraway 1988</a>]; [<a class="ref" href="#dignazio2019">D’Ignazio 2019</a>]. Sociologists James A. Evans and Jacob G. Foster define
                     metaknowledge as the result of “critical scrutiny of what is known,
                     how, and by whom” and suggest that we might best understand what metaknowledge is
                     by thinking about what we, as individual scholars with particular trainings, career
                     paths,
                     and expertise, think about as we read a journal article in order to “index a broader context of ideas, [scholars], and disciplines” – the kind of
                     knowledge gained from being a participant in a system through time [<a class="ref" href="#evans_etal2011">Evans and Foster 2011</a>, 721]; [<a class="ref" href="#kwan2002">Kwan 2002</a>]. Knowledge maps offer an
                     alternative way to gain a similar kind of qualitative understanding via quantitative
                     techniques, affording viewers an intuitive summary of a large collection of information

                     or diagnostic-style logic, where experts may arrive intuitively at a conclusion based
                     on
                     partial information combined with their existing understanding of the system and situation
                     at hand, and where knowledge may be generated instead of simply synthesized [<a class="ref" href="#brooke2017">Brooke 2017</a>]; [<a class="ref" href="#douven2017">Douven 2017</a>]; [<a class="ref" href="#graham_etal2015">Graham, Milligan, and Weingart 2015</a>]. </div>

                     maps act as a tool which – just like regular maps of landscapes – are useful for sharing
                     information, for planning where to go and how to get there, for noticing patterns
                     or

                     knowledge and specific pieces of information and evidence, an ability which has been

                     present it as knowledge, while also emphasizing the incredible utility of this form

                     created network visualizations to reveal (dis)connections in geoengineering knowledge,

                     tradition of science mapping, a kind of knowledge mapping undertaken by computer
                     scientists and network analysts. Science mapping uses bibliometric data to reveal
                     the
                     structure of a knowledge domain by creating networks of papers or authors linked by
                     citations or collaborations. However, despite having domain expertise in climate
                     communication and fluency in network analysis techniques (often considered the ideal
                     for
                     this type of project), we immediately ran into ethical and practical challenges that
                     were
                     not well addressed in the science mapping literature, perhaps because too much emphasis
                     is
                     placed on the objectivity of network maps, the assumed impartiality of algorithmic
                     curation, and the potential of data speaking for itself [<a class="ref" href="#conway2014">Conway 2014</a>]; [<a class="ref" href="#dignazio2019">D’Ignazio 2019</a>]; [<a class="ref" href="#dignazio_etal2020">D’Ignazio and Klein 2020</a>]; [<a class="ref" href="#hepworth2020">Hepworth 2020</a>]; [<a class="ref" href="#white_etal1998">White and McCain 1998</a>]; [<a class="ref" href="#yang_etal2016">Yang et al. 2016</a>]. In our project, limited technological resources necessitated static depictions of
                     the
                     knowledge network, data quality precluded purely algorithmic curation, and it was
                     frequently unclear how fundamental tasks like disambiguation and layout should be
                     approached when the goal was to create a useful knowledge map (instead of just to
                     arrive
                     at an analytical result). In this section, we describe in detail the challenges
                     encountered in building the climate communication knowledge map and point out how

                  <div class="ptext" id="p11">Perhaps because of the impact of scientific approaches to visualization on knowledge
                     mapping, a significant amount of data in knowledge mapping projects is not pre-processed
                     before it is visualized. It is thought that network analysis itself controls for any
                     errors or ambiguities in the underlying data [<a class="ref" href="#chen2016">Chen 2016</a>]. If ambiguities do
                     exist in the network map, conventional wisdom holds that resulting irregularities
                     cancel
                     each other out, and overall conclusions are not affected [<a class="ref" href="#fegley_etal2013">Fegley and Torvik 2013</a>];
                     [<a class="ref" href="#white_etal1998">White and McCain 1998</a>]. We did not find this to be the case in our knowledge
                     map, especially when imagining how it might be useful and trustworthy for climate
                     communicators. If the first thing a user notices when looking at a knowledge map is
                     a data
                     error (such as a single leading scholar being split into multiple author nodes), it
                     cannot
                     be expected that the user will trust other elements of the knowledge map. Given that
                     the
                     point of a knowledge map is to support reasonable inferences about the structure and
                     function of the research domain, it is a serious problem if data issues affect
                     interpretation. Engineer Jinseok Kim’s research reveals the nature and extent of factors
                     that distort knowledge maps [<a class="ref" href="#kim_etal2014a">Kim, Kim, and Diesner 2014</a>]; [<a class="ref" href="#kim_etal2014b">Kim et al. 2014</a>]; [<a class="ref" href="#kim_etal2016">Kim and Diesner 2016</a>]; [<a class="ref" href="#kim2019">Kim 2019</a>].

                     studying network processes can be profound when data visualizations uncritically display
                     conclusions that may be based on irregularities in the data, and when funding decisions
                     are made based on this data. As a result, the bulk of our paper focuses on data
                     processing, and the ethical considerations that may be glossed over when the network

                        delineation of a particular research area from an unprocessed dataset and the need
                        to
                        rely on human judgment in data visualizations even at these early stages. This process
                        of data preparation opens a knowledge mapping analysis up to perpetuating harm in
                        two
                        ways: first, that whether an algorithm or a human applies inclusion/exclusion criteria,
                        some error is likely to occur, and second, that the underlying data does not adequately
                        or equally represent the breadth of scholarship in a particular knowledge domain.

                        individuals into a single mega-researcher) [<a class="ref" href="#harzing2015">Harzing 2015</a>]; [<a class="ref" href="#milojevic2013">Milojevic 2013</a>]. This can be due to inconsistent name spelling (for example
                        the occasional omission of a middle initial), name change (for example due to a change
                        in marital status), or database limitations and errors. Merged names are such a problem
                        in bibliometrics that many databases contain entries for mega-authors who appear to
                        publish multiple papers every day for years on end [<a class="ref" href="#harzing2015">Harzing 2015</a>].
                        Clearly, the process of author name disambiguation has enormous ramifications for
                        whose
                        contributions are legible or visible in a knowledge network, and whose are not. Recent
                        efforts to use unique author identifiers such as ORCIDs may eventually solve this
                        problem, but they are not yet used widely enough to offer a practical author
                        disambiguation solution.</div>

                     <div class="ptext" id="p17">Author network studies wishing to disambiguate name data face a choice: implement
                        algorithmic disambiguation strategies of varying complexity or undertake the
                        time-consuming process of manually disambiguating the data. Simple algorithmic
                        disambiguation is the norm, partly due to research suggesting that more computationally
                        or time intensive approaches don’t improve results [<a class="ref" href="#milojevic2013">Milojevic 2013</a>].
                        Manual disambiguation is rare, though not unheard of; some find the time investment
                        comparable to designing an algorithm, at least for up to about five thousand authors

                     <div class="ptext" id="p18">The simplest algorithmic approaches are “first initial” disambiguation and “all
                        initial” disambiguation. A pattern of initials is selected and all names are
                        converted to match this pattern (for example, a full author name being converted to
                        first initial and full last name). First initial disambiguation is the most common
                        but
                        also the most fraught: split individuals change network statistics less overall than
                        do
                        merged authors, and first initial disambiguation’s weakness is that it merges many
                        authors [<a class="ref" href="#fegley_etal2013">Fegley and Torvik 2013</a>]; [<a class="ref" href="#strotmann_etal2012">Strotmann and Zhao 2012</a>]. When
                        authors are merged, their actual networks combine with others, sometimes resulting
                        in
                        the appearance of bridges connecting areas of the network that are actually distinct
                        and
                        making the mega-author seem like an important synthesizer of knowledge at a level
                        that
                        may not reflect reality [<a class="ref" href="#kim_etal2016">Kim and Diesner 2016</a>]. Networks containing many merged
                        individuals become smaller, less transitive, denser, more productive, and more connected
                        (or more frequently connected) than they actually are, and will have larger giant
                        components [<a class="ref" href="#kim_etal2014b">Kim et al. 2014</a>]; [<a class="ref" href="#kim_etal2016">Kim and Diesner 2016</a>]; [<a class="ref" href="#fegley_etal2013">Fegley and Torvik 2013</a>]. Initials-based disambiguation has been shown to introduce
                        error into the entire gamut of statistics describing network structure and function,
                        including those assessing author productivity, collaboration patterns, and cohesion
                        [<a class="ref" href="#kim_etal2016">Kim and Diesner 2016</a>]. Given the potential for harm inherent in miscalculating
                        network statistics, both for evaluated individuals and for their broader knowledge

                        disambiguation approaches so that we could make a clear determination of which strategy
                        to use.</div>

                        approaches was applied (<a href="#figure02">Figure 2</a>). Though the overall network is
                        smaller, many more nodes are included in the “First Initial” giant component than
                        in “Full Name,” with “All Initials” falling somewhere in the middle. <a href="#table01">Table 1</a> provides quantitative support for these visual impressions. The
                        number of authors contained in the giant component and the number of links connecting
                        them changes significantly, by hundreds of individuals in the overall network and
                        by
                        over a thousand individuals in the associated giant components. Most notable in <a href="#figure02">Figure 2</a> is the fact that a salient feature of the manually disambiguated
                        network, the bridge that spans from the left to the right of the giant component without
                        traveling through the core, is not as clear in any of the networks generated from
                        algorithmic disambiguation. But each of the networks appears individually reasonable,
                        both from a network standpoint and a climate communication one. This makes it clear
                        how
                        researchers could (wittingly or unintentionally) select a disambiguation strategy
                        that
                        conveys a particular message. In this case, the “First Initial” network suggests
                        thriving exchange and dense connection, “All Initials” offers better-defined
                        clusters, and “Full Name” presents neat divisions between communities with just a
                        few bridges between. It’s therefore important to be attentive to how interpretations
                        may
                        be influenced by visualization choices. </div>

                        at
                        approximating the true network, though it’s been shown that between 8-39% of individuals
                        in a dataset can be affected by merging or splitting [<a class="ref" href="#kim_etal2016">Kim and Diesner 2016</a>]; [<a class="ref" href="#milojevic2013">Milojevic 2013</a>]. Estimates to quantify the amount of error often use
                        “First Initial” disambiguation as the lower limit of the range of error on the
                        actual number of authors in the database, and , “All Initials” as the upper limit,
                        but they do not usually visualize the resulting differences to see how more qualitative
                        structural conclusions may be affected. Clearly, the success of a disambiguation
                        strategy depends on meta-characteristics of the dataset itself. The most common example
                        of this is the near-impossibility of using initials-based disambiguation on datasets
                        with high participation from individuals with Chinese or Korean last names [<a class="ref" href="#harzing2015">Harzing 2015</a>]; [<a class="ref" href="#kim_etal2014b">Kim et al. 2014</a>]; [<a class="ref" href="#kim_etal2016">Kim and Diesner 2016</a>]; [<a class="ref" href="#milojevic2013">Milojevic 2013</a>]; [<a class="ref" href="#strotmann_etal2012">Strotmann and Zhao 2012</a>].</div>

                        approaches to algorithmic disambiguation, it would be hard to predict which authors
                        would be the most affected, meaning that analysis choices may have differential effects
                        on different communities of scholars. Even if only a small percentage of error is
                        introduced overall, that error may be distributed unevenly across the network, raising
                        real concerns about whose and what types of contributions may be emphasized or obscured.
                        <a href="#figure03">Figure 3</a> shows how different authors’ network positions are affected
                        by different disambiguation strategies: node size changes (e.g., the node for S.
                        Dessai), as does community membership (e.g., the node for S. Lewandowsky) and the
                        visibility of underlying data errors (e.g., two nodes for E. Maibach linked together).
                        The relative importance of nodes acting as brokers (large nodes here have high
                        betweenness, one measure of a brokering role) changes too, and lumped or split authors
                        open or close network pathways and affect community delineation. <a href="#table02">Table 2</a> shows how overall rankings of authors change order as nodes are merged or split.

                        sort of error can’t be waved away as acceptable distortion, and the only way to
                        understand how such error affects an analysis is to visualize it and see. Though author
                        disambiguation is rarely framed as an ethical issue, it clearly is one, as
                        disambiguation strategies affect not only author rankings but the structural roles
                        of
                        authors in a network and the apparent structural function of the knowledge domain
                        as a
                        whole. In this case, we mitigated potential harm caused by inaccurate evaluations
                        by
                        building our final visualization on the manually disambiguated author dataset (though
                        it’s important to note, there are almost certainly errors even in this carefully curated
                        dataset). However, most knowledge mapping projects will not have the benefit of a
                        manually disambiguated dataset to compare to. In those cases, the best thing to do
                        is
                        understand the potential consequences of choosing different disambiguation strategies
                        and avoid over-interpreting the results.</div>

                        visualization and data feminism: by placing nodes into groups, the knowledge map makes
                        a
                        strong argument that there is some inherent quality of those nodes that justifies
                        their
                        grouping, despite that the underlying data is not always so decisive. This is especially
                        so when the network has been filtered to represent connections above a certain strength,
                        such as authors that have collaborated at least twice, or papers that have been cited
                        together at least ten times. This common practice eases the computational task of
                        creating and analyzing the networks, but it also makes it easier to identify communities
                        that seem much less interconnected than they actually are (or, conversely, give too
                        much

                        curation and presentation. In the next section, we offer suggestions for how to apply

                     this type of data successfully requires coupling quantitative fluency with the more

                        and a visual artifact representing those domains. The first focuses primarily on
                        creating knowledge and insight for the immediate researchers involved and can be best
                        understood as a process. The second focuses primarily on assisting others in gaining
                        insight into the mapped domain, and can be best understood as a product. However,
                        as the
                        climate communication knowledge map makes clear, these two types of knowledge mapping
                        are generally impossible to separate: knowledge mapping proceeds in an iterative and
                        exploratory fashion, where impressions gained in experimenting with different analyses
                        and layouts inform the final version of the map, and where the layout of the map informs
                        a researcher’s conclusions. Franco Moretti described this as a 
                        “heterogeneity of problem and solution” in distant reading; we argue that the
                        same applies to knowledge mapping [<a class="ref" href="#moretti2007">Moretti 2007</a>]. In the case of the
                        climate communication knowledge map, the desire to create a particular kind of product
                        (a useful and trustworthy knowledge map to support collaboration and discovery in
                        a
                        particular knowledge community) influenced the process of data preparation and analysis,
                        for example leading to the decision to manually disambiguate data, which in turn
                        affected analytical results. </div>

                        a
                        sound process). For example, we often observe knowledge maps developed primarily to
                        facilitate analysis being included in research reports. In these cases, researchers
                        have

                        how to understand these charts. We also learned that, once viewers felt they understood
                        what the nodes and connections and color scheme meant, they quickly formed and held
                        onto
                        inaccurate impressions about what the chart conveyed. While it is not possible to
                        moderate the rhetorical force of a visualization entirely, it is possible to embed
                        guidelines and caveats for interpretation that guide viewers towards the interpretations
                        intended by the visualization designer. This does not preclude the viewer reaching
                        their

                        A network chart necessarily conveys a message of connection, especially since
                        unconnected elements are generally omitted from analysis. Network thinking is
                        fundamentally structuralist, meaning that it privileges relationships over attributes
                        and affords the system a level of agency that it may or may not have [<a class="ref" href="#conway2014">Conway 2014</a>]; [<a class="ref" href="#gouchenour2011">Gochenour 2011</a>]; [<a class="ref" href="#moretti2007">Moretti 2007</a>].
                        A consequence of this structuralist lens is that disconnection is seen as undesirable,
                        and distinctions between quality and quantity are often blurred [<a class="ref" href="#gouchenour2011">Gochenour 2011</a>]. The focus on quantitatively (but possibly not
                        qualitatively) strong connections (after all, there are many ways to become connected
                        in
                        a coauthor network that do not necessarily represent close collaboration) extends
                        to the
                        way networks are generally depicted, showing nodes connected only above a certain
                        link
                        strength threshold (as in <a href="#figure05">Figure 5</a>). The assumption that weak
                        connections are just noise to be removed, and that strong connections are the defining
                        structural feature of a network, means this type of analysis may miss cutting-edge
                        or
                        non-standard knowledge patterns. </div>

                        for visualization. Because the visualization tools actively shape the conclusions
                        of the
                        analysis (<a href="#four-one">as discussed in 4.1</a>), it is important to be transparent about how this may
                        have occurred even if the effects are not apparent to the research team [<a class="ref" href="#vangeenen_etal2020">van Geenen and Wieringa 2020</a>]. None of this threatens the utility of network analysis

                        (especially the co-author networks presented in this paper) is made up of individual
                        people. Certain nodes may assume standout roles that wouldn’t be apparent in a list

                        publicity will need to be determined on a project-by-project basis. Asking questions

                        as we have done in this article. This may be done in scholarly publications, or in
                        metadata and annotations accompanying published visualizations. Like disclosing
                        positionalities, articulating the strategies used to create visualization products
                        reveals implicit impressions the designer may not have been aware of, but which could
                        be
                        important to viewers. Sharing this information safeguards transparency by aiding other
                        researchers in creating similar maps, should they wish to. </div>

                        build
                        the knowledge map? Did you find evidence for it, or against it? Narratives explicate
                        network structure and concepts in an intuitive way, guiding viewers to reasonable
                        scales
                        of interpretation and guarding against out-of-context presentations of the knowledge

                        reveal
                        clearly, such as a possible function of or reason for absent links between authors

                  <div class="ptext" id="p47">We began this paper with the observation that scholars have long been captivated by
                     the
                     quest to develop high-tech tools for information management and knowledge synthesis.
                     From
                     the vantage point of the 21st century, we recognize that the success of these tools
                     is not
                     simply a matter of technological progress, but one that requires ethical thought.
                     Just as
                     a network mapping platform like Gephi provides the technical tools for working with
                     big
                     network data, an ethical visualization framework provides the ethical tools for reducing
                     the harm and increasing the impact of knowledge maps – essentially, for making them
                     deliver on their promise of augmenting our perceptual abilities when faced with large
                     and
                     complex information spaces. In this paper, we have drawn on lessons learned in the
                     climate
                     communication knowledge mapping project to offer strategies for ethical and effective
                     visualizations of knowledge networks. This approach acknowledges the potential for
                     harm
                     that comes with such visualizations and works actively to mitigate it. Taking an ethical
                     approach to knowledge mapping is vital because the choices made in such an analysis
                     determine whose and which contributions are ultimately legible. </div>

                     balance tensions between qualitative and quantitative and objective and subjective

                     the only
                     way to produce an effective knowledge map is to produce an ethical one, which requires

                     digital humanities tools to work carried out across diverse other fields. Connecting
                     bibliometrics literature with digital humanities discourse invites more qualitative

                     interpretive perspectives into bibliometric knowledge mapping, demonstrating that

                     without attending to these ethical concerns. A central purpose of this paper is to
                     offer a

                  <div class="ptext" id="p50">The idea of separating wheat from chaff is a common trope in knowledge mapping. While
                     knowledge mapping can absolutely facilitate discovery of relevant or applicable knowledge,
                     assuming this is its key strength overlooks its real potential. Essentially, a
                     system-level depiction may provoke a reassessment of what is wheat and what is chaff,
                     and
                     recognition that these designations are situation-dependent. As knowledge production
                     increases and we continue to rely on quantitative and visual tools to help us navigate
                     information spaces, it may be best to abandon the threshing trope and instead adopt
                     a more
                     kaleidoscopic model of knowledge mapping’s goals. Knowledge maps provide meaningful
                     and
                     multipurpose ways for individuals to explore a knowledge domain, and different individuals
                     may need to turn the kaleidoscope in unique ways to find useful or compelling information
                     and explanations which gel with, and usefully complement, their own experiences of
