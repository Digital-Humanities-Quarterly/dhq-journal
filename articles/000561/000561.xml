            <!--Include a brief abstract of the article-->
            <p>Citing and referencing is an important aspect of scholarship as it makes research
               processes retraceable and transparent. Over centuries citation practices have been
               optimized for print publications. However, the digital revolution and the increased
               scholarly output online provide new challenges. For instance, the physical form of
               the book which was the basis for citation styles in the past is replaces by different
               types of online resources of which only some resemble books. Another issue is that
               digital resources on the internet are not as durable as printed books that are
               distributed in multiple copies in libraries across the world. For scholarly citation
               this is a problem as a website referenced today, might not be available tomorrow or
               might have changed its address which is frequently used for referencing.  Editions,
               in print or digital, are supposed to be stable reference points for scholarly
               discourse as discussions the scholarly community engages today should still be
               reproducible in 50 or 100 years – as it is the case with printed scholarly editions
               from the 19th century. Consequently, assurance of long-term availability of resources
               and clarity of how and what to cite in a digital edition is vital. That the lack of
               providing this kind of assurance and information makes online resources less
               attractive for citation has been shown in a recently published survey using as a case
               study British History Online and Early English Books Online. The survey assessed if
               researchers prefer to cite print or digital resources and the results indicate that
               there is still a very strong <q>culture of non-citation</q> of electronic resources
               among students and researchers in the humanities. The authors of the study suggest
               that creators of web content can contribute to facilitate the citation of digital
               resources by providing recommendations on how to cite a resource and by having a
               solid permalink strategy <ptr target="#blaney2017" loc="46–7"/>.The following study
               tries to explore this topic further. After a brief introduction and discussion of the
               key issues of digital citation such as <q>broken links</q> and strategies to provide
               persistent identifiers for the citation and access of online content, the results of
               a survey of 100 digital scholarly editions will be presented. The survey focuses on
               citation recommendations provided and permalink strategies used by digital scholarly
               editions. In this context the paper will look at how permalink/PID strategies and
               citation recommendations can make digital editions better citable. A closer look will
               be taken at citation recommendations of selected editions in order to highlight
               possible solutions.</p>

            <p>Editions, in print or digital, have a prominent place in humanities research as they
               make primary sources accessible and are the foundation for scholarly argumentation in
               many disciplines. Allowing the unambiguous citation of an edited text is an important
               task of a scholarly edition since it makes research processes retraceable and
               transparent. This has not changed in the digital age, however, despite the digital
               medium posing new challenges for editors and users of scholarly digital editions
               (SDE) alike.</p>
            <p>The Institute for Documentology and Scholarly Editing (IDE) has developed a checklist
               to evaluate scholarly digital editions. Two items of this catalogue deal with the
               assessment of the citability of such editions: <list>
                  <item><label>1.2. Bibliographic identification of the reviewed SDE.</label> An SDE
                     should be identified in terms similar to traditional bibliographic
                     descriptions: a title, the responsible editors, other responsible persons and
                     institutions, the dates of its publication (initial, versions, last
                     modification), and the address (in terms of web-URL or other naming conventions
                     like DOI, URN or PURL) should all be evident. Any difficulties extracting such
                     information from the SDE should be remarked upon in the review. <ptr
                        target="#sahle2014" loc="1.2"/></item>
                  <item><label>4.8. Identification and citation.</label> Are there persistent
                     identifiers for the objects of the SDE? Which level of the content structure do
                     they address? Which resolving mechanisms and naming systems are used? Does the
                     SDE supply citation guidelines? <ptr target="#sahle2014" loc="4.8"/></item>
               </list></p>
            <p>The first quote from the catalogue is concerned with the possibility to extract
               suitable bibliographic data to cite an SDE correctly. It is important that the SDE
               should be identifiable in the same manner as traditional print publications. However,
               besides traditional bibliographic data such as the title, editor(s) and date of
               publication, the version or the date the digital object was last changed is also
               indicated and the Internet address is important for citation too. Two other crucial
               aspects of digital editions are mentioned in the second quote: does the SDE use
               persistent identifiers and does it provide citation guidelines for users? Print
               editing knew similar concepts: updated versions of a book are published as second,
               third and further subsequent editions, the ISBN is recognised as a persistent
               identifier and the title page as the location where all the bibliographic information
               can be found. When looking at digital editing however, updating an edition, providing
               persistent identifiers and bibliographic data for citation are not handled in a
               similar manner and pose new challenges. </p>

            <p><hi rend="bold">Persistent names.</hi> URLs are globally unique identifiers that
               could be used for persistent addressing of online resources <ptr
                  target="#bernerslee1998"/>. However, as a URL’s primary function is to locate
               resources, they do not guarantee that the information they present to stays the same
               over time or that the entire web page they point to will still be available in two,
               five, or ten years. The unreliability of URLs for citation is well known and causes
               problems for research in different disciplines <ptr target="#klein2014"/>. Permalink
               and Persistent Identifier (PID) strategies have been developed to ensure resources
               can be cited using names that are globally unique and stable over time <ptr
                  target="#arnold2017"/>. However, it must be emphasised that the stability of
               permalinks and PIDs is primarily an organisational challenge as the assigning
               institution must put policies in place for assignment, management, and maintenance of
               identifiers and ensure correct resolving <ptr target="#shafer1996"/>
               <ptr target="#brugman2009"/>. Consequently, persistence of online resources cannot be
               guaranteed without commitment. </p>
            <p><hi rend="bold">Versioning.</hi> Closely linked to stable addresses is the question
               of how to deal with changes of digital objects over time. A content provider may
               change the content of a website at any time and without any explicit indication of
               the changes <ptr target="#jones2016"/>. From a scholarly citation perspective, this
               causes several issues, the foremost of these is to the user who needs to cite a
               specific version of the webpage content as she consulted it. For instance, this is
               particularly true for users of legal texts the citations of which must refer to a
               determined version. This is also a relevant issue for scholarly publishing and the
               recent publication by Broyles has highlighted the relevance of this topic for the
               digital editing community <ptr target="#broyles2020"/>
               <ptr target="#burgermeister"/>. Critical editions are the basis of textual
               scholarship and constantly changing texts cannot be reliably cited. Wikipedia is an
               example of a website with constantly changing content, with every editing of an
               article resulting in a new version with a permalink. Wikipedia deals with this issue
               in the following way: The most recent authorized revision of an article can be
               accessed via a <term>canonical URL</term> that always points to the most recent,
                  <q>accepted</q> version of an article. However, older versions can still be
               accessed using their permalink which is also strongly recommended by Wikipedia
                  itself.<note>For more details see Wikipedia’s permalink strategy: <ref
                     target="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Permalink&amp;oldid=877394616"

                  Accessed: 01.02.2019. </note> When a user accesses an older version, a warning
               message appears indicating that newer versions of this article are
                  available.<note>For the Wikipedia permalink strategy see: <ref

               by providing a list of changes made to a document.<note><ref

                     10</ref>.</note> The benefit of this approach is that the editor(s) may provide
               a descriptive summary of changes, which provide additional information about the
               people involved, the parts of the documents that were effected, etc. and this can be
               as detailed as the editor(s) require it to be. However, a disadvantage is that it is
               very impractical to record all changes to a file in the TEI document and consequently
               older versions cannot be recovered using the TEI method alone.</p>
            <p><hi rend="bold">Granular citation.</hi> A citation should be as precise as possible
               to make it easier for a reader to address and verify the source. In academic papers
               and scholarly discussion, it is necessary to cite not only entire works but to be
               precise sub-entities such as the page numbers of a book or verse and the number of a
               poem. In the humanities, established granular citation methods are used to cite
               chapters, paragraphs, pages and lines of a print publication or manuscript. A
               frequently used example for canonical numbers is that of the books, chapters, and
               verses of the Bible. These entities can be used to cite passages of the Bible across
               different editions and translations which ensures, for instance, that John 3:16
                  (<quote rend="inline">For God so loved the world, that he gave...</quote>) can be
               found in any Bible version or translation under the same number.<note>As an example,
                  see the website bibleserver.com which aligns more than 40 bible versions using the
                  canonical verses. <ref target="https://www.bibleserver.com"
                     >https://www.bibleserver.com</ref> [12.10.2020] For a detailed introduction to
                  the problem with a focus on canonical citation in digital scholarly editions see:
                     <ref target="#bleier2021">Bleier (2021)</ref>.</note> One must distinguish
               between semantic numbers, which are content related (e.g. chapters of a book), and
               visual numbers, which are object related (e.g. folios and lines of a manuscript) <ptr
                  target="#kalvesmaki2014"/>. This requirement has not changed for online resources;
               however, the implementation of granular citation options is very different in a
               digital editing context. From a technical perspective, granular referencing means
               referring to individual resources within a website, using an URI, or to a place
               within an electronic resource, either by addressing a position (e.g. byte position or
               pixel in an image) or the relevant markup structure. For a digital edition editor, it
               is important to evaluate what kind of granular citation strategy is required. It can
               be argued that traditional forms of citation of a source text, such as canonical
               numbers, can and should be considered and implemented in a new digital edition. </p>
            <p><hi rend="bold">Citation practice.</hi> Several publications have pointed out that
               despite the availability of an increasing number of digital editions these are not
               being cited by the majority of students and researchers in the humanities who prefer
               to cite print publications instead <ptr target="#porter2013"/>

               <ptr target="#blaney2017"/>. Blaney and Siefring’s British History Online and Early
               English Books Online survey has shown that users are both concerned about the
               stability of digital resources and that they do not know how to cite digital
               resources correctly. They suggest that creators of web content can contribute to
               facilitate the citation of digital resources by providing recommendations on how to
               cite a resource and by implementing a solid permalink strategy <ptr
                  target="#blaney2017" loc="46–7"/>. The relevance of the topic is also highlighted
               by an article about a recent survey on the use researchers make of digital editions
               and their expectations. The authors report that participants indicated that the
               provision of suitable citation information is still a neglected issue <ptr
                  target="#franzini2019"/>. Consequently, clarity about how and what to cite in an
               SDE is vital information that should be communicated to a user. </p>

            <p>The following study attempts to explore this topic further. In a survey conducted by
               the author of this study, the citation recommendations and permalink strategies of
               670 digital editions, published between the 1990s and 2020, have been analysed. The
               primary goal of the survey was to collect data about how digital editions ensure
               citability of their content by: <list type="ordered">
                  <item>providing citation recommendations</item>
                  <item>ensuring the content can be cited with permalinks or PIDs </item>
                  <item>implementing a versioning strategy for its data</item>
               </list></p>
            <p>The quantitative analysis of the collected data will show developments that are,
               hopefully, not only representative for this sample, but applicable to the wider SDE
               community. In addition to the quantitative analysis, various citation strategies
               applied in different editing projects will be illustrated by taking a closer look at
               some of the editions in the list. The goal is to identify developments/strategies
               that are frequently used and which also appear to have proven value as effective
               solutions.</p>

                  by a digital paradigm in their theory, method and practice</quote>
               <ptr target="#sahle2016"/>. Following his own definition, Sahle has compiled a
               catalogue of 670 editions over the last two decades.<note>I received a copy of the
                  catalogue in XML on 11.5.2020. I am grateful to Patrick Sahle und Jana Klinger for
                  sharing the latest version of the catalogue with me.</note> Sahle included several
               important properties of the catalogued editions and some of them, such as date,
               subject, language, and the category <q>Edition source period,</q> were used for
               analysis purposes in this research. Figure 1 shows the distribution of these
               categories across Sahle’s catalogue. However, at the time of writing this article,
               the catalogue included only occasional information about the availability of
               permalinks or citation information (for 85 editions). Therefore, all 670 editions had
               to be inspected to collect relevant data to assess their citability. </p>

            </figure>
            <p>The study of a temporal development was desired as an original assumption of the
               author was that more recently developed editions show a greater awareness for issues
               of citation and more frequently use permalinks or PIDs for their resources. However,
               there are two main problems in trying to assign a date to a digital edition. First,
               some digital editions do not clearly state a date of publication. In print publishing
               it is standard to have a date of publication printed either on the title page or on
               its reverse side. Digital editions do not always provide an official publication
               date, some provide a period of time when the edition was under development, but
               already available as alpha or beta version, and a few digital editions do not publish
               any dates or include only vague information about their development. Second, digital
               editions may have changed over time (and indeed many did) and their interface and
               structure might have looked different ten or fifteen years ago. Consequently, a
                  <title rend="quotes">How to cite?</title> page or a citation info pop-up may have
               been added more recently and may not have been present in an earlier release of the
               edition. To balance these issues and to facilitate a temporal comparison, the author
               divided the time between the 1990s (the period of development of the earliest edition
               in our data set) and 2020 into four periods: pre 2006, 2006-2010, 2011-2015, and
               2016-2020. Each edition was assigned to one of these four periods depending on the
               publication date listed in Sahle’s catalogue. The Internet Archive’s Wayback Machine
               was consulted for earlier editions (pre 2016) as it stores early snapshots of many
               editions. The URL of the snapshot that was consulted was recorded in the dataset for
               reference. By looking at an early snapshot it was often possible to see if a citation
               recommendation was already present earlier in the edition or if it was added later.
               For several editions no early snapshot was available, and I had to use a more recent
               snapshot or create a new one. </p>
            <p>Each edition in Sahle’s catalogue was inspected and the presence of citation
               information was evaluated as follows. Data about three categories was collected:
                  <list type="ordered">
                  <item>the presence of a citation recommendation with or without examples of how to
                     cite the edition or parts of it</item>
                  <item>the presence of PIDs or permalinks</item>
                  <item>the presence of any version information (of individual objects or the entire
                     edition) </item>
               </list></p>
            <p>What made the assessment slightly difficult, is that digital editions do not yet have
               an established structure. Consequently, the citation information could be found in
               different places. However, after looking through several editions, the author
               identified the most likely places to look for citation information: <list
                  type="ordered">
                  <item>Some editions have bibliographic data or an example of how to cite the
                     edition directly on the start page.</item>
                  <item>Some editions have their own citation page which can be accessed through a
                     link in the top navigation.</item>
                  <item>Occasionally the footer includes bibliographic data, citation recommendation
                     or a link to a page with citation information.</item>
                  <item>The <title rend="quotes">About (this edition),</title>
                     <title rend="quotes">Project,</title>
                     <title rend="quotes">Copyrights and permissions</title> pages sometimes contain
                     a section explaining how to cite the edition and parts of it.</item>
                  <item>The impressum may contain citation information.</item>
                  <item>Some older editions provide an entry on how to cite the edition in the FAQ
                     section.</item>
                  <item>Citation information could be available directly with the edited texts,
                     facsimile images, etc. </item>
                  <item>And finally, it should be mentioned that some editions use a system of
                        <q>implicit citation</q> by providing structural entities within an edition,
                     but no explicit recommendation on how they should be used for citation and
                     consequently they were also not counted as providing citation recommendations.
                  </item>
               </list></p>
            <p>This variety of options highlights a core problem for users of SDEs. When moving from
               one SDE to another, one cannot be sure to find the citation information in the same
               place or implemented in a similar way. As the collected data for this study is based
               on the observation of the author, it might be possible that hard to find permalinks
               or citation recommendations were overlooked and are not included in the dataset.
               However, this does not impact on the results of the study as the goal was to explore
               the citability of editions. Citation information that is hard to find and uncertainty
               about the availability of permalinks, reduce the chance that an edition will be cited
               correctly and, therefore, can be considered as <q>not present</q> or <q>not
                  relevant.</q></p>
            <p>The author looks at a <q>Citation recommendation</q> as a statement about how an
               edition or parts of it should be cited. Most editions that provide such information
               label it clearly. The dataset records not only the absence or the presence of such
               recommendations, it also includes a distinction between citation recommendations for
               the entire edition and recommendations for a more granular level of citation such as
               individual letters, individual webpages, images, chapters and paragraphs of a text.
               These categories are in concordance with the data collected in Sahle’s catalogue.
               Citation recommendations can have different levels of detail. Some may only suggest a
               permalink or an URL to be used, other editions include all necessary bibliographic
               data (editor, year of publication, etc.) for a citation and provide citation
               examples. Frequently, these citation examples follow a common citation style like MLA
               or APA. In addition to citation recommendations and the presence of examples, version
               information indicated by an SDE was also recorded. This information is very diverse
               and ranges from a simple version number for the entire edition (like an edition
               number in a book) to uniquely citable PIDs or permalink for all older versions of
               individual resources. The provision of a date of access is frequently found in
               citation recommendations. While the suggestion to include an access date in a
               citation shows awareness of the problem of changeability of an online resource, an
               access date is an indicator of an research process and does usually not correspond
               with an actual change to an online resource <ptr target="#broyles2020" loc="9"/>.
               Consequently, the inclusion of an access date in a citation recommendation has not
               been counted as versioning strategy. </p>
            <p>Finally, the provision of permalinks or PIDs was recorded. In the dataset either the
               name of the PID system (e.g. URN, DOI) is listed, or if an edition uses permalinks,
               or if neither was found. Another identifier which is usually used for print
               publications, the ISBN, is occasionally found in SDEs too, for instance in the <title
                  rend="italic">Jane Austen’s Fiction Manuscripts’ edition</title> or the <title
                  rend="italic">Vespasiano da Bisticci, Lettere</title>. The use of ISBNs is
               particularly frequent in earlier editions as they were used, for example, for CD-ROM
               publications. Even if ISBNs are usually not listed among the PID systems, they are
               globally unique identifiers and I have recorded them in my dataset among PIDs and
               permalinks. One edition uses ISBN-A which is a DOI based on an ISBN.<note>See the
                  footer of the edition <title rend="italic">Edizione digitale dell'Epistolario di
                     Alcide De Gasperi</title>. Available under: <ref

               editions use unique and persistent project IDs. For instance, the <title
                  rend="quotes">How to cite</title> page of the edition <title rend="italic">The
                  Diplomatic Correspondence of Thomas Bodley, 1585-1597</title> recommends that the
               persistent project IDs of each object should be included in any citation.<note> See
                  the citation page of the edition <title rend="italic">The Diplomatic
                     Correspondence of Thomas Bodley, 1585-1597</title>. Available under: <ref

                  2019].</note> This so-called <q>Transcript ID</q> will ensure that a resource can
               be found also in the future even if <quote rend="inline">the website is restructured
                  or the URL changes.</quote> Persistent project IDs do have their value for
               internal operations in an edition and can be used like canonical numbers to refer to
               a resource or parts of it. In the context of a specific domain or edition and
               combined with an URL (the editions URL) they become globally unique identifiers and
               therefore I have counted them as permalinks in the dataset. </p>
            <div>
               <head>Citation recommendations provided by digital editions</head>
               <p>The survey data shows a constant increase of editions that provide citation
                  information for the edition or parts of it (see Figure 2). Interestingly, the
                  number of editions that provide citation information for the entire edition has
                  not increased much, from 25.3% (pre 2006) to 29.1% (2006-2010) to 19.7%
                  (2011-2015), and 28.8% (2016-2020). However, the number of editions that provide
                  granular citation options has increased nearly five times over the last 20 years.
                  It seems that providing only a citation option for the entire edition was more
                  common in the early times of digital editing, while in the past decade, editions
                  increasingly provide recommendations for the citation of individual objects and
                  also for sections within an edition. To sum up, more and more SDEs provide
                  citation recommendations and especially editions that provide recommendations for
                  granular citation have increased.</p>

               </figure>
               <p>During this research, several strategies for the inclusion of bibliographic
                  information and citation recommendations have been identified. The first strategy
                  is a very traditional approach: a title page. A title page, like the ones found in
                  printed books, is an established means to communicate essential bibliographic
                  information required by common citation styles. The author’s initial assumption
                  was that title pages might primarily be relevant in early SDEs that follow the
                  printed book style and, therefore, recorded the presence of a title page only in
                  the <title rend="quotes">Comments</title> column of the dataset. After having
                  analysed the data, it seems that title pages feature more prominently in SDEs than
                  originally expected and are present even in more recent editions (see Figure 4).
                  However, it must be noted that a great number of editions with title pages were
                  published series-like by the same organisations, for instance, the Herzog August
                  Bibliothek (HAB), and the Éditions en ligne de l'École des chartes (Élec), and
                  Romantic Circles (RC). These organisations seem to have developed a template for
                  SDEs which includes a title page. The presence of a title page does not exclude
                  the use of other forms of citation recommendations in the same edition. On the
                  contrary, the HAB uses a standardised citation statement and the Romantic Circles
                  provides a citation page. </p>

                  <graphic url="resources/images/figure04.png"/>
               </figure>
               <p>Another strategy is to provide a brief statement that exemplifies how to cite the
                  edition or parts of it. Such citation examples can look very diverse and may be
                  found in different parts of the SDE. For instance, a citation recommendation for
                  the entire website may be found on the home page, in the footer section, or on
                  some subpage of the website – frequently on either the About, Copyright, Imprint,
                  Permissions, or Project page (see Figure 5). The citation example may follow a
                  common citation style; however, it is important that the necessary bibliographic
                  data is provided to apply to the most common citation styles. Sometimes, however,
                  only a permalink or PID is provided. While this is certainly enough to identify an
                  online resource and link to it from other online publications, it does not provide
                  enough information for citing using a traditional citation style. </p>

                  for parts of an edition, for instance, individual web pages, edited objects,
                  images, or even parts of texts, such as chapters and paragraphs, may be provided.
                  These text- and object-related citation examples are in most cases displayed
                  directly below, above, or next to a text or other object, for instance, as a text
                  box, a cite button, or a link that produces a pop-up with the citation example in
                  it. Citation information directly at the citable resource may, for instance, be
                  found in the <title rend="italic">Jahrrechnungen der Stadt Basel 1535 bis 1610 –
                     digital</title> which provides a citation example for each transcription(see
                  Figure 6), or the <title rend="italic">Edition Humboldt digital,</title> and the
                  edition <title rend="italic">Alfred Escher-Briefedition</title> which provide
                  citation statements for their letter transcriptions at the bottom of each page.
                  The <title rend="italic">Welsche Gast digital</title> displays an URN, DOI and a
                  permalink prominently with its online resources and additionally a link that
                  generates a detailed citation example (see Figure 7). </p>

               <p>Editions that provide citation pages often have a link in the main navigation page
                  of the website or they include them in the footer. If citation pages are designed
                  for a specific edition, they can become very detailed with instructions and/or
                  examples that illustrate how to cite the edition and its different resources using

               <p>Another type of citation page is used by some publishers that maintain several
                  digital editions, such as Huygens ING and RC. In this case a generic citation page
                  is used to communicate basic information on how to cite editions and resources
                  produced by these publishers. The benefit is that this approach is much easier to
                  maintain than to maintain a citation page for each edition. It is also a
                  sustainable means to provide citation information as long as the page is not
                  moved. For instance, RC editions have the link to the citation page in the footer
                  either under <title rend="quotes">Electronic Citation,</title> or under <title
                     rend="quotes">About Romantic Circles</title> and the citation page was already
                  in place in 2005.<note> IA has an early version of this page from 2005 stored:

               </p>
               <p>An additional way that shows how a SDE may provide guidance for referencing is by
                  embedding metadata that can be used by reference management tools such as Zotero,
                  Citavi or Endnote. For instance, by using an embedded metadata strategy,
                  standardised metadata (e.g. Dublin Core) can be included in the head section of
                  the HTML document via so-called <q>meta-tags.</q> A better strategy is to include
                  bibliographic metadata as COinS (ContextObjects in Spans) in the HTML page. COinS
                  is a citation microformat based on the OpenURL standard which allows the inclusion
                  of metadata in URLs. As the name COinS suggests, bibliographic metadata is
                  included in an empty <code>&lt;span&gt;</code> Element directly in the HTML page
                     <ptr target="#fenner2014"/>. This strategy is successfully used in online
                  catalogue platforms such as WorldCat. While the use of COinS and similar
                  strategies is still the exception in SDEs, the provision of an edition’s
                  bibliographic metadata in a machine-readable way for reference management tools
                  will become increasingly important in the future <ptr target="#dumont2018"

               <head>Granular referencing strategies</head>
               <p>The survey had a very wide understanding of granular addressing strategies: if
                  editions provide recommendations on how to cite anything beyond the edition as a
                  whole, it has been considered as <q>granular addressing.</q> The collected data
                  shows that before 2010 only few editions provided the option for granular
                  citation, while in the last 10 years editions are increasingly providing
                  recommendation on how to cite their individual parts (see Figure 2 and 3).
                  However, occasionally SDEs go even further and provide addresses for smaller
                  citable entities. The <q>addressing markup</q> strategy for addressing parts of an
                  XML or HTML document using an URI and a <term>fragment identifier</term> or
                  standards such as XPath and XPointer <ptr target="#simpson2009"/> is most
                  frequently used by content providers to create citable entities within texts in
                  scholarly digital editions and we will look at different examples such as CTS
                  further below. However, it has to be pointed out that the other strategies for
                  granular referencing are also used; an example would be the addressing of regions
                  within an image using the Image Interoperability Framework (IIIF) <ptr
                     target="#witt2018" loc="229–33"/>
                  <ptr target="#vanzundert2018"/>.<note>See also the projects <title rend="italic"

                  not widely present in SDEs, but holds great potential for future research with
                  images in editions. </p>

               <p>Citable entities in SDEs are usually HTML fragments that have an attribute
                     <q>id</q> and can be addressed using a <term>fragment identifier</term>
                  attached to a URL. The publication platform of the Max Weber Stiftung
                  Perspectivia.net provides a detailed citation recommendation for its editions
                  including a section on how to cite granular entities such as paragraphs using
                  fragment identifier (see Figure 9). The traditional workflow is to generate the
                  fragment identifier during the transformation process from TEI to HTML. The <title
                     rend="italic">Text Encoding for Interchange</title> (TEI) standard has become
                  the main standard used for digital scholarly editing projects worldwide. The
                  traditional workflow in TEI editions is that edited texts are semantically marked
                  up and stored in a TEI document for long-term preservation and exchange, but the
                  primary access point for a user is an HTML, CSS and JavaScript-based user
                  interface generated using XSLT, XQuery or other technologies that translate
                  between data (storage) and publication. From the perspective of citability it is
                  important to note that the structure of the TEI document and the HTML web
                  presentation can be fundamentally different. In fact, during the transformation
                  process from TEI to HTML, content may be removed, added, or reorganised <ptr
                     target="#flanders2016" loc="264"/>. Text, metadata, markup and fragment
                  identifiers in the TEI document are not necessarily the same as in the HTML
                  document. Consequently, citing the text from the TEI document or the presentation
                  of the text by the edition’s user interface are two different things. For the sake
                  of citability both should be possible. However, as TEI is the format for long-term
                  preservation of data; it could be argued that ideally a citation should point to
                  identifiers in the TEI source file. Furthermore, the mapping between TEI and HTML
                  structures and identifiers for citation needs to be clearly documented and
                  communicated. This can be done using the element <term>references
                     declaration</term> (<code>&lt;refsDecl&gt;</code>) in the TEI header. However,
                  documentation should also be present on the website of the edition. Lastly,
                  another option to reduce divergence between the TEI and the user interface would
                  be to create a user interface that reproduces the TEI source document (or parts of
                  it) in HTML. This is, for instance, realised by the CETEIcean project <ptr

               </p>
               <p>In a digital editing context attempts have also been made to use semantically
                  structured PIDs for granular addressing of sections of a text. One such attempt is
                  the protocol Canonical Text Services (CTS) which was originally developed for the
                  referencing of ancient texts. Ancient texts, such as Homer’s hymns, often have
                  established canonical numbers that were used for citation for decades or even
                  centuries <ptr target="#bleier2021"/>. CTS provides a means to translate these
                  citations into digital form and makes them human and machine-readable <ptr
                     target="#blackwell2016"/>
                  <ptr target="#kalvesmaki2014" loc="15–6"/>
                  <ptr target="#smith2009"/>. The CTS understands a text as a number of
                  hierarchically structured entities that can each be addressed by established
                  canonical citation rules. To identify these entities URNs are used to follow a
                  syntax containing canonical names and numbers. Undoubtedly, this is an elegant and
                  practical solution to create abstract and human-readable persistent identifiers
                  for texts. However, as Kalvesmaki already pointed out, a fundamental problem is
                  that the <q>cts</q> namespace is not registered with the global namespace
                  authority IANA <ptr target="#kalvesmaki2014" loc="20"/> and, therefore, anybody
                  could register and use the namespace for other purposes. Consequently,
                     Perseus<note>The Homer Multitext Project was the first big test case for CTS
                     and since then it has been used most prominently by Perseus which recently
                     launched its CTS implementation, the CapiTainS environment. Accessible under:
                        <ref target="https://cts.perseids.org/">https://cts.perseids.org/</ref> [10.
                     April 2018].</note> and other projects must be aware that their URNs are
                  currently not sustainable in the long run. Perseus itself translates its URNs into
                  URLs. The provision of permalinks based on the URN syntax would be a suitable
                  workaround until the URN namespace issue is resolved.</p>
               <p>A project that has a similar strategy is <title rend="italic">The Classical Latin
                     Texts</title> online collection by <title rend="italic">The Packard Humanities
                     Institute</title> (PHI). This project makes numerous classical texts available
                  and citable using canonical numbers in their human-readable URLs that follow a
                  similar logic as the CTS URNs.<note>A typical URL would be the following to a line
                     in Livy’s <title rend="italic">Ab Urbe Condita</title>:<ref
                        target="http://latin.packhum.org/cit/Liv/AUC/23.45.4.2"
                        >http://latin.packhum.org/cit/Liv/AUC/23.45.4.2</ref> [10. April 2018].A
                     user is navigated to the passage in Livy and the cited line is highlighted in
                     the editions interface. However, the URL logic is not adequately documented,
                     and there is no visible commitment or permalink policy available on the
                     site.</note> Other projects also implemented solutions to represent traditional
                  canonical citations as digital citations. The following are only a sample of
                  projects that succeeded in this process. The <title rend="italic">dMGH</title>
                  project makes the monumental edition series <title rend="italic">Monumenta
                     Germaniae Historica</title> (MGH) available in digital form. The project uses
                  human-readable permalinks containing the known abbreviations for volumes of the
                  MGH and individual page numbers can be included in the URL for citation. This is
                  an interesting example for the use of object-related visual numbers for
                     citation.<note>Besides the canonical naming of the volumes, the edited texts in
                     the MGH have internal naming conventions and canonical numbers, but their use
                     as permalinks is limited. This has already been pointed out by <ref
                        target="#assmann2008">Assmann and Sahle (2008)</ref>.</note> The final
                  example is Peter Robinson’s suggested solution to the citation of electronic texts
                  which is also based on URNs. He calls it the <quote rend="inline">documents,
                     entities and texts</quote> (DET) scheme and demonstrates the applicability of
                  the system through an implementation into the Textual Communities environment
                  using the Canterbury Tales as an example <ptr target="#robinson2017"/>.</p>
               <p>Two final points concerning <q>granular citation</q> need to be discussed in
                  brief. The first is the bibliographic data for the paratextual pages of an SDE
                  that is frequently missing. Some editions provide recommendations on how to cite
                  the edition or parts of it, but it is sometimes not clear how to cite the
                  introductions, commentaries, bibliographies, technical documentation, the
                  documentation of the encoding model etc. These are fundamental resources of an
                  edition and it should be possible for a user to cite them correctly. The second
                  point is important in digital editing projects that were produced in teams. The
                  TEI <code>&lt;respStmt&gt;</code> (statement of responsibility) allows recording
                  of the individuals responsible for the editing of a TEI document and also their
                  roles. Frequently, the main editor(s) only are mentioned in a citation statement.
                  Many people apart from the editor(s), however, are often involved in compiling the
                  transcriptions or collations, while xml developer(s) are responsible for the data
                  modelling and web developer(s) are responsible for the correct presentation of the
                  edited text on the edition’s website. The question arises whose name should appear
                  besides that of the main editor(s) in a citation statement? When individual
                  resources, such as a transcription, are cited, at least the person(s) who did the
                  main editorial work should have a prominent place in the citation statement.
                  Similarly, the xml and web developer should be cited when referring to the data
                  model (as ODD or a prose documentation) or the source code of the website. To list
                  every project member in a citation is not practical as this will always result in
                  an <q>et al</q> mention and the essential information about responsibilities gets
                  lost.</p>

               <head>PIDs and permalinks in digital scholarly editions</head>
               <p>PIDs and permalinks are central for citation of SDEs as they are persistent names
                  for web content and consequently imperative for reference texts that are used for
                  citation by the scientific community. However, the survey results are slightly
                  disillusioning (see Figure 10). It is a positive development that the use of
                  permalinks and PIDs has increased in the last two decades. Yet over 75% of SDEs
                  still do not provide PIDs or permalinks – or at least do not communicate this
                  information to their users. </p>
               <figure>
                  <head>Editions that provided PIDs and permalinks for citation</head>
                  <graphic url="resources/images/figure10.png"/>
               </figure>
               <p>While URNs and DOIs are well known PIDs and their use is already a sign to the
                  informed user that these identifiers can be used for citation, URLs have a bad
                  reputation for being unreliable and have to be explicitly labelled as being
                  permalinks. Some editions might use their URLs as permalinks, but do not
                  explicitly state this, or if they do the statement is difficult to find. As
                  mentioned in the introduction, the maintenance of PIDs and permalinks is key to
                  their function as persistent names for online resources. Ideally, an institution
                  with suitable infrastructure and a commitment to preserve and maintain its online
                  resources should oversee the hosting of a SDE. The same is valid for the
                  management and maintenance of PIDs and permalinks. Long-term preservation and the
                  permalink strategy are important information for a user as they may increase trust
                  in the stability of an online resource. Therefore, such a statement should be
                  placed in a prominent position.</p>
               <p>The HAB provides <q>persistent URLs</q> (permalinks) for its online resources and
                  has a brief, but clear commitment published on its website that ensures the
                  persistent availability of its online content via the persistent URLs.<note><ref

                  the use of permalinks in SDEs. The edition includes a permalink statement that
                  specifies what permalinks in the edition are and a commitment by the
                  Berlin-Brandenburg Academy of Sciences and Humanities (BBAW), which is committed
                  to making published resources available.<note><ref

                  statement is brief, but it also mentions that the persistent availability of
                  versions will be ensured via the indicated permalinks. This is a functionality
                  that is unfortunately rarely seen in SDEs. The edition <title rend="italic"
                     >Welscher Gast digital</title> is an interesting case in this context, since
                  for some of its resources the edition provides a DOI and a <q>Zitierlink</q>
                  (citation link), a permalink, and for other resources an additional URN. A user
                  may ask, should all these options be used for citation or only the
                     <q>Zitierlink?</q> A clear answer comes from the developers of the edition who
                  solved this issue elegantly by providing information about the stability of the
                  permalink in an info lightbox and additionally a <q>Zitierhinweis</q> (citation
                  recommendation with an example) indicating that the DOI should be used for
                  citation (see Figure 7).</p>
               <p>Closely related to the use of permalinks and PIDs is the question of long-term
                  availability of online resources. Sahle’s catalogue includes several editions that
                  were available 10 or 20 years ago, but are gone today or have been moved and their

                  <head>Versioning strategies in SDEs</head>
                  <p>As pointed out in the introduction, a versioning strategy is important for SDEs
                     as their content can be changed as easily as the content of any other website.
                     Following strategies from software design, digital editions are also frequently
                     released at an early stage of development and resources are revised or added at
                     a later stage. Therefore, resources in digital editions might change over time
                     and it is important to make those changes transparent to a user. For scholarly
                     discourse, editions need to provide resources that can be reliably cited not
                     when they are finished, but as soon as they are released to the public. For
                     citation and later retrieval, it is imperative that users know what version
                     they are dealing with. Different strategies are used to indicate versions. </p>
                  <p>The results of the study have shown that over the past decade editions with a
                     versioning strategy have substantially increased (see Figure 12).
                     Unfortunately, however, most SDEs still do not have a versioning strategy
                     implemented. The reasons for this cannot be of a technical nature alone, as the
                     provision of version information in its most basic form only requires adding a
                     version number or a version date. Deeper reasons are to be found for the
                     problem rather in the way editors perceive their online editions. These are
                     often considered as being <q>final</q> and <q>static,</q> scarcely affected by
                     the changes that may occur once they have been released. Additionally, editors
                     may believe that minor changes applied to online editions do not matter to the
                     user. If this is the case, however, this perspective needs to be openly
                     communicated on an edition’s website. Another possible explanation for the lack
                     of a solid versioning strategy, might be that there is still too little
                     awareness of both the topic itself and the importance of transparency and
                     retractability for changes in a digital editing context. Scholarly arguments
                     and citations cannot be based on texts that may be modified overnight. The
                     following examples have been selected for briefly highlighting the different
                     strategies used by editions listed in Sahle’s catalogue to indicate for users
                     what version they are dealing with. The already mentioned study by Broyles
                     analyses the versioning strategies of about 30 digital editions <ptr
                        target="#broyles2020"/>. While this study is primarily concerned with
                     strategies to indicate versions to the user as part of a citation
                     recommendation, Broyles study also explored logged changes in data files and
                     other forms of content versioning.</p>

                        [11. April 2019].</note> In these cases, the editions have a version number
                     and not individual web resources. This is the same approach used in traditional
                     print editing: the author or editor of a book or an edition decides when the
                     release of a revised version is necessary. Citation recommendations provided by
                     these editions suggest adding the current version number or the date to any
                     citation. Previous versions may be available in an archive, but neither of the
                     three editions provide permalinks for older versions. <title rend="italic">The
                        Online Froissart</title> is a more recent edition which also employs this
                     strategy, and it provides a very useful detailed list of changes made between
                     the different versions.<note>See: <ref

                  <p>Another versioning strategy is that in which it is not the edition itself that
                     receives a new version with every update, but the versions of individual web
                     resources which are stored and made accessible for citation using permalinks or
                     PIDs. Version control systems (VCS) can be used for this purpose. Every little
                     change to a resource is recorded and generates a new version. In contrast to
                     the above-mentioned system, the creation of a new version is not triggered by
                     the author or editor. Every change, no matter how small, generates a new
                     version. The benefit of this system is that parts of an SDE can be updated
                     without the need to create a new version of the entire edition. Furthermore,
                     every old and new version is stored and can be referenced and retrieved from an
                     archive. A downside, however, is that if badly executed, this strategy can lead
                     to the creation of an enormous number of unnecessary versions, for instance of
                     irrelevant changes, which might be confusing to a user, require more storage
                     space, and maintenance.</p>
                  <p>The <title rend="italic">Edition Humboldt digital</title> is an example of an
                     edition which has an archive of older text versions citable via
                        permalinks.<note>See also: <ref target="#dumont2018">Dumont
                        (2018)</ref>.</note> Moreover, if one accesses one of its old versions, a
                     warning message indicates that a newer version of this transcription is
                     available and points the user to it. The most recent authorized revision of a
                     resource can be then accessed via a <term>canonical URL.</term> There is a
                     significant difference between canonical URLs and the before mentioned
                     canonical numbers. Canonical URLs were introduced out of a practical need to
                     optimise search engine results. They are implemented using an HTML
                        <term>canonical tag</term> the purpose of which is to specify what URL
                     should be listed in the search results.<note><ref

                        01.02.2019.</note> A canonical URL should always point to the newest,
                     accepted version of an online resource. As the canonical URL does not in any
                     way reflect the change of the online resource, it should not be used for
                     citation. While this versioning approach is relatively new to the digital
                     editing community, it has been in use for projects such as Wikipedia for quite
                     a while. Wikipedia is an example of a website where content is constantly
                     changing and where a new version with a permalink results each time an article
                     is edited. The project provides canonical URLs for the most recent, accepted
                     version of an article and permalinks for permanent addressing. Wiki as an
                     editing platform is also being used by digital edition projects. For instance,
                     the <title rend="italic">Social Edition of the Devonshire</title> MS (BL Add.
                     MS 17492) is published via <title rend="italic">Wikibooks</title> and uses the
                     same system as Wikipedia for the visibility of permalinks and versioning information.<note>

            <head>Conclusion</head>
            <p>Scholarly editions – both in print and in digital form – are reference works for
               scholarly discourse. Consequently, resources provided by scholarly digital editions
               (SDE) should be clearly citable and persistently available. This is, however, not
               always the case as SDEs are often complex websites with different resources and
               traditional citation style guides do not sufficiently cover this type of website.
               Furthermore, developers of SDEs often do not provide the necessary bibliographic data
               and guidance to cite an edition and its resources correctly. Apart from the
               bibliographic data that is also required for the citation of editions in print,
               crucial information specific to SDEs has been identified and discussed including
               permalink, PID, versioning strategies, and granular citation options for digital
               resources. </p>
            <p>As in the digital realm there is no stable physical representative of the edition,
               the provision of permalinks or PIDs for the scholarly digital edition and its
               resources is crucial. If online resources are updated and changed, it is necessary to
               provide stable identifiers for older versions and, ideally, to make them accessible
               for users. Furthermore, the possibilities and potential for granular citation in
               scholarly digital editions have been addressed by briefly discussing the strategies
               used by IIIF, fragment identifiers and the CTS protocol. In this context, it is
               important to note that a substantial number of texts used in the humanities have
               established titles and numbers for citation. CTS, DET, dMGH, PHI and similar projects
               try to translate the logic of traditional into a digital format. By this means not
               only the edition, but fragments and objects within the edition may be cited in the
               digital realm using existing and widely used logical structures of a text.</p>
            <p>The survey conducted as part of this research has shown that over the past two
               decades, the awareness of these topics has increased among SDE developers. However,
               most digital editions still do not sufficiently communicate to the user what can be
               cited in an SDE and how to do so safely. Citation information is, nevertheless,
               imperative as each edition may have a different structure, it may also provide a
               different set of online resources, or use diverse granular citation strategies.
               Therefore, not providing clear information on how to cite the edition or partial
               resources may decrease the trust in and the citability of a digital edition.
               Furthermore, digital editions are produced by teams rather than individuals and the
               acknowledgement of the individual responsibilities of team members can and should be
               emphasised by citing these persons alongside the main editor(s) when appropriate.
               This information needs to be communicated to a user.</p>
            <p>A further important point of consideration is the provision of all necessary
               bibliographic data for citation. The most practical approach for this would appear to
               be the placing of a citation statement for the entire edition in a prominent position
               on the home page, and additional citation statements referring to the individual
               resources provided by the edition. Permalinks and PIDs should be clearly highlighted
               and it must be communicated to the user that these can and should be used for
               persistent citation. As the persistent availability of online resources always
               depends strongly on the institution maintaining them, a digital edition should
               outline its PID/permalink strategy and policy on the website. Furthermore, users
               should be informed on how an edition deals with updates and revisions of its
               resources. A good place for such a statement would be a citation page or the
                  <q>about</q> page. How changes are logged and how old and new versions can be
               cited is vital information. As a matter of fact, very few online editions will remain
               unchanged over time. Ideally, a new permalink or PID should be created for every
               version. </p>
            <p>Currently, there is no standardised way to provide citation information in an SDE.
               Various strategies were discussed in this article and it was occasionally pointed out
               that some solutions seem to be more frequently used. This might be the first step
               towards the standardisation of this very important feature of an SDE. However, as
               there are too many different types of editions covering various subjects, further
               research is necessary to analyse what kind of citation recommendation fits to
               different types of editions. Currently, the best advice for editors and developers
               alike is to provide essential bibliographic data for the citation of an edition
               easily accessible to the user (ideally in human- and machine-readable form). It is
               essential for a user to know how to cite the individual resources of the edition and
               to easily find permalinks/PIDs and information on the versioning strategy of an SDE.
               Following these basic rules will increase the citability of an edition and help move
               towards more stability for scholarly online resources.</p>
