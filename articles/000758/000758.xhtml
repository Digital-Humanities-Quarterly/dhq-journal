                  <p>This study examines factors contributing to the loss of four grant funded, free use
                     digital humanities websites funded by the 
                     National Endowment for the Humanities' Education Development and Demonstartion Program,
                     1996-2003: Decision Point! at Auburn University,
                     Hawthorne in Salem at North Shore Community College (Danvers, MA), the New Deal Network
                     at the Franklin and Eleanor Roosevelt Institute (Hyde Park, NY), 
                     and River Web at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. The evidence shows
                     that website loss did not occur suuddenly. In all four cases, 
                     organizations that accepted program funds to create online materials ultimately failed
                     to develop or continue procedures to manage them effectively. 
                     As the organizations or organizational divisions that developed these websites struggled
                     to sustain them or indicated an unwillingness to do so any longer, 
                     their creator(s) asked a college, university, or research library to take responsibility
                     for them, without success. Online materials became subject 
                     to increased risk of loss in both contexts in part due to rapid technological change,often
                     expressed in accelerating software product update cycles, 
                     combined with a general lack of funding and personnel available for addressing it
                     after the end of grant period. Several other elements also played 
                     parts in website loss however, often shaping the ways in which technological developments
                     and financial circumstances did their damage. In three instances 
                     website creators discovered that common vicissitudes of organizational life, including
                     revised objectives, changing tactics used to achieve them, 
                     and new administrative personnel compromised website sustainability. In two cases
                     adminstrators' responsibility for risk management led them to remove 
                     legacy websites made obsolete by new technology. In one case research pursung technological
                     innovation in the retrieval and management of large data sets 
                     contributed to the loss of a funded resource. Finally, simple, inexplicable failure
                     also contributed to that website's demise. These four cases can provide 
                     a digital humanities community increasingly concerned about the sustainability of
                     grant funded online materials with additional evidence of how technological 
                     change and financial shortfalls threaten these resources. In doing so, it can also
                     show how more complex organizational dynamics often contribute 
                     to website loss.</p>

                     A recent survey of this program’s funded materials 
                     found that while 40 remained online in September 2020, 19 had become unavailable [<a class="ref" href="#vandecreek2022">VandeCreek 2022</a>].<a class="noteRef" href="#d4e188">[1]</a> This study examines four of these

                     at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign (UIUC). By the time of this article’s
                     preparation, information about many 
                     of the 19 lost websites had become scarce or nonexistent. However, sufficient data
                     remained to consider the impact of the loss of these four. 
                     Moving from those instances supplying less information to those furnishing more, this
                     inquiry provides a brief history of each website. 
                     The accounts frame several questions pertaining to legacy website sustainability <a class="noteRef" href="#d4e190">[2]</a> “How did the digital humanists that created the resources 
                     seek to sustain them?” “How did the institutions responsible for presenting the four websites under review
                     attempt to do so?” 
                     In the period that these websites remained online, “how effectively did they function? What factors contributed to their loss?” 
                     Finally, “what does the record of these websites’ loss tell us about the larger state of legacy
                     website sustainability efforts 
                     in the period spanning 1996-2023?”</div>

                     effectively. As the organizations or organizational 
                     divisions that developed these websites struggled to sustain them or indicated an

                     magazine and newspaper articles, and other documents. 
                     In each case two major factors contributed to NEH-EDD grant recipients’ inability
                     to sustain websites and libraries’ unwillingness to do so. 
                     Online materials became subject to increased risk of loss in part due to rapid technological

                     ways in which technological developments and financial circumstances 
                     did their damage. They combined in complex ways. In three instances website creators
                     discovered that common vicissitudes of organizational life,

                     other researchers have not pursued her latter observation in detail. 
                     Each type of organizational change, alone or together, can prevent the planning, policymaking,

                     rather successes, however. 
                     It proposed that digital humanists and associated technologists should not understand

                     Recording and analyzing cases of legacy website failure provides information and insight
                     that discussions of disasters averted simply cannot. The cases can indeed provide
                     opportunities to develop enhanced methods,

                     an important juncture 
                     that requires a close evaluation of legacy websites’ future prospects. It shows that
                     NEH-EDD funded materials produced in very different organizational contexts — including
                     a 501c3 organization, a community college, and two large research universities — disappeared
                     from the live web. 
                     A complex mix of factors produced this website loss over time periods ranging from
                     11 to 19 years. Although a familiar combination of technical and financial factors
                     played a large role in each case, common forms of bureaucratic change, 
                     administrators’ responsibility to manage risk and avoid liability, different forms
                     of technological innovation itself, and simple, seemingly inexplicable failure also
                     contributed to website loss. Scholarship discussing a wide range of subjects, 
                     from those close at hand like digital preservation to more distant like network security,
                     risk management, and the history of technology, has in several cases pointed the way
                     to these factors. Before members of the digital humanities community

                           NEH-EDD funding allowed the project team to expand and refine an existing online resource
                           called “Decision Point!”, which facilitated problem-centered instruction in United
                           States history [<a class="ref" href="#nationalendowment2001">National Endowment 2001</a>]. 
                           The website placed high school students in Spring 1968 immediately following the assassination
                           of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. It asked student teams to act as civil rights leaders, determining how they should
                           continue the struggle 
                           for racial equality and justice in the United States. The website presented discussions
                           of three general strategies that informed movement activism at that time: working
                           within the legal system, nonviolent protest, and Black Power. 
                           It also included a database containing multimedia content documenting and discussing
                           events related to the civil rights movement of the 1950s and 60s, such as period newspaper
                           clippings, television footage and music, personal accounts, 
                           and interviews with movement participants. In addition to making these materials available
                           in a searchable format, the site presented them thematically in three strands representing
                           the primary change strategies. Each strand also included an original interpretive
                           essay, 
                           an event timeline, and a menu of available materials organized by document type [<a class="ref" href="#saye_etal1999">Saye et al 1999</a>, 481] also see [<a class="ref" href="#saye_etal2002">Saye et al 2002</a>].</div>

                           described as an integrated electronic notebook. It contained a set of categorizing
                           questions that a historian might use to organize evidence pertaining to an event,
                           
                           as well as an opportunity to record research activities in a journal format. Saye and collaborator Thomas Brush of Indiana University further described these additional materials as a set of scaffolding
                           tools for collecting, analyzing, and evaluating historical 
                           evidence and offering conclusions. Using the website’s tools, student teams constructed
                           persuasive presentations supporting their approach to continued civil rights activism
                           in 1968 [<a class="ref" href="#saye_etal1999">Saye et al 1999</a>, 472–473, 481–482]. Saye and Brush found that participating students 
                           responded to the website enthusiastically and achieved improved learning levels. In
                           a 1999 publication the collaborators recounted their experience with the site and
                           emphasized scaffolding materials’ great potential for supporting teachers using primary
                           sources in history instruction. 
                           They went on to describe the website as an initial expression of an ongoing project

                        studying legacy website sustainability have often described. University administrators’
                        
                        subsequent activities related to Decision Point! created a more specific and complex

                        legacy websites’ 
                        value so that they might provide institutional resources for sustaining the materials.
                        In this case, however, Auburn University officials recognized that Decision Point!
                        had become a network security hazard and removed it from use. All managers or administrators

                     ransom in exchange for stolen data [<a class="ref" href="#dagostino2022">D'Agostino 2022</a>][<a class="ref" href="#schwartz2023">Schwartz 2023</a>]. By 2023 costs related to a data loss through network incursion at an institution
                     of higher education increased to an average of $3.7 million [<a class="ref" href="#donadel2023">Donadel 2023</a>]. 
                     In this context, NSCC administrators identified Hawthorne in Salem as a network security
                     risk and removed the site from service in February 2023.</div>

                  <div class="ptext" id="p26">Whitney asked the college’s Director of Information Technology to identify specific security
                     concerns that the website created. She received a reply that mentioned several factors.
                     First, the administrator noted that the Hawthorne in Salem site resided on a server
                     using a Linux operating system. 
                     Had the site employed a Windows operating system, he believed that his team could
                     have protected it from attacks with the Crowdstrike utility used to discourage incursions
                     on other NSCC websites. He also mentioned the fact that the project used an obsolete
                     version of Linux, Red Hat version 5. 
                     In addition, the site’s database employed MySQL, PHP, and Perl scripts, each in obsolete
                     versions. In order to address these issues, he determined that his staff would need
                     to build a new server, upgrade to Red Hat 7, update the obsolete server software to
                     render it secure, 
                     and then migrate the site to the new platform. 
                     He emphasized that this work would require more time than his department could devote
                     to the project unless the college administration approved it, and he knew they would
                     not. <a class="noteRef" href="#d4e683">[10]</a></div>

                     framework, now entitled “Hawthorne at Salem.” Whitney explained that it reflected the work that NSCC librarians 
                     had completed while attempting to migrate the original site materials to the LibGuide
                     platform in 2019 and 2020. <a class="noteRef" href="#d4e690">[11]</a>[<a class="ref" href="#hawthorneatsalem2023">Hawthorne at Salem 2023</a>]. Whitney, NSCC administrators, and NSCC librarians deserve recognition for attempting to keep
                     Hawthorne in Salem online, 
                     but their efforts have produced a website that adds new aspects to Tucker’s description of legacy resources in limbo. Providing a limited quantity of data,
                     without search function, under a slightly different name, it exists in a state of
                     de facto loss. 
                     Introductory text on the new website’s front page suggests that it remains online
                     principally in hopes of attracting an institution willing to adopt it for future use:
                     “The Hawthorne in Salem site at www.hawthorneinsalem.org had to be removed from the
                     internet because of security vulnerabilities. 
                     Some of the material from the site is available on this lib guide. We hope to be able
                     to expand this lib guide site to include more of the original Hawthorne in Salem material,
                     but we may have to attempt to find another institution to host the site.

                     an obsolete NEH-EDD funded resource that became a substantial network security risk
                     to its home institution. The record shows that NSCC’s experience differs from Auburn
                     University’s in several significant respects, however. 
                     Unlike their peers at Auburn, NSCC officials originally provided funds for updating
                     and otherwise maintaining Hawthorne in Salem’s software after the end of the project’s
                     grant period. When falling student enrollments reduced the institution’s budget and
                     drew administrators’ sustained attention, 
                     NSCC officials diverged from Auburn’s course of action once more. They directed the
                     college library to devise another way, compatible with the institution’s existing
                     network security measures, to keep the website online. In this effort NSCC librarians
                     grappled with the results of outdated software 
                     and a lack of institutional resources directly, where Auburn library officials had
                     only mentioned them when refusing to adopt Decision Point! Working solely with resources
                     already at hand, including a content management system designed to present guides
                     to library materials in a non-searchable format, 
                     they failed to produce a usable website. When hackers attacked the original NEH-EDD
                     funded version of Hawthorne in Salem, NSCC officials reprised Auburn’s experience
                     in one crucial respect, however. In taking the website down, they acted on the basis
                     of an administrator’s duty to protect 
                     their organization and its members from harm in a variety of forms.</div>

                        <div class="ptext" id="p29">In January 1996 Thomas Thurston of FERI in Hyde Park, New York began building an online resource documenting American
                           society and politics in the New Deal era (1933-1941). The New Deal Network website
                           first appeared online on October 1 of that year, hosted at nearby Marist College.
                           
                           The resource also benefited from the contributions of the Franklin D. Roosevelt Presidential
                           Library and International Business Machines Corporation (IBM). The presidential library
                           provided content for digitization. FERI lacked the expertise necessary to develop
                           a website and database, 
                           but IBM provided a senior programmer who led the team that designed them. The New
                           Deal Network website attracted significant national media attention and quickly grew
                           to contain over 3,000 photographs as well as political cartoons, audio clips, speeches,
                           letters, and other documents from the period. 
                           In addition to records from the Roosevelt Presidential Library, these included materials
                           scanned from the collections of the National Archives, the Library of Congress, and
                           several museums and private collections [<a class="ref" href="#newdeallaunched1996">New Deal Launched</a>] [<a class="ref" href="#newdealnetwork1997">New Deal Network 1997</a>]. 
                           Fifteen sets of teachers and students around the country, which the project team called
                           the Civilian Computer Corps, also created locally based web projects describing and
                           documenting the Great Depression and New Deal’s impact on their own communities. 
                            Thurston linked their finished projects to a section of the New Deal Network  site devoted
                           to classroom instruction. In 1997 the National Endowment for the Humanities’ “EdSITEment: The Best of Humanities on the Web” program selected the New Deal Network for online recognition [<a class="ref" href="#nehnewdeal1998">NEH New Deal 1998</a>].</div>

                           web site. The funds helped Thurston to double the number of available primary sources. 
                           They also provided for the addition of audio and video files and curricular materials
                           [<a class="ref" href="#nehnewdeal1998">NEH New Deal 1998</a>]. The New Deal Network website eventually came to include seven sections: classroom,

                           posts. 
                           Although IBM and Marist College did not take part in the grant project, Thurston’s place of employment moved to a new project partner, Columbia University Teachers
                           College’s Institute for Learning Technologies. A combination of funds provided by

                           of 1998 Thurston presented an NEH-funded teachers’ workshop at Vassar College in Poughkeepsie, New
                           York. There teachers acquired skills to allow them to enhance their existing online

                           and produce new interactive student projects [<a class="ref" href="#civilian1999">Civilian 1999</a>]. The next year the New Deal Network won the American Association for History and

                     As the New Deal Network website remained in the limbo of obsolescence, the institute

                     mission and identity.

                     target for malicious cybercriminals. Even if they did not, organizational changes

                     His analysis of the situation resembles Hedstrom ’sdiscussion of how common forms of organizational change may affect attempts to
                     preserve and sustain digital materials in single organizations, and indeed large changes
                     in the project’s host organization undermined its online viability. 
                     However, the record also shows that other organizations’ changes in direction and
                     focus affected the website. FERI relied on partners to provide the historical source
                     materials and technical capacity that it could not, as well as a portion of Thurston’s compensation, throughout the project’s brief life. 
                     When these partners ceased their contributions and FERI and Thurston did not attract new partners, FERI soon proved incapable of and/or uninterested in
                     sustaining the resource. Organizational partnerships can help to produce digital humanities
                     websites, 
                     but partners’ changing missions and the various means by which they seek to realize

                     when an organization that led partners, but relied heavily on them, lacks the institutional

                        Louis, Illinois from the Mississippi River flood of 1993. While stacking sandbags,
                        Burton realized that he could present materials documenting local history online in a searchable
                        website 
                        [<a class="ref" href="#burton_etal2020">Burton and et al 2020</a>, 132]. Burton had long used quantitative data in historical research, and in 1986 the new National
                        Center for Supercomputing Applications (NCSA) at UIUC provided him with a Senior Research
                        Scientist appointment. In 1993 Burton became Head of NCSA’s Initiative for Social Sciences and Humanities 
                        [<a class="ref" href="#burton2023">Burton 2023</a>]. The university provided his new project with financial support and computer equipment,
                        and in October 1996 he received $50,000 from the NEH Education Development and Demonstration
                        program for activities to begin the following year [<a class="ref" href="#burton2023">Burton 2023</a>][<a class="ref" href="#riverweb">River Web</a>]. 
                        Working with several graduate students, Burton created a pilot website exploring the American Bottom region that surrounded East
                        St. Louis, just below the confluence of the Missouri, Illinois, and Mississippi Rivers

                        their work” [<a class="ref" href="#read2003">Read 2003</a>, A37]. Shortly thereafter Burton and the River Web team became dissatisfied with the website they had developed, which
                        presented static HTML pages and 72 dpi resolution images. 
                        Seeking to upgrade the site’s available features, the team worked with a group of
                        Information Science and Computer Science graduate students enrolled at UIUC who used
                        its contents as a testbed for creating a new content management system. After this

                        the collaborators built a new site on a Wiki framework and attempted to develop an
                        application that would automatically generate links between related content. Amidst
                        this work, Burton later recalled, “disaster soon struck”[<a class="ref" href="#burton_etal2020">Burton and et al 2020</a>, 138]. </div>

                  <div class="ptext" id="p40">NCSA had served and updated the River Web project website at no cost since its inception,
                     but shortly after Burton’s team began work on the third (Wiki) iteration of the website, NCSA adopted a center-wide
                     cost-recovery model and began to charge $10,000 per year for website hosting and support.
                     
                     River Web’s creators could not find funds to pay this fee. They asked the University
                     Libraries to take responsibility for the site, but its representatives declined, explaining
                     that their policies did not provide for hosting websites developed outside the library
                     itself <a class="noteRef" href="#d4e898">[20]</a> 
                     Finally, Burton and his team turned to the UIUC College of Liberal Arts and Sciences, which offered
                     to provide web hosting services for $5,000 per year. About a year after moving the
                     resource to the new host, the project’s development server suffered what River Web’s
                     creators described as “a catastrophic failure” 
                     that destroyed the website and its underlying data [<a class="ref" href="#burton_etal2020">Burton and et al 2020</a>, 139]. The team moved to recover backup copies of their materials from the College of Liberal
                     Arts and Sciences’ Information Technology Department. Department policy included a
                     provision for the automatic backup of data appearing online 
                     via its servers, but, Burton recalled, this “had stopped some six months earlier without anyone realizing [it].” Although the discovery of the oversight inadvertently saved other researchers’ work
                     from a similar fate, Burton noted that “the overwhelming majority of the project was now lost”[<a class="ref" href="#burton_etal2020">Burton and et al 2020</a>, 139]. 
                     A 2002 version of River Web remained online in March 2023 on the Illinois State Museum
                     website [<a class="ref" href="#riverwebnd">River Web nd</a>].

                  <div class="ptext" id="p41">NCSA’s decision to begin charging a fee for web hosting began the process that destroyed
                     River Web. Burton later recalled that two factors likely informed its action. First, the university
                     faced a financial shortfall in 2008 and sought budget reductions in all units and
                     divisions. Second, the professor noted that the move 
                     took place after the 2004 founding of the Illinois Center for Computing in Humanities,
                     Arts, and Social Science (I-CHASS), of which he served as Founding Director. <a class="noteRef" href="#d4e929">[21]</a>;[<a class="ref" href="#burton2023">Burton 2023</a>]. The university had provided seed funding to I-CHASS with the understanding that
                     the new center would ultimately become self-sufficient through grant awards. 
                     The adoption of a cost recovery web hosting policy served to encourage scholars affiliated
                     with I-CHASS to become more aggressive in seeking grant support for their work (Burton,
                     2023c). When River Web did not attract new grant funding to pay NCSA’s hosting fee,
                     its website stood in jeopardy. </div>

                  <div class="ptext" id="p42"> Burton also believed that the River Web project’s collaboration with UIUC research activities,
                     particularly data mining, contributed to the website’s loss. When NCSA opened at UIUC
                     in 1986 as one of the five original nodes in the National Science Foundation’s Supercomputer
                     Center Program, it raised a university long renowned for its engineering prowess 
                     and outstanding Information Science program to the forefront of scholarly inquiry
                     using high-performance computing [<a class="ref" href="#usnews2010">U.S. News and World Report 2010</a>] [<a class="ref" href="#nationalsciencend">National Science nd</a>]. Student researchers enrolled in these programs became familiar with River Web as
                     the site developed within NCSA and harvested material 
                     from it in bulk for use in projects seeking means to assemble, manage, and analyze
                     very large quantities of data. After River Web’s move to the UIUC College of Liberal
                     Arts and Sciences, these students continued to collect data from the website at a
                     similar scale. <a class="noteRef" href="#d4e948">[22]</a> The professor had not imagined that web harvesting would damage the site when he
                     developed it, 
                     as it resided on NCSA servers. However, Burton and other team members came to believe that a server not outfitted in keeping with
                     NCSA’s standards eventually succumbed to the demands of student researchers still
                     unfamiliar with best practices in the emerging field of online data collection. <a class="noteRef" href="#d4e953">[23]</a>
                     Looking back, team member Simon Appleford noted that the system administrators at the College of Arts and Sciences “thought we were asking for a web hosting solution, whereas the server was being used
                     for some relatively intensive compute processing.”<a class="noteRef" href="#d4e959">[24]</a> A 2007 discussion of web data mining supported Burton and Appleford’s 
                     understanding of the situation, emphasizing that these activities can subject web
                     servers to significant strain [<a class="ref" href="#liu2007">Liu 2007</a>, 315]. Like Decision Point!, Hawthorne in Salem, and the New Deal Network, River Web experienced
                     the effects of continued innovation in web software. Burton and his team began to address this problem when they moved River Web to a Wiki format.
                     
                     Nevertheless, intensive research activity at UIUC, pursued in hopes of creating similar
                     technical innovations, completed the process of loss begun by NCSA’s withdrawal of
                     complimentary web hosting. </div>

                  <div class="ptext" id="p43">River Web’s history provides further illustration of how financial concerns can compromise
                     digital humanities websites, even at very large research universities with considerable
                     internal funds. However, a closer review also shows how the financial issue arose
                     in other contexts, including partnership arrangements. River Web developed from a
                     longstanding collaboration 
                     among units within the same institution. NCSA provided Burton, a historian employed within UIUC’s College of Arts and Sciences, with web hosting.
                     Yet when NCSA helped to found I-CHASS, River Web faced an increased risk of loss.
                     Previous research has suggested that the support of a digital humanities center has
                     in specific cases helped grant-funded digital humanities websites 
                     to remain online long after their funding ran out [<a class="ref" href="#vandecreek2023">VandeCreek 2023</a>]. By contrast, when a new center devoted to facilitating digital humanities work emerged
                     at UIUC, it did so in an institutional arrangement that effectively withdrew in-kind
                     support from River Web. Again, a partner organization’s change in direction, however
                     slight, proved fatal to a website. </div>

                  <div class="ptext" id="p44">The 15-year-old record does not provide direct evidence of why UIUC Libraries declined
                     to adopt River Web in the years immediately before its loss, but a subsequent inquiry
                     sets its action in a familiar context. When asked if UIUC Libraries had revised its
                     policy to provide for the adoption of legacy websites since River Web’s failure in
                     2009, 
                     Kyle Rimkus, Librarian for Digital Programs and Partnerships and Associate Professor at that
                     institution, reported that they had not. He stated that the libraries had long evaluated
                     such requests on a case-by-case basis, and “in most cases they get turned down”. He continued, noting that “It is incredibly difficult for libraries to sustain digital humanities projects”
                     in which they have been involved from the start; “adopting orphaned projects from other parts of the university is an even more challenging
                     and headache-inducing prospect.” He concluded that, if legacy projects are to survive, “there needs to be a curatorial unit in the library which is strongly invested and
                     engaged in the project’s long-term success.”<a class="noteRef" href="#d4e997">[25]</a> 
                     Rimkus’ reference to a curatorial unit responsible for legacy websites likely stemmed from
                     the University of Virginia Libraries’ successful reconstruction of the Valley of the
                     Shadow Project site. In that instance the university provided its library with $100,000
                     and considerable staff time and effort to sustain a well-known online resource [<a class="ref" href="#vandecreek2023">VandeCreek 2023</a>]. 
                     Rimkus suggested that this level of support did not exist at UIUC in 2009 and remained unavailable
                     in 2023. Again, the never-ending challenge of keeping up with rapidly changing web
                     software and a shortage of resources dedicated to doing so shaped library policy.
                     When Burton and his team searched for a new hosting arrangement for River Web, 
                     that policy indirectly contributed to the website’s loss.</div>

                  <div class="ptext" id="p46">Although website loss often seemed immediately to follow a single event, like an administrative
                     dictat or server failure, in all four cases it occurred as a result of a complex set
                     of developments playing out over a period of years. These cases show that websites
                     have histories and that a historical approach can benefit the study and practice of
                     legacy website sustainability. 
                     Historical analysis represents one of the humanities’ core disciplines. The influential
                     2004 Companion to Digital Humanities begins with a review of the field’s development
                     to that date and goes on to provide historical reviews of various subfields [<a class="ref" href="#hockey2004">Hockey 2004</a>]. Some scholars might dismiss an account of events taking place less than 30 years
                     in the past as something less than history. 
                     However, an emphasis on documenting events, in detail, in a particular setting, in
                     sequence, over a period of time, provides several major benefits to the discussion
                     of legacy website sustainability. Documentation in detail increases the volume of
                     data, the number of discrete events and developments related to website loss, that
                     researchers and practitioners concerned about the future of legacy resources online
                     can analyze. 
                     Understanding that attempts to sustain websites take place in specific organizational
                     contexts can lead to a realization that each endeavor will not develop in an identical
                     manner. Local circumstances affect how major factors already shown to influence website
                     sustainability take effect in individual cases. Consideration of events and developments
                     taking place in a given context in chronological order 
                     can reveal elements of causation in single cases, which can in turn provide evidence
                     to be integrated into broader studies’ findings. Together, the above considerations
                     can produce a greater appreciation for complexity and nuance in the study and practice
                     of legacy website sustainability. </div>

                  <div class="ptext" id="p47">The record shows that in these cases concerned researchers’ attempts to persuade organizations
                     to take responsibility for legacy websites’ active management, like website creators’
                     plans for their extended use, bore no fruit. Sustainability efforts found disappointment
                     in two contexts. Each website emerged with NEH-EDD funding in an organization or organizational
                     unit other than a library, 
                     and website creators first sought to secure their materials’ future there. As funded
                     materials’ online viability became increasingly precarious in these settings, digital
                     humanists turned to libraries in hopes that they would take responsibility for sustaining
                     the materials in the future. In three cases academics turned to their college or university
                     library. 
                     In the fourth a digital humanist employed by a 501c3 organization appealed to a research
                     library that had contributed to the project as a partner organization. None of these
                     libraries stepped forward to take responsibility for sustaining these NEH-EDD funded
                     websites. </div>

                  <div class="ptext" id="p48">Researchers have identified rapid technological change, in the form of short web software
                     update cycles, as a major cause of legacy digital humanities website loss. They have
                     also emphasized a general shortage of resources available to underwrite the resulting
                     steady stream of necessary updates as another. Each proved significant in NEH-EDD
                     funded websites’ original organizational context and libraries’ 
                     decisions to stand aside in all four cases examined in this article. However, the
                     available evidence shows that other factors also served to thwart attempts to establish
                     active management in funded materials’ original institutional settings. They often
                     influenced when and how technological change and a paucity of resources took effect.

                  <div class="ptext" id="p49">Other factors affecting the websites under review included the changes of direction,
                     focus, and management that Hedstrom identifies as influencing libraries’ attempts to curate and preserve digital materials.
                     Two cases examined in this study provide examples of changes in organizational focus
                     and managerial personnel that contributed to website loss in single organizations.
                     
                     A new team of NSCC administrators focused on student recruitment and discontinued
                     funding for Hawthorne in Salem’s maintenance. At FERI, the installation of a new CEO
                     preceded the organization’s decision to withdraw support from the New Deal Network
                     website’s further development. Years later, a broader change in institutional objectives
                     preceded the organization’s decision to remove the website from use entirely. </div>
                  
                  <div class="counter"><a href="#p50">50</a></div>
                  <div class="ptext" id="p50">The same factor also shaped legacy websites’ histories in another way. Researchers
                     have noted that collaboration and partnerships often contribute to the development
                     of new online digital humanities materials, but they have not recognized that these
                     arrangements’ changing terms or outright dissolution may cause website loss. The New
                     Deal Network site emerged at FERI with significant support form partner organizations.
                     
                     As partners departed the project, FERI administrators found themselves lacking the
                     resources they had provided and determined that the project could not move forward
                     without them. At UIUC, one university unit’s seemingly minor change of policy began
                     a chain of events that led to River Web’s loss. </div>

                  <div class="ptext" id="p51">Researchers and practitioners have suggested that obsolete websites are likely to
                     attract hackers’ intrusions but have not furnished specific examples of such acts
                     or their consequences for legacy websites. Nor have they explored how administrators’
                     awareness of this threat alone might affect legacy resources. The record shows that
                     online intruders attacked an obsolete, NEH-EDD funded website at NSCC, 
                     leading administrators to remove it from further use. Hackers apparently did not exploit
                     Decision Point! as a ready point of entry to Auburn University’s network, but administrators
                     removed it from use when they recognized its vulnerability. In both cases officials
                     acted on an aspect of administrative duty that proponents of legacy websites’ active
                     management never anticipated, 
                     producing NEH-EDD funded resource loss rather than successful preservation. Individuals
                     and groups concerned about the future of legacy digital humanities websites should
                     not assume that integrating these resources into organizations’ planning and resource
                     allocation activities will chart a sure course toward sustaining them. </div>
                  
                  <div class="counter"><a href="#p52">52</a></div>
                  <div class="ptext" id="p52">If the above factors frustrated attempts to establish successful, active management
                     of NEH-EDD funded websites in their original organizational contexts, they also prevented
                     libraries from stepping in to sustain them. When Auburn University library administrators
                     declined to adopt Decision Point!, they noted that they lacked the funds to rebuild
                     it in a form capable of meeting the university’s security standards. 
                     At NSCC, the library that college officials asked to take responsibility for a similarly
                     outmoded Hawthorne in Salem lacked the resources, including funds, personnel, hardware,
                     and software, to rebuild it in a secure form. The Franklin D. Roosevelt Presidential
                     Library’s change of course toward the development of its own digital library contributed
                     to the loss of the New Deal Network. 
                     No evidence documents UIUC libraries leaders’ reasons for specifically declining to
                     adopt River Web, but the record does show that they developed an unwillingness to
                     adopt websites built in other units of the university due to the great technical difficulty
                     and expense required to do so. </div>
                  
                  <div class="counter"><a href="#p53">53</a></div>
                  <div class="ptext" id="p53">Two factors affecting legacy website sustainability emerged in the record of the River
                     Web project that did not appear in the other three cases. At UIUC, research attempting
                     to develop new technology itself, rather than software changes created by research,
                     contributed to the loss of the website. These activities did not interfere with attempts
                     to devise a system of active management for River Web, 
                     nor did they discourage the university libraries from taking responsibility for it.
                     Rather they provided the immediate cause of the server failure that destroyed the
                     project’s data. That failure should not have proved fatal to the website. University
                     policy mandated automatic backups of materials that its divisions presented online,
                     but UIUC College of Arts and Sciences’ Information Technology staff members failed
                     to follow it. 
                     Although the lack of backup data figures largely in an accounting of River Web’s disappearance
                     from use, the record provides no further clues as to why it occurred. Simple human
                     fallibility may explain it. Readers’ experiences with the bureaucracies that constitute
                     institutions of higher learning may suggest a variety of other reasons why it occurred.
                     A review of River Web’s history cannot explain how a failure to backup data occurred,
                     
                     but it must acknowledge that it contributed to the site’s demise. This suggests that
                     seemingly random or unaccountable factors may help to hinder, or perhaps assist, legacy
                     website sustainability efforts.

                  <div class="ptext" id="p54">This article is the third in a series examining the issue of legacy digital humanities
                     website sustainability. Its findings complement those of two earlier studies. The
                     first publication found that 40 of 59 NEH-EDD funded websites created between 1996
                     and 2005 (68%) survived to 2020. Calculations based on the data collected indicated
                     that the online resources under review enjoyed an average estimated online lifespan
                     of 16.4 years [<a class="ref" href="#vandecreek2022">VandeCreek 2022</a>, 99].
                     This far surpassed a previous estimate that found that free-use digital humanities
                     websites remained online for an average of five years [<a class="ref" href="#meneses_etal2019">Meneses et al 2019</a>, 131].</div>

                  <div class="ptext" id="p55">The second entry in the series reviewed legacy websites funded by the NEH-EDD program
                     that had survived to 2020. It showed that eight of nine resources found online in
                     2020 remained there in 2022 [<a class="ref" href="#vandecreek2023">VandeCreek 2023</a>]. This finding again suggested notable success in sustaining legacy online digital
                     humanities materials, but the investigation also revealed several aspects of a more
                     complex situation. As researchers had already discovered in other contexts, 
                     center staff members devised an ad hoc approach to legacy website sustainability,
                     which often did not provide updates necessary to keep online materials’ software compatible
                     with changing web technology. Nor did they replace deprecated software. Without institutional
                     resources to support these activities, the sites became increasingly obsolete.The
                     case of the eighth sustained website once again presented evidence of success mixed
                     with more problematic particulars. 
                     Although university administrators provided their library with resources to rebuild
                     a popular online resource in conformity with information standards and current web
                     technology, they produced a distinctly qualified accomplishment. Some 10 years after
                     the completing the rebuilding project, the site’s creator found it necessary to overhaul
                     it again to keep pace with available technology and user expectations. He did so at
                     another institution where he had recently retired as university president. 
                     In both cases rebuilding the website required large amounts of institutional resources
                     and political capital, which many digital humanists may be unable to muster. The second
                     article in this series closed by suggesting that grant-making organizations might
                     administer a competitive process distributing funds for reconstructing them, either
                     with new web software or in keeping with the Endings Project’s emphasis on static
                     websites. </div>

                  <div class="ptext" id="p56">Recent publications have argued that digital humanities website sustainability efforts
                     have reached an inflection point and can benefit from new approaches. While compelling,
                     their contentions rest on a relatively narrow evidentiary record, largely comprised
                     of observations made at two digital humanities centers. The second article in this
                     series augmented this record by providing data showing that familiar methods and practices
                     relying on database technology and other web software have become ineffective, 
                     in part due to a lack of institutional resources devoted to legacy materials. This
                     article’s review of four failed websites originally funded by the NEH-EDD program
                     supplies still more supporting evidence for the “inflection point” hypothesis, but
                     from a different perspective. Recent publications making this assertion have largely
                     focused on factors that make present methods of sustaining legacy websites untenable,
                     and which might cause resource loss in the future. 
                     By contrast, this discussion has examined factors that have already made four NEH-EDD
                     funded websites unavailable for use. Some of this evidence documents events and processes
                     bringing digital humanists and their online materials to grief in ways that authors
                     discussing causes of legacy website loss have not considered. </div>

                  <div class="ptext" id="p57">A fuller understanding of the complex ways in which website loss actually occurred
                     can inform a more effective response to the present situation. The Endings Project’s
                     approach provides an excellent starting point for an expanded discussion of how creators
                     of legacy digital humanities websites, as well as technologists and administrators,
                     may be able to sustain them. Endings Project staff members have made a sound prima
                     facie case showing that 
                     converting legacy websites using databases and other web technologies to a static
                     format can promote their sustainability. However, this article’s emphasis on examining
                     website loss in specific contexts suggests that one size may not fit all. Even if
                     reconstructing websites in static form produces improved sustainability in some cases,
                     it may prove impracticable in others. Additional research can test the proposition
                     that the construction of static websites can provide 
                     improved sustainability in different contexts. Granting organizations might fund projects
                     rebuilding at-risk websites in a static format, while at the same time documenting
                     and evaluating how organizations of different types, sizes, and financial means did
                     so. “What costs can an organization expect to incur in the course of rebuilding a website
                     in a static format?” “ What expertise or other institutional capacity does this type of website reconstruction
                     require?”
                     “What drawbacks or sacrifices of function might a static website entail, as compared
                     to a resource using database and other web software?” A more ambitious project might trace a single website or set of websites reconstructed
                     in two formats, one employing updated web software and another as a static resource.

                     and expense each version of the site required for a length of time after the end of
                     the grant period, and the sites’ overall effectiveness. 
                     From this perspective researchers and practitioners might be able to determine effective
                     ways forward toward improved legacy website sustainability.
