                  <p>This study underscores the importance of adequate data preprocessing, transparency,
                     and documentation in digital history research, showcasing how these often overlooked
                     practices impact research quality and reproducibility. We present a topic modelling
                     case study involving over 160,000 records of official correspondence of the Atlantic
                     Portuguese Empire from 1640 to 1822 to illustrate how these practices, associated
                     with standardised formats and metadata conventions, facilitate the sharing and reproduction
                     of experiments. First, we evaluate the impact of data cleaning and preprocessing on
                     model performance. Second, concerning model selection, we compare the performance
                     of latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA), latent semantic indexing (LSI), and Gibbs sampling
                     algorithm for a Dirichlet mixture model (GSDMM). Besides stressing the underestimated
                     significance of data preprocessing and transparent documentation to strengthen research
                     robustness and contribute to a reproducibility culture, we also demonstrate the potential
                     of topic modelling in digital historical studies, specifically in the context of the
                     Atlantic Portuguese Empire.

                  <div class="ptext" id="p1">The tools of digital humanities have considerably broadened the perspectives of historical
                     scholarship. However, new opportunities do not come without challenges. In this paper
                     we discuss one of these new challenges historians are facing: dealing with huge amounts
                     of data that require methodological practices previously unfamiliar to these scholars.</div>
                  
                  <div class="counter"><a href="#p2">2</a></div>
                  <div class="ptext" id="p2">Historical research prior to the 1970s and 1980s is often referred to as “pre-digital”
                     quantitative history. The term “pre-digital” encompasses two important aspects within
                     historical studies: Firstly, it refers to the period before the widespread introduction
                     of computer software for quantitative data analysis. Secondly, it represents a time
                     before the increasing accessibility of digitised archival collections and their storage
                     in machine-readable formats (Burrows, 2023; Kesner, 1982). One of the first widely
                     known experiments in digital analysis of historical data can be found in the pioneering
                     work of William O. Aydelotte in 1963 (Aydelotte, 1963). Yet, digital (automated) data
                     extraction and preprocessing took much longer to become part of the digital historian
                     toolbox and only became widely used in the 21st century. (Pettersson et al., 2016).</div>
                  
                  <div class="counter"><a href="#p3">3</a></div>
                  <div class="ptext" id="p3">In Padgett and Ansell’s study on the rise of the Medici family in 15th century Florence,
                     a network analysis was carried out in which a basic dataset was created by manually
                     extracting data from various published and unpublished sources (Padgett and Ansell,
                     1993). Different types of relationships were manually coded, from kinship and patronage
                     to personal and financial ties. Charles Wetherell, Andrejs Plakans, and Barry Wellman
                     also used manual extraction of historical data for network analysis (Wetherell et
                     al., 1994). The primary data source came from nominal censuses covering the period
                     from 1795 to 1850, whose extraction was crucial in defining both the extent and structure
                     of the personal communities of peasants residing in Pinkenhof in the Russian Baltic
                     Province of Livland. Timothy Brook’s approach was similar to the previously discussed
                     manual data extraction methods (Brook, 1981). In researching Chinese trade networks
                     during the 16th century under the Ming dynasty, he extracted and listed relevant information
                     to create a table of place names and the corresponding administrative level and modern
                     Chinese nomenclature.</div>

                  <div class="ptext" id="p4">With the growing interest in open access archives, many libraries in the Western hemisphere
                     have introduced complex methods such as Optical Character Recognition (OCR) to digitise
                     their collections (Salmi, 2020). This trend started with the initiative of governments
                     and private companies in the 1980s who wanted to make their documentation more accessible
                     (Kesner, 1982). An important observation that Richard Kesner made at the time was
                     that archivists have traditionally struggled to agree on standardising metadata, as
                     it was impossible to use a uniform format for different archival sources (Kesner,
                     1982). The lack of a standardised format for historical records is a key reason why
                     this article highlights the importance of appropriate preprocessing in digital history.</div>
                  
                  <div class="counter"><a href="#p5">5</a></div>
                  <div class="ptext" id="p5">When considering the profound impact that digital tools have on data-driven historical
                     research, two different approaches can be identified: the traditional method of manual
                     extraction followed by computer analysis, and the fully digital approach, where computational
                     tools are used from the outset. When it comes to analysing networks, many historians
                     opt for manual extraction on the one hand and then use tools such as Python, Gephi,
                     or Nodegoat to map data, visualise relationships, and construct their arguments on
                     the other (Haggerty and Haggerty, 2011; Verbruggen et al., 2020; ANTUNES, 2021; Ye,
                     2022). On the other hand, automated extraction can be performed from either digital
                     databases and repositories with previously carefully prepared metadata (Wittek and
                     Ravenek, 2011; Petz and Pfeffer, 2021; Geraerts and Vasques Filho, 2024), born-digital
                     sources (Linkevicius de Andrade and Vasques Filho, 2022), or using Natural Language
                     Processing (NLP) methods to extract entities directly from traditional historical
                     sources (Elwert, 2020; Zbíral and Shaw, 2022).</div>
                  
                  <div class="counter"><a href="#p6">6</a></div>
                  <div class="ptext" id="p6">Having a paper document and creating a dataset with proper metadata are challenging
                     tasks that require several steps. For instance, Elo describes how he processed the
                     documents with OCR software and then used a Python programme to extract data such
                     as institutions, parties and individuals (Elo, 2020). In another example, using data
                     made available in Extensible Markup Language (XML) transcriptions of baptisms and
                     marriages, Geraerts and Vasques Filho investigated religious choice in the 18th century
                     (Geraerts and Vasques Filho, 2024). With Python scripts, they extracted the content
                     of interest from the transcriptions and organised it in comma-separated values (CSV)
                     files. These data were then ingested into a specifically designed graph database —
                     modelled to connect people, events, and places — in such a way to facilitate quantitative
                     and qualitative network analysis.</div>
                  
                  <div class="counter"><a href="#p7">7</a></div>
                  <div class="ptext" id="p7">Computer-assisted historical research thus offers a wide range of possibilities for
                     the analysis of manually or automatically extracted data. These methods include social
                     network analysis (ANTUNES,</div>
                  
                  <div class="counter"><a href="#p8">8</a></div>
                  <div class="ptext" id="p8">2021; Petz and Pfeffer, 2021; Ye, 2022; Geraerts and Vasques Filho, 2024; Linkevicius
                     de Andrade and Vasques Filho, 2022), quantitative analysis (Haggerty and Haggerty,
                     2011), semantic text modelling (Zbíral and Shaw, 2022), topic modelling and random
                     indexing (Wittek and Ravenek, 2011; Brauer and Fridlund, 2013; Ravenek et al., 2017),
                     spatial methods (Verbruggen et al., 2020), or even a mix of them (Ravenek et al.,
                     2017; Curran et al., 2018; Elwert, 2020). That said, collected data is usually not
                     ready for direct processing during the data analysis stage of the research – preprocessing
                     is required in between. Jentsch and Porada illustrated the steps of digital research,
                     showing the pipeline from unstructured text to structured data, that begins with data
                     collection, moving to the OCR process, NLP methods, data access, and ends with data
                     interpretation (Jentsch and Porada, 2021, p. 90).</div>
                  
                  <div class="counter"><a href="#p9">9</a></div>
                  <div class="ptext" id="p9">The lack of standardised metadata for historical and archival sources makes the preprocessing
                     stage (with its proper documentation) even more relevant in historical research; as
                     mentioned, this is one of the driving forces behind this discussion. Nevertheless,
                     scholars in the field of digital history often prioritise data collection, interpretation,
                     and especially visualisation, often overlooking the critical intermediate steps. Referring
                     to the early example of computational analysis of voting data in the House of Commons,
                     Aydelotte summarised the preprocessing stage with a single statement: “I am confident
                     that the information currently stored on my cards is largely accurate” (Aydelotte,
                     1963, p. 139). Still, repeating this experiment or adapting it to our needs seems
                     to be an arduous task or even impossible. Reproducibility involves much more than
                     just repetition and verification, but also an understanding of the meticulous steps
                     that digital historians take to arrive at their results. In examining Padgett and
                     Ansell’s exploration of the rise of the Medici family, to take yet another example,
                     questions naturally arise about the methods they use to organise both published and
                     unpublished sources, as well as their approach to standardising data. These concerns
                     exist not only in cases where the data was extracted manually, but also in automated
                     processes. </div>
                  
                  <div class="counter"><a href="#p10">10</a></div>
                  <div class="ptext" id="p10">Such examples underscore a broader concern in the field: ensuring that research can
                     be replicated or validated by others in order to maintain credibility (Peng, 2011).
                     While this practice is becoming increasingly important (Stodden et al., 2014; Peng
                     and Hicks, 2021), the field of digital history presents a particular challenge. As
                     previously mentioned, digital historians often prioritise data collection and visualisation
                     over adequate documentation of the preprocessing stage required for reproducibility.</div>

                     digital historical research, we observe that steps 1 and 2 (experimental design and
                     data collection) and steps 4 and 5 (data analysis and interpretation of results) are
                     disproportionately emphasised. In contrast, step 3, the preprocessing phase, is often
                     not reported with comparable detail. Our earlier works also share that characteristic
                     and did not give much attention to the importance of the data preparatory decisions
                     (Błoch et al., 2021, 2022, in press).</div>

                     documents – in particular, how different choices of text preparation (filtering) and

                     we review the stages of the typical workflow of digital history and the place the
                     preprocessing takes in it – types of preprocessing decisions usually made, their impact
                     illustrated with examples. In section 3, we discuss motivations, approaches, and solutions
                     regarding the proper documentation as well as metadata creation and standardisation.
                     Section 4 describes the case study in which we show how substantively impactful the
                     preprocessing decisions can be. Finally, the paper concludes with a discussion in

                  <div class="ptext" id="p15">Preprocessing is an iterative process that includes activities related to data preparation,
                     such as cleaning and normalising data, spelling corrections, reducing imperfections,
                     solving problems with missing data, and, in the case of textual data, also lemmatising/stemming
                     and sometimes even removing stop words or tags (Kunilovskaya and Plum, 2021; García
                     et al., 2016). This particular stage is of great importance, even if it is not very
                     fascinating and takes up a lot of time. Kunilovskaya and Plum claim that this stage
                     is believed to take up to 80% of the entire research process. Nevertheless, they also
                     refer to a report based on a survey in which the average time spent by 2,300 respondents
                     worldwide in this critical phase was 45% (Kunilovskaya and Plum, 2021). It is also
                     worth noting that this is an iterative process due to the eventual need to perform
                     some steps more than once. For example, after executing the preprocessing pipeline
                     and analysing the processed data, we noticed that a few terms were not removed because
                     they were not present in the stop words list, for example. In this case, we modified
                     this step to include these terms and performed the cleaning again.</div>
                  
                  <div class="counter"><a href="#p16">16</a></div>
                  <div class="ptext" id="p16">These general preprocessing challenges become even more complex in the context of
                     digital historical research due to the discrepancies between historical sources, archival
                     practices and the nature of the documents in question. Determining whether the documents
                     are digitised or physical, their linguistic diversity and their categorisation (e.g.,
                     administrative, religious or private) is crucial (Matthew and Bannister, 2020; Broadwell
                     et al., 2020). Each of these elements requires different approaches and an accurate
                     assessment of the advantages and disadvantages of dealing with historical data.</div>

                  <div class="ptext" id="p17">In light of these complexities, thorough documentation of the preprocessing phase
                     significantly increases data quality and fosters reproducibility. It is important
                     that researchers provide insights into best practices for the manual extraction of
                     data from both unprinted (Antunes, 2021) and printed materials (Ye, 2022), including
                     analyses of small and large corpora (Elo, 2020; Elwert, 2020). In addition, sharing
                     methods for standardising and cleaning data from existing databases and digital sources
                     (Petz and Pfeffer, 2021; Geraerts and Vasques Filho, 2024) together with identifying
                     the most useful metadata for specific research purposes (Zbíral and Shaw, 2022; Ravenek
                     et al., 2017) is a promising way to advance the field of digital history. The question
                     of how researchers engage with sources in different non-English languages (Wittek
                     and Ravenek, 2011; Błoch et al., 2022) can also provide important insights for the
                     broader community of digital historians focusing on non-mainstream materials and incorporating
                     more marginalised archival collections. </div>

                     under an open access license can be found in the work done by Jiménez-Badillo et al.
                     (Jiménez-Badillo et al., 2020). The authors meticulously explain their methodology,
                     focusing in particular on geographical text analysis, and describing in detail the
                     individual steps and the challenges encountered in the process. It also provides knowledge
                     about digital research and bridges the gap between data collection and data analysis
                     by explaining what should be done in between.</div>

                     of the nature and characteristics of the sources (raw data) – is essential to improve
                     result quality and reproducibility. Regarding the latter, the objective is to enable
                     other researchers who follow the described methodology to arrive at similar conclusions,
                     or build upon previous results, when working with the same data. When it comes to
                     results quality, as preprocessing is an iterative process, researchers can improve
                     the results by optimising the approaches performed in this phase by maintaining a
                     good documentation. If the preprocessing steps are insufficiently described, each
                     iteration can generate more difficulties and uncertainties to digital historians.</div>

                  <div class="ptext" id="p20">The preprocessing pipeline (Figure 2) is employed to enhance the quality of the raw
                     data (Lee et al., 2017; Fan et al., 2021; Engel et al., 2013), after data acquisition
                     (or collection). It usually involves multiple steps addressing issues such as scattering,
                     baseline changes, peak shifts, noise, missing values, and various other artefacts
                     (Mishra et al., 2020). This process is the foundation for robust and valid data analysis.
                     The preprocessing pipeline should take into account the specificities of the data
                     and the requirements of the data analysis models, help unveil relevant underlying
                     structures and, when necessary, accurately predict properties of interest (Mishra
                     et al., 2020; Engel et al., 2013).</div>

                  <div class="ptext" id="p21">Extensive research has yielded a variety of preprocessing techniques (Mishra et al.,
                     2020; Fan et al., 2021). Within the spectrum of these proposed methodologies, some
                     are tailored towards the automated identification of preprocessing strategies (Mishra
                     et al., 2019, 2020), while others address specific tasks, such as data transformations
                     and standardisation (Cao et al., 1999; Baxter, 1995; Shanker et al., 1996). Synergistically
                     employing multiple preprocessing techniques can effectively mitigate artefacts that
                     persist when relying solely on a singular technique. Figure 2 depicts an example of
                     a preprocessing pipeline.</div>

                  <div class="ptext" id="p22">Usually, cleaning is the first preprocessing step. It aims to transform raw data into
                     a clean, consistent, and reliable dataset that is accurate, amenable to subsequent
                     analyses, modelling, and interpretation (Rahm et al., 2000). In this step, we address
                     issues such as identifying and treating missing values, outliers, duplicates, and
                     any inconsistencies in the data.</div>

                  <div class="ptext" id="p23">Next, one might require data reduction and scaling depending on the data characteristics
                     (e.g., high dimensional data) or problem tackled (e.g., classification and regression
                     tasks). Data reduction aims to reduce the volume of data without losing important
                     information (Lelewer and Hirschberg, 1987). It focuses on relevant data and eliminating
                     noise or redundancy. In contrast, data scaling involves transforming the features
                     of a dataset so that they fall within a similar scale or range (Cao et al., 2016;
                     Alshdaifat et al., 2021). Scaling the data can mitigate the risk of, for example,
                     feature dominance due to their larger magnitudes.</div>

                     of maintaining a record of all the changes made during the data preprocessing. This

                     the EDA, we check summary statistics, distributions, and relationships among variables
                     to ensure the data look as expected. Lastly, let us highlight again that preprocessing
                     is not a one-time task. As new data become available or the data collection process
                     evolves, it is recommended to revisit and update the pipeline.</div>

                        models is widely known and accepted (Alshdaifat et al., 2021; Zelaya, 2019). Despite
                        the challenges of assessing this effect, research from several domains has shown the
                        positive impact of proper selection and application of preprocessing tools on the
                        quality of the results (Zhu and Gao, 2016; Rinnan et al., 2009; Lee et al., 2017;
                        Joo et al., 2000; Alshdaifat et al., 2021). The magnitude of these gains depends on
                        several factors (Zhu and Gao, 2016), such as the dataset characteristics (e.g. size,
                        dimensionality, and missing values) and the problem tackled (e.g. classification,
                        regression, and clustering), but we can find examples of 25% improvement when comparing
                        the model results of an optimal preprocessing pipeline to the global model (Rinnan
                        et al., 2009). Also, enhancements in the learning rate and terminal error were reported
                        for neural network models when using adequate preprocessing (Joo et al., 2000).</div>

                        Both data reduction (either by size or dimensionality) and scaling (with clarified

                        for non-experts (Bazjanac and Kiviniemi, 2007). These tasks simplify the dataset,
                        making it more manageable and accessible, and allow analysts to focus on relevant

                        application further augments the intricacy of the problem (Engel et al., 2013).</div>

                  <div class="ptext" id="p35">The lack of a golden preprocessing standard amplifies the relevance of a proper documentation
                     in the digital humanities; but documentation is not limited to this stage only. Throughout
                     this section, the term “documentation” refers to the systematic recording, detailing,
                     and archiving of all aspects related to the research process. This process includes
                     documenting the research design, methodologies, procedures, data collection techniques,
                     analytical methods, results, interpretations, and conclusions. The primary purpose
                     of documentation is to ensure transparency and reproducibility of the research findings
                     (Gorgolewski and Poldrack, 2016). It provides a comprehensive record that allows other
                     researchers to understand, evaluate, replicate, and build upon the study.</div>

                  <div class="ptext" id="p36">From the reproducibility perspective, the meticulous documentation of every step in
                     data preprocessing is paramount since they transform the raw data into a format suitable
                     for analysis (Gibert et al., 2016); each step can significantly impact the outcomes
                     and conclusions of the research. Moreover, detailing the parameters and configurations
                     of the methods employed in the study is another crucial element for improving reproducibility
                     and transparency (Haibe-Kains et al., 2020). Parameters such as scaling factors, normalisation
                     methods, missing data imputation techniques, and feature selection criteria can profoundly
                     impact the data characteristics and the subsequent analytical results. By documenting
                     these parameters and the rationale for their selection, researchers also provide insights
                     into the preprocessing decisions, justify the chosen methodologies, and enable critical
                     evaluation and validation of the research process.</div>

                     to document the software used. Different software packages may have distinct algorithms,
                     functionalities, and default settings that can influence the preprocessing outcomes
                     (Chirigati et al., 2016). Through the specification of the software version, modules,
                     and any custom scripts or plugins, researchers enable others to replicate the research,
                     ensuring consistency across studies. Moreover, by leveraging these documents, researchers
                     can identify and address sources of bias, ensure consistency in data handling, and
                     mitigate the risk of errors.</div>

                     first steps of the research workflow (i.e., experimental design, as seen in Figure
                     1). For example, creating well-documented research data and methodologies during the
                     experimental design enhances research reproducibility and helps experts evaluate the
                     research methodology, data quality, interpretations, and limitations. Also, it allows

                     also data creation and analysis. Clear documentation enables educators to incorporate

                     the documentation process. For example, the guiding FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable,
                     Reusable) data principles (Jacobsen et al., 2020) are designed to enhance the management,
                     sharing, and reuse of research data and digital resources. Developed by the scientific
                     community, these principles aim to address challenges related to data discovery, accessibility,
                     documentation, integration, and sustainability across diverse disciplines and data
                     infrastructures (Lamprecht et al., 2020). The FAIR principles can be summarised as
                     follows:</div>

                           formats. Accessibility ensures that data is available for analysis, validation, and

                           adhering to established data models and conventions. This principle enables researchers
                           to combine data from multiple sources, perform cross-disciplinary analyses, and derive

                     (DDI) – an international standard for documenting social, behavioural, economic, and
                     health science data (Rasmussen and Blank, 2007). The DDI specification provides a
                     comprehensive framework for describing the various aspects of data, including its
                     collection, processing, distribution, and use. It aims to facilitate the interoperability,
                     preservation, and sharing of research data by promoting standardised metadata documentation.
                     This standard can be beneficial when describing and documenting data sources from
                     the conceptualisation to the archival stages.</div>

                     support the implementation, management, and use of its metadata standards. These range
                     from metadata editors and converters to validation tools and repositories (Blank and
                     Rasmussen, 2004). For example, the DDI Codebook (DDI Initiative, 2024a) is an XML-based
                     structured documentation format that facilitates the creation of codebooks, data dictionaries,
                     and questionnaires using the metadata standards. It enables researchers to document
                     survey instruments, variables, question text, response categories, and other relevant
                     information in a standardised format. The DDI covers all major content areas but is
                     generally limited to descriptive narrative.</div>

                     2024c). The latter is a comprehensive metadata standard that supports the documentation
                     of the entire research data lifecycle, from conceptualisation and data collection
                     to data processing, analysis, dissemination, and archiving. The DDI Lifecycle provides

                     to facilitate the creation, editing, validation, and management of DDI metadata. These
                     tools provide graphical user interfaces, templates, wizards, and validation checks
                     to assist researchers, data professionals, and organisations in implementing DDI standards
                     effectively. Some tools enable metadata transformation, conversion, and interoperability
                     between different formats and standards. Tools such as structured data transformation
                     language (SDTL) and extended knowledge organisation system (XKOS) support the conversion
                     of metadata to and from DDI XML, DDI Codebook, SDMX, RDF, and other relevant formats,
                     ensuring compatibility and consistency across data systems and platforms (DDI Initiative,

                     implementation, and best practices of DDI standards. These resources provide guidance,
                     tutorials, case studies, and examples to assist users in understanding and applying
                     DDI metadata standards effectively. Also, local initiatives, such as the European
                     Open Science Cloud (EOSC) (Budroni et al., 2019) and the German National Research
                     Data Infrastructure (NFDI) (Klingner et al. 2023), are proposed to create a unified
                     and accessible ecosystem for research data and digital resources. Both projects aim
                     to accelerate the transition towards open science by providing researchers and institutions
                     access to a wide range of research data, tools, services, and infrastructures.</div>

                  <div class="ptext" id="p46">Historical research can benefit from applying the FAIR framework or the DDI initiative.
                     For example, the findable principle from FAIR could be used to standardize the metadata
                     created to describe historical sources (e.g., author, period, location). This standardization
                     will aid the creation of searchable databases for archival materials and digitized
                     records. These steps also benefit research using digital methods since a standard
                     data representation reduces the amount of data preparation for applying digital methods.</div>

                     historical research, particularly for its reproducibility. Accessible data means storing
                     historical datasets in open repositories with clear access protocols. It also requires
                     ensuring long-term digital preservation to prevent data loss. This step helps to guarantee
                     that the research is reproducible and verifiable and that data remains valid for future

                     data and metadata comply with the interoperable principle of FAIR. In this case, instead
                     of using some proprietary or OS-specific data format, researchers should opt, for
                     example, for XML, CSV, and JSON as their data format. Lastly, the reusability principle
                     will ensure that historians build upon previous research by providing clear documentation
                     on data sources, methodology, and provenance.</div>

                     can be provided as supplemental material, for example. Git repositories are also an
                     excellent alternative for digital historians to share their code analysis of the data.
                     For data, there are free data repositories that can also be linked to the population,

                        models to achieve better results. Our preprocessing pipeline consists of data cleaning
                        and transformation, while data scaling and reduction were unnecessary. We refer to
                        “data cleaning,” as to a series of procedures to remove unnecessary text elements.
                        These elements include special characters, parentheses and brackets, location and
                        people’s names, and dates.</div>

                        as it only contains metadata (date, original location of the letter, and archival
                        information) which is useful for other types of analysis but not for topic modelling
                        — metadata do not contain semantic information relevant for our purposes. To illustrate
                        our point, we can take the word Lisbon as an example. Several documents are sent from/to
                        Lisbon; due to the high frequency of this work, the models could create a topic grouping
                        all documents referencing it. In this scenario, the matter discussed in those documents
                        could be related to military, religious, administrative or any other subject. Hence,
                        the group based on the location is not helpful. Figure 3 shows an example text with

                        marks, brackets, parentheses, and a string of white space characters. We also leverage
                        a Named Entity Recognition (NER) model (Nadeau and Sekine, 2007; Błoch et al., 2022)
                        to remove names of people and locations present in the body of the text. As we explained
                        before, grouping the documents by location is irrelevant to knowing the actual topic
                        discussed in them. Analogously, we remove people’s names as, besides the lack of meaningful
                        information, grouping by names could lead to misinterpretations due to homonyms (e.g.,
                        grouping all documents referencing “Maria" would aggregate both commoners and a queen).</div>

                     <div class="ptext" id="p61">Together with the NER model, we could employ other methods to identify and remove
                        people and locations from the text. For instance, we could filter the text by creating
                        a list of location names from Portugal and the colonies and using libraries available
                        on the web that provide a list of people’s common names per location and language.
                        The main drawback of this approach is the continuous effort of feeding these lists
                        with locations and people not previously captured. Thus, we opted for the NER model
                        as, instead of searching for specific words characterised as location names, the model
                        learns from examples of the patterns in the text that indicate that a noun is a location
                        name. The model’s performance depends on the quantity and quality of the examples
                        provided during its training phase.</div>

                     <div class="ptext" id="p62">Several NER libraries and pre-trained models are available for our use, provided they
                        work with texts in Portuguese. As we are using Python and due to the availability
                        of resources, we chose to experiment with the spaCy library (Srinivasa-Desikan, 2018)
                        and its pretrained models. Nevertheless, the amount of pre-trained models and the
                        best-performing ones are usually for texts in English. In our case, although pre-trained
                        models in Portuguese are available, they are based on a modern version of Portuguese,
                        usually from news and social media data sources. Hence, their accuracy with historical
                        texts is impacted. Figure 4 shows an example of entities recognised in one sample
                        of our dataset by the pre-trained NER Portuguese model (spaCy, 2024).</div>

                     <div class="ptext" id="p63">Although this model can reach accuracy levels up to 89% because it was trained using
                        news sources of modern Portuguese, the accuracy in our data can be much lower for
                        documents from the 17th until the beginning of the 19th century (Błoch et al., 2022).
                        As seen in Figure 4, one of the problems of this model is the long names that are
                        identified as multiple entities. Another drawback of using a pre-trained model is
                        the limitation of the type of entities it can recognise. We can see in Figure 4 that
                        titles and occupations (e.g., king, prince, queen, viceroy, duke, general) were not
                        tagged as this model was not trained to identify them.</div>
                     
                     <div class="counter"><a href="#p64">64</a></div>
                     <div class="ptext" id="p64">Due to these entity identification issues related to the specificities of our data,
                        we trained a custom model by providing examples from our corpus. The training process
                        is described in our previous work (Błoch et al., 2022), and this new model achieved
                        an overall accuracy of 93,1%. The main drawback of a custom NER model is the time
                        required to select, annotate, and train it. Still, compared to general pre-trained
                        models, it has several advantages, such as enhanced performance in the problem tackled
                        and the definition of additional entities we wish to identify. For example, besides
                        identifying locations, our custom model can distinguish between masculine and feminine
                        names and identify titles, occupations and different types of organisations (e.g.,
                        military and religious).</div>
                     
                     <div class="counter"><a href="#p65">65</a></div>
                     <div class="ptext" id="p65">Figure 5 presents the entities recognised in the text shown in Figure 4. We can see
                        in Figure 5 a better identification of people’s names when compared to the pre-trained
                        model. We can also observe that titles and occupations were tagged in the model trained
                        in our data. Having a better NER model in our preprocessing pipeline means that fewer
                        irrelevant entities will reach the topic modelling, making the topics less noisy.
                        Omitting the usage of NER to clean the text or even not disclosing the usage of a
                        custom model impacts the results that can be achieved in the topic modelling stage.
                        Figure 6 shows examples of the impact of not using NER models to filter out irrelevant
                        text elements on the LDA performance. We can see in Figure 6(B) the presence of location
                        names such as “baía”, “espírito_santo” and “maranhao”. Not all documents in those
                        groups are from this location, which can lead to a false interpretation that the other
                        keywords in those groups are related to those places.</div>

                        examples of topics obtained without removing stopwords are dominated by these words
                        that contribute little to the understanding of the main subject of the groups. Figure

                        Portuguese Empire. Words such as "captain," "regiment," "patent," and "confirmation"
                        indicate a focus on military organization, ranks, and official appointments. These
                        terms could be a reflection of how Portugal managed its colonial territories through
                        a hierarchical system of governance and defense, essential for maintaining control
                        over vast regions. The presence of terms like "prince" and "regent" further indicates
                        connections to royal authority, underscoring the centralized nature of decision-making

                        and bigrams. The creation of n-grams and lemmatisation can sometimes be classified
                        as feature extraction or feature engineering, depending on the research (Poulston
                        et al., 2015). Regardless of the classification, it is well-established that topic
                        models can benefit from these procedures (Nikolenko et al., 2017; Skorkovská, 2012;

                        These procedures transform the original data into other structures or change the word
                        form. For example, we apply lemmatisation to group the different inflected forms of
                        a word, reducing them to their base or root form — called the lemma (Korenius et al.,
                        2004) — to normalise and simplify the text for analysis and understanding. Another
                        example of data transformation applied is the creation of n-grams (Sidorov et al.,
                        2014).</div>

                     <div class="ptext" id="p79">The main benefits of the usage of n-grams are related to capturing collocations and
                        improving topic coherence. N-grams, especially bigrams and trigrams, allow the model
                        to identify and group together frequently appearing phrases. Also, single words might
                        have multiple meanings, and by employing n-grams, the model can differentiate between
                        these meanings and create more focused topics. This representation can be particularly
                        valuable if your topics are defined by specific terminology, such as “Espírito Santo"
                        or “Rio de Janeiro", both location names. However, without using n-grams, the model
                        would interpret these terms in isolation, leading to inaccurate evaluations of their
                        meaning. For example, “Espírito" and “Santo" (i.e., from Portuguese “Holy" and “Spirit”)
                        could be linked to documents discussing religious matters. While “Rio" and “Janeiro"
                        (i.e. from Portuguese “River" and “January”) could be interpreted as a location and
                        a date.</div>

                     <div class="ptext" id="p80">Our pipeline’s last data transformation method is TF-IDF (term frequency-inverse document
                        frequency) — a technique for weighing the importance of words in a document collection.
                        As the name suggests, it comprises two main components: term frequency (TF) and inverse
                        document frequency (IDF). The first gauges how often a word appears in a document
                        relative to its total word count. Words that appear frequently are more important
                        for that particular document. In contrast, IDF estimates how often a word appears
                        across all documents in the collection. The idea behind IDF is that words appearing
                        in many documents are less informative because they don’t distinguish the specific
                        content of a document.</div>

                     <div class="ptext" id="p81">By combining these factors, TF-IDF gives higher weights to frequent words within a
                        document but rare across the entire collection. This weighting scheme helps identify
                        the keywords that best characterise the specific topics covered in that document.
                        TF-IDF helps further filter out irrelevant words and emphasise the most informative
                        terms to uncover the underlying themes, leading to more accurate and meaningful topic

                     <div class="ptext" id="p88">Because our texts are short on average, they were ready for topic modelling right
                        after the preprocessing stage mentioned before. That said, for a corpus of long texts,
                        such as book chapters, it can be required to split the text into chunks that will
                        feed the models separately. The primary reasons behind this practice are twofold.
                        First, topic modelling algorithms can be computationally expensive with long texts,
                        and splitting the text into smaller chunks helps decrease the computational complexity
                        of processing the texts. Second, reducing the text size can positively impact the
                        topic coherence (i.e., how well the words within a topic relate to each other semantically).
                        This impact is linked to the possible jumps between different ideas or themes in long
                        texts.</div>

                     <div class="ptext" id="p89">It is necessary to note that the solution to the text length problem is more complex
                        than splitting the text into the smallest chunk size possible, and there is no one-size-fits-all
                        convention. Using very small chunks of text might not provide enough context for accurate
                        topic identification. Hence, when dealing with a corpora of lengthy texts, it is fundamental
                        to perform preliminary results to assess the impact of the text chunk sizes on the
                        topic modelling performance.</div>

                     <div class="ptext" id="p90">In our case, this assessment was unnecessary due to the short nature of our text sizes.
                        However, to test the hypotheses that text size can impact the model’s performance
                        and that traditional approaches, such as LDA and LSI, might not perform as well as
                        other models developed to work with short texts, such as the GSDMM, we will perform
                        experiments comparing the performance of these three models on our data using the
                        same preprocessing pipeline. Before presenting the results, we will discuss the model’s

                        topics using word clouds (i.e. representing the most relevant terms in each topic)
                        and visually analysing them. In this approach, we can employ two primary quality evaluation
                        criteria: the number of words overlapping in different groups and the possibility
                        to identify a group’s dominant subject. Hence, good solutions are described as well-defined

                     <div class="ptext" id="p94">Utilising our evaluation criteria for the word clouds, we can see in Figure 10 that
                        the LSI results were the only model that failed to meet both conditions. There are
                        a large number of overlapping terms across groups, such as “catalogue”, “confirmation”,
                        “bay”, “patent”, and “consultation”. Also, it is difficult to determine the relationship
                        between the terms inside each group. However, Figure 11 shows that the GSDMM presented
                        the best results with minimal overlapping relevant words and relatively cohesive topics,
                        while the LDA model had the second-best groups. Though a few terms overlap between
                        different groups in the LDA’s results, Figure 12 indicates that the main issue is
                        the difficulty of interpreting each group’s main topic.</div>

                     <div class="ptext" id="p95">Another approach is to use metrics to quantify the performance of the models. The
                        literature offers various metrics to evaluate and support the model selection process
                        (Meaney et al., 2023). However, it is essential to notice that a significant percentage
                        of these metrics require a ground truth (i.e., a dataset with the text and their expected
                        groups), which is not always possible. For example, the dataset used in this work
                        does not have the expected topical classification, which restricts the metrics that
                        can be applied.</div>

                     <div class="ptext" id="p96">In our experiments, we used the model coherence metric (Meaney et al., 2023) to measure
                        the interpretability and semantic coherence of the topics produced. This metric outputs
                        values from 0 to 1, in which a higher coherence score typically indicates that words
                        characterising a topic co-occur frequently across the documents in the corpus. Figure
                        13 shows an application of the coherence metric to evaluate LDA models with different
                        numbers of topics. The idea behind the experiment depicted in Figure 13 is to use
                        the metric to choose the best number of topics. In this approach, the best number
                        of topics will be the one that maximises the metric (e.g., the highest value for the
                        coherence metric). It is also possible to use multiple model evaluation strategies
                        and, for example, combine the use of metrics with the inspections of the top relevant
                        words per topic.</div>

                        topics provided in each figure. These samples represent groups in distinct quadrants
                        in the plot; the amount of overlapping of essential words (i.e., large ones) is considerably

                        search algorithm can find the best or near-best parameters to optimise a given metric.
                        For example, a hyperparameter tuning approach based on a simple exhaustive search
                        can be used to find the best configuration that maximises the model coherence score.</div>

                        the results to other research can be challenging. Second, the interpretation of the
                        metric results is challenging even when it is restricted to an interval. For example,
                        a 0.5 coherence score might be good for one dataset and not enough for another. Lastly,
                        different models have different optimal numbers of topics that maximise the coherence
                        score, as shown in Figure 16. For all these reasons, it is not recommended to rely
                        on a single method for model evaluation.</div>

                     <div class="ptext" id="p105">Although metrics can guide defining the number of topics and identifying overlapping
                        groups, determining the criteria for a satisfactory topical classification for a set
                        of documents must also satisfy the interpretability requirement. Ultimately, the division
                        of the groups should be done in a fashion that allows researchers to understand and
                        determine the main topic for each group. Ensuring the interpretability of the results
                        is an iterative process that relies on the synergy of automation tools and human expertise.
                        This process shapes the preprocessing pipeline, and the selection of methods used
                        for extracting information from the data. Based on our experiments, the GSDMM was
                        the algorithm that provided better results, with clearer topical groups compared to
                        the LSA and LDI. The GSDMM's superiority over the LDA and LSI can be attributed to
                        its design to work with short texts such as the ones in our dataset. LDA and LSI could
                        struggle to find better topics due to the small text size, which provided reduced
                        context about the main topic of the text.</div>

                        preprocessing guideline as such a thing does not exist. It also does not show all
                        the possible points to be considered when documenting research. Our goal is to provide
                        an example of how we designed our preprocessing methodology to best suit the requirements
                        of our problem (e.g., extracting information from a large historical corpus) and the
                        specificities of the methods we planned to use (e.g., topic modelling algorithms).
                        We also wanted to showcase how the lack of transparency in documenting the preprocessing
                        can make research nearly impossible to reproduce and lead to different conclusions.
                        For example, if we were to say only that we used the NER model to remove names of
                        people and locations before applying topic modelling, the results would differ significantly
                        from those published, given the proven accuracy limitations of general-purpose NER

                     often-neglected tasks compose the pipeline of digital research, profoundly affecting
                     its reproducibility and transparency: Through our experiments with several topic models,
                     we have demonstrated how variations in preprocessing techniques and the absence of
                     comprehensive documentation can impair the reliability of research outcomes. By doing
                     so, we discuss how important it is for researchers in the digital humanities to carefully

                     decision, the specific tools, libraries and parameters that were used, and any changes

                     other researchers to understand, criticize and build on one’s own work. The lack of

                     and adoption of more and more widely spread standards. Not only among researchers,

                     debates about biases, assumptions and limitations embedded in those decisions, as
                     well as in the computational tools employed. Surfacing such phenomena will ensure
                     a more thoughtful and responsible historical scholarship.</div>

                  <div class="ptext" id="p113">To close, it is also useful to realize that the recommendations provided in our article
                     coincide with changes in how history and digital history are practiced. The main difference
                     between traditional and digital history is the shift from individual engagement with
                     the sources to a fully collaborative and interdisciplinary approach. It is no longer
                     a solitary initiative but requires teamwork and the integration of different tools
                     and methods. The decisions made in the preprocessing phase, before the data is visualized,
                     have a significant impact on the results. For this reason, digital history is not
                     only about the final result, but also about building a shared knowledge of the basic
                     steps between the source collection and its interpretation that strengthens the commitment
                     to reproducibility. While every historian is trained in methodologies of working with
                     source materials, these are not usually shared. Contemporary humanities moved toward
                     “intersubjectivity” and transparency of the research process improving on reproducibility
                     and results transparency in digital history research must focus on collaboration instead
                     of data preprocessing standards.</div>
