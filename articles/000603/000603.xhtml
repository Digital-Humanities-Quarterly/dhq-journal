                  <p>In the scholarly communications lifecycle, it is the archive (as place and as
                     collection) that has traditionally functioned as <em class="emph">the</em> research
                     laboratory, the source of knowledge for the humanities and
                     its sub-disciplines. This article examines the notion of the archive as revealed
                     through a process of infrastructural inversion, with an emphasis on understanding
                     the
                     working information practices of archivists as a prerequisite to any discussion of
                     humanities infrastructure initiatives. Situating the archive as a form of
                     infrastructure and archival labor as a form of maintenance work generates
                     descriptions of archival systems and practices that shine a spotlight on key
                     negotiations and tensions that adhere in a profession that exists in service of
                     others. In particular, the article and the argument therein, sets out to describe
                     what will be lost if this archival assemblage of people, practices, activities,
                     artifacts, and structures is set aside rather than ported into any imagining or
                     re-imagining of the humanities of the future.</p>

                  <div class="ptext" id="p1">Built over centuries, the scholarly infrastructure that forms the backbone of the
                     humanities includes “diverse collections of primary sources in libraries, archives, and
                     museums; the bibliographies, searching aids, citation systems, and concordances that
                     make that information retrievable; the standards that are embodied in cataloging and
                     classification systems; the journals and university presses that distribute the
                     information; and the editors, librarians, archivists, and curators who link the
                     operation of this structure to the scholars who use it” [<a class="ref" href="#unsworth2006">Unsworth et al. 2006</a>, 6]. Since
                     its modern inception, the infrastructure of the archive has enabled key functions
                     required of humanities scholarship: authentication, providing researchers with an
                     assurance of the trustworthiness of records as records; awareness, enabling a community
                     of scholars to discover and understand needed sources; gathering, allowing scholars
                     to
                     build personal collections of primary source materials; contextualization, facilitating
                     scholars in situating sources in the circumstances of creation and use; tracking,
                     creating a means to credit the information used through the process of proper citation;
                     and preservation, ensuring the reliable and long-term maintenance of the historical
                     record for future generations of scholars [<a class="ref" href="#trace2017b">Trace and Karadkar 2017</a>]. </div>

                  <div class="ptext" id="p2">In the past twenty years the virtue inherent in the long-standing nature and widespread
                     use of research infrastructures has been upended in a world in which the digital has
                     come to the fore and the infrastructural push in the humanities is oriented to the
                     large-scale, the new, the innovative, the future-oriented and the technologized.
                     Initiatives such as the European Holocaust Research Infrastructure [<a class="ref" href="#anderson2015">Anderson and Blanke 2015</a>] and the Cultural Heritage Data Reuse Charter [<a class="ref" href="#baillot2017">Baillot et al. 2017</a>] situate
                     archives as institutional players in the ongoing development and transformation of
                     the
                     humanities. Yet in analyzing the rhetoric of Our Cultural Commonwealth, a 2006 report
                     published under the auspices of the American Council of Learned Societies to guide
                     humanities infrastructure development in the United States, Speck and Links highlight
                     the limited role ascribed to the archivist centered on the collection, management,
                     and
                     preservation of the cultural record [<a class="ref" href="#speck2013">Speck and Links 2013</a>]. As Speck and Links [<a class="ref" href="#speck2013">Speck and Links 2013</a>] note, in the push to attune humanities infrastructural development with
                     cyberinfrastructural developments in the sciences, existing relationships between
                     scholars, archivists, and archives have generally been overlooked. Indeed, research
                     by
                     Poole and Garwood suggests that some scholars working on large scale data-intensive
                     digital humanity projects are unaware or unconvinced that archivists have requisite
                     skills on which they could draw [<a class="ref" href="#poole2018">Poole and Garwood 2018</a>]. Part of the explanation for
                     this may lie in arguments made by scholars such as Svensson who, while acknowledging
                     the
                     need to engage with existing infrastructural traditions, caution against extending
                     or
                     building “uncritically” on this base [<a class="ref" href="#svensson2016">Svensson 2016</a>, 143]. </div>

                  <div class="ptext" id="p3">Such viewpoints seek to upend existing “epistemic commitments” in the humanities,
                     whether pertaining to structure, material types, selection procedures, access and
                     retrieval systems, or the relationship between researchers and entities such as archives
                     [<a class="ref" href="#svensson2016">Svensson 2016</a>, 145]. Disrupting the institutions, systems, and professions at the heart
                     of collection management is one way of seeking greater legitimacy for the humanities;
                     rejecting the image of the humanities as a discipline bound to pen and paper and instead
                     focusing on developing novel infrastructural platforms, material assemblages,
                     intellectual agendas, modes of material engagement, and interpretive frameworks
                     [<a class="ref" href="#svensson2016">Svensson 2016</a>]. Even in instances where there is a recognized lineage between the
                     traditional and the emerging, the reimagined humanities are expansive at a scale that
                     threatens to stretch the fabric of the already overtaxed infrastructure on which it
                     is
                     built [<a class="ref" href="#trace2021">Trace 2021</a>]. Such an unrestrained vision for the humanities in the digital age
                     includes the “complete digitisation and virtual unification of the cultural record,”
                     along with “universal access” to it [<a class="ref" href="#speck2013">Speck and Links 2013</a>, 131]. </div>

                  <div class="ptext" id="p4">Missing or buried in much of the recent discussion of the future of humanities
                     infrastructure is the idea that lessons can be learned from studying extant systems;
                     to
                     reflect on the ways in which they have existed in use and the ways in which they have
                     been stewarded - sustained, maintained, repaired, and remodeled - over time. Also
                     largely missing from this discourse is the understanding that claims that the archival
                     infrastructure is visible, knowable, and available to the humanities scholar is
                     complicated by the act of mediation. In the digital humanities literature Speck and
                     Links [<a class="ref" href="#speck2013">Speck and Links 2013</a>] note the diminished sense of understanding of the role the
                     archivist plays as intermediary and as mediator in the research process, with Rosenzweig
                     [<a class="ref" href="#rosenzweig2007">Rosenzweig 2007</a>] providing a historical grounding for the associated decoupling of the
                     historical and archival professions. As Speck and Links discuss, inter-mediation is
                     undertheorized in the literature on research infrastructures despite an acknowledgement
                     that humanities research infrastructure exists within a “complex relationship between
                     scholar, archivist and archive” [<a class="ref" href="#speck2013">Speck and Links 2013</a>, 128]. From an archival
                     perspective, what is lost or at best ignored in this discourse is the central and
                     evolving role that archival information labor has played for the past one hundred
                     years
                     in allowing humanities infrastructure to function. In the focus on the digital we
                     see a
                     neglect of notions of physical space and the associated skills and knowledge that
                     grew
                     up around and alongside the physical archive.</div>

                     particular spatial/temporal and political-economic context” [<a class="ref" href="#downey2014">Downey2014</a>, 148]. Despite
                     or perhaps because of its invisibility to the outside world, the nature and composition
                     of the labor that undergirds maintenance work has recently been the focus of intense
                     scrutiny among archival practitioners. Echoing Jackson, the archival profession has
                     come
                     to understand that “questions of visibility and invisibility may be intimately linked to
                     power” [<a class="ref" href="#jackson2014">Jackson 2014</a>, 229]. That its labor is often contingent, done by workers on
                     temporary contracts brought in to try and diminish an ever-present backlog, highlights
                     one set of concerns about the ethics and sustainability of the maintenance process
                     [<a class="ref" href="#trace2021">Trace 2021</a>]. That, typical of other feminized professions, the emotional labor inherent
                     in such work goes unrecognized, has been an additional source of tension. </div>

                     The
                     goal is to enact the archive as a form of information, knowledge, and research
                     infrastructure; an infrastructure that science and technology scholars show is
                     sociotechnical in nature [<a class="ref" href="#henke2020">Henke and Sims 2020</a>]. The article centers and scrutinizes the
                     labor of the archivist as a form of infrastructural maintenance work for the humanities;
                     a maintenance that is of the network, of the buildings, and of the collections under
                     care. Situating the archive as a form of infrastructure and archival labor as a form
                     of
                     maintenance work generates descriptions of archival systems and practices that shine

                     other social structures and arrangements, and having a certain spatial and/or temporal

                     when
                     the Alexandrian Mouseion housed a cultural center, university, and library. Over the
                     centuries, developments such as the advent of scholarly disciplines, advances in the
                     creation of taxonomies and classifications, and the diffusion of scholarly journals
                     helped to create the bedrock infrastructure for humanities scholarship [<a class="ref" href="#esf2011">European Science Foundation 2011</a>]. This
                     past century has seen a boom in the development of a network of infrastructures that
                     exist to support and sustain knowledge discovery. As Paul Edwards describes, these
                     infrastructures exist as “robust networks of people, artifacts, and institutions that
                     generate, share, and maintain specific knowledge about the human and natural worlds”
                     [<a class="ref" href="#edwards2010">Edwards 2010</a>, 17]. This growth of knowledge and information infrastructures coincided
                     with a period of change for higher education in the United States, one in which the
                     model of a research university with distinct academic disciplines, and with original
                     knowledge production at its heart, was ascendant. Looking at the more recent history

                     sector supporting archives with public money funded through state taxes. In the process,
                     archives were entangled with powerful political, economic, and social forces with
                     constraining and enabling effects on their utility and function. The chief technical
                     function of the archive is to move recorded information across time and over distance
                     for current and future generations. Grounded in time and place, materials are held
                     and

                     the
                     past. In the process, as Tom Nesmith says, “users of archives invariably want to look

                     historical record moves the profession beyond intermediary to that of mediator. As
                     Latour notes, mediators are transformative – working to “transform, translate, distort,

                     understandings align with Star’s concept of the “master narrative,” an encoding or work

                     carefully crafted identities of stakeholders external to the archival profession.
                     In the
                     digital age, prevailing forces revolve around the need for humanities scholarship
                     to be

                     physicality, and rootedness complicates that image leaving stakeholders to adjust
                     archival representations to suit. One option in situating the role of the archive
                     and
                     the archivist in this new endeavor is to recast the archivist in a decidedly backstage

                     behest of the client - the humanities scholar. For Drucker, the way that the humanities
                     scholar understands knowledge and their “tasks as scholars” should be the primary
                     drivers as scholarly environments are designed [<a class="ref" href="#drucker2009">Drucker 2009</a>]. </div>

                     always had a strong sense of its own autonomy; an autonomy that is constructed and
                     reconstructed as it comes into contact and under the influence of various disciplines
                     –
                     history, library and information science, and more recently, computer science. Yet
                     the
                     archival profession has waxed and waned in its understanding of the power inherent
                     in
                     its structures and in its labor, and the degree to which it is comfortable revealing
                     or
                     hiding this capacity from others. Early metaphors of labor, servitude, and care abound
                     as applied to the profession of the archivist. Given that writing was first developed
                     in
                     the process of “keeping account of the land and its produce” [<a class="ref" href="#yale2015">Yale 2015</a>, 332] it seems
                     fitting that a predominant image is that of agrarian toil in service of others with
                     the
                     archivist preparing the way for the scholarly process to come. </div>

                  <div class="ptext" id="p18">In the late nineteenth century, Canadian archivist, Douglas Brymner equated the
                     archivist to a settler working to clear the land in readiness for cultivation by the
                     historian: the archivist “must not forget that he is only the pioneer whose duty is to
                     clear away obstructions; the cultivated ﬁelds will follow” [<a class="ref" href="#publicarchives1890">Public Archives of Canada 1890</a>, x]. Later, Hugh Taylor characterized archival work as more in tune with
                     well-rounded husbandry; with records and the information they contained needing to
                     be
                     cultivated and tended by archivists “if there is to be a fertile crop of knowledge and
                     wisdom forthcoming” [<a class="ref" href="#taylor1984">Taylor 1984</a>, 36]. Pioneering English archivist Hilary Jenkinson
                     compared the archivist to a beast of burden; an ox in servitude of man, entitled
                     occasionally to partake in the spoils of his own manual labor [<a class="ref" href="#jenkinson1980">Jenkinson 1980</a>].<a class="noteRef" href="#d4e490">[4]</a> Distinct from the agricultural frame, the analogy of the archivist to that of a
                     paleontologist surfaced in the Dutch manual of Muller, Feith, and Fruin; an early
                     attempt to wrap archival labor in a mantle of professionalism and scientific legitimacy
                     [<a class="ref" href="#ilerbaig2016">Ilerbaig 2016</a>]. This mantle reemerged in the digital age with the idea of the archivist
                     as digital archaeologist, unearthing, excavating, and preserving important digital
                     objects inscribed on obsolete storage media [<a class="ref" href="#galloway2011">Galloway 2011</a>].</div>

                  <div class="ptext" id="p19">Perhaps the most enduring modern archival metaphor is that of the archivist as physical
                     and intellectual custodian or guardian, whether it be of the material under care or
                     of a
                     creator’s or donor’s legacy [<a class="ref" href="#wexler2009">Wexler and Long 2009</a>]. Indeed, Terry Cook has equated the
                     archival profession to that of “an invisible caretaker, a docile handmaiden” [<a class="ref" href="#cook2010">Cook 2010</a>, 3]. Yet, from a postmodern perspective, the archivist, and their workplace, is
                     understood as more consequential than such a supporting role implies. Brien Brothman’s
                     [<a class="ref" href="#brothman1991">Brothman 1991</a>] notion of the archivist as custodian or groundskeeper is one in which
                     the archival ‘ordering’ and ‘tidying up’ of physical and intellectual spaces is creative
                     and consequential. Mediative so to speak. Indeed, the archival designation and removal
                     of information that is deemed ‘dirt,’ ‘rubbish,’ ‘weeds,’ or ‘debris’ is seen as a
                     form
                     of axiological othering; what Brothman deems “socially determined exclusion” [<a class="ref" href="#brothman1991">Brothman 1991</a>, 81]. Thus, the archival essence is to theorize about and to engage in acts of
                     qualification and disqualification. The resultant selective knowledge transfer is
                     accompanied by the equally far-reaching effect of archival ordering and representation
                     via the processes of arrangement and description; acknowledging that the archivist
                     is
                     not only selectively moving information through time and space but co-creating and
                     situating it in the process [<a class="ref" href="#trace2012">Trace and Dillon 2012</a>]. The idea of the archivist as
                     ‘someone who protects’ has also been lately realigned; this time with carceral and
                     other
                     metaphors of imprisonment. This reimagined metaphor confesses the archival role in
                     controlling and consigning the record and in surveilling, monitoring, and policing
                     the
                     researcher who enters onto the archival premises [<a class="ref" href="#ketelaar2002">Ketelaar 2002</a>] [<a class="ref" href="#jimerson2006">Jimerson 2006</a>]. It is  
                     an acknowledgment that the archive, like other infrastructural forms, can “bend human
                     routines and material practices to its will” [<a class="ref" href="#howe2016">Howe et al. 2016</a>, 5]. </div>

                     also home in on the metaphor of performativity. In such a scenario archival work is
                     described as ritualized labor within a performative space with archivists acting as
                     “performers in the drama of memory-making” [<a class="ref" href="#cook2002">Cook and Schwartz 2002</a>, 172]. Linking
                     archival work to that of performativity is an acknowledgement and a call to
                     consciousness that standard archival procedures exist as inherited scripts; ones the
                     profession is capable of embodying but also rewriting or otherwise setting aside.
                     Here
                     Terry Cook and Joan Schwartz foreground the archivist as “an actor, not a guardian; a
                     performer, not a custodian” [<a class="ref" href="#cook2002">Cook and Schwartz 2002</a>, 183]. In doing so the work of the
                     archivist is deliberatively moved from a backstage to a front stage perspective. A
                     similar metaphor is introduced by Gabrielle Dean [<a class="ref" href="#dean2011">Dean 2011</a>] who rejects the notion that
                     the “archival encounter” is solely that between researcher and source. Instead, she
                     heralds the archivist as part of a “cast of characters,” conjuring these relationships
                     within the archive as “more a barn dance than a pas de deux.”</div>

                  <div class="ptext" id="p21">In the newest twist on agentive understanding, the most militant archival metaphor
                     is
                     ecological in origin, serving as a “potential corrective” to the various anthropocentric
                     takes on archiving that have been discussed to date. Reorienting the archival
                     perspective, Dani Stuchel [<a class="ref" href="#stuchel2020">Stuchel 2020</a>] leads from the “premise that not all agents or
                     entities responsible for material changes in the archive are human,” and thus the
                     archive should be understood as more than a “human institution about human history.”
                     Directing the archival profession to theories from the fields of new materialism and
                     critical plant studies Stuchel reveals the often hidden but vibrant life force and
                     material reality of things in the archive; formed in a complex web of people, societies,
                     cultures, technologies, and the natural world with aims that can be independent of
                     our
                     own [<a class="ref" href="#stuchel2020">Stuchel 2020</a>]. This is a worldview in which archives are understood as “agential
                     material assemblages characterized as much by the actions of dust, moisture, and plant

                     archivist to infrastructure and the installation and repair of systems - we can see
                     that
                     this idea was first explored by Canadian archivist Hugh Taylor in the 1980s in his
                     use
                     of the metaphor of the archivist as plumber [<a class="ref" href="#taylor1987">Taylor 1987</a>]. Taylor compares the inner
                     workings of the archive to a network of pipes; conduits through which information
                     flows
                     along distinct channels, with descriptive finding aids acting like taps to deliver
                     information to the user. In this metaphor, archivists’ bedrock concern is maintenance:
                     “that our storage tanks do not leak, our taps work, and the information comes out in
                     a
                     nice steady stream” [<a class="ref" href="#taylor1987">Taylor 1987</a>, 25]. Playing into the image that later evoked concern
                     from digital humanists, Taylor characterizes such long-established archival information
                     systems as staid, inward looking, and rather monopolistic in outlook. Yet, tying the
                     archivist to an image such as the plumber is critical to rendering the archive as
                     a
                     material entity (human and non-human); showing it to exist as a socio-technical (as
                     well
                     as ecological) space through which information flows from creating entities through
                     the
                     archivist to the humanities scholar, while surfacing the ‘on the job’ labor that makes
                     the process possible. </div>

                  <div class="ptext" id="p23">Whatever the ascribed metaphor, the notion that archivists merely work (whether
                     efficiently or not) at the behest of the client plays into the notion of humanities
                     scholarship as an individualistic and self-contained endeavor. It is a viewpoint that
                     undermines or at best downplays the cooperative if sometimes fluctuating efforts
                     involved in the practice of humanities scholarship, including the many dependencies
                     and
                     interdependencies between the creator, the scholar, and the archivist. It seems
                     expedient to reiterate here that the work that goes into imagining an infrastructure
                     into being should be accompanied by the work that goes into maintaining it long term
                     and
                     ensuring its future. Indeed, the combination of infrastructure and the scope of human
                     and of historical time should invariably and inevitably lead to questions of upkeep.
                     Upkeep is a state of being, an act, a process, a form of care taking or aftercare,
                     and
                     sometimes a means to an end. In the research literature ‘upkeep’ is synonymous with
                     the
                     concept of ‘maintenance.’ In academic disciplines and professional practice, maintenance
                     is a lens (“a theoretical framework, an ethos, a methodology, and a political cause”)
                     that grounds our experience of a world in which the breakdown and repair of
                     infrastructures (political, civic, physical, social, natural etc.) are commonplace

                     accounts societies make of themselves” [<a class="ref" href="#edgerton2011">Edgerton 2011</a>, 79]. In a blog post on the
                     Maintainers website, the authors [<a class="ref" href="#russell2019">Russell et al. 2019</a>] ruminate on the
                     reasons why maintenance and maintenance work are neglected at all levels of society;
                     factors with a clear resonance with the discourse around the future of the humanities.
                     According to Russell et al., [<a class="ref" href="#russell2019">Russell et al. 2019</a>] the psychological disposition of
                     people today shows a preference for novel things in the environment, with such a
                     cognitive bias coexisting with a desire for proximate rather than distant outcomes.
                     Moving from the individual to the societal and cultural level they see an attunement
                     to
                     and mythologizing of innovation and short-term growth to the detriment of caring for
                     the
                     established and the operationalized. The authors note that economic incentives factor
                     into whether organizations approach maintenance in a proactive or a reactive and
                     repair-focused manner, with notions of profitability and performance often formative
                     conditions. Here the idea of status, interest, and power are also prevailing forces,
                     impacting which public and private infrastructures are deemed worthy of maintenance,
                     with the identity markers of maintainers, including that of gender, positioning this
                     occupational role low in the established social hierarchy. From the perspective of
                     the
                     maintainers themselves, temporal and social pressures mean that a delicate balance
                     or
                     set of tradeoffs are always in play when it comes to fixing things under their care.
                     Fixes can be patchwork, hasty, and short lived or systemic, methodical, and long-term.
                     In the first case the bet is on making something better quickly while setting aside
                     the
                     issue that it will continue to get worse in the long-term. In the second scenario
                     the
                     fundamentals of the situation are addressed over time, even as the situation may
                     deteriorate in the short and medium term. </div>

                     archival profession today. Indeed, the difficulties of maintenance have long been
                     seared
                     into the archival imaginary [<a class="ref" href="#trace2011">Trace 2011</a>]. Arguably, the story of the archive in the
                     United States has been one of ongoing conditions and acts of maintenance and of repair
                     conditioned by the framework of fragility. The changing nature of institutions,
                     technologies, social arrangements, and stakeholders means that all infrastructures
                     are
                     fragile over time [<a class="ref" href="#borgman2016">Borgman et al. 2016</a>]. Yet the archival notion of fragility is
                     particularly tied to conditions that drive toward notions of failure and degradation,
                     including the impossibilities of maintaining a material and intellectual infrastructure
                     that the archival profession has closely tied to a bedrock principle of permanence.
                     Time
                     here is the constant that leads to breakdown. It is the recognition that the archival
                     infrastructure is not and cannot be an adamantine structure. In such an open-ended
                     scenario, durability is only possible when there is immediate and ongoing “care and
                     maintenance of individual components and the links between them” [<a class="ref" href="#borgman2016">Borgman et al. 2016</a>, 1]. </div>

                     to the societal level and to the constant uncertainty whether the financial resources

                     buffeting as society struggles to understand and accept the archive as “an
                     administrative, economic, or social good” [<a class="ref" href="#trace2017a">Trace 2017</a>, 134]. The ongoing battle for
                     resources and the conditions of scarcity that result, are tied to the lack of social
                     resonance to that which the archive clings - to the past, to history and the humanities,
                     to the study of human culture. The feminized nature of the profession serves as an
                     additional point of perceived fragility, providing little of the needed social and

                     History began its life in the state capitol building in downtown Atlanta operated
                     by a
                     staff of three - the first state archivist, Lucian Lamar Knight; a stenographer; and
                     an
                     African American porter, Charlie Justice. Speaking to the hearts and minds that
                     glorified a history of the elites and of white southern exceptionalism, the archive
                     yet
                     struggled to endure in a state system in which value adhered overwhelmingly to those
                     contributing to the narrative of capital rather than historical accumulation. Two
                     years
                     after operations commenced, Governor Thomas W. Hardwick (1921-1923) singled out the
                     Department for closure under the aegis of a state retrenchment plan. With a focus
                     on
                     pruning state agencies of an educational, humanitarian, and charitable nature
                     (categories which Hardwick believed fell outside of the purview of legitimate state
                     business), Hardwick set in motion a plan of economy and efficiency that echo in the

                     the
                     infrastructure of the Georgia state archive, its second and third decades are a textbook
                     case of how macro and meso level economic prerogatives for maintenance abide with
                     localized micro-level ones. Indeed, the story of the second state archivist of Georgia,
                     Ruth Blair (1925-1937) highlights how the struggle to maintain infrastructure is often
                     part of the gendered division of labor. As Denis and Pontille note, “maintenance work
                     participates in a care of things” [<a class="ref" href="#denis2015">Denis and Pontille 2015</a>, 341]. Blair’s story is one
                     of infrastructural care work; work in which she gave her practical labor to ‘patch
                     up,’
                     ‘set right’ and ‘keep going’ an infrastructure still in its infancy. This commitment
                     to
                     holding together the archive was put into practice when Blair secured the removal
                     of the
                     Archives Department from the cramped conditions at the State Capitol to Rhodes Hall,
                     a
                     Romanesque revival style twenty-two room mansion on Peachtree Street in Atlanta,
                     formally known as ‘Le Rêve.’ While the legislature appropriated $5,000 to repair the
                     building and install shelving, the economic conditions of depression-era Georgia
                     provided cover for a situation in which the specificities of care could be neglected.
                     Thus, no state money was appropriated for the ongoing maintenance of the building,
                     an
                     expenditure estimated at $1,500 annually (the cost split between employing a porter
                     and
                     paying for heat, light, water, and incidentals). With the state abrogating its duty
                     as
                     maintainer, Blair took on the responsibility to pay for the upkeep of the building,
                     an
                     undertaking that cost no less than $1,800 before the situation was resolved [<a class="ref" href="#trace2015a">Trace 2015</a>]. </div>

                     necessarily neutralize the problem that generated the need for them” [<a class="ref" href="#berlant2016">Berlant 2016</a>, 393], the Georgia Archives continues under a perpetual shadow of scarcity a century
                     after its founding. In the latest incarnation in 2012, Georgia Governor John Nathan
                     Deal
                     and Georgia secretary of state Brian Kemp waged their own campaign to shutter this
                     administrative unit of state government. This even though expenditures on state archives
                     and records programs were later established as below one-tenth of 1 percent of total
                     state expenditures [<a class="ref" href="#councilofstate2015">Council of State Archivists 2015</a>]. In this instance the fragility of
                     the archive was once again bound to rhetoric in the United States that champions
                     government frugality and retrenchment, aimed solely at a program and services deemed
                     superfluous to the core functions of government [<a class="ref" href="#trace2017a">Trace 2017</a>]. And once again it was only
                     in the mobilization and deployment of concerted countermining weights - in this instance
                     the longevity of the archives installed base and the ability to marshal historical,
                     heritage, and genealogical organizations to its cause – that crisis was diverted.

                     be
                     maintained for the research process to function. Like Barley and Bechky’s study of
                     technicians in scientific labs, archivists, as technicians for the humanities, “manage an
                     interface between a larger work process and the materials on which the process depends”
                     [<a class="ref" href="#barley1994">Barley and Bechky 1994</a>, 88]. In the language of goods and services, the archive exists
                     as an infrastructure of information production, distribution, and consumption. Embedded
                     in the notion of the archive is the idea of a steady flow of information that resides
                     within and moves through socio-technical systems - from the creator to the archivist
                     to
                     the researcher. Maintaining this information flow subtends and is given expression
                     in
                     the archive through the backstage and normalized act of archival processing. Archival
                     processing is connective and coordinative work; the ‘articulation work’ [<a class="ref" href="#strauss1985">Strauss 1985</a>],
                     so to speak, that the archivist does as a middle actor to link and mediate between
                     past,
                     present, and future. </div>

                     to
                     gain intellectual and physical control of archival materials through the activities
                     of
                     accessioning, arrangement, description, and preservation. This work includes arranging
                     or rearranging archival materials into recognized groupings (the evidentiary layers
                     of
                     record group, subgroups, series, and files), while also stabilizing and inscribing
                     context in a descriptive finding aid for the collection ready for the user to discover.
                     The rhetorical strategy of the finding aid works to hide the agency and emotion of
                     the
                     archivist from the process and from the associated narrative presented to the reader

                     professions as a strategy to manage information under their control [<a class="ref" href="#russell2012">Russell 2012</a>]. In
                     the archival system, processing of materials takes on the characteristics of a core
                     module, being standardized across collections and interchangeable among them. Processing
                     also demonstrates modularity in its ability to coordinate and manage complexity; to
                     “black-box” the messy internal details of the system and thus bring “efficiency and

                     Downey, information labor exists to make information useful, in the process working
                     to
                     set information in motion so it can circulate from one context to another [<a class="ref" href="#downey2014">Downey2014</a>].

                     Barley and Bechky [<a class="ref" href="#barley1994">Barley and Bechky 1994</a>] call an act of ‘brokerage’ - a four-way
                     relationship of creator, archivist (as technician), user, and the record. Mediation
                     is
                     necessary because the traditional impulses of historical methodology, buried within
                     colonialist and capitalist frames, are inherently extractive. For archivists, analog
                     and
                     digital records exist as technical artifacts to be curated when removed from their
                     creating context. Archivists respond to the act of extraction by engaging in ongoing
                     restorative labor – backstage work to recreate the context of creation for subsequent
                     users of the archive [<a class="ref" href="#trace2020a">Trace 2020a</a>] [<a class="ref" href="#trace2020b">Trace 2020b</a>]. If the goal of social science data

                     that
                     brought the records into being, and the recordkeeping structures in which they were

                     of
                     processing, although this work is obscured or rendered invisible from public view,
                     happening as it does in the private staff areas of the archive. In this private space,
                     processing acts as what is called a ‘concealed tool,’ part of a long-established
                     tradition of maintenance and repair [<a class="ref" href="#graham2007">Graham and Thrift 2007</a>]. In terms of preservation,
                     repair is a bench activity for analog materials and a technical and forensics process
                     for objects born within digital space; the site of repair taking place at the processing
                     workbench and the digital archive workstation, respectively. In the work of repair,
                     as
                     Stuchel notes, the emphasis is on “human purposes,” a stance that neglects the reality
                     that objects “change in ways proper to their materiality without regard for our desire
                     to remember and prove” [<a class="ref" href="#stuchel2020">Stuchel 2020</a>]. Indeed, Stuchel’s [<a class="ref" href="#stuchel2020">Stuchel 2020</a>] work highlights
                     the tendency for archival things to be viewed as resources to be fixed and mined,
                     rather
                     than as part of vibrant and diffuse “other-than-human” components that engage and
                     influence the world. It is the difference between a values-based approach that seeks
                     to
                     preserve the past by mitigating depletion and loss and a living heritage approach
                     that
                     sees change as a fundamental aspect of continuity [<a class="ref" href="#poulios2014">Poulios 2014</a>]. In effect, the idea of
                     decay exists as dueling notions - as a natural state of being in the world and as
                     an
                     imperative that archivists strive to subsume through maintenance and repair
                     strategies.</div>

                  <div class="ptext" id="p39">In the bench work that has traditionally encompassed repair, archivists engage in
                     micro-processes, physically inspecting the records and carrying out technical
                     preservation and conservation treatments to minimize deterioration of materials (and
                     the
                     information they carry) and maximize their projected life span. Co-opting the words
                     of
                     Dant, this benchwork shows that “the work of repair takes ingenuity in identifying the
                     problem and then a wide range of skills and tools to make the object useable again;
                     it
                     involves a mixture of perceptual, cognitive and manual skills that are normally
                     associated with handcraft” [<a class="ref" href="#dant2010">Dant 2010</a>, 97]. The notion of repair is so ubiquitous in the
                     digital realm that systems are designed to supplement the work of the archivist in
                     the
                     form of “automatic self-repair” [<a class="ref" href="#graham2007">Graham and Thrift 2007</a>, 5] indicating when digital
                     files are corrupted, in need of restoration or replacement. The job of maintenance
                     – of
                     “arresting a cultural object in time, maintaining it as closely as possible in the
                     state
                     in which it was created” [<a class="ref" href="#galloway2017">Galloway 2017</a>, 7] is especially critical for digital objects
                     given their volume, complexity, and fragility. Indeed, as Trace [<a class="ref" href="#trace2011">Trace 2011</a>] and
                     Galloway [<a class="ref" href="#galloway2017">Galloway 2017</a>] note, the work of maintaining digital objects requires the
                     archivist to get below the digital interface to the mechanism, documenting and
                     preserving the hardware and software contexts that shape digital objects and give
                     them
                     life. </div>

                     constantly retrofitted to meet new contingencies” [<a class="ref" href="#howe2016">Howe et al. 2016</a>, 7], the ascendency
                     of born-digital materials shows how the archival infrastructure alters and improvises
                     as
                     archival labor flexes its creativity in response to technological provocations. Deciding
                     which version of a software environment to document is a particularly complex problem
                     given that elements of the originating software and hardware stack likely evolved
                     at
                     different rates over the life of the digital object [<a class="ref" href="#galloway2017">Galloway 2017</a>]. As Galloway
                     [<a class="ref" href="#galloway2017">Galloway 2017</a>] indicates, the practice of maintenance under these conditions requires
                     craft work attuned to preserving both the digital output and the human input into
                     legacy
                     systems. In the first sense this entails homing in on the set of rules or standards
                     that
                     best represents the originary (or temporally situated) software environment and
                     installing it on legacy systems for testing. In the second sense this craft work entails
                     untangling interpellations, including “the shaping of the user by the machine”; the
                     “complex conversation” in which actions can be read “not just from the machines
                     themselves but from those who made them and those who use them” [<a class="ref" href="#galloway2017">Galloway 2017</a>, 15]. At
                     a broader level, archivists have also responded to the digital transition by retuning
                     descriptive practices to model the multifaceted contexts in which digital information
                     resides; contexts that are increasingly understood as dynamic and unbounded, best
                     architected in networked form. Such ongoing adjustments to archival processing are
                     evident, for example, in the newly released <cite class="title italic">Records in Context
                        </cite>conceptual model and ontology; work that comes out of the Expert Group on Archival

                  <div class="ptext" id="p41">In all this work archivists not only seek to fix the material object, but the negotiated
                     order around it. The notion of an attempted material and social repair is ever present
                     here. Archivists understand that the creators’ original recordkeeping structures atrophy
                     when removed from their original context, and materials themselves succumb to the
                     elements and degrade over time. In their mind, archival maintenance “occupies” and
                     “constitutes” what Jackson calls “an <em class="emph">aftermath</em>” [<a class="ref" href="#jackson2014">Jackson 2014</a>].
                     The repair in this instance, is an attempt to heal the rift in space and time that
                     has
                     opened between the materials as created and the materials as archived and used. It
                     is an
                     attempt to connect the materials to a creator, an activity, a place in time, and to
                     a
                     condition where they have the most meaning, allowing them to be brought to life again
                     by
                     those who frequent the archive. Throughout this physical and intellectual process,
                     material traces of the repair explicitly and implicitly recede from view, an
                     instantiation of the professional role ceded to and negotiated by the technical workers
                     in the archive as it exists in a delicate balance between discretion and legitimation.
                     While the agentic work of the archivist is pellucid in the processing manuals and
                     descriptive standards documentation that accompany the work, the professional
                     containment of such skills and knowledge mean that it often goes unnoticed and
                     unacknowledged by the scholarly communities that archivists exist to serve. </div>

                     heritage work, we can say that the importance of the archive and of archival information
                     labor lies in its ability to allow analog and digital information to continually
                     circulate and have value in society. It does this by providing information – “cast as
                     data, content, or knowledge” — with a way to jump contexts across time, space, and
                     disciplines, transposing information from the past into the future, from one kind
                     of
                     institution or intellectual domain to another, and from one kind of cultural and social
                     milieu to another [<a class="ref" href="#downey2014">Downey2014</a>, 152]. It is an acknowledgement that the humanities have
                     meaning broader than innovation, with an emphasis on articulating how the archive
