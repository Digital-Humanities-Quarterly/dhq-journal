                     underappreciated mid-range manner of reading that stands between traditional
                     close reading and computer-aided distant reading of first-person witness
                     testimony.  This mid-range or “cellular” reading method attends both to the
                     singularity of each text, and ventures widely enough to grasp that each text
                     gains credence and expository authority as one among aggregates of witness
                     testimony; it is, moreover, in facilitating such mid-range reading that DH can
                     provide readers with the foundation for moving from secondary witness and into
                     acting for social change.  </p>

                     within digital humanities scholarship, the field risks replicating the
                     exclusions of a dominant culture that already relegates difference to its
                     margins”
                     [<a class="ref" href="#risam2015">Risam 2015</a>]. Here I describe a project that grew not from a

                     among the very populations that have historically been marginalized by criminal
                     justice involvement — a testimonial action that, like other witness literatures,
                     demands its own manner of reading. Amid debates surrounding traditional close

                     [<a class="ref" href="#moretti2013">Moretti 2013</a>], this essay documents the inception and rapid
                     growth of a literary corpus that demands what I will describe as mid-range or
                     cellular reading — a position that not only has a well-established history as a
                     means of intervention in dis-equalizing social practices, but that is the apt
                     response to what incarcerated writers do: write for 2.23 million others while
                     making singular statements. The essay suggests that DH's definitive work of
                     closing material distances is the work to which incarcerated and otherwise
                     confined writers have always aspired: to broach walls (material, social,
                     cultural, of prisons, plantations, death camps) and thus to expose life inside
                     to readers outside, creating public interfaces in resistance to the prison’s
                     founding purpose in legal quarantine from the public sphere’s discursive life
                     [<a class="ref" href="#meranze1996">Meranze 1996</a>, 12]
                     [<a class="ref" href="#rush1787">Ross 1787</a>]. My claim is that whenever DH engages directly with
                     social injustice — let alone when those whose inequality has been socially and
                     legally sanctioned demand a place on digital platforms — DH is best assessed by
                     what it does or aspires to enable among social agents; and such enabling cannot
                     come solely through text analysis, text mining, or close reading, but must come,
                     if it seeks to affect change in practice, through a mid-range reading that
                     receives texts and affects readers as these texts are intended by documentary
                     witnesses: as singular statements that assume and offer context-dependent
                     representative testimony for a collective body.<a class="noteRef" href="#d4e225">[2]</a> When
                     witness-based, text-driven DH projects venture into social justice work, they
                     step onto a well-warn path behind those who have helped to disseminate slave,
                     Holocaust, and other witness literatures, whose reception incurs concrete social
                     effects. These effects have in the past been achieved without the benefits of
                     data mining or enlisting close reading techniques. They have, rather, come about
                     with acknowledgment of the singular human dignity of each witness, at the same
                     time that these witnesses have joined into a testamentary chorus of those on the
                     receiving end of dis-equalizing and dehumanizing practices [<a class="ref" href="#wieviorka2006">Wieviorka 2006</a>]. It is this mid-range reading that DH can aspire
                     to enable and accelerate as a social justice project. Computational methods can
                     help us to decide where to look and help us to look deeper and wider in the
                     archive; they cannot reveal to us how to feel, react, or take action in the face
                     of direct testimony to what the law looks like from the ends of fists and batons
                     inside walled and razor-wired institutions; and it is the moral choice to act
                     that is the beginning of changed practice. Computation can, however, atomize the
                     foundation in human witness that the archive can provide for action. Our primary
                     trust must and can confidently reside in the incarcerated (and the illegally
                     detained, the enslaved…); the voices from inside generously usher us forward
                     into America’s Fourth City. These are teachers who want us to learn everything
                     we can about closed spaces where the law’s violence is always on open display.
                     The archive thus makes possible text analysis that will be of most concrete
                     value when, beyond mining the words of incarcerated people, it is guided by the
                     intentions of those inside. From the start, the APWA has prioritized respectful
                     and non-discriminating posting of incarcerated people’s first-person witness to
                     carceral experience; its faceted search capacities have been built exclusively
                     upon metadata provided by incarcerated people, who complete a questionnaire that
                     welcomes unprogrammed responses. (The questionnaire is linked at the APWA site.

                     signature granting one-time publication rights and contact information, all
                     information is voluntary. The archive accepts this compromise regarding
                     identifying information in face of the need for contributors to protect
                     themselves and to be given full control over their representation. Writers can
                     publish anonymously or under pen names. As described below, search terms for
                     text analysis are now in development with a consultant who has served
                     thirty-eight years in prison and who is helping to build a team of incarcerated
                     and formerly incarcerated advisors. Every step taken outside prison walls has
                     been and will continue to be guided by those inside.<a class="noteRef" href="#d4e238">[3]</a>

                     consideration; here the question is addressed as literally as possible, as a
                     question about inception, sources, aspirations, outcomes, and potentials; and I
                     suggest that it is in historicizing the trajectory of DH social practice that we
                     set the grounds for the questions that theory might ask and address, thus
                     extracting theory from practice. </div>

                     into-digital growth of the APWA, I present an instance of DH serving not simply
                     as a means to expose and study a dis-equalizing institution, but to provide a
                     platform where incarcerated and free people can meet to begin setting the

                     planning (or conceiving an end to) new penal practice. When theory grows out of
                     practice, it not only avoids elitism; it sets the stage for intervention. In

                     readers to follow on the way to precipitating change in practice. Distant
                     reading can aid in mapping the landscape of testament to law’s violence so that

                     paths through the daily violations of human, constitutional, and civil rights
                     and human decency inside the earth’s largest prison state; it remains in
                     mid-range reading, however, that we will see outside hearts and minds moved to

                     Correctional Facility. The class was entirely voluntary. It offered no college
                     credit. It would not bolster anyone’s appeals for parole. Only the will to learn
                     to write had brought thirteen men serving twenty to twenty-five-to-life
                     sentences to the room. Over the ensuing ten years, the stories I read and heard
                     painted an unrolling panorama of urban battlegrounds, rural poverty, and the
                     occasional scene of suburban desperation — nearly all marked by some form of
                     addiction or mental illness — as the backdrops to the booby-trapped road that
                     runs from arrest, plea bargains or the very rare occurrence of a jury trial, to
                     incarceration in a place built to produce pain, suffering, and rural employment

                     other, at the same time that each story was seated in an individual biography.
                     In turn, I could not avoid hearing their reports both closely and as some
                     distance: from the details of life in a home on a particular Bronx or Rochester
                     city block, to the “public pretenders” nearly all had hardly
                     spoken with before arriving in court. Over these ten years, dozens of men passed
                     through that workshop. No two were much alike. Yet they held many things in

                     Asian, and White, from large and small cities, and came from poor,
                     working-class, and, in one instance, from an affluent background. Together, they
                     offered stories of institutionalized degradation, of coping, and of unimaginable

                     status — spaces the absence from which marks readers as those in the name of
                     whose security such quarantine exists, or as co-subjects of policing practices
                     outside (much as looking into original stereoscopes impresses us as much with a
                     view of a <em class="emph">past</em>, and with location of ourselves in a present, as with
                     the subject at hand). Readers are asked at once to bear secondary witness, and
                     to accept their own positions as either those in the name of whose protection
                     incarcerated people are forced to struggle to regain their discursive existence,
                     or as the similarly hyper-policed. The light cast by prison witness casts
                     silhouettes around readers outside — silhouettes deepened as readers are exposed
                     to each successive text, in contrast to the limited effects of close reading or

                     once metaphor and not, and that replicates the enunciatory moment of meeting
                     between witness and reader. This is a meeting that is not so much stereoscopic
                     as “cellular,” at-once literally of the body and of
                     architecture, of vulnerable flesh like the reader’s and of the stone and steel
                     that divide writer from writer and writer from reader, while each text carries
                     traces of the DNA of the next and yet remains distinct, as the condition of
                     identify and of life. Cellular reading is mid-range reading; it is reading at
                     proximal distance. No text is the whole, but the whole gains its status as
                     witness as an aggregate of each with each when each is read and held in the mind
                     as a singular whole, rather than as a mere yet-to-be-aggregated and mined data
                     vessel; authority lies in the “typical” moments across texts, while each text
                     remains absolutely authoritative regarding the experience, anger, aspirations,
                     hope, or hopelessness of its author — an author whose testimony, at the same
                     time, is shaped by widely experienced conditions: conditions implicating the

                     also makes clear, however, the need to mind the ethical stakes here. As the
                     archive grows and computational methods are applied, the danger rises of
                     reducing back to data points the testimony of writers struggling to assert their
                     human dignity and singular integrity from among the date piles gathered by state
                     agencies and research. Cellular reading should complement rather than seek to
                     exclude computational analysis; my claim is that, between academically inclined
                     close reading, and computationally enabled distant reading, it is from
                     mid-range, cellular reading that human readers will be moved to social action.
                     It is cellular reading that allows us to participate in the communities that can
                     complete the witness transaction, recognizing voices that never stand alone or
                     outside the legal matrix upon which we are all located; voices that are never
                     effective until embraced by others, and that work directly in the face of
                     organized authority that is often invisible to those outside. </div>

                     commit to reading thousands of essays, cellular reading can set the ethical
                     context for data mining among much greater numbers.We need simply read enough to
                     see how our ability to doubt, to find excuses for testimony that reveals the

                     readers will discover cellular links that surround and mark them as the
                     virtually law-immune or legally protected, while others will feel solidarity as
                     those living outside prison yet in subjection to the law’s pathologies.

                     Such cellular reading sets the grounds for what Jamie “Skye”

                     [<a class="ref" href="#bianco2013">Bianco 2013</a>, 109] both between writers and between writers
                     and readers, where “context, affect, and embodiment …remain

                     [<a class="ref" href="#bianco2013">Bianco 2013</a>, 108]. Johanna Drucker notes that “situatedness and enunciation are intimately bound to each

                     [<a class="ref" href="#drucker2013">Drucker 2013</a>, 92]. Reading prison witness reveals a causal
                     exchange relation between these moments: when incarcerated writers write of
                     their situation, the reader — as a co-subject of policing systems, or their
                     beneficiary — sees revealed their own legal situation within the current order.
                     If cultural influence is indeed at play in every act of interpretation [<a class="ref" href="#clement2016">Clement 2016</a>, 164], the interpretation of prison witness is
                     irrevocably influenced by the position of the reader within legal culture.
                     Unveiling the complexities of a city in cages, each text retains its singularity
                     even as its uniqueness is dispersed across the whole. Close reading can
                     acknowledge any one text’s ethical demand; but as the numbers of exposures grows
                     an osmotic leak occurs; we hear the reverberations of beating on one steel wall,
                     pouring and echoing into the next across facilities, and state borders, and
                     across the affective interface of writers and readers. While we may then find
                     bracing patterns in data mining the archive, it is the base in cellular reading
                     that reveals that such witness is not like reading fiction or other literary
                     texts bound by time or subject. Here, writing is not representation; it is human
                     and (re)humanizing witness to the legal and extra-legal conditions that surround
                     and demark citizenship and fully human status inside a carceral regime that, as

                     legislation, and investigative reporting of interest to incarcerated people.
                     That we receive this number of essays from a small ad is testament to the sheer
                     size of the prison population; it is that size and scale that has allowed the

                     mass incarceration [<a class="ref" href="#simon2010">Simon 2010</a>]; it is scale that also creates the

                     political, and ethical failures that surround crime and racialized punishment.
                     The archive allows us to consider what happens when we shift authority from
                     prison administrators, law-makers, judges, prosecutors, police, and outside
                     scholars, into the hands of the community of organic intellectuals among
                     incarcerated people. It suggests that DH social justice work is what DH/SJW
                     enables: demystification of historically dis-equalizing institutions, laying new
                     grounds for newly goaled public policy and growing consensus about the
                     practicality and moral imperative for a range of abolitions: from judicial
                     misconduct, to police violence, the knowing creation of employment deserts,
                     domestic violence, poverty, failing schools, to prisons themselves. </div>

                  <div class="ptext" id="p29">Continuing the literary legacy documented by Franklin, these writers are creating
                     what may well become one of the largest bodies of witness literature in human
                     history <a class="noteRef" href="#d4e825">[20]</a> — a literary corpus only possible on a platform that can sidestep the
                     censors (market-sensitive agents, editors, and sales reps) of commercial and
                     academic analog publishing. Unlike the most salient on-line witness archives —
                     at the US Holocaust Memorial Museum [USHMM] and the University of North
                     Carolina’s Documenting the American South’s archive of slave narrative [<a class="ref" href="#documentingsouth">'Documenting the American South'</a>] — the APWA is a repository of primary witness
                     that expands as you read this sentence, as incarcerated people bear testimony to
                     their experience. Though already the largest such archive, it is clearly in its
                     early growth. Yet even now, its promise is clear: These writers are not only
                     getting word out about what life is like inside; many write about their lives
                     from birth to arrest, as well as through cumulative millennia of incarceration.
                     What DH work has done in this case is to build a platform not only for those
                     outside to look inside, but for those outside to see, from inside, the contours
                     of US policing, judicial, and carceral practices, as well as from the interiors
                     of the homes and communities affected by poverty, untreated addiction and mental
                     illness, unemployment, crime, and the damaging feedback loop of mass-scale
                     punishment that criminalizes poor people of color, the gender non-conforming,
                     and the mentally ill — punishment that can exacerbate the very problems that
                     precipitate crime [<a class="ref" href="#clear2014">Clear et al. 2014</a>]. That closed loop is only possible
                     as long as the prison’s walls are reinforced by political and cultural circuits
                     that remain unbroken, as long as the public sees its social distance from the
                     condemned as based in moral virtue (rather than the chances of birth) and thus
                     lives complacently with walls of concrete while consuming the salacious media
                     misrepresentations used by “tough on crime” prosecutors,
                     judges, and law makers to garner votes despite a steady, twenty-six-year decline
                     in rates of crime [<a class="ref" href="#golashboza2017">Golash-Boza 2017</a>]. Breaking such circuits and
                     dismantling such walls will not be achieved by close reading of a handful of
                     essays, nor by reading data hit lists and clusters (however useful such reading
                     methods clearly are to particular purposes and, again, to helping us determine
                     where to read at greater depth). These simply are not how incarcerated writers
                     conceive of their work or intend it to be read; and if incarcerated lives
                     matter, so should the intentions among their representatives.</div>

                     interpretation takes place in a field of pain and death”
                     [<a class="ref" href="#cover1992">Cover 1992</a>, 203]: the law suppresses violence by casting
                     legal sanction over the acts of violence carried out by the police, courts, and
                     prisons. Since the deaths of Michael Brown, Tamir Rice, Eric Garner, Sandra
                     Brown and too many others, and the rise of the Black Lives Matter movement, the
                     cost-benefit balance of this sanctioning (Black costs v. white benefits) have
                     been called into question. Cover did not live to see his claims brought home by
                     cell-phone videos, and he only tentatively pointed toward the corollary to his
                     own claim: Without understanding both the breadth and the depth of human
                     suffering experienced on the receiving end of legalized violence, we can never
                     understand the full human cost of, let alone understand our location within the
                     current legal order. This is a cost and location that prison witness, on a scale
                     that only a digital platform can provide, makes clear. </div>

                  <div class="ptext" id="p32">A first major proof of the power of a peculiarly American literary corpus,
                     subjected to cellular reading, to foment social change came with the rise of
                     slave narratives. First-person testimony by former slaves would prove one of the
                     most effective weapons in the abolitionist arsenal [<a class="ref" href="#johnson1972">Johnson 1972</a>].
                     While documenting previously unimaginable conditions of degradation, and thus
                     confronting southern propaganda, the witness borne by former slaves presented
                     depths of moral and intellectual acuity, emotional allegiance and social
                     alliances that few white readers had to practice in their own lives. <a class="noteRef" href="#d4e859">[21]</a> Like
                     incarcerated people today, former-slaves countered popular misrepresentation of
                     a dehumanizing institution, protesting their condition by bearing witness to the
                     dignity of the objects of popular invective. This was not achieved by close
                     reading of a handful of texts, nor, of course, with data sets, but by cellular
                     reading, in which every whipping taken by one author stood proxy for a thousand,
                     including those whose experience never saw print, and thus exposing the moral
                     culpability of passive compliance. All witnesses speak for the muted, for the
                     <em class="emph">musselmanner</em>, as the living called the walking dead inside
                     Auschwitz [<a class="ref" href="#levi1995">Levi 1995</a>]
                     [<a class="ref" href="#wieviorka2006">Wieviorka 2006</a>]; and all witness recipients are (at least
                     potentially) morally repositioned by such reception. The aim of the APWA, after
                     229 years, is to open precisely that public, “affective
                     exchange” that Benjamin Rush sought to block in fear that exposure
                     of human suffering would evoke sympathy and desire to relieve that suffering
                     [<a class="ref" href="#schorb2012">Schorb 2012</a>, 167]; an exchange much like that which
                     slave narrative helped to precipitate war and the abolition of slavery. With
                     this aim, the argument here is, again, not against data analysis. It is for a
                     plenum and balance of reading proximities, from close, into cellular reading
                     (with its tried historical precedents), to those generated by computation, and
                     for an ethically responsible complementarity of reading proximities that never
                     loses sight of the primacy of whole statements by whole individuals. Stephen
                     Ramsey remarks that DH is strongest when it resists seeing data as
                     “more valid” than humanistic inquiry [<a class="ref" href="#ramsey2016">Ramsey 2016</a>, 528]. My claim is that such a balance — and
                     embrace of the broad, deep, and morally engaging middle ground between the close
                     and the distant — is best suited to affect change in social practice. History
                     and prison witnesses themselves have rushed the gates of analog publication and
                     into DH; we must take care to avoid atomizing their testimony. </div>

                     to slave masters and prison guards. Acts of prison testimony document not only
                     how failures in public policy, civil services, mental and physical health care,
                     foster care, public education, policing and court and prison practices are
                     translated into broken lives; they instruct us in how to retain our humanity in
                     the face of legally organized suffering, which also includes retaining human
                     status in a world beset by datafication. As Jill Stauffer writes, “…understanding what dehumanizes also helps us determine what
                     we take a human being to be”
                     [<a class="ref" href="#stauffer2015">Stauffer 2015</a>, 15]. For even while prisons strip
                     incarcerated people of other means of attempting to make good of their pasts,
                     they are doing the work of restorative justice, offering up what they have
                     learned from their lives, their crimes, and from our punishments. This is the
                     reason why we must pick our steps carefully between the ironies that line the
                     path of (re)datafication of voices struggling to break free from the data piles
                     gathered by the administrators of state violence, and by researchers outside. As

                     composition clearly are not. Prison-composed texts show evidence of
                     state-imposed “resistance in the materials”; but rather than
                     “reveal[ing] opportunity,” as Bethany Nowviskie

                     shows the unequal distribution of opportunities inside. A text composed with a
                     ballpoint pen filler (the plastic cylinders prohibited since they can be turned
                     into tattoo guns, syringes, or weapons) and a library staff clerk’s

                     with an aggressive, schizophrenic cellmate in a grossly understaffed prison is
                     quite different from a tenth year in solitary confinement, and from life with a

                     these essays, which, as noted, narrows the range from all included voices to a
                     recognizable set of issues (though often multiple and mixed inside individual
                     essays) inside facilities whose basic mission is the same: to confine human
                     beings against their will and do them damage. While we mine for broad sets of
                     words, sentiments, syntactical patterns, etc., cellular reading reveals that
                     even when general subject matter may be similar, and the language similar enough
                     to fall together in text analysis, each writer brings their individual
                     biographies, conditions, and experience to these issues in distinct settings;
                     each writes at once to document and protest their particular conditions, and to
                     represent US incarceration <em class="emph">en masse</em>. (Even in the small sampling above
                     in figures 2 through 6, note how often writers assume the authority to address
                     the prison system as a whole.) Mass incarceration dehumanizes by treating
                     individuals <em class="emph">as</em> mere units of a mass. Data mining can no doubt reveal
                     important and telling patterns in such statements, and it can lead us to rich
                     sites for closer reading; but it can also — like state actors — reduce
                     imprisoned people and their discourse to types. We cannot undo mass
                     incarceration by the massification of prison witness; nor, even as it helps us
                     map, can we expect data points to evoke the affective responses needed to
                     motivate advocacy for changes in penal conditions, thinking, or policy. These
                     writers write at their risk, in order both to distinguish themselves from and to
                     witness for a mass population. The mid-range reading for which I’m advocating is
                     a practice that contributors assume. Lexical patterns and word frequencies can
                     reveal broad trends within a corpus; they are not what prison witnesses intend
                     to create, and it is with respect for and to seek guidance from the incarcerated
                     that the APWA was built, as a basis for policy critique and activism aimed at
                     concrete changes in practice. The other side of this project is, of course, in
                     the hands of readers using the search capacities availed to them by the site and
                     populated by information provided by incarcerated people.</div>

                     One can, for example, select out essays by writers who self-identify as African
                     American, as male, and as confined in Michigan, thus curating, for the first
                     time, a cellular network of men who can speak to racial and legal conditions in
                     that state. This is the point (both critical moment and purpose) of cellular or
                     proximal reading aided by search capacities. The many ways in and subjects about
                     which incarcerated people write become animated by the many ways of searching,
                     reading, and curating this work. Daniel J. Cohen notes that “<em class="emph">Curation</em> becomes more important than publication once

                     of handwritten essays into full searchable texts.

                     volunteering their time have joined in the work of making carceral witness
                     available to search. At their best, such projects refocus DH on the “intersection of digital production and social
