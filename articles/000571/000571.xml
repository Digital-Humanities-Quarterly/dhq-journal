                <p>Drawing from a largest and first fully-searchable digital archive of non-fiction essays by incarcerated people writing about their experience inside US prisons
                    and jail, the article proposes that there exists a broad, well established, but underappreciated mid-range manner of reading that stands between traditional 
                    close reading and computer-aided distant reading of first-person witness testimony.  This mid-range or “cellular” reading method attends both to the singularity
                    of each text, and ventures widely enough to grasp that each text gains credence and expository authority as one among aggregates of witness testimony; it is, moreover, 
                    in facilitating such mid-range reading that DH can provide readers with the foundation for moving from secondary witness and into acting for social change.  </p>

                         <p>At 2.23 million, the
                    inhabitants of US prisons and jails constitute a population larger than
                    Houston’s and just behind Chicago’s—a larger population than sixteen American
                    states.<note>These states are represented by nearly one third of
                            the members of the senate; incarcerated people can vote only in Maine
                            and Vermont. Post-release re-enfranchisement policies make up a
                            patchwork across the other states <ptr target="#felonydisenfranchisement"/>. The
                            collection, archiving, and dissemination of prison witness described
                            below is in part an effort to raise the voices of incarcerated people
                            from de facto civil death. </note>
                Nearly one quarter of the earth’s
                    incarcerated human beings, and close to one third of the earth’s incarcerated
                    women, are drawn from the less than 5% of people residing inside the US. <ptr target="#incarccerationnation2014"/> <ptr target="kajstura2018"/>
                     A notoriously
                     race-driven system, poor people of color live these numbers <ptr target="#western2016"/><ptr target="#sakala2014"/>, while over 6,000-US confinement facilities, as well as the police,
                    courtrooms and prisons stand virtual lightyears away from moneyed white living
                    rooms where they appear as subjects of uncounted television dramas (and regular
                    humor) <ptr target="#brown2009"/>. As long as incarcerated people remain either data points
                    without faces or voices, or the criminal habitués of fearful popular
                    imagination, they are easily dismissed as 2.23M units of a type, rather than
                    being perceived as the nation’s fourth largest city of fathers and mothers,
                    brothers and sisters, grandparents and grandchildren, wives and husbands.
            </p>
               <p>The aim of this essay is to describe one instance of digital humanities practices working not only in contradistinction from <soCalled>retro-humanism</soCalled> <ptr target="#bianco2013"/>—the
                replication of traditional canons on line—but as an irruptive, discursive intervention into the dis-equalizing social practices from which retro-humanism might
                be counted as one distraction.  It describes an instance in which DH’s signature ability to close spaces between people and archives seeks to close the <soCalled>social
                distance</soCalled> between those populations that determine criminal punishment and those upon whom punishments land, a distance that has been shown to mark nations where
                   penal practice is most harsh <ptr target="#christie1994" loc="23-24"/>. The essay will describe the organic emergence and growth of The American Prison Writing Archive, an archive 
                of first-person non-fiction essays by incarcerated people that continues a 229-year history of American literary resistance to a dis-equalizing institution that
                over the past forty years has grown into the unprecedented American <soCalled>penal state</soCalled> <ptr target="#wacquant2009"/>. While the regular calls for DH to engage with inequality, social
                   injustice, and cultural critique assume DH as an extant practice that needs to reassess its premises and methods <ptr target="#liu2013"/>

                   , this paper describes an instance of marginalized voices forcing a break
                    out of prisons and into DH, and of their driving the metadata behind the search
                    facets availed to archive visitors. Roopika Risam notes that <quote rend="inline">Without attention
                    to the omissions that exist within digital humanities scholarship, the field
                    risks replicating the exclusions of a dominant culture that already relegates
                    difference to its margins</quote> <ptr target="#risam2015"/>. Here I describe a project that grew not
                    from a decision to address such DH omissions but that evolved into the digital
                    in the effort simply to keep up with the insistent will of those omitted by
                    state confinement to press their case for inclusion in, and thus expansion of
                    public discussion of US carceral practice.
                The APWA evolved from the labor of actors among the very
                    populations that have historically been marginalized by criminal justice
                    involvement—a testimonial action that, like other witness literatures, demands
                    its own manner of reading. Amid debates surrounding traditional close and
                    computation-enabled distant reading <ptr target="#ramsey2016"/><ptr target="#moretti2013"/>, this essay
                    documents the inception and rapid growth of a literary corpus that demands what
                    I will describe as mid-range or cellular reading—a position that not only has a
                    well-established history as a means of intervention in dis-equalizing social
                    practices, but that is the apt response to what incarcerated writers do: write
                    for 2.23 million others while making singular statements. The essay suggests
                    that DH's definitive work of closing material distances is the work to which
                    incarcerated and otherwise confined writers have always aspired: to broach walls
                    (material, social, cultural, of prisons, plantations, death camps) and thus to
                    expose life inside to readers outside, creating public interfaces in resistance
                    to the prison’s founding purpose in legal quarantine from the public sphere’s
                    discursive life <ptr target="#meranze1996" loc="12"/><ptr target="#rush1787"/>. My claim is that whenever DH
                    engages directly with social injustice—let alone when those whose inequality has
                    been socially and legally sanctioned demand a place on digital platforms—DH is
                    best assessed by what it does or aspires to
                enable among social agents; and such enabling cannot come solely through text analysis, text mining, or close
                reading, but must come, if it seeks to affect change in practice, through a mid-range reading that receives 
                texts and affects readers as these texts are intended by documentary witnesses: as singular statements that 
                assume and offer context-dependent representative testimony for a collective body.<note>
                    Witness 
                    literatures are by nature representative in this way <ptr target="#wieviorka2006"/>,
                            even where the witnessed event is not one seated in collectively
                            sanctioned practice. See, for example, Our Marathon [2013] at <ref
                                target="https://marathon.library.northeastern.edu/"
                                >https://marathon.library.northeastern.edu/</ref>.</note> 
                   When witness-based, text-driven DH projects venture into social justice work, 
                   they step onto a well-warn path behind those who have helped to disseminate slave, 
                   Holocaust, and other witness literatures, whose reception incurs concrete social effects.  
                   These effects have in the past been achieved without the benefits of data mining or enlisting
                   close reading techniques. They have, rather, come about with acknowledgment of the singular 
                   human dignity of each witness, at the same time that these witnesses have joined into a 
                   testamentary chorus of those on the receiving end of dis-equalizing and dehumanizing practices
                   <ptr target="#wieviorka2006"/>. It is this mid-range reading that DH can aspire to enable and accelerate as a 
                   social justice project.  Computational methods can help us to decide where to look and help us to 
                   look deeper and wider in the archive; they cannot reveal to us how to feel, react, or take action
                   in the face of direct testimony to what the law looks like from the ends of fists and batons inside
                   walled and razor-wired institutions; and it is the moral choice to act that is the beginning of changed
                   practice.  Computation can, however, atomize the foundation in human witness that the archive can provide
                   for action.  Our primary trust must and can confidently reside in the incarcerated (and the illegally detained,
                   the enslaved…); the voices from inside generously usher us forward into America’s Fourth City.  These are teachers
                   who want us to learn everything we can about closed spaces where the law’s violence is always on open display. The 
                   archive thus makes possible text analysis that will be of most concrete value when, beyond mining the words of incarcerated
                   people, it is guided by the intentions of those inside. From the start, the APWA has prioritized respectful and non-discriminating
                   posting of incarcerated people’s first-person witness to carceral experience; its faceted search capacities have been built exclusively
                   upon metadata provided by incarcerated people, who complete a questionnaire that welcomes unprogrammed responses.  (The questionnaire is 
                   linked at the APWA site.  See 
                <ref target="https://apw.dhinitiative.org/collection-description">https://apw.dhinitiative.org/collection-description</ref>.) 
                   Other than a signature granting one-time publication
                    rights and contact information, all information is voluntary. The archive
                    accepts this compromise regarding identifying information in face of the need
                    for contributors to protect themselves and to be given full control over their
                    representation. Writers can publish anonymously or under pen names. As described
                    below, search terms for text analysis are now in development with a consultant
                    who has served thirty-eight years in prison and who is helping to build a team
                    of incarcerated and formerly incarcerated advisors. Every step taken outside
                    prison walls has been and will continue to be guided by those inside.<note>In this
                            spirit, the preliminary list of search terms has been drawn from the
                            index of <title rend="italic">Fourth City</title>, described below. Early
                            planning for and work on text analysis has been conducted at DePaul
                            University, whose mission is to serve marginalized populations <ptr target="#depauluniversity"/>
                        and whose library has a history of thoughtful handling of

            <p>Enlisting DH platforms for concrete social

                    and such work requires ongoing theoretical revision and
                    questioning. Yet it may also be under-explicated. Martha Nell Smith asks
                    regarding DH projects, <quote rend="inline">How have these items of knowledge and the organizations
                        and working groups who made them come into being?</quote> <ptr target="#smith2014" loc="409"/>. This
                    question should invite theoretical consideration; here the question is addressed
                    as literally as possible, as a question about inception, sources, aspirations,
                    outcomes, and potentials; and I suggest that it is in historicizing the
                    trajectory of DH social practice that we set the grounds for the questions that
                    theory might ask and address, thus extracting theory from practice.
            </p>
            <p>As Barbara Christian reminds us, theory not
                based in practice is bound to remain elitist <ptr target="#christian1987"/>[. In describing the
                    analog birth and into-digital growth of the APWA, I present an instance of DH
                    serving not simply as a means to expose and study a dis-equalizing institution,
                    but to provide a platform where incarcerated and free people can meet to begin
                    setting the grounds to generate new terms for critical legal and penal theory,
                    and for planning (or conceiving an end to) new penal practice. When theory grows
                    out of practice, it not only avoids elitism; it sets the stage for intervention.
                    In helping broach the walls of prisons (or detention centers, or other
                    state-sponsored lines of confinement), DH practice can constitute a
                    transformative, political action, thus <quote rend="inline">shift[ing] the focus of DH from
                        technical processes to political ones</quote> <ptr target="#bailey2016" loc="71"/>.
                <note> The need for
                            expository action regarding prisons is particularly acute when
                            traditional journalism has been largely barred from such work <ptr target="#peters2018"/>.
                </note>
                    This essay suggests that DH can—as methodology—not only
                    host witness born from the <quote rend="inline">lived experiences of difference in the U.S.</quote> <ptr target="#risam2015"/>
                    , but can also, if read as the dis-equalized direct us, facilitate moving
                    the incarcerated to the front lines of efforts to uncloak the work of an
                    institution built to enforce all manner of inequalities and to censor the
                    dis-equalized.
                    The distant v. close reading debate in DH <ptr target="#ross2015"/>
                    replicates questions around how to balance addressing mass incarceration
                    as a statistical fact—as a data set—and/or as a human and humanly articulated
                    condition experienced and documented by discrete individuals <ptr target="#smith2010"/>. I
                    want to argue for a plenum of reading proximities by advocating for the
                    neglected middle-range of reading as more than a space of transition between
                    close and distant reading.

                </note>  What I will call cellular reading is the most apt manner of reception of what incarcerated
                writers—like other literary witnesses—do day by day, decade by decade, over millions of cumulative
                human years: create paths for readers to follow on the way to precipitating change in practice.  Distant
                reading can aid in mapping the landscape of testament to law’s violence so that we know where to begin
                in tracking particular, and potentially class-actionable paths through the daily violations of human,
                constitutional, and civil rights and human decency inside the earth’s largest prison state; it remains
                in mid-range reading, however, that we will see outside hearts and minds moved to act.</p>
            <p>In the spirit of drawing theory from practice,
                    I build my argument upon the back of a biography of the project in

                    There</head>
            <p>In the winter of 2006, I initiated a creative
                    writing workshop inside Attica Correctional Facility. The class was entirely
                    voluntary. It offered no college credit. It would not bolster anyone’s appeals
                    for parole. Only the will to learn to write had brought thirteen men serving
                    twenty to twenty-five-to-life sentences to the room. Over the ensuing ten years,
                    the stories I read and heard painted an unrolling panorama of urban
                    battlegrounds, rural poverty, and the occasional scene of suburban
                    desperation—nearly all marked by some form of addiction or mental illness—as the
                    backdrops to the booby-trapped road that runs from arrest, plea bargains or the
                    very rare occurrence of a jury trial, to incarceration in a place built to
                    produce pain, suffering, and rural employment <ptr target="#haney1998"/> <ptr target="#huling2002"/>. Their
                    stories regularly reinforced and echoed each other, at the same time that each
                    story was seated in an individual biography. In turn, I could not avoid hearing
                    their reports both closely and as some distance: from the details of life in a
                    home on a particular Bronx or Rochester city block, to the <soCalled>public pretenders</soCalled>
                    nearly all had hardly spoken with before arriving in court. Over these ten
                    years, dozens of men passed through that workshop. No two were much alike. Yet
                    they held many things in common.
                <note> A core groups
                            of six men attended for most or all of ten years. Such groups are never
                            a random sampling. Prisons screen those permitted into such classes, by
                            behavior record and mental condition (inside what have become America’s
                            default mental institutions <ptr target="#serious2016"/> <ptr target="#jailing2018"/>, and writers are always a subset of
                            any population. </note> Thus began to appear a testimonial corpus seemingly
                    pre-staged for text analysis: denial of freedom denies unlimited randomness in
                    experience. The men who joined the class were Black, Latino, Native-American,
                    Asian, and White, from large and small cities, and came from poor,
                    working-class, and, in one instance, from an affluent background. Together, they
                    offered stories of institutionalized degradation, of coping, and of unimaginable
                    resilience. But these, of course, are not the impressions one gains from
                    outside.

            <p>From its inception in 1790, the aim of the American penitentiary was less to cut off lawbreakers from
                the public than the reverse <ptr target="#tarter2012" loc="15"/> <ptr target="#meranze1996"/><ptr target="#foucault1977"/> <ptr target="#schorb2014"/>
                . In his <title rend="italic">Enquiry into the Effect of Public
                    Punishment Upon Criminals and Upon Society</title>,
                Dr. Benjamin Rush addressed the dangerous effects of
                letting the condemned speak to or even be seen by the public <ptr target="#rush1787"/>
                <note> This was not
                            an unfounded fear. Gallows and other criminal confessions, biographies,
                            and autobiographies turned a healthy trade in colonial America. As Jodi
                            Schorb notes, Cotton Mather and (Rush’s friend) Ben Franklin both
                            profited by selling these texts (purely for moral edification, of
                            course) to colonials and to readers in England <ptr target="#schorb2012" loc="152-3"/>.</note>; imprisonment would not
                    only stanch such communication; it would deter crime by allowing the images of
                    penal suffering to expand to the limits of public imagination <ptr target="#rush1787" loc="11"/>.
                    Prisons today have become less a holding place for offenders than one relay in a
                    closed circuit: we do not need prisons in order to contain deviancy, Foucault
                    notes; we need them to mark a deviant class and thereby justify security
                    apparatuses that both model and enforce behavioral norms <ptr target="#foucault1995"/>. Over
                    the past forty years, the abandonment of rehabilitation and embrace of
                    punishment, or the <soCalled>new penality,</soCalled> as the prison’s <soCalled><foreign lang="fr">raison d’etre</foreign></soCalled>
                <ptr target="#haney1998" loc="58"/>, has been built on the premise that incarcerated people—these (black and
                brown) <soCalled>monsters</soCalled> and <soCalled>animals</soCalled>—simply aren’t like <soCalled>us</soCalled> <ptr target="#christie1994" loc="42"/> .
                    <quote rend="inline">The art of punishing,</quote> Foucault reminds us, <quote rend="inline">must rest
                        on a whole technology of representation</quote> <ptr target="#foucault1995" loc="104"/>[Foucault 1995, 104]. Prison walls,
                    today as in 1790, represent law’s monopoly on legitimate violence, they contain
                    and recycle criminalized demographics, they silence the condemned, and in turn
                    they allow fantastic images of the criminalized to be spread without
                    intervention by incarcerated people themselves. The ruse that this is about
                    public safety (incarceration has a marginal effect on crime rates <ptr target="#study2017"/> <ptr target="#mauer2006"/>) 
                    can be maintained only as long as the public is not apprised
                    of the full, if often wounded humanity of those inside. At the end of a
                    forty-year US punishment wave, Rush’s fear of incarcerated people speaking to
                    those outside is warranted not only by fear of evoking public sympathy; it would
                    rip the screen upon which an eighty-billion-dollar prison industry and popular
                    media have cast all incarcerated people as not-fully-human <ptr target="#brown2009"/> <ptr target="#gottschalk2015" loc="234"/>
                     <ptr target="#alexander2010" loc="274"/>. Their voices might dissolve public
                    moral pretense, revealing an industry built on the backs of caged and fully
                    human beings.
                <note> The national
                            prison strike staged from August 21 to September 9, 2018, was largely
                            about just such exposure, as reflected in strike demands <ptr target="#manos2018"/>.
                        </note> Facilitating public access to what goes on inside through the testimony of incarcerated people
                is about shorting such closed circuits. It’s about revealing <soCalled>monsters</soCalled> as the very able, primary witnesses to, 
                and most competent critics of the lie beneath claims of the threat that all
                imprisoned people pose, as well as the lies of due
                    process, judicial equity, and respect for human rights. It’s about confronting
                    and exposing the final, legally sanctioned enforcer of institutionalized racism,
                    classism, gender-ism, etc.</p>
            <p>The bars to the public serving as secondary
                    witnesses to the primary witnesses of prison conditions are not only made of

                There is only one broad historical survey of US prison writing, H. Bruce Franklin’s pioneering 
                <title rend="italic">Prison Literature in America: The Victim as
                    Criminal and Artist</title>,
                    which offers decade-by-decade readings of this work from
                    1798 to 1989 <ptr target="#franklin1989"/>. This book and the texts it explicates make
                    evident, however, that for as long as the US has presented itself as a bastion
                    of liberty, equal opportunity, and judicial fairness, prison witnesses have
                    documented the nation’s working state of intersecting penal
                    apartheids. Prisons isolate. They exile. They quarantine. Yet prison witness makes clear
                    that these messages have never been simply from in <em>there</em>. They unearth for us the silent chambers beneath the nation Americans call 
                    <em>here</em>.<note>
                            Computational work on the full canon of US prison writing is thus
                            overdue.</note></p>
            <p>Franklin’s history ends in 1989, only a decade
                    into the era of true mass-scale incarceration (commonly dated from 1980).
                    Important collections of essays by political and politicized prisoners have
                    appeared since then <ptr target="#james2005"/> <ptr target="#james2003"/>; and Franklin himself has edited a
                survey of US prison writing in the twentieth century, reaching to 1995 <ptr target="#franklin1998"/>
                    . But in summer 2009, as I found (again) in searching out new texts for the
                    second iteration of an undergraduate course on US prison writing, there existed
                    no broad national sampling of non-fiction writing by people then living behind
                    bars. In attending national
                    and international conferences for legal scholars and social scientists, I found
                    that even researchers who had conducted surveys or scripted interviews with
                    incarcerated people virtually all crunched this testimony into statistical
                    charts and graphs (which, for their purposes, were certainly of vital
                    importance). I heard no open ended, witness-driven testimony about carceral
                    life. I had not set out to become an editor of prison witness (let alone a
                    digital humanist), but the need—on campus and in the profession—became very
                    clear.
            </p>
            <p>With the help of a research assistant, the first call for essays by imprisoned people went out in fall of 2009.  On February 1, 2014, 
                <title rend="italic">Fourth City: Essays from the Prison in
                    America</title>
                was published, including seventy-one essays from twenty-seven states <ptr target="#larson2014"/>. The title reflects the total population of US 
                prisons and jails. More importantly, as a first sampling of what a national gathering of contemporary prison witness might reveal, 
                the title indicates a collective experience as cohesive as we might expect from citizens writing of their experience of New York, LA, or Chicago.
            </p>
            <p>From among the first forty-five essays
                    received, eleven stable categories of subject matter emerged and persisted into
                    the final organization of the book. This occurred despite the fact that
                    incarcerated people have virtually no means to communicate between facilities,
                    let alone states, and often even between cells blocks inside any one
                    facility<note> Facilities block communication in order to thwart
                        organization, such as that seen inside Attica in 1971 <ptr target="#thompson2017"/>,
                            and amid the recent prison strike, the latter facilitated by contraband
                            cell phones <ptr target="#manos2018"/>. </note>;
                    so the consistency of subjects was striking: autobiographical sketches of the
                    paths to prison, coping with prison life, slice-of-life examples of everyday
                    challenges inside, ways to seek peace, the damage incarceration does to
                    families, the injustices perpetrated inside, critiques of criminal justice
                    policy, the inadequacy of mental and physical health care, activism from inside,
                    prison reentry programs, and messages of warning or hope shouted out to kids on
                    the street or others inside. Take the state names off these essays and it is
                    impossible to tell they are not reporting from one institution committed to
                    vengeance and willful dehumanization, and where the residents struggle mightily,
                    day by day, to make lives worth the name.
                <note> One broad
                            division is that incarcerated women (roughly one tenth of the prison
                            population) face gender-specific depredations and routinized sexual
                            threats and assault from male officers, as well as disproportionate
                            discipline for petty offenses <ptr target="#shapiro2018"/> <ptr target="#levi2011"/>
                    among the fastest growing sector of the prison population <ptr target="#sawyer2018"/>. These challenges also cross state and regional
                    lines.</note> What the project revealed is that our Fourth City is a metropolis of both willful debilitation and miraculous acts of human
                resistance, not the least of which is the very act of bearing witness. These are traits that anyone who has worked with incarcerated people might
                gather; one could do so, however, without gaining the basis for attributing common struggles and victories to a national population.  But in gathering
                this work in a relatively short period of time, from across the nation, the outline of America’s carceral metropolis began to take shape.
                <note> Several of
                            the tropes found in US prison witness are also transnational—crossing
                            biographical, local, national, continental, political, and criminal
                            boundaries and conditions <ptr target="#larson2017"/>.</note></p>
            <p>In her 2012 essay, <title rend="quotes">Why are the Humanities so White?</title> Tara McPherson distinguishes a lenticular view, 
                in which two discrete images can be seen in one frame but never at the same time (her model for the 
                separate-but-equal divide between the histories of computing and social justice activism since the 1960s);
                and a stereoscopic view, which layers distinct viewpoints on the same subject to create a sense of depth 
                <ptr target="#mcpherson2013" loc="144"/>.  What I had experienced inside Attica and what emerged from the 
                <title rend="italic">Fourth City</title> solicitation was stereoscoping of deeply singular voices, each implicitly
                demanding—like the face for camp survivor Emmanuel Levinas, like Holocaust witness for critic D.G. Meyers <ptr target="#levins2010"/> <ptr target="#meyers1999"/>—an 
                ethical response to the witness borne by individual human beings who are also all exemplars among a mass population; such ethical response, 
                moreover, is asked of a human listener or reader equally implicated in the legal order that concretely and morally marks the distance between
                the law-breaker and the law-abiding, the condemned and the protected, and those subjected to or spared by the law.  Here, stereoscopicism occurs
                in a mirror: the layered depths of witness’ testimony to law’s violence reveal the degree and manners in which those outside are either spared and 
                protected by the law (especially the white middle and upper classes) or co-objects of criminal justice involvement (especially poor people of color).
                As in reading witness texts from slavery, the Holocaust, or truth and reconciliation tribunals, it is impossible to hear
                or read prison witness without hearing echoes across biographies and texts, across razor-wired facility and state (and national)
                boundaries. It is impossible to ignore abiding tropes generated from spaces that hold those stripped of civil and basic human rights
                and effective citizenship status—spaces the absence from which marks readers as those in the name of whose security such quarantine
                exists, or as co-subjects of policing practices outside (much as looking into original stereoscopes impresses us as much with a view of a 
                    <em>past</em>, and
                    with location of ourselves in a present, as with the subject at hand). Readers
                    are asked at once to bear secondary witness, and to accept their own positions
                    as either those in the name of whose protection incarcerated people are forced
                    to struggle to regain their discursive existence, or as the similarly
                    hyper-policed. The light cast by prison witness casts silhouettes around readers
                    outside—silhouettes deepened as readers are exposed to each successive text, in
                    contrast to the limited effects of close reading or pixilated reading at
                    distance</p>
            <p>Stereoscopism better approximates but is not,
                    however, fundamentally adequate to representing this situation, in which
                    disparate and discrete biographies intersect at singular angles with the
                    enervating spaces of the prison and with the legal positions of outside readers
                    outside <ptr target="#larson2017" loc="12"/>. Prison witness texts—in their
                    non-interchangeability
                    <em>and</em> their clear linkages among themselves and in the minds of readers—are 
                best figured by a term that is at once literal and figurative, at once metaphor and not,
                and that replicates the enunciatory moment of meeting between witness and reader. This is 
                a meeting that is not so much stereoscopic as <soCalled>cellular,</soCalled> at-once literally of the body and
                of architecture, of vulnerable flesh like the reader’s and of the stone and steel that divide
                writer from writer and writer from reader, while each text carries traces of the DNA of the
                next and yet remains distinct, as the condition of identify and of life.
                Cellular reading is
                    mid-range reading; it is reading at proximal distance. No text is the whole, but
                    the whole gains its status as witness as an aggregate of each with each when
                    each is read and held in the mind as a singular whole, rather than as a mere
                    yet-to-be-aggregated and mined data vessel; authority lies in the “typical”
                    moments across texts, while each text remains absolutely authoritative regarding
                    the experience, anger, aspirations, hope, or hopelessness of its author—an
                    author whose testimony, at the same time, is shaped by widely experienced
                    conditions: conditions implicating the reader as part of the public in the
                    public safety rationale for a city in cages.
                </p>
            <p>Computation can accelerate location of common
                    veins in this corpus; it can reach reading communities at rates unimagined by
                    previous witness writers in their own. DH can, in this way, facilitate a shift
                    of authority from scholarship (or state agencies) to the communities that any
                    work can garner, as Kathleen Fitzpatrick has observed <ptr target="#fitzpatrick2013" loc="453"/>.
                    The APWA also makes clear, however, the need to mind the ethical stakes here. As
                    the archive grows and computational methods are applied, the danger rises of
                    reducing back to data points the testimony of writers struggling to assert their
                    human dignity and singular integrity from among the date piles gathered by state
                    agencies and research. Cellular reading should complement rather than seek to
                    exclude computational analysis; my claim is that, between academically inclined
                    close reading, and computationally enabled distant reading, it is from
                    mid-range, cellular reading that human readers will be moved to social action.
                    It is cellular reading that allows us to participate in the communities that can
                    complete the witness transaction, recognizing voices that never stand alone or
                    outside the legal matrix upon which we are all located; voices that are never
                    effective until embraced by others, and that work directly in the face of
                    organized authority that is often invisible to those outside.
            </p>
            <p>Cellular reading is an irreversible process of
                    revelation. Close reading one piece of prison witness (or slave or Holocaust
                    narrative) is qualitatively distinct from reading five, and twenty, and a
                    hundred; and while few readers can commit to reading thousands of essays,
                    cellular reading can set the ethical context for data mining among much greater
                    numbers.We
                    need simply read enough to see how our ability to doubt, to find excuses for
                    testimony that reveals the collective damage of collectively sanctioned and
                    supported institutions thins and vanishes as we read repeated reports on, for
                    example, lethal medical neglect, or feel the human toll paid by female victims
                    of staff rape that research shows occurs in numbers that rival reported
                    instances of rape outside <ptr target="#gottschalk2015" loc="137"/>. Amid multiple interfaces, some
                    readers will discover cellular links that surround and mark them as the
                    virtually law-immune or legally protected, while others will feel solidarity as
                    those living outside prison yet in subjection to the law’s pathologies.
                <note>Case in
                            point: The media attention given to Henry Louis Gates’ arrest for
                            breaking into his own home, and later sharing a beer with the president
                            and the arresting officer, shows the social distance commonly assumed
                            between Harvard professors (as effectively enforcement immune) and Black
                            men (as the default objects of policing) <ptr target="#thompson2010"/>.</note>
                Such cellular reading sets the grounds for what Jamie

                <ptr target="#bianco2013" loc="109"/> both between

                <ptr target="#drucker2013" loc="92"/>. Reading prison witness reveals a causal exchange relation
                    between these moments: when incarcerated writers write of their situation, the
                    reader—as a co-subject of policing systems, or their beneficiary—sees revealed
                    their own legal situation within the current order. If cultural influence is
                    indeed at play in every act of interpretation <ptr target="#clement2016" loc="164"/>, the
                    interpretation of prison witness is irrevocably influenced by the position of
                    the reader within legal culture. Unveiling the complexities of a city in cages,
                    each text retains its singularity even as its uniqueness is dispersed across the
                    whole. Close reading can acknowledge any one text’s ethical demand; but as the
                    numbers of exposures grows an osmotic leak occurs; we hear the reverberations of
                    beating on one steel wall, pouring and echoing into the next across facilities,
                    and state borders, and across the affective interface of writers and readers.
                    While we may then find bracing patterns in data mining the archive, it is the
                    base in cellular reading that reveals that such witness is not like reading
                    fiction or other literary texts bound by time or subject. Here, writing is not
                    representation; it is human and (re)humanizing witness to the legal and
                    extra-legal conditions that surround and demark citizenship and fully human
                    status inside a carceral regime that, as Colin Dayan notes, metes out

            <p>My life was as different from Laura's [a recent suicide] as
                    it could possibly be. Two years later I was proven wrong when an officer emptied
                    a full can of pepper spray through the flap in my lock up door while I stood on
                    the sink trying to cut my wrist on the fire sprinkler. I hadn't eaten or drank
                    anything in nine days. My own girlfriend was in the cell next door loudly urging
                    me to kill myself. I am proof and testimony that if you do enough time and allow
                    yourself to become lonely enough you will turn to whatever outlet you can find
                    to ease that loneliness a little. If you are addicted and obsessive by nature,
                    as I am, then that addiction and obsession, left unaddressed, will transfer
                    itself to whatever target is available. Be it starving, bingeing, exercise,

            <p>Incarcerated people and the writers among them are the subjects of intersecting

                sentencing guidelines that determine years of punishment from a grid; from the
                recording of their every demographic trait upon entering jail and prison, to
                psychological profiling, to the marking of every violation they incur inside, to
                prison, block, and cell assignment, to whether they recidivate upon release—release
                decisions increasingly influenced by risk assessment algorithms [Stevenson and

                wary of becoming the subjects of yet further datafication.</p>
            <p>At the same time that we can use computation to help map the carceral landscape, socially responsible and responsive text analysis must align itself with, and serve to further the struggle of incarcerated people to be heard and read on their own terms, thus avoiding the danger of refracting and deflecting the work of prison writers—who are themselves the select representatives for other incarcerated people—through our own presumptions.  In this vein, we might use computational tools primarily to locate, amid a mass of essays, those subject clusters that incarcerated writers make salient: such as the prison industry’s financial exploitation of incarcerated people, staff assault, damage to family ties, etc.  Such indexing can help readers to see the pervasiveness of such concerns across the nation, respect the integrity of individual writers, and create the basis for focused advocacy. Text analysis can thus work for the kind of social justice action that </hi>

                writers</hi> seek to forward.  Socially conscientious data mining must recognize that witness texts are not mere data, they are not simulacra. They are the literary corpus of bodies and minds struggling amid the “penal harm” that the carceral state and the American public have embraced for nearly have a century as an explicit aim [Haney 1996; Travis and Western 2017, 307]. Text analysis can serve this corpus and amplify its voices by maintaining to it less an analytical than an indexical relationship.</hi>

                    >At the other extreme from distant reading, meticulously close reading will also not bring us to the understanding of prison texts and practice that prison writers overwhelmingly intend.  Incarcerated people know they are held inside a mass-scale system.  Even when they focus on their own situations, they clearly understand and articulate those situations as examples, not isolated instances. The image of a city in cages—while it reflects the cohesiveness of subjects and themes among prison texts—moves in the direction of better focusing our views of that mass into the diversity and distinctiveness of a major metropolis. The APWA’s facetted and key word searches allow further granulation—by demographic categories, locations, keywords, and layering of these factors.  Computational work, as Moretti observes, offers “not an obstacle, but </hi><hi

                    interconnection. Shapes, relations, structures” [Moretti 2005, 1]. From their
                    beginning in 1790, as Michael Meranze points out, prisons have been spatial
                    answers to social problems [Meranze 1996, 9, 250]. They are shapes and
                    structures that, as Dr. Rush intended, alienate human relations. What we should
                    be seeking from computer-aided text analysis are mappings of these shapes,
                    structures, and relations as they are reflected in their counter-discourse, in
                    humanizing, mass-scale literary resistance. This is a literature that turns the
                    prison’s shapes and structures inside out: a literary corpus that exposes the
                    denaturalizing angles, shapes, and structures of penal confinement; a corpus of
                    textualized bodies and minds and hearts, presenting for mutual exchange and
                    transformation, the shared, fluid, and ineradicably interactive humanity of
                    those whose freedom outside and unfreedom inside are built upon, and have been

Incarcerated people have been spoken for (and objectified, medicalized, and demonized) for too long, including by academics.  A thick indexing method seeks to disentangle branches of consensus that appear among prison witnesses even while imprisoned writers are denied communication with their peers.

                    that the public safety returns on incarceration are now badly outweighed by the
                    social damage it imposes [Western 2018, 178]. The APWA offers visitors
                    (including voters) the opportunity to measure the human breadth and depth of
                    carceral damage. The project does not pose arguments but allows us to ask by
                    implication what new “materialist epistemologies” [Ramsey and Rockwell 2013, 77]
                    might be possible if we resituate incarcerated people from their current place
                    in public discourse as a mass deficit, to positions as our foremost authorities
                    on what imprisoned people are, what prisons actually do, the real effects of the
                    politics and economics of the criminal justice industry as a whole, and how we
                    might proceed on the path toward greater humanity in addressing all the social,
                    civil, economic, political, and ethical failures that surround crime and
                    racialized punishment. The archive allows us to consider what happens when we
                    shift authority from prison administrators, law-makers, judges, prosecutors,
                    police, and outside scholars, into the hands of the community of organic
                    intellectuals among incarcerated people. It suggests that DH social justice work

                    institutions, laying new grounds for newly goaled public policy and growing
                    consensus about the practicality and moral imperative for a range of abolitions:

                    through cumulative millennia of incarceration. What DH work has done in this
                    case is to build a platform not only for those outside to look inside, but for
                    those outside to see, from inside, the contours of US policing, judicial, and
                    carceral practices, as well as from the interiors of the homes and communities
                    affected by poverty, untreated addiction and mental illness, unemployment,
                    crime, and the damaging feedback loop of mass-scale punishment that criminalizes

                    that can exacerbate the very problems that precipitate crime [Clear et al 2014].
                    That closed loop is only possible as long as the prison’s walls are reinforced
                    by political and cultural circuits that remain unbroken, as long as the public
                    sees its social distance from the condemned as based in moral virtue (rather
                    than the chances of birth) and thus lives complacently with walls of concrete

                    203]: the law suppresses violence by casting legal sanction over the acts of
                    violence carried out by the police, courts, and prisons. Since the deaths of
                    Michael Brown, Tamir Rice, Eric Garner, Sandra Brown and too many others, and
                    the rise of the Black Lives Matter movement, the cost-benefit balance of this
                    sanctioning (Black costs v. white benefits) have been called into question.
                    Cover did not live to see his claims brought home by cell-phone videos, and he
                    only tentatively pointed toward the corollary to his own claim: Without
                    understanding both the breadth and the depth of human suffering experienced on
                    the receiving end of legalized violence, we can never understand the full human
                    cost of, let alone understand our location within the current legal order. This
                    is a cost and location that prison witness, on a scale that only a digital

                    former slaves would prove one of the most effective weapons in the abolitionist
                    arsenal [Johnson 1972]. While documenting previously unimaginable conditions of
                    degradation, and thus confronting southern propaganda, the witness borne by
                    former slaves presented depths of moral and intellectual acuity, emotional

                    precisely that public, “affective exchange” that Benjamin Rush sought to block
                    in fear that exposure of human suffering would evoke sympathy and desire to
                    relieve that suffering [Schorb 2012, 167]; an exchange much like that which
                    slave narrative helped to precipitate war and the abolition of slavery. With
                    this aim, the argument here is, again, not against data analysis. It is for a
                    plenum and balance of reading proximities, from close, into cellular reading
                    (with its tried historical precedents), to those generated by computation, and
                    for an ethically responsible complementarity of reading proximities that never
                    loses sight of the primacy of whole statements by whole individuals. Stephen
                    Ramsey remarks that DH is strongest when it resists seeing data as “more valid”
                    than humanistic inquiry [Ramsey 2016, 528]. My claim is that such a balance—and
                    embrace of the broad, deep, and morally engaging middle ground between the close
                    and the distant—is best suited to affect change in social practice. History and
                    prison witnesses themselves have rushed the gates of analog publication and into

                    ideological and cultural production” [Harlow 1987, 28-9]; they are grounded in
                    concrete and whole human experiences of the effects of these forms of
                    productions—including the production forms of digital computation used by state

            <p>While the value of all prison witness is in
                    principle equal, the conditions of composition clearly are not. Prison-composed
                    texts show evidence of state-imposed “resistance in the materials”; but rather
                    than “reveal[ing] opportunity,” as Bethany Nowviskie claims [Nowviskie 2016,
                    178], this manner of resistance shows the unequal distribution of opportunities
                    inside. A text composed with a ballpoint pen filler (the plastic cylinders
                    prohibited since they can be turned into tattoo guns, syringes, or weapons) and
                    a library staff clerk’s word-processor indicate different opportunities in the
                    very act of composition. A newspaper article necessarily indicates outside
                    support. The graphic state of texts offers one consistently distinguishing
                    material indicator of what it is for the writer at hand to write from inside. As
                    Paul Fyfe claims (in another context) “the accidents are often essential” [Fyfe
                    2013, 274]. The accidents of prison-witness documents announce their emergence
                    from the unequal conditions of writers in willfully low-to-no-tech
                    environments.</hi>

            <p>This, of course, is lost amid big data, along
                    with the voice of the individual, and the distinct conditions inside each
                    prison, prison block, and prison cell; and such documentation is, after all,
                    largely the point for these writers.</hi>

While we mine for broad sets of words, sentiments, syntactical patterns, etc., cellular reading reveals that even when general subject matter may be similar, and the language similar enough to fall together in text analysis, each writer brings their individual biographies, conditions, and experience to these issues in distinct settings; each writes at once to document and protest their particular conditions, and to represent US incarceration </hi>

These writers write at their risk, in order both to distinguish themselves from and to witness for a mass population.

                    that of transcribers of handwritten essays into full searchable texts.
                    “Transcribe-athons” held at libraries, courses that offer transcription as a

                    which graphically rendered the physical pain that slaves suffered and made it
                    widely visible, helped to propel the abolitionist cause. Today, what happens in
                    prison stays mostly in prison, making it harder to draw connections in the
                    public mind between justice on the inside and justice on the outside. The
                    ability to identify with an offender—or not—is a key predictor of why people
                    differ in their levels of punitiveness. The invisibility of the millions of
                    people behind bars has made it extremely difficult to alter the negative
                    portrait that members of the general public have in their heads of people who
                    have been convicted of a crime. They are simply prisoners and criminals. As
                    such, they often are denied their humanity and any right to democratic
                    accountability, much as slaves were in the United States. [Gottschalk 2015,

My hope is that the APWA, as well as other DH workers and especially those working with first-person witness corpora, will use the powerful tools now at hand to amplify and arrange, as witness voices dictate, rather than merely to datify the testimony of those on the receiving end of collectively organized, silencing, and too often silently suffered institutions of legal quarantine. </hi>

                    DH/SJW has allowed them to speak from across state boundaries, from city and
                    country, raising a chorus that sounds out every pothole on the road of
                    opportunity supposedly open to every American. Reading of the suffering demanded
                    for stumbling upon that road, we are forced to reassess whether any concrete

                    justice. No political representative, no social scientist, and no one else
                    speaking from outside can provide what direct witness to legally sanctioned
                    suffering offers. No other platform can open that witness to a world that today
                    needs to learn humility before the voices of those on the receiving end of
                    populist and demagogic rhetoric, which arguably saw its recent inception in the

            <p>My conviction is that readers willing to read
                    prison witness will find spread before them not only a richly illustrated map of
                    our failures to care for each other—civic, political, ethical, economic, and
                    social—but a map as well for building a nation empathic at last to all of its
                    members: citizens and non-citizens of all races and ethnicities, all classes,
                    genders, creeds, abilities, and sexualities… In response to calls for DH to
                    address inequality and social injustice, digital humanists can seek to build
                    platforms for activism modeled on proven reading methods of the past while
                    keeping their eyes on the yet untouched horizon of a more humane and equitable
                    future.</hi></p>
