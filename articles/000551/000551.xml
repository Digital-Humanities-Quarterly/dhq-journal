                    <p>The Göttingen Dialog in Digital Humanities is an initiative that started in 2015. This event creates a meeting place for researchers, students, and practitioners of Digital Humanities in Göttingen and neighbouring universities and research institutions. External speakers receive an invitation to provide a keynote lecture that is the starting point for thematic discussions and ensured several fruitful project collaborations. The best paper receives a 500 Euro award. Criteria are equally for the submitted paper and the presentation of the research during the Göttingen Dialog.
