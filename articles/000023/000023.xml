            <p>No humanists have moved more aggressively in the digital world than students of the
               Greco-Roman world but the first generation of digital classics has seen relatively
               superficial methods to address the problems of print culture. We are now beginning to
               see new intellectual practices for which new terms, eWissenschaft and eClassics, and
               a new cyberinfrastructure are emerging.</p>

                  respect only but in all, that equality is a good thing. Evidence for this is the
                  fact that while they were under tyrannical rulers, the Athenians were no better in
                  war than any of their neighbors, yet once they got rid of their tyrants, they were
                  by far the best of all. This, then, shows that while they were oppressed, they
                  were, as men working for a master, cowardly, but when they were freed, each one
                  was eager to achieve for himself.</quote>

            <p>The first passage above follows a military encounter in which the Athenians show, for
               the first time, that terrible energy which would (at least according to our Athenian
               sources) fascinate and unnerve the rest of fifth-century Greece. Students of
               classical Athens have for millennia contemplated the energy that liberation released
               — Herodotus’ wonder has echoed ever since and served as one motivation for human
               fascination with Athens and its achievements.<note>The publications in this
                  collection were the production of a workshop, sponsored by the National Science
                  Foundation, on the subject of Cyberinfrastructure in the Classics in September
                  2007 (NSF GRANT INFO). We gratefully acknowledge the support that we received from
                  the University of Kentucky and the Department of Classics.</note>

            <p>The early years of the twenty-first century have seen a heroic age for intellectual
               life. Ideas have poured across the world and new minds have joined the
               professionalized academics and authors in grappling with the heritage of humanity.
               Often rough and unpolished, unconcerned with the niceties of convention, a new
               generation of digital entities has exploded across human society, creating wikis,
               blogs and millions of electronic resources. Plato’s Socrates scorned writing itself
               on the grounds that the written word was as powerless to answer our questions as a
               mute painting (Plat. <title rend="italic">Phaedrus</title> 275d). Now each question
               becomes a challenge as active readers probe relentlessly the sprawling information
               space beneath their fingers. Wikipedia has demonstrated a new form of intellectual
               production that challenges the assumptions that many of us internalized in graduate
               school about how knowledge can be described and ideas shared.<note>For some
                  evaluations of the Wikipedia phenomenon and the challenges it has offered to more
                  conventional forms of intellectual production, see for example, <ptr
                     target="#lally2007"/> and <ptr target="#rosenzweig2006"/>.</note> The scale of
               projects such as Wikipedia deserves serious reflection: the English Wikipedia has, as
               of summer 2008, more than 2.4 million entries.<note>Statistics retrieved from <ref
                     target="http://www.wikipedia.org">http://www.wikipedia.org</ref>, accessed
                  August 2, 2008.</note> By one estimate, Wikipedia has absorbed 100 million hours
               of labor — put another way, Wikipedia has, if measured by the labor invested, become
               a billion dollar project <ptr target="#shirky2008"/>.</p>
            <p>Changes go beyond traditional academic channels. The 9/11 attacks in 2001 were the
               last major event owned by the centralized 20th century media. With the Tsunami and
               the 7/7 London bombings, we had shifted <q>from the
                  broadcasters owning the story, to the people involved in the events owning their
                  own stories and spreading it to those who they know and care about, using their
                  own communication channels.</q>

                     >http://wealthofnetworks.wordpress.com/</ref>, a blog by Margaret Gold that
                  contains summaries of John Dartington’s remarks at a conference entitled, <title
                     rend="quotes">The Wealth of Networks: Digital Economies and the Next Generation
                     Internet,</title> held in the UK in July 2008.</note>
            </p>
            <p>Conventional streams of refereed publications (such as this collection) are necessary
               but insufficient — this introduction has already cited Wikipedia, a blog and the
               video for a presentation at a conference. We cannot make the decisions that we need
               to live in the world around us without constantly evaluating information that has no
               conventional academic pedigree. Every anxious editorial fretting about undomesticated
               ideas prowling through an internet jungle underscores the urgent need for that
               critical thinking that we in the liberal arts claim to instill. The internet may
               prove to be the best thing for humanities education since the rulers of early modern
               Europe found that classical training provided them with the administrators with whom
               to build strong nation states.</p>
            <p>No field of study is poised to benefit more than those of us who study the ancient
               Greco-Roman world and especially the texts in Greek and Latin to which philologists
               for more than two thousand years have dedicated their lives. Our predecessors worked
               in Alexandria, Damascus and Baghdad as well as Berlin, Oxford and Venice. Many lived
               in states whose names we may never have heard. Most spoke languages like Syriac or
               the dialects of medieval Europe, which have themselves passed into history. They
               preserved the battered remains of the past in isolated monasteries and the libraries
               of aristocrats. They raised capital and set type, then sent Greek and Latin texts
               coursing through Europe and then the world. They convinced the powerful that the
               study of Greek and Latin would provide the supple and disciplined minds needed to
               fashion, maintain and expand the nation states of Europe and their empires across the
               world. And in the twentieth-century, as other disciplines emerged as filters to
               identify the promising and send them on their way to worldly privilege, classicists
               carried their field forward, opened up their curricula to those who had not learned
               Greek and Latin and, from the margins of the intellectual world, continued their
               researches on the texts that they loved</p>
            <p>The papers in this collection reflect a new generation of classicists —
               entrepreneurial in their disruptive actions, impatient of convention, hunting for new
               methods to understand and to disseminate those ancient texts to which they, like
               dozens of generations before them, have dedicated their lives. It is hard to predict
               what the future holds for the intellectual practices and products of twentieth
               century print-based classical studies. In the opening of his fifth Nemean Ode Pindar
               reveled in the speed and reach of the written word: his songs could be copied and
               race across the known world in the largest ship and the smallest boat, while the
               grandest statues remain fixed and mute upon their pedestals. The texts of antiquity,
               freed from the tyrannical limitations of expensive print publication, preserved in
               multiple servers across the globe, flash instantaneously anywhere that the internet
               can reach — hundreds of millions of desktops and mobile devices. Homer, Plato,
               Virgil, Cicero — they all reach more of humanity than ever was conceivable in the
               millennia since they set down their styli for the last time and passed into dust. And
               it is not just physical access — we already can, with simple links between source
               text and its commentaries, translations, morphological analyses and dictionary
               entries, provide a better reading environment than was ever conceivable in print
               culture. We know from the readers of our web sites that texts in Greek and Latin, of
               many types, now fire the minds to which twenty years ago they had no access. And if
               this reading environment now supports those proficient in English, we can already
               design libraries that will, within a reasonable period of time, support readers in
               the less commonly spoken languages of the European Union such as Croatian and
               Hungarian and widely spoken languages such as Arabic and Chinese.</p>

                  <quote rend="block" source="#canonical">As to the speeches which were made either before
                     or during the war, it was hard for me, and for others who reported them to me,
                     to recollect the exact words. I have therefore put into the mouth of each
                     speaker the sentiments proper to the occasion, expressed as I thought he would
                     be likely to express them, while at the same time I endeavoured, as nearly as I
                     could, to give the general purport of what was actually said. [2] Of the events
                     of the war I have not ventured to speak from any chance information, nor
                     according to any notion of my own; I have described nothing but what I either
                     saw myself, or learned from others of whom I made the most careful and
                     particular enquiry. [3] The task was a laborious one, because eye-witnesses of
                     the same occurrences gave different accounts of them, as they remembered or
                     were interested in the actions of one side or the other. [4] And very likely
                     the strictly historical character of my narrative may be disappointing to the
                     ear. But if he who desires to have before his eyes a true picture of the events
                     which have happened, and of the like events which may be expected to happen
                     hereafter in the order of human things, shall pronounce what I have written to
                     be useful, then I shall be satisfied. My history is an everlasting possession,
                     not a prize composition which is heard and forgotten.</quote>

               <p>The distinction between science and the humanities reflects particular traditions
                  of the English speaking world. In German, for example, <emph>Wissenschaft</emph>
                  includes all systematic intellectual work — we need to specify
                     <emph>Naturwissenschaft</emph> or <emph>Geisteswissenschaft</emph> if we want
                  to distinguish between the natural sciences and the humanities. The term
                     <emph>Altertumswissenschaft</emph> describes the systematic analysis of the
                  past, including both the textual and the material record. </p>
               <p>We thus use the term Wissenschaft to describe the output of the systematic study
                  of antiquity as it appears in material forms such as articles and monographs,
                  plans and maps, images and diagrams, editions and reference works. Whether or not
                  we believe that we can reconstruct aspects of the ancient world as they actually
                  were, we develop our ideas on the basis of primary and secondary sources stored in
                  material form. </p>
               <p>For the purposes of this introduction, philology describes the production of
                  shared primary and secondary sources about linguistic sources, while classical
                  philology focuses upon classical Greek and Latin, as these languages have been
                  produced from antiquity through the present. The famous passage from Thucydides,
                  quoted above, is relevant for several reasons. First, Thucydides was one of the
                  first to apply systematic methods to represent in textual form, as accurately as
                  he could, the events of the past — his history of the Peloponnesian War has been a
                  model for Wissenschaft. Second, Thucydides used writing as a medium to disseminate
                  his ideas, but he drew upon every source available, including eyewitness
                  interviews, archaeological remains, and the textual record. Third, Thucydides’
                  words seek to represent an entire world — we cannot fully study Thucydides without
                  engaging as well with the material record. Nor is this material record simply a
                  source with which to illustrate the topics that Thucydides has included. We need
                  to develop the fullest possible understanding of the material record in order to
                  develop our own understanding of how Thucydides represents his subject. </p>
               <p>The terms eWissenschaft and ePhilology, like their counterparts eScience and
                  eResearch, point towards those elements that distinguish the practices of
                  intellectual life in this emergent digital environment from print-based
                     practices.<note>For a discussion of ePhilology and its role in the larger
                     cyberinfrastructure environment, please see <ptr target="#crane2007"/>; also,
                        <ptr target="#dimitriadis2006"/>.</note> Terms such as eWissenschaft and
                  ePhilology do not define those differences but assert that those differences are
                  qualitative. We cannot simply extrapolate from past practice to anticipate the
                  future.</p>

                        <speaker>Socrates:</speaker>
                        <p>I heard, then, that at Naucratis, in Egypt, was one of the ancient gods
                           of that country, the one whose sacred bird is called the ibis, and the
                           name of the god himself was Theuth. He it was who [274d] invented numbers
                           and arithmetic and geometry and astronomy, also draughts and dice, and,
                           most important of all, letters. Now the king of all Egypt at that time
                           was the god Thamus, who lived in the great city of the upper region,
                           which the Greeks call the Egyptian Thebes, and they call the god himself
                           Ammon. To him came Theuth to show his inventions, saying that they ought
                           to be imparted to the other Egyptians. But Thamus asked what use there
                           was in each, and as Theuth enumerated their uses, expressed praise or
                           blame, according as he approved [274e] or disapproved. The story goes
                           that Thamus said many things to Theuth in praise or blame of the various
                           arts, which it would take too long to repeat; but when they came to the
                           letters, <q>This invention, O king,</q> said Theuth, <q>will make the
                              Egyptians wiser and will improve their memories; for it is an elixir
                              of memory and wisdom that I have discovered.</q> But Thamus replied,
                              <q>Most ingenious Theuth, one man has the ability to beget arts, but
                              the ability to judge of their usefulness or harmfulness to their users
                              belongs to another; [275a] and now you, who are the father of letters,
                              have been led by your affection to ascribe to them a power the
                              opposite of that which they really possess. For this invention will
                              produce forgetfulness in the minds of those who learn to use it,
                              because they will not practice their memory. Their trust in writing,
                              produced by external characters which are no part of themselves, will
                              discourage the use of their own memory within them. You have invented
                              an elixir not of memory, but of reminding; and you offer your pupils
                              the appearance of wisdom, not true wisdom, for they will read many
                              things without instruction and will therefore seem [275b] to know many
                              things, when they are for the most part ignorant and hard to get along
                              with, since they are not wise, but only appear wise.</q>

               <p>Those of us who grew up hearing that we should read more and that television had

                  ubiquitous connectivity.<note>For example, Jeffrey Garrett discusses whether the

               </p>
               <p>Nevertheless, the basic point remains valid, even if the media change. We must
                  augment our biological memories by using material records, whether these are
                  hand-written, printed or digital but external information can only augment
                  internalized knowledge. We can only experience humor, for example, if we
                  understand the joke as it happens. We can work our way through a Greek text,
                  looking up every word in a dictionary and using modern translations to orient
                  ourselves, but we will not understand the text in the same way as we would if we
                  could understand the language fluently. And, even if we understand the Greek words
                  and grammar, we will hear more from those words the more we have thought about
                  Plato, the philosophical concepts that form the subject of his dialogues, and the
                  culture in which he lived.</p>
               <p>Thucydides set out to express in material, written form a record of the past that
                  would last forever. Plato questions the value of any written record except insofar
                  as that record finds full expression in human minds. We already live in a world
                  where the books have begun to talk with each other.<note>For more on this theme,
                     see <ptr target="#crane2005"/> and also <ptr target="#kelly2006"/>.</note> When
                  data mining systems detect fraudulent activity on our credit cards, they do a
                  better job of finding significant patterns than could human analysts alone — if
                  there were human analysts to sift through trillions of transactions. Financial
                  institutions do not care how they identify fraud because fraud detection is a
                  means to an end.</p>
               <p>Text mining can detect words and phrases that are unusual in Plato.<note>Text
                     mining within the humanities and within classics has received a fair amount of
                     attention in recent years, for example, see <ptr target="#plaisant2006"/>; <ptr
                        target="#don2007"/>; and <ptr target="#hyman2008"/>.</note> We can even
                  imagine syntactic analyzers that can not only parse every surviving Greek and
                  Latin word but that might at some point be better able to justify its decisions by
                  pointing to other similar patterns in that vast corpus than has ever been possible
                  for any human reader. But such information would only realize its full value if it
                  becomes knowledge in a living human mind and allows a reader to see something that
                  would not otherwise have been visible.<note>Matthew Kirschenbaum has offered a
                     useful overview of how text and data mining are reshaping reading in the
                     digital environment, see <ptr target="#kirschenbaum2007"/>.</note>
               </p>
               <p>For the purposes of this discussion, we use the terms classics and the humanities
                  to describe that focus upon internalized knowledge and intellectual practices
                  designed to help us perceive new connections and increasingly sophisticated
                  patterns not only in the texts that we read but in the images that we see and the
                  sounds that we hear. Human beings are the measure of all things in the humanities.
                  Philology truly matters insofar as it serves classics and its goal of bringing
                  classical Greek and Latin to life in the minds of human beings.</p>

               <p>Infrastructure provides the material instruments whereby we can produce new ideas
                  about the ancient world and enable other human beings to internalize those ideas.
                  Infrastructure includes intellectual categories (e.g., literary genres, linguistic
                  phenomena, and even the canonical book/chapter/verse/line citation schemes whereby
                  we cite chunks of text), material artifacts such as books, maps, and photographs,
                  buildings such as libraries and book stores, organizations such as universities
                  and journals, business models such as subscriptions, memberships, and fee simple
                  purchases, and social practices such as publication and peer review. Our
                  infrastructure constrains the questions that we ask and our sense of the possible.
                  Thus, the Homeric narrator rules out the idea of representing the names of every
                  hero who participated in the Trojan War. The twenty-first century fan of American
                  baseball can, by contrast, locate not only the name but the basic statistics
                  recorded for every person who ever threw a pitch or swung the bat in a major
                  league game. By the classical period, we begin to find lists of citizens,
                  office-holders, temple dedications, tribute paid and similar categories. </p>
               <p>Thucydides drew upon textual, archaeological and verbal sources and he could leave
                  behind a written text to which he had attached his own name, but there were no
                  libraries in the modern sense. He could not cite transcripts of public speeches in
                  a congressional record or even a <title rend="italic">New York Times</title>
                  article. He could not footnote official documents in a classical Greek equivalent

               <p>Infrastructure is so fundamental that it may become invisible to us but the
                  resulting blindness makes us confuse the limits that we face with our larger
                  goals. In periods where our infrastructure advances incrementally, we may take it
                  for granted. Infrastructure does not simply affect the countless costs/benefit
                  decisions we make every day — it defines the universe of what cost/benefit
                  decisions we can imagine.<note>Several recent reports have called for expanding
                     our ideas of infrastructure in order to create a larger cyberinfrastructure,
                     see <ptr target="#arms2007"/> and <ptr target="#acls2006"/>.</note> All the
                  tribute of the Athenian empire could not have paid for one color photograph of
                  Pericles. Rarely, if ever, can we predict the full implications of relatively
                  modest technological change. Gutenberg did not think that, in using movable type
                  to print a Latin bible, he was creating a technology to make translations of the
                  bible ubiquitous, enable new forms of Christian worship and facilitate
                  revolutionary change.</p>
               <p>But even if we cannot foresee the future with perfect clarity, we must constantly
                  reexamine the goals that we choose to pursue today in the light of what is already
                  possible. Before shifting to the digital infrastructure already taking shape and
                  its implications for current practices in classical philology, we should review
                  what has and has not changed for classical philology as the core information
                  infrastructure of human life as a whole has shifted, decisively and irrevocably,
                  from atoms to electrons.</p>

               We do not, like the Athenians, like to say that our ancestors were sprung from the
               dirt and our ancestors have not inhabited the same small rocky peninsula since they
               were sprang from the earth — classicists have come from countries and periods far
               beyond the experience of any classical Greek. Our field has an ancient history but we
               have begun to expand, like the Athenians of fifth century Athens, into a much larger
               space than we ever could occupy before. The digital world has become our sea, but our
               empire offers freedom, and the natural borders that will contain our field are
               nowhere to be seen. Much as we may have achieved, we are still as a field in the
               incunabular phase of development, more focused upon the problems of the past than the
               opportunities of the present.<note>For more discussion on this topic, please see <ptr

            <p>Classicists were among the first humanists to exploit digital technologies and enjoy
               a reputation as being arguably the most digitally advanced field. Certainly,
               classicists were, as a field, early adopters. If one includes the study of any Greek
               and Latin texts under Latin, Father Busa’s famous concordance of Thomas Aquinas,
               produced with the help of IBM in the late 1940s, would constitute the start of
               digital classics (see <ptr target="#busa1974"/> and <ptr target="#busa1980"/>).</p>
            <p>If we restrict ourselves to the Greek and Latin authors commonly taught in classics
               departments of the 20th century, then we must move twenty years forward to the late
               1960s. Full professors of classics today have been born after David Packard, who

               There are classics majors who received their undergraduate degrees in the spring of
               2008 who were born after the Perseus Digital Library began serious work in the late
               spring of 1987. Not only are virtually all publications — whether distributed in
               print or not — produced digitally, but digitized textual corpora, digital versions of
               printed secondary sources, electronic reviews, bibliographic databases, and web sites
               are all standard elements of our work.<note>For an overview of how many classicists
                  use digital materials as evidenced by citations, see <ptr target="#dalbello2006"
                  />.</note> Two leading departments of classical philology have even discovered the
               value of the preprint servers on which some of the most demanding areas of research
               have depended for more than fifteen years.<note>
                  <ptr target="#pritchard2008"/>. The papers for a 1995 workshop by the American

                  about preprints. The ArXiv.org server founded in 1991, contained (as of June 29,
                  2008) 484,758 e-prints in Physics, Mathematics, Computer Science, Quantitative
                  Biology and Statistics.</note>

            <p>The early use of digital tools in classics may, paradoxically, work against the
               creative exploration of the digital world now taking shape. Classicists grew
               accustomed to treating their digital tools as adjuncts to an established print world.
               Publication — the core practice by which classicists establish their careers and
               their reputations — remains fundamentally conservative. While we may congratulate
               ourselves on the innovative content of what we write and while we will always need
               publications that articulate particular arguments at a particular point in time in a
               particular voice, the format of our publications is essentially the same as that
               which Gibbon used in the 18th century.<note>Classics is not the only field that has
                  been challenged to modernize its publication system, the issue of scholarly
                  communication and the need for major change has been the subject of much
                  discussion, it recently served as the topic for the <ref

                     >Winter issue</ref> of the Journal of Electronic Publishing. </note>
            </p>
            <p>While the documents were digital in form, almost none of their content was machine
               actionable: strings such as <q>Thuc. 1.38.2</q> had not been analyzed and converted
               into machine actionable links to the text of Thucydides, book 1, chapter 38, section
               2; a reference to Thucydides did not have associated with it any information whereby
               an automated system could reliably determine whether this Thucydides was the
               historian or one of the various other figures by this name; quotations of Greek and
               Latin authors were not dynamically linked to multiple online editions, nor did they
               carry with them links to any linguistic apparatus (textual notes, dictionaries,
               grammars, commentaries, translations) not offered by the author of the articles.
               While these articles may be online, the main bibliographic resource for classical
               studies, <ref target="http://www.annee-philologique.com/aph/">
                  <title rend="italic">L’Année Philologique</title>
               </ref>, still relies upon manual summaries to index and disseminate these articles in
               its digitally disseminated bibliography. Nor can the reader, of course, see what
               later articles cite earlier publications. </p>
            <p>We can add each of the features listed above to existing documents automatically with
               reasonable accuracy — simple text search provides functionality that is increasingly
               comparable to the manually produced indices on which we had to rely in print
                  culture.<note>While manually created indices such as back-of-the-book indexes are
                  still considered essential by many, the automatic creation and remodeling of such
                  indices is a growing research area, see <ptr target="#csomai2006"/> and <ptr
                     target="#chi2007"/>.</note> Google has already popularized the ability to
               identify and disambiguate place names and to find quotations embedded in unstructured
               text — automatically generated maps became a standard feature of Google Books in 2007
               and frequently quoted passages soon followed.<note>For further information on the
                  Google Books system, see <ptr target="#kolak2008"/> and <ptr target="#schilit2008"
                  />.</note> Particular domains may need to adapt general services to their needs:
               classicists need Optical Character Recognition (OCR) systems that can not only
               provide useful results for classical Greek but can also recognize Latin and do not
               helpfully convert <emph>t-u-m</emph> (a Latin word for <q>then</q>) into English
                  <emph>t-u-r-n</emph>.<note>The adaptation of commercial OCR systems for Greek and
                  Latin as well as the development of other text recognition systems have been
                  explored by several research groups; see for example <ptr target="#gatos2006"/>
                  and <ptr target="#moalla2006"/>.</note> Scholarly disciplines need page layout
               analysis systems that can recognize and parse not only general document formats such
               as notes at the bottom of the page, and the individual entries of indices,
               encyclopedias, and lexica, but also specialized document formats such as the
               commentary and textual notes.<note>Specialized document layout analysis systems for
                  historical documents has been an active research field for years, for a recent
                  overview see <ptr target="#sankar2006"/> and for some recent work in this area
                  involving texts digitized by the Open Content Alliance, see <ptr target="#lu2008"
                  />.</note> Scholarly disciplines such as classics need specialized named entity
               searches: we need to determine not only whether <q>Th. 1.38</q> is a citation to a
               primary source but also, if so, whether it designates Thucydides, book 1, chapter 38,
               Theocritus, <title rend="italic">Idyll</title> 1, line 38 or some other text.</p>
            <p>The production of these services is the most important task for classics and for any
               scholarly discipline which does not focus solely upon the contemporary
               English-language, mass market American culture which the Web of 2008 primarily
               serves. While we may need to support less and less software, we will then only shift
               our efforts to the production and refinement of the knowledge sources which support
               general services: we need machine actionable reference works that can help general
               services run by giants such as Google to distinguish one Antonius or one Alexandria
               from another.<note>We have reported on our own work in historical named entity
                  recognition in <ptr target="#crane2006c"/> and <ptr target="#smith2001"/>; for
                  several examples of the growing research in this area, see <ptr

            <p>Classicists of the 20th century built their work upon a foundation that took shape in
               the 19th century. In the last decades of the twentieth century, ambitious classicists
               began to shift their efforts away from infrastructural tools such as editions and
               commentaries. Instead they turned towards articles and expository monographs on
               topics often derived from their colleagues in the Modern Language Association. The
               Pax Stereotypica of the 20th century has, however, collapsed. We live in a digital
               age in which we need to rethink our most fundamental resources -- we are reinventing
               the forms and functions of our editions, lexica, encyclopedias, commentaries,
               grammars, bibliographies and every other textual category that evolved in a print
               ecosystem. And as we feel our way forward, we need to rebuild our entire
               infrastructure. In a primarily print world, we can turn to digital tools for
               documents that contribute at the margins — e.g., digital scholia for a major
               classical author. In the digital world, we want the scholia but we also need editions
               of our canonical authors. The <title rend="italic">Editiones Principes
                  Electronicae</title> for every major author are still waiting to be produced. A
               new generation of editors spreads across a new and uninhabited world in which they
               can acquire for themselves the digital <emph>kleos aphthiton</emph> (<q>undying
                  fame</q>) that the pioneers of Hellenistic Alexandria and early modern Europe
               earned for themselves.</p>
            <p>The greatest barrier that we now face is cultural rather than technological. We have
               all the tools that we need to rebuild our field, but the professional activities of
               the field, which evolved in the print world, have only begun to adapt to the needs of
               the digital world in which we live — hardly surprising, given the speed of change in
               the past two decades and the conservatism of the academy.</p>
            <p>Perhaps the most important point of continuity — and the greatest reason why
               publication in classics has adapted so little to the digital world — appears before
               we even begin reading publications. An informal survey reveals that forty of
               forty-one classics publications available online from Johns Hopkins University Press
               (97.5%) are products of a single author — the only exception was an archaeological
               publication in <title rend="italic">Hesperia</title>, the journal of the American
               School at Athens.<note>This informal survey examined the articles in sample issues
                  that Johns Hopkins made publicly available for marketing purposes. Where there was
                  not a public issue, the most recent online issue was examined. Seven single author

               </note> While expanding this survey would provide greater statistical certainty, the
               conclusion would be the same: classicists in 2008 devote most of their energies to
               individual expressions of particular arguments.</p>
            <p>An even more problematic issue is that the editions, commentaries, grammars, lexica,
               and other elements of scholarly infrastructure have not adapted in any significant
               way to the digital world.<note>For further discussion of this issue, see <ptr
                     target="#crane2006b"/>.</note> In the five centuries since the first printed
               editions of classical texts began to appear, print culture assembled an immense
               amount of intellectual capital with which to support thinking about Greek and Latin
               texts. This knowledge must, however, be converted into a machine actionable
                  form.<note>Research into how reference works can be made machine actionable has
                  been investigated by <ptr target="#veltman1999"/> and <ptr target="#buckland2007"
                  />. Other interesting work has examined how less traditional reference sources
                  such as Wikipedia can be turned into knowledge bases, see <ptr
                     target="#ponzetto2007"/>.</note> Converting this intellectual capital from
               human readable print to machine actionable knowledge is both fundamental and complex:
               we need to convert statements such as <q>
                  <emph>facio, facere, feci, factum</emph>
               </q> into something that a morphological analyzer can use to recognize a form
               fecisset as the pluperfect form of the verb <emph>facio</emph>; we need to mine from
               a set of encyclopedia articles the data that will allow us to search primary and
               secondary sources alike for one among dozens of historical figures named
                  <emph>Antigonus</emph>; we need grammars and lexica that provide not only a
               handful of examples but that can also locate the phenomena that they describe in any
               corpus of Greek or Latin; we need editions that can tell us precisely, how and how
               often they differ from another and which previous editions and/or manuscript
               witnesses they follow most closely. </p>
            <p>More than fifteen years ago the Text Encoding Initiative (<ref
                  target="http://www.tei-c.org/index.xml">TEI</ref>) was circulating methods with
               which to create machine actionable editions that can support advanced services and,
               more importantly, can be updated and maintained over time <ptr target="#sperberg1994"
                  />.<note>Early versions of these guidelines were circulating at least as early as
                  1990. For an example of current technology available to manage properly structured
                  textual data, see <ptr target="#vandenbranden2007"/>.</note> The process was an
               open one that invited participation from scholars in Europe and North America. Any
               editor developing a capital resource such as a text, designed to serve an
               intellectual community for decades to come, had an opportunity to learn how to design
               a digital edition that could be printed in the short term and then maintained — and
               even updated — over time.<note>A variety of approaches to designing digital editions
                  have been developed over the years, many based on the TEI, for several (but by no
                  means exhaustive) examples, see <ptr target="#audenaert2008"/>; <ptr
                     target="#dekhtyar2006"/>; <ptr target="#riva2005"/>.</note> In the fifteen
               years that have passed since the TEI documented how to produce digital editions, a
               new generation of scholars has passed from secondary school to the faculty, but all
               of the new editions of classical authors still appear as static print documents, the
               rights sold to commercial publishers.<note>As often in the history of scholarship,
                  New Testament scholars have, by contrast, pioneered the use of information
                  technology, see P. Robinson’s work for example <ptr target="#robinson2000"/>; <ptr
                     target="#robinson2005"/>.</note> If the electronic files were freely available,
               they would be of limited use because their authors did not follow the guidelines that
               the TEI published. Classicists have relied for the most part on the <ref
                  target="http://www.tlg.uci.edu/">
                  <title rend="italic">Thesaurus Linguae Graecae</title>
               </ref> (TLG) to provide searchable versions of the reconstructed texts that have
               appeared — without the introductions, textual notes, indices or other scholarly
               apparatus available in any digital form. </p>
            <p>Converting digital editions to print is a particularly messy task. Editors often do
               not repeat in the textual note the precise passage to which the textual note applies
               — they assume that their human readers will be able to make these connections
               themselves. In a recent study, Federico Boschetti applied a range of techniques with
               which to associate the notes in a textual apparatus with the appropriate place in the
               text. He found that these techniques could correctly associate only about 80% of the
               textual notes with the text to which they referred <ptr target="#boschetti2007"/>.
               This does not even address the task of analyzing the content of the textual notes so
               that we can then pose queries such as <q>where does MS P differ from V by using the
                  same grammatical form but P and V use different dictionary words,</q>
               <q>visualize the evolution of the text of Aeschylus, allowing me to see how each
                  edition differs from those which precede it, which editions are most closely
                  related to one another and which editions have been most influential,</q> or
                  <q>which variants have the biggest apparent impact on the text based on a range of
                  criteria.</q>
            </p>
            <p>The articles in this collection reflect the most recent stage in the evolution of
               digital classics and point to the future, but to appreciate that future, we need to
               review major developments on which that future builds. These articles point forwards
               to an emergent Cyberinfrastructure, but this Cyberinfrastructure builds upon three
               earlier stages of digital classics: incunabular projects, which retain the
               assumptions of print culture, knowledge bases produced by small, centralized
               projects, and digital communities, which allow many contributors to collaborate with
               minimal technical expertise</p>

               <p>Digital incunabula are forms that replicate the established forms of print. Thus,
                  the TLG was, in the early 1970s, designed as a gigantic, infinitely flexible
                  concordance. Its texts capture the basic page layout and canonical citations of
                  the original editions, and a sample search of it is illustrated in <ref
                     target="#figure01">Figure 1</ref>. The <ref
                     target="http://ccat.sas.upenn.edu/bmcr/">Bryn Mawr Classical Review</ref> has
                  been successful because it used forms such as email and then the Web to produce
                  traditional reviews that any classicist could produce and read. The digitized
                  publications in <ref target="http://www.jstor.org/">JSTOR</ref>, <ref
                     target="http://muse.jhu.edu/">Project Muse</ref>, and <ref
                     target="http://books.google.com/">Google Books</ref> provide new methods by
                  which to search and disseminate knowledge, but the ultimate objects of exchange
                  are facsimiles of exchange. These projects tend to require either very large or
                  very small capital investments. They focus on producing, as quickly as possible,
                  the same intellectual objects to which their communities are already accustomed.
                  In this stage of work, catalogues may grow far more elaborate — the TLG and JSTOR
                  allow us to search all the words in primary and secondary sources, while Google
                  dynamically generates maps of places and lists of frequently quoted passages
                  automatically extracted from its image books. All of these projects provide, in
                  effect, a new generation of catalogues where the books remain unchanged. The
                  system designers do not want to get bogged down in the specifics of any particular
                  domain, while the domain experts do not want to get bogged down in the technology.

                        classical Greek texts. First begun in 1972, the TLG provides word searches
                        of various types that deliver excerpts of text that mirror print sources —
                        even the hyphens are retained. The most important contributions of the TLG
                        are (1) very accurate transcriptions of the text (without textual notes,
                        introduction, indices etc.) and (2) encoding one canonical citation scheme
                        by which scholars cite these sources. Incunabular systems have themselves
                        evolved. Storage has grown so much less expensive (by one measure, at least
                        300,000 times cheaper<note>See the discussion of storage costs in 1982

                  in the case of Greek, no — searchable text, but they index all of the text on the
                  page, and their accuracy will increase as OCR software becomes more
                     sophisticated.<note>Google has sponsored development of OCRopus, an open-source

                  library of Greek and Latin critical editions, on which advanced services can be
                  built. The scanned editions, though simple in form, provide a foundation on which
                  more sophisticated digital objects can be built: no license will later pull these
                  image books out of circulation and no license restricts the ways in which they can

                  find a translation and any other background information you may need to make sense
                  of what is before you. In the incunabular stage, the center of computation is
                  external to the document, emphasizes general algorithms and depends upon little,
                  if any, domain specific machine actionable knowledge. In incunabular projects, the

               <p>These kinds of projects, unlike incunabular projects, set out to create knowledge
                  about a particular domain that machines can manipulate and that begin to move
                  beyond the forms of print. In classics, the Perseus Project provides an example of
                  such systems. Perseus set out, in the middle 1980s, to build an environment where
                  knowledge about the ancient world, including both the material and textual record,
                  could be dynamically recombined to support new forms of inquiry. <ref

                  the Perseus Digital Library.The focus of Perseus was to create resources that were
                  in print either impractical in print (e.g., producing dozens or hundreds of high
                  resolution color images of for thousands of Greek vases) or impossible (e.g.,
                  interactive tours of archaeological sites and searching/browsing services based on
                  automated morphological analysis of Greek and Latin).<note>For a list of

                  Semantic text markup is a characteristic feature of such projects: rather than
                  simply recording that a word is, for example, in italics, these systems try to
                  interpret the content and thus to record whether the italics indicate rhetorical
                  emphasis, the title of a literary work, a word quoted from a foreign language, or
                  some other category.<note>The importance of semantic markup for digital library
                     texts has been discussed for many years, particularly the issue of potential
                     semantic interoperability of such markup or metadata, for two examples see <ptr
                        target="#vangendt2006"/> and <ptr target="#elings2007"/>.</note> As these
                  systems grow more intelligent, they convert an increasing portion of the content
                  inside the books into well-structured information that machines can process. These
                  systems depend upon individuals who understand the evolving relationship between
                  the possibilities of technology and the needs of the discipline.<note>We have
                     previously described this role as that of corpus editors, see <ptr

                           rend="italic">Perseus Digital Library</title>. First, documents in this
                        collection have markup illustrating their logical contents: thus, where
                        incunabular systems can only recognize the physical page divisions, the
                        knowledge base allows the digital library system to recognize for dictionary
                        words in the LSJ Greek-English lexicon the many separate entries that appear
                        within a single page or that begin on one page and end on another. Second,
                        the primary source citations have been automatically analyzed and encoded.
                        Thus, the system can take a chunk of Greek, recognize what lines it
                        contains, and then locate dictionary entries (or commentaries,
                        encyclopedias, articles etc.) that refer to the lines in the chunk
                        displayed. In a mature digital library, citations from one text to another
                        become bi-directional links, allowing readers not only to follow the
                        documents that a particular work cites, but also to find works that
                        subsequently cite the document that they are viewing. Third — and perhaps
                        most importantly, morphological knowledge has been represented in machine
                        actionable form. Thus, an automated system is able to recognize that the
                        string ἔννεπε is a form associated with the dictionary entry ἐνίσπω.</head>

                  provide dynamic commentaries. If you retrieve a book in a language that you cannot
                  read or on a topic that you cannot understand, the system can find translations
                  where these already exist, machine translation and translation support systems,
                  reference works, and general background information suited to the general
                  background and immediate purposes of the reader. In knowledge bases, the

                  physically more accessible. Digital communities enable more people to participate

                  make your own contributions by creating annotations directly, producing a blog

               one another, the resulting environment is qualitatively different not only from print
               culture but from any of the three digital environments taken in isolation. Having
               reviewed some developments in the previous generation, we can now begin to consider
               the implications for ePhilology (primary and secondary sources relevant to classical
               Greek and Latin), eClassics (ancient Greek and Latin as they work within human
               minds), and Cyberinfrastructure (the material systems whereby we exchange the objects
               of our intellectual labor and ourselves internalize these objects). The following
               sections describe ePhilology and eClassics. The conclusion to this collection returns
               to the Cyberinfrastructure towards which the individual articles point.</p>

                     advantages of a brave defence, which you know already. But instead of listening
                     to him I would have you day by day fix your eyes upon the greatness of Athens,
                     until you become filled with the love of her; and when you are impressed by the
                     spectacle of her glory, reflect that this empire has been acquired by men who
                     knew their duty and had the courage to do it, who in the hour of conflict had
                     the fear of dishonor always present to them, and who, if ever they failed in an
                     enterprise, would not allow their virtues to be lost to their country, but
                     freely gave their lives to her as the fairest offering which they could present
                     at her feast.</quote>

               <p>If we think only in terms of word searches, the production of camera-ready copy,
                  image management, the ability to generate basic maps, and manually produced format
                  such as wikis and blogs, increased storage and computational power may seem
                  relatively unimportant. For anyone whose career extends more than a decade,
                  current technologies are astonishingly powerful. In 1982, it cost the Harvard
                  Classics Computing Project $34,000 to purchase a 660 megabyte disk drive to store
                  early versions of the TLG: the disk was the size of a washing machine, arrived in
                  a wooden crate, needed a special disk controller, took two days for the
                  technicians to install and required modifications to the version of the Unix
                  operating system then available. The maintenance contract cost c. $4,000/year and
                  was essential. As this introduction is written, $100 buys a terabyte of storage —
                  more than 1000 times as much storage as its 1982 predecessor for 300 times less
                  money, a decrease in cost of more than 300,000 in one quarter of a century. We can
                  now take for granted storage that was previously unimaginable, collecting huge
                  digital images as well as texts and datasets with little regard for the costs of
                  storage or computation. A generation ago, only a few of the wealthiest departments
                  could raise tens of thousands of dollars to provide the storage to search a few
                  million words of Greek and support the first generation of digital publishing. In
                  2008, many cell phones have more than enough storage and computational power to do
                  much more. </p>
               <p>All of us in the academy and in society as a whole, of course, already depend upon
                  general services, such as Google, that require stunning amounts of storage and
                  computational power — even academics who may proudly dissociate themselves from
                  the web of digital services depend completely upon those services for the paper
                  publications that arrive in the mail and the catalogues by which they find books
                  on the shelf. And, of course, we already depend upon digital infrastructure for
                  the paychecks, medical treatments and other fundamental components of material
                  life. Within classical studies, it is easy to see the need for vast networked
                  storage and high performance computing for the analysis and visualization of
                  quantitative and visual evidence from the material culture.<note>The need for
                     support for grid level computing for digital humanities projects has been

               <p>Consider the basic problem of reading Greek and Latin. The machine-actionable
                  Liddell-Scott-Jones (LSJ) Greek-English and Lewis and Short Latin-English lexica
                  developed by the Perseus Project contain 422,000 and 303,000 tagged citations to
                  800 Greek and 80 Latin authors. In LSJ, half of the 422,000 citations are to a
                  half dozen canonical authors. For Lewis and Short, the top dozen authors account
                  for more than two-thirds (215,000) of the citations.</p>
               <p>Not all lexicographic projects have such narrow focus, but extensive lexicographic
                  coverage is extraordinarily labor intensive. The <title rend="italic">Thesaurus
                     Linguae Latinae</title> (TLL) is building a lexicon that covers Latin from
                  earliest times through AD 600 and bases its work on an archive of 10,000,000 slips
                  with information about particular words. The TLL in 2008 boasts a staff of twenty
                  Latinists, began work in 1894, published its first fascicle, and has been an
                  international project since 1949. Its official website promises that the TLL will
                  during 2009 <q>reach the end of the letter P, at
                     which point more than two thirds of the complete work will have
                     appeared</q>.<note>See <ref

               </p>
               <p>The ten million or so words of ancient Latin may require more then a century of
                  labor, but they constitute, of course, a relatively small corpus. The TLG had
                  accumulated 99,000,000 words in 2007.<note>

                  individual Latinist, Johann Ramminger, had accumulated a wordlist of later Latin
                  from Petarch up through 1700 that was based on 200,000,000 words of text already
                  available in digital form. Semi-automated methods involving computerized data but
                  still dependent upon manual analysis of each form may increase productivity by a
                  factor of two or three, but simply enhancing traditional approaches would require
                  centuries to provide us with truly comprehensive lexica of Greek and Latin.</p>
               <p>No branch of scholarship is probably older than lexicography, but our traditional
                  methods do not scale up to the challenges of representing textual materials in
                  Greek and Latin. We have no choice but to exploit, as vigorously as we can,
                  automated methods. The essay by <ref target="/dhq/vol/3/1/000033/000033.html"
                     >Bamman and Crane</ref> in this collection describes some of these methods as
                  they exist today. The essay by <ref target="/dhq/vol/3/1/000032/000032.html"
                     >Finkel and Stump</ref> illustrates how automated methods can reconfirm — but
                  place on a profoundly new foundation — ancient analytical instruments such as the
                  reduction of Latin verbs to a four dimensional space defined by the traditional
                  principal parts.</p>
               <p>Ultimately, automated and manual methods reinforce one another. Decisions embedded
                  in print reference materials such as lexica, indices, and grammars can be, at
                  least in part, extracted and converted into machine actionable data. In effect,
                  human annotators provide the examples and rules from which automated systems
                  learn. The automated systems present the results of what they learn when they work
                  with new materials. Human readers then correct and augment the automated results.
                  The automated systems recalculate their statistical models and then
                     recalculate.<note>For some examples of this process, please see <ptr
                        target="#ganchev2007"/>, <ptr target="#vlachos2006"/>, and <ptr
                        target="#culotta2005"/>.</note> In a mature system, we separate training
                  data from test data so that we can automatically measure the impact that our
                  changes have upon performance.</p>
               <p>Complex algorithms can be computationally demanding even when we are working with
                  small corpora. In preliminary work on sense detection in 2005, we found that by
                  comparing five different translations with the 150,000 Greek words in Thucydides
                  we can identify words with many senses in Thucydides: e.g., passages where the
                  Greek word archê corresponds to <q>beginning</q> or to <q>empire</q>. It took days
                  of processing power from a single CPU to identify clusters of word senses in five
                  translations of the 150,000 words in Thucydides.<note>Work, still unpublished,
                     conducted by D. Sculley, a PhD student in Computer Science at Tufts University.
                     This preliminary work led to the subsequent funded research described by <ref
                        target="/dhq/vol/3/1/000033/000033.html">Bamman and Crane</ref> in this
                     collection.</note> Even if we shift to these algorithms, analyzing millions of
                  words and thousands of translations in a half dozen languages would require more
                  computational power than any desktop system could readily deploy.</p>
               <p>The infrastructure of 2008 forces researchers in classics and in the humanities to
                  develop autonomous, largely isolated, resources. We cannot apply any analysis to
                  data that is not accessible. We need, at the least, to be able gather the data
                  that is available today and, second, to ensure that we can retrieve the same data
                  in 2050 or 2110 that we retrieve in 2010.<note>This need for long term data
                     curation of the scholarly record has recently been discussed by <ptr
                        target="#gold2007"/> and <ptr target="#luce2008"/>.</note> We need digital
                  libraries that may be physically distributed in different parts of the world but
                  that act as a single unit: we need to be able to pose queries such as <q>find all
                     Greek editions and modern language translations of Aeschylus, <title
                        rend="italic">Persians</title>, lines 1-40</q> and retrieve machine
                  actionable results from a variety of sites.<note>For further discussion on the
                     need for distributed digital libraries that can be searched seamlessly and the
                     issues involved, please see <ptr target="#simeoni2007"/>, <ptr
                        target="#trnkoczy2006"/>, and <ptr target="#lagoze2006"/>.</note>
               </p>
               <p>There are two components to this problem. First, we need libraries that can
                  preserve collections in the digital world as they have preserved them in the print
                  world. The institutional repository movement is slowly addressing this
                     challenge.<note>For more on digital preservation and the need for institutional
                     repositories, see <ptr target="#marshall2008"/>; <ptr target="#cantara2006"/>
                     and <ptr target="#hockxyu2006"/>.</note> Thus, the publications in this
                  collection are a part of a long-term institutional repository that can manage
                  static expository prose with very general features such as sections, footnotes,
                  bibliography etc.</p>
               <p>We need, however, more than digital preprints. A second component is the need for
                  sophisticated citation and reference linking services. Smith’s paper in this
                  collection, <ref target="/dhq/vol/3/1/000028/000028.html">

                  identify precise chunks of text within the surviving corpus of classical Greek and

                  library catalogues end and provide furthers layers of granularities essential for
                  classical scholarship: the CTS provides a common language whereby we can aggregate
                  information about particular lines in the <title rend="italic">Iliad</title> or a
                  numbered section from a chapter in Thucydides.<note>For more on the potential of

               <p>The TEI has developed a shared language whereby humanists can describe the same
                  phenomena in similar ways so that we can more readily combine documents produced
                  by different groups. The TEI has many different methods, however, and it is
                  possible to represent the same phenomenon in many different TEI-compliant ways.

                  a famous and famously successful model for distributed authorship, but classicists
                  had already begun pioneering such systems in the 1990s. <ref

                  Greek and Latin has been — or will be — carefully transcribed and edited. If we
                  begin to consider the challenge of extracting and analyzing information about
                  classical Greek and Latin scattered throughout very large collections of books
                  available as scanned page images, the challenges of storage and computation become
                  daunting. The collection of essays thus ends with articles about converting print

                        emphasize that the collection published here reflects the on-going need for
                        expository arguments that articulate particular points of view constructed
                        at a particular time. Nevertheless, even when the superficial form of
                        argumentation remains largely traditional in form, the substitution of
                        dynamic links for static citations can exercise a major impact upon the
                        content and the audience that publications can reach. Stoa.org was founded
                        in 1997 to support, among other things, new forms of publication that would
                        provide rich links to original sources while bringing classics to a broader
                        audience. Thomas Martin’s Overview of Classical Greek History in the <ref

                        subscription models evolved to generate revenue. In a digital environment,

                        the widest possible audience, distributed by a non-profit organization
                        (JSTOR) would cost $19US. The medium sends a strong message to the general

               <p>The authors of these papers represent, however, a greater advance than the work
                  that they have produced so far. In part, this reflects the hope that they will
                  produce even more in the future. They also represent a new community, one large
                  enough to foster junior scholars within the field, and in this way they may
                  indirectly spawn far more productive work than all of them could in the aggregate
                  produce during their own careers. But more significant than any output is the
                  sense within this community that the field of classics is being reborn and that
                  limitations with which many of us grew up are no longer relevant. This new digital
                  world not only changes what we can do but who can do what. The collection of

               <p>We look to a new digital infrastructure not only so that we can increase the body
                  of published information about classical Greek and Latin but so that these
                  languages can play an increased role in the intellectual life of humanity. We can
                  do this in two ways. First, we can create environments that more fully engage
                  those already working with Greek and Latin — we have already begun to address this
                  by creating searchable corpora of Greek and Latin, by making secondary sources
                  available online as PDF files or by adding links between inflected words in a text
                  and their dictionary entries and thus reducing time spent flipping large
                  dictionaries. These all reduce the time between when we pose a question and when
                  we receive an answer. It would be hard to overstate the degree to which
                  cost-benefit decisions, often unconscious, shape the directions that we take in
                  our intellectual lives. Classicists have for millennia understood the difference
                  between being in a small, poorly organized collection and a large collection in
                  which it is easy to find what we want. Cyberinfrastructure provides new threads
                  that we can follow through the vast body of published information.</p>
               <p>The second way to increase the role of classical Greek and Latin is to engage more
                  people in reading and thinking about these languages. Anecdotal evidence suggests
                  that this began to happen as soon as substantial bodies of Greek and Latin became
                  available to the general public. Perseus quickly received letters from students in
                  isolated locations such as rural homes and naval vessels at sea who were using
                  online lexica and texts. Even more interesting, people who had studied Greek and
                  Latin decades before found that the reading support tools available online gave
                  them the support that they needed to begin reading Greek and Latin again.</p>

                  and patients could not only determine the best courses with which to treat disease
                  but also to identify potential problems and predispositions in advance. Health
                  records that include decades of medical tests and case histories clearly raise
                  daunting issues of confidentiality, but the potential benefits are enormous.
                  Emergent cyberinfrastructure for health care includes thus both methods to
                  represent our particular background in great detail and a major investment in
                  maintaining personal privacy. <figure xml:id="figure08">

               <p>The same instruments developed for health care can be adapted for our intellectual
                  backgrounds. We can begin to devise ways for us to keep track of what we have
                  learned so that we can receive background information customized for our
                  particular needs when we confront a new object of study.<note>Adaptive systems
                     that customize themselves automatically to what a user has already learned have
                     been in development for a number of years now, for some recent work see <ptr
                        target="#heilman2008"/>.</note>
                  <ref target="#figure08">Figure 8</ref> illustrates a system that compares an
                  arbitrary text of Latin against a model of the vocabulary that a particular reader
                  has encountered, then calculates which words have been seen before and which are
                  new. Seen words can then be associated with the places where they have been seen
                  in the past, while unseen words can be ranked by their importance according to
                  various criteria (e.g., numerical frequency, relevance to a particular theme etc.)
                  The implementation is conceptually simple but represents the first stage at an
                  open-ended process. As our data sources improve, we can look for more complex
                  linguistic phenomena such as syntax and semantics (e.g., a new sense of a seen
                  word). As our learning models grow more sophisticated, we can begin helping
                  readers identify areas of weakness on which they can focus to enhance their
                  ability to read with fluency.</p>
               <p>Even small advances in our ability to work with multiple languages can be
                  important if they open up historical languages to new audiences, whether these
                  audiences are professional researchers using more linguistic sources or members of
                  the public reading Greek poetry that they would not otherwise have experienced.
                  The biggest benefits are likely to come when we open up linguistic materials to
                  audiences with little or no training in the language. None of us has the
                  opportunity to become familiar with more than a handful of languages. None of us
                  can, in print culture, work with un-translated sources in dozens of languages.</p>
               <p>Classics can, however, show how knowledge about an ancient culture can be designed
                  to serve the speakers of multiple languages. The traditional method is for
                  communities to choose a lingua franca — Akkadian, Greek, Latin, French, German,
                  and now English have all served as common languages of diplomacy and scholarship.
                  The speakers of an unbounded set of local languages communicate by learning one of
                  these linguae francae — thus, the Chinese businessman in a Damascus hotel will
                  probably carry on his business in English. Classicists are more broad-minded but
                  generally expect scholars to publish materials in English, French, German and
                  Italian. Speakers of Croatian or Modern Greek must learn these languages if they
                  are to gain access to most information about the Greco-Roman world.</p>
               <p>Classicists can, however, design their cyberinfrastructure from the start to be as
                  portable as possible across multiple languages. There are at least three basic
                  strategies, the third and most important of which is peculiarly suitable to
                  historical fields where primary sources are finite and heavily studied.</p>
               <p>First, we need to be able to optimize machine translation for the field of
                     classics.<note>Some cultural heritage projects have conducted research into how
                     machine translation can be customized for more resource-poor languages, see
                        <ptr target="#jones2007"/>. </note> We can develop statistical models that
                  capture the idiosyncrasies of documents about Greco-Roman culture. We develop
                  these models by adding markup, using a combination of manual and automated
                  methods, to finite bodies of material as training sets. Machine learning systems
                  then scan these bodies and recognize that Alexandria usually refers to the city in
                  Egypt and almost never to the suburb of Washington, DC, by that name. An ambiguous
                  word such as “case” probably designates a grammatical case in a Greek grammar and
                  a display case in a museum catalogue. These domain specific features, once
                  identified, can help general machine translation systems avoid many of the worst
                  problems they face and improve the quality of their output.</p>
               <p>Second, we need to include as much basic information as we can in forms from which
                  they can be converted into multiple languages. Thus, if we represent birth and
                  death dates in a generic form, we can then develop modules to represent that
                  knowledge in multiple languages. <note>Various research has explored the potential
                     of either translating semantic markup into multiple languages or mapping
                     between languages, see <ptr target="#monroy2007"/> and <ptr target="#bia2006"
                     />. </note> Some ontologies such as the <ref
                     target="http://cidoc.ics.forth.gr/">CIDOC-CRM</ref> for museum objects and <ref
                     target="http://www.ifla.org/vii/s13/frbr/frbr.pdf">FRBR</ref> for books have
                  been under development for years and can represent a great deal of basic
                  background information.<note>For a specific look at how CIDOC-CRM is being used
                     with multilingual texts, see <ptr target="#genereux2006"/>.</note>
               </p>
               <p>Third, canonical literary texts attract very large amounts of labor. We can use
                  that labor to create databases of linguistic annotations that describe syntax
                  (e.g., the subject and object of a verb), co-reference (e.g., which person is the
                  subject of a particular verb), semantics (e.g., where does <emph>oratio</emph>
                  correspond to <q>prayer</q> rather than <q>oration</q> or some other concept).
                  These annotations stored in treebanks and other linguistic databases not only
                  allow us to put our understanding of Greek and Latin on a wholly new, quantifiable
                  foundation but can resolve the ambiguities that bedevil machine translation and
                  can ultimately support higher quality machine translation.<note>The Perseus
                     Project has recently begun work on a Greek treebank, and work on a Latin
                     treebank has been ongoing for over three years, for more on the Latin treebank,
                     see <ptr target="#bamman2007"/> and <ptr target="#bamman2006"/>.</note> Such
                  annotations are expensive but are, in effect, the digital successors to print
                  editions. Where print editors labored to resolve ambiguities and problems in the
                  textual tradition, digital editors provide machine actionable annotations that
                  resolve where possible ambiguities in the reconstructed texts.</p>
               <p>The problem of multilingual knowledge thus breaks down into language independent
                  and language dependent phases.</p>
               <p>Knowledge bases (e.g., basic propositional statements) and linguistic annotation
                  can be created by speakers of any language. The tag sets of ontologies and
                  annotation schemes are relatively contained and can themselves be translated,
                  allowing authors to work entirely with Greek, Latin and their own primary
                  languages: the birthdate of a given author may be uncertain but that uncertainty
                  can be represented in a general form by the speaker of any language. We may differ
                  in how we construe the syntax of a sentence, but anyone who knows Greek,
                  regardless of their native language, can decide which word depends on which and
                  represent this in a common format.</p>
               <p>Communities that want to make publications in their own languages accessible to
                  wider audiences will have to develop the training sets for documents about
                  classics. The results will not be perfect but readers can then use dictionary
                  lookups and other translation aids to more closely study the original language.
                  Each language needs its own training sets but this approach will not only make
                  publications in the traditional languages of publication accessible to wider
                  audiences but will also open up publications in less widely read languages (e.g.
                  Croatian and Dutch) to much larger audiences.</p>
               <p>Communities that want to be able to read basic knowledge about the Greco-Roman
                  world in their own language will need machine translation that can be optimized
                  for classics and language specific drivers that can convert the basic knowledge
                  from ontologies into their language, and systems that can exploit the dense
                  linguistic annotations available for major canonical source texts.</p>
               <p>The creation of knowledge bases designed from the start to flow from language to
                  language would be a radical change from traditional scholarly practice.
                  Nevertheless, there are profound strategic reasons for this new form of
                  scholarship in the two major classes of society that produce scholarship about the
                  Greco-Roman world.</p>
               <p>Classical Greek and Latin are the foundational languages of Europe and were the
                  languages of high culture and trans-European discourse until relatively recent
                  times — in fact, Turkey, whatever its religious background, would only restore to
                  Europe a region that had been lost to it from the past. The European Union has a
                  commitment to make the cultural heritage of its nations intellectually accessible
                  to the widest possible audience. This implies an infrastructure that maximizes
                  what can be learned not only in English, French, German, and Italian, but in all
                  of the other official languages of Europe.<note>The challenges of supporting
                     multi-lingual access to Europe’s cultural heritage through the European Digital
                     Library have been discussed in <ptr target="#agosti2007"/>.</note>
               </p>
               <p>The United States, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, and South Africa are, however,
                  not only geographically distinct from Europe but are fashioning themselves into
                  cosmopolitan societies, European in origin but creating new identities with roots
                  from every civilization of humanity. The United States has in particular
                  identified Chinese and Arabic as the two strategic languages on which it will
                  concentrate its resources. While Europe concentrates on making its cultural
                  heritage accessible to the speakers of its official languages, American scholars
                  can take the lead in making classical antiquity increasingly accessible to
                  speakers of Chinese, Arabic and other languages. Ultimately, the increased
                  distribution of Greco-Roman cultural materials into many other languages will
                  speed the complementary process of opening up materials in classical Chinese,
                  Arabic, Sanskrit and other languages to speakers of English and other European
                  languages. Our larger goal must be to make the record of humanity accessible to
                  everyone regardless of linguistic and cultural background.</p>
               <p>While a linguistically and culturally portable knowledge base about the
                  Greco-Roman world may seem daunting, the tools already at hand allow us to rethink
                  not only who can read and consume primary and secondary sources but who can
                  contribute substantively to the field. <ref

                  opens this collection by describing how the practices of undergraduates have begun
                  to change. The rise of undergraduate research is arguably the most important and
                  promising development for classics as a discipline since classics lost its
                  privileged position. Before we can appreciate the possibilities of the technology
                  now available but not yet fully exploited, we need to see how much classicists
                  have already begun to accomplish.</p>
               <p>Before turning to the prospects for undergraduate and more general non-specialist
                  research in classics, we should emphasize that the collection of essays published
                  here themselves illustrate the greatest achievement of classical philology in this
                  digital world. We now have a critical mass of classicists who are committed to
                  building and exploiting the evolving digital infrastructure upon which all
                  scholarship and teaching in our field will depend. While discussions of digital
                  humanities still revert to the problem of tenure and promotion, several of the
                  contributors to this collection have already earned tenure by pursuing digital
                  projects. All of the authors here are able to review innovative forms of digital
                  scholarship on its intellectual merits, neither penalizing or rewarding the use of
                  digital technologies per se but assessing the degree to which the new work
                  advances our ancient and unchanging goals to bring the Greco-Roman heritage in
                  general and ancient Greek and Latin in particular ever more fully to life in the
                  minds of the broadest audience possible.</p>
               <p>No one showed more vision and patience to create this community than our colleague
                  and beloved friend, Allen Ross Scaife. He showed the way with his own pioneering
                  work on <title rend="italic">Diotima</title>, a digital representations of women
                  in antiquity. As director of the <title rend="italic">Stoa</title> from its
                  founding until his death ten years later, Ross always understood that the greatest
                  resource for any field was the people whom it attracted. Ross supported, fostered,
                  encouraged, and advanced careers that will continue now for decades and will shape
                  other careers as well. <quote rend="inline" source="#canonical">Do not lament,</quote> the
                  Pericles of Thucydides (1.143.5) tells the Athenians, <quote rend="inline"
                     source="#canonical">houses and land but people, for it is not houses and land that
                     acquire people but people who acquire them.</quote> The passing of Ross Scaife
                  wounds the field of classics more deeply than would have the loss of everything
                  that the field as a whole has produced. But the community that Ross fostered with
                  intelligence, patience and love and that produced these essays is greater than any
                  single achievement that their authors could ever produce.</p>
