                     order to identify the sources of previously unattributed
                     quotations within the work of Eliza Haywood. The article
                     offers a brief introduction to methods used previously
                     within the field of historical text reuse, describes the
                     combinatorial ngram approach used within the present work,
                     then shows how this method can help us better understand the
                     complex inner workings of Eliza Haywood’s most celebrated
                     novel, <cite class="title italic">Betsy Thoughtless</cite>.

                     witnessed a revolution in notions of authorship, one that
                     moved from a culture based on imitation to a culture
                     organized around the production of original
                     utterances.<a class="noteRef" href="#d4e181">[1]</a> Since at least the publication of Harold
                     Ogden White's <cite class="title italic">Plagiarism and Imitation
                        during the English Renaissance</cite>, scholars have
                     maintained that those writing in the seventeenth and early
                     eighteenth centuries endorsed the model of <cite class="title italic">imitatio</cite> that one finds throughout
                     classical writing: "That early modern
                     writing does not operate according to the logic of
                     original invention is well known," writes Max
                     Thomas: "Between the residual medieval
                     tradition of <em class="emph">compilatio</em> and the
                     humanistic practices of <em class="emph">copia</em> and
                     <em class="emph">inventio</em>, the dominant structure of
                     writing was largely imitative"
                      [<a class="ref" href="#thomas2000">Thomas 2000</a>, 282]. By the 1750s, however, the scene had changed. "It is in the middle of the 18<span class="hi superscript">th</span> century," writes
                     George Buelow, that "the concept of originality . . .
                     become[s] [a] significant elemen[t] in critical
                     writings, and it is on this foundation of new ideas
                     that much of the further development of aesthetic
                     criticism as well as actual artistic achievement in
                     all the arts was made possible in the 19<span class="hi superscript">th</span> century"
                      [<a class="ref" href="#buelow1990">Buelow 1990</a>, 123]. During this pivotal period, celebrated works like
                     Edward Young's "Conjectures on Original
                     Composition" helped make "Originality . . . the main force in the creative
                     process," driving out earlier endorsements of
                     imitation with an insistence on each author's individual
                     genius [<a class="ref" href="#buelow1990">Buelow 1990</a>, 123].<a class="noteRef" href="#d4e255">[2]</a></div>

                  <div class="ptext" id="p2"> Written in the midst of this cultural shift, Eliza Haywood’s
                     1751 novel <cite class="title italic">Betsy Thoughtless</cite>
                     includes a wide variety of passages drawn from an array of
                     previous literary texts, and offers an interesting case
                     study of the struggle between mimesis and authorial
                     originality during the eighteenth century. Unfortunately,
                     adequate study of Haywood’s intertextual borrowings has
                     heretofore been limited because previous scholarship has
                     been unable to identify the sources for many of the passages
                     borrowed in Haywood’s writing. In an attempt to help fill
                     this scholarly gap, the present study introduces a novel
                     algorithmic method that can be used to identify instances of
                     intertextuality in large data sets, and shows how one can
                     leverage this workflow to generate new insights on the
                     nature of intertextuality in literary texts such as
                     Haywood’s novel.

                  <div class="ptext" id="p3">The methods used within the present study may be best
                     illustrated by comparison with previous work in the field of
                     historical text reuse. In their research on intertextuality
                     in classical texts, Neil Coffee et al. use a sliding window
                     technique to find passages wherein two texts share at least
                     two words, then rank the matching window results according
                     to the proximity and rarity of the words shared in the two
                     windows. Jean-Gabriel Ganascia et al. also use a sliding
                     window technique and score matches based on word rarity,
                     though they allow for missing words in their sliding windows
                     such that two windows of five words can count as a match if
                     they share three words in common. David Smith et al. use a
                     sliding n-gram window to establish candidate pairs, leverage
                     the Smith-Waterman algorithm to align matching sequences in
                     documents, and finally sort documents with matching windows
                     according to the frequency of their common n-grams.
                     Similarly, Constance Mews et al. also use a sequence
                     alignment technique that matches strings based on identical
                     words. Moving away from a sliding window technique, Glenn
                     Roe et al. measure the cosine distance between passages in a
                     term document matrix, while David Bamman et al. use Moore's
                     Bilingual Sentence Aligner and a translation probability
                     table generated from MGIZA++ to identify cross-lingual
                     instances of intertextuality.

                  <div class="ptext" id="p4">The present study extends the candidate retrieval step of
                     Jean-Gabriel Ganascia et al., and implements a minimal
                     probabilistic model to remove high probability ngrams from
                     the database in order to reduce both storage requirements
                     and processing time. The first step of the method used
                     within the present study is to preprocess each file in a
                     corpus, transform each file into an array of sentences using
                     the Punkt sentence boundary detector, drop stopwords, remove
                     non-token punctuation, and lowercase all text. Because
                     orthography was non-standardized in the eighteenth century,
                     the lookup table from MorphAdorner is then used to
                     regularize the spelling of each word in the text, using a
                     simple hash table replacement. Finally, the WordNet
                     Lemmatizer is used to transform each word into its lemma
                     form.

                  <div class="ptext" id="p5">Once the texts are all represented as lists of clean and
                     normalized sentences, the next step of analysis is to find
                     sentences with unusually similar language. To accomplish
                     this, a sliding window of length <em class="emph">w</em> is slid over
                     each sentence in the corpus such that for each sentence, the
                     window first contains words 0 through <em class="emph">w</em>-1 from
                     the sentence, then 1 through <em class="emph">w</em>, then 2 through
                     <em class="emph">w</em>+1, and so on. For each of these windows,
                     a list of all possible combinations of <em class="emph">c</em> words
                     from the window is generated. Suppose <em class="emph">c</em> is 3,
                     and the algorithm is considering the following sentence:

                     saw spots", "all saw but" . . . "her
                     brightness took". In order to minimize the storage
                     requirements and maximize the utility of these ngrams, the
                     algorithm next estimates the rarity of each ngram by
                     calculating the product of the relative frequency of each
                     word in the ngram.<a class="noteRef" href="#d4e345">[3]</a> The rarity of the ngram
                     "spots few brightness", for instance, is calculated
                     as p(spots) * p(few) * p(brightness). Because ngrams with
                     high probability are much more likely to be found often in a
                     corpus and are therefore much less useful for detecting
                     textual reuse, they are dropped from the list, and the
                     remaining ngrams are stored in a database.

                     the combinatorial ngrams in each sentence from the input
                     document to the sentences archived in the database.<a class="noteRef" href="#d4e354">[4]</a> An estimation of the similarity of two
                     sentences can be produced by simply summing up the number of

                     the combinatorial ngram method gives a stronger indication
                     of their semantic similarity, yielding 10 combinatorial
                     trigram matches for the pair. Using this simple and scalable
                     technique on the works of Eliza Haywood, we shall see below,
                     allows one to rapidly identify instances of textual reuse
                     and thereby improve our understanding of the production and
                     dissemination of literary texts in the long eighteenth
                     century.<a class="noteRef" href="#d4e379">[5]</a></div>

                  <div class="ptext" id="p11">Although much of Eliza Haywood’s biography remains
                     mysterious, she was notorious within the literary circles of
                     her day. After early careers as an actress and successful
                     playwright, Haywood embarked upon a prolific career as a
                     writer that would lead one eighteenth-century biographer to
                     call her "perhaps the most voluminous
                     female writer this kingdom ever produced." Many
                     of the works in her canon offered critical if comical
                     responses to high-profile works by male literati of the day.
                     In titles such as <cite class="title italic">The Female
                        Spectator</cite>, <cite class="title italic">Anti-Pamela</cite>, <cite class="title italic">Memoirs of
                        the Court of Lilliput</cite>, and <cite class="title italic">The Female Dunciad</cite>, Haywood transformed works
                     by Joseph Addison, Samuel Richardson, Jonathan Swift, and
                     Alexander Pope into biting commentary on the gender
                     inequality within eighteenth-century England. For these
                     efforts, Alexander Pope granted Haywood a position next to
                     the goddess Dullness in <cite class="title italic">The
                        Dunciad</cite>, and James Sterling crowned Haywood
                     alongside Aphra Behn and Delarivier Manley in his "fair triumvirate of wit," both of
                     which acts attest to Haywood’s elevated status in the
                     eighteenth-century world of letters.

                  <div class="ptext" id="p12">In works from her later years, such as her best-known novel
                     <cite class="title italic">Betsy Thoughtless</cite>, Haywood
                     used realistic portraits of the social dynamics of
                     eighteenth-century England to fight for gender equality. She
                     also borrowed an unusually large quantity of material from
                     previous writers, weaving vast quantities of quotations from
                     previous literature into her own writing. In the case of
                     <cite class="title italic">Betsy Thoughtless</cite>, as
                     Andrea Austin has noted, Haywood leaves most of these
                     quotations unattributed: "The overwhelming majority of
                     quotations follow the introductory phrase, 'as the
                     poet says', or some variation thereof,
                     leaving the reader to determine the source of her
                     borrowing . . . . Only in a few instances does she
                     identify the original source"
                      [<a class="ref" href="#austin2000">Austin 2000</a>, 278]. The majority of these mysterious quotations have
                     remained unsourced ever since, perhaps because Haywood’s
                     representations of the source material often depart
                     significantly from the source texts themselves. As Kathryn
                     R. King observes in her standard edition of Haywood’s works, "Haywood could be highly creative in
                     her use of sources, embroidering here and there on
                     hints she found in them and seldom exhibiting an
                     overnice regard for considerations of veracity . . .
                     . Her reworkings of her sources deserve, in fact, a
                     study of their own."
                      [<a class="ref" href="#haywood2001">Haywood 2001</a>, x]. Armed with the vast digital databases that have
                     recently become available, it is now possible to heed King’s
                     call and trace Haywood’s reworkings of source material in

                     renderings with her sources, one finds that Haywood often
                     changes her sources in provocative ways. Consider, for

                  <div class="ptext" id="p15">By closely comparing these passages, one finds that Haywood
                     withheld the feminist punchline of Dryden’s stanza: "Errors of wives reflect on husbands
                     still." Perhaps of greater import is the fact
                     that while Dryden believed "secrets of
                     marriage"
                     <em class="emph">were</em> still held sacred, Haywood needed to
                     implore that secrets of marriage <em class="emph">should</em> be held
                     sacred. Such repetitions with a difference abound in
                     Haywood’s textual reuse, and might well reflect Haywood’s
                     position on the status of institutions such as marriage in
                     her day.

                  <div class="ptext" id="p16">Comparing Haywood’s adaptations to their source passages also
                     helps to reveal one reason why previous editors have had
                     difficulty identifying the sources of her quotations, namely
                     the fact that Haywood often combined lines from disparate
                     literary works into a single passage and then passed the
                     resulting passage off as a "quotation" of extant works.
                     Take, for example, the following passage from <cite class="title italic">Betsy Thoughtless</cite>:

                  <div class="lg">

                     "thoughtless." By the end of the
                     novel, however, Betsy repents for her wayward youth and
                     devotes herself to a single love, Mr. Trueworth.
                     Interestingly, as Betsy completes her transition from
                     flighty youth to dedicated lover, the passages Haywood
                     borrows from other texts also become more faithful to their
                     source texts. By calculating the Jaccard Similarity
                     Coefficient between Haywood’s source passage and Haywood’s
                     rendering of that passage for each borrowed quotation within

                     misbegotten youth and devotes herself to a dedicated
                     relationship with Mr. Trueworth. Whether this trend

                     Haywood’s adapted quotations reveals that a significant
                     portion of the poetic passages Haywood incorporates into her
                     own writing are derived from a single work of literary
                     extracts, the 1710 edition of Edward Bysshe’s <cite class="title italic">Art of English Poetry</cite>. Bysshe’s
                     volume is essentially a collection of literary passages
                     organized into hundreds of themes such as "Love,"
                     "Gypsy," and so on. As Table 1 shows, nearly half of
                     the quotations Haywood adapts in <cite class="title italic">Betsy
                        Thoughtless</cite> are present in Bysshe’s volume. One
                     could take for example the point in the novel wherein Lady
                     Mellasin reflects on the beauty of Miss Flora, and Haywood
                     uses the following phrase to introduce a borrowed quotation:
                     "[Lady Mellasin] had often heard and
                     read of men, whose resentment had been softened and
                     melted into tenderness on the appearance of a lovely
                     object: — as the poet somewhere or other expresses
                     it..." [519]. Having created a need for a passage
                     on beauty, Haywood then weaves in a passage found under the
                     "Beauty" heading in Bysshe’s

                     another quotation from the "Beauty" section in Bysshe’s volume [536].
                     Examining passages such as the above, it seems Haywood often
                     introduced her quotations with vague phrases like "as the
                     poet somewhere or other expresses it" because she
                     didn’t yet know which poet she would quote, or the text from
                     which she would quote. She merely intended to look up a
                     relevant heading in Bysshe’s volume and siphon off a quote
                     from that page.

                     can use computational methods to trace patterns in
                     intertextuality within literary texts. Using a novel method
                     to scour large text collections for patterns of textual
                     reuse, the present study has discovered many sources for the
                     borrowed passages in Eliza Haywood’s writing. By examining
                     those passages in detail, one finds that many of Haywood’s
                     changes to her source materials may well help reveal both
                     her position on contemporary institutions as well as the
                     particular editions of works from which she derived the
                     borrowings. Furthermore, examining Haywood’s borrowed
                     quotations in the aggregate, one finds that the degree of
                     similarity between her source materials and her own
                     representation of those materials offers a provocative
                     parallel to her protagonist’s psychological development over
                     the course of <cite class="title italic">Betsy
                        Thoughtless</cite>. Lastly and most curiously, one finds
                     that a shocking portion of the quotations Haywood
                     incorporated into her texts derive from a single work of
                     literary extracts from the period, the 1710 edition of
                     Edward Bysshe’s <cite class="title italic">Art of English
                        Poetry</cite>. In sum, closely attending to the texts
                     Haywood borrowed — including their original sources, the
                     contexts in which Haywood introduces those passages, and the
                     ways in which she modifies them — offers a series of rare
                     glimpses into the finer points of a powerful and playful
                     writer’s mind.
