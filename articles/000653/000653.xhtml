                  <p>In <cite class="title italic">Technology and the Historian</cite>, Adam Crymble proposes a history of digital history, arguing that understanding the
                     origins and rationale behind the discipline’s development is necessary to lead conversations
                     about its future. </p>

                  <h1 class="head">The History of Digital History: A Review of Crymble (2021)</h1>
                  
                  <div class="counter"><a href="#p1">1</a></div>
                  <div class="ptext" id="p1">A most basic and overly simplistic definition of history would state that the field
                     comprises tracking and contextualizing change over time, which is exactly what Adam
                     Crymble admirably does in <cite class="title italic">Technology and the Historian</cite>. The author presents an overdue comprehensive perspective on the birth and growth
                     of Digital History as a new field within the historical discipline. Rather than setting
                     fire to the outdated writings of the past, the author rescues that literature to present
                     the origins and rationale behind the development of what we currently call by Digital
                     Humanities and, more precisely, Digital History. He calls historians to recognize
                     the influence of technology in historical practices and the impact that computers
                     had on historical studies in the information age, independently of their scholarly
                     work being categorized as <em class="term">digital history</em> or not. Crymble argues that historians have chosen to gloss over the transformative
                     role of technology for too long and claims that his book is a first attempt to overcome
                     this “blind spot” in historical inquiry. In his own words, “a history [of Digital History] also forces historians to acknowledge that their field
                     is influenced not only by philosophical shifts and theory, but by each new gadget
                     or piece of software coming out of the Silicon Valley”[<a class="ref" href="#crymble2021">Crymble 2021</a>, 9]. </div>
                  
                  <div class="counter"><a href="#p2">2</a></div>
                  <div class="ptext" id="p2">One of the main merits of the book, therefore, is an analysis of literature produced
                     utilizing digital methods in the last decades, and how they provide opportunities
                     to understand the synchronic relation between methodological and theoretical demands
                     of the field and computational methods – in the context in which they were created.
                     Rather than trying to define Digital History as a concise field in a “single overarching narrative” [<a class="ref" href="#crymble2021">Crymble 2021</a>, 9], the book seeks to present a historical account of digital history in its plurality,
                     with a rationale that created the demand for computational methods and a common vocabulary
                     for historians. He even includes a glossary at the end of the book to uniformize the
                     terminology that historians working with digital methods should use. Finally, Crymble
                     advocates for building a solid and critical historiography of digital history to free
                     digital scholars from the loop of the “eternal present” [<a class="ref" href="#crymble2021">Crymble 2021</a>, 3], i.e., the perfunctory rejection of older literature in favor of the most recent
                     ones.   </div>
                  
                  <div class="counter"><a href="#p3">3</a></div>
                  <div class="ptext" id="p3">The chapters are divided into what Crymble identifies as the five realms of digital
                     history: historical research, archive, classroom, self-learning eco-system, and scholarly
                     communication channels. Chapter 1 seeks to institute the twofold origin of digital
                     history as a set of practices that use computers for scholarly inquiry based on either
                     “records of bureaucracy” for quantitative research (begun by Frank Owsley’s <cite class="title italic">Plain Folk of the South</cite>) or <em class="term">big data</em> for <em class="term">humanities computing</em> (begun by Robert Busa’s project Index Thomisticus). Chapter 2 focuses on mass digitization
                     and archival practices as two intertwined factors that shape one another and, most
                     importantly, not only revolutionize the way scholars conduct research nut also the
                     outreach of their scholarly production. The archival turn and the revisionism in library
                     and museum sciences shed light on the ways archival entries (be they texts, documents,
                     or artifacts) are selected and organized into collections and, conversely, how digital
                     collections are built and presented. Digital collections and the access to them (consider
                     the internet and the different devices we use), according to Crymble, create new spaces
                     that profoundly change the ways scholars and public alike engage with collections
                     and, consequently, with the past. Chapter 3 presents how digital technologies meet
                     the premises of an already ongoing revision of teaching methods undertaken by educational
                     theorists and psychologists in which lectures and teacher-centered methods are called
                     into question in favor of student-centered approaches. Crymble identifies four waves
                     of experiments in the teaching of history (data-centric, audience-focused multimedia,
                     data analysis, return to history with some digital component) to highlight that, although
                     digital methods are not the only innovative initiatives undertaken, the “technology-inflected history classroom” [<a class="ref" href="#crymble2021">Crymble 2021</a>, 105] is one of the most obvious places for experimentation.  </div>
                  
                  <div class="counter"><a href="#p4">4</a></div>
                  <div class="ptext" id="p4">In Chapter 4, Crymble explores what he calls “the invisible college,” or the support network that many historians and historians-to-be need to independently
                     build due to the lack of institutional structures to contemplate computing and technological
                     skills in their curricula. That encompasses an eco-system that provides not only self-learning
                     resources but, basically, advice in what to learn and how. Chapter 5 analyzes how
                     historians used computational technologies such as blogs as a continuation of older
                     practices to share their work and communicate with peers in a space parallel but outside
                     institutional centers of higher education. Challenging long-established and rigid
                     academic hierarchies, historian bloggers create channels for disrupting disciplinary
                     boundaries and build communities with similar goals that might surpass geographical
                     and other limitations in unprecedented ways. Be it by presenting their findings to
                     larger audiences, sharing research (and often activist) agendas, or simply ranting
                     about the hardships of academia, social media certainly has demanded a more self-reflective
                     attitude from history professionals occupying different ranks. Finally, Chapter 6
                     acts as a conclusion chapter in which the author clearly enunciates the greater contribution
                     of his book: to disprove historiographies that neglect the impact of the not only
                     methodological but also material influence of technology (encompassing computers,
                     scanners, tablets, Kindles, cell phones, and so on) on the history profession in favor
                     of intellectual influences. Moreover, he encourages historians to define their scholarship
                     in specific ways rather than as “digital history,” a terminology too broad and even disparate to convey any intelligible information.

                  <div class="ptext" id="p5">Crymble invites historians to engage in collaborative work that will consider social,
                     not only technical, differences across geographical locations and briefly cites examples
                     of digital histories applied to different social and cultural contexts, such as the
                     activist nature of the historical profession in South Africa, the translation of the
                     <cite class="title italic">Programming Historian</cite> to Spanish speakers, and the promising scenario in India. Crymble closes the book
                     by remembering Marshall McLuhan’s idea of “global village” [<a class="ref" href="#crymble2021">Crymble 2021</a>, 170], and highlighting the potential that the digital age offers as a powerful venue for
                     historical inquiry. The book is a thoughtful reflection on the evolution of digital
                     history and digital humanities relevant to anyone interested in the subject, including
                     graduate students in the humanities, historians, literary theorists, linguists, and
                     educators in general.   </div>
