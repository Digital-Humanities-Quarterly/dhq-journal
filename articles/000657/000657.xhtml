                  <p>I examine the influence of one literary text upon another by the open-source
                     					programming methodology of information science. In particular, I look at
                     					how the “Calamus,” sequence as rendered in the 1867 <cite class="title italic">Leaves of Grass</cite> may be understood to be
                     					topically present, although most of the sequence was removed and regrouped
                     					by William Michael Rossetti toward publishing the first British Whitman
                     					edition in the 1868 <cite class="title italic">Poems by Walt Whitman</cite>. I
                     					further demonstrate the complement of theory testing as I examine the
                     					laudatory and cautionary nature of the “Calamus,” poems. Those
                     					celebrations and reservations about loving out of bounds may at once apply
                     					either to the radical inclusivity of a new republic or in same-sex love.
                     					While the utility of that laud-caution categorization remains tenuous,
                     					looking at both the limitations and strengths of the approach demonstrate
                     					the utility of employing a non-linear, even hypertextual sensibility
                     					readily available to readers who wish to encounter the social cognitive
                     					terrain of a literary work. On that terrain, I argue, readers can better
                     					understand a mind produced in time and responding to its time.</p>

                     				readership, William Michael Rossetti strode the line between censorship and
                     				advocacy, as well as that between an enabling and co-opted subversion. That
                     				Hotten edition removed about one-half of <cite class="title italic">Leaves of Grass
                        				</cite>(1867) — including what would become “Song of Myself” — toward making
                     				possible Whitman’s broader circulation in the United Kingdom. <cite class="title italic">Poems</cite> was praised by the <cite class="title italic">Saturday Review </cite>for

                     				published into the 20th century, remains remarkable in a British publishing
                     				culture that allowed officials to seize an entire press run before either the
                     				author or publisher appeared in court to argue its merit.</div>

                     				text betrays an editorial/critical orientation contrary to the values of a
                     				digital humanities community underscored by openness to process and
                     				collaboration with others. It permits authorial identity and preferences to
                     				trump the slate the values that permitted publication, however second-guessed
                     				that edition was. To understand <cite class="title italic">Poems </cite>to be bowdlerized
                     				puts it in the company of <cite class="title italic">The Family Shakespeare: in which
                        					nothing is added to the original text, but those words and expression are
                        					omitted which cannot with propriety be read in a family</cite> [<a class="ref" href="#bowdler2009">Bowdler 2009</a>]. That family-friendly Shakespeare
                     				continues to remove the vulgarity and bawdy joys that Thomas’s sister Henrietta
                     				sensed more than two centuries ago; the entire six volume set published by
                     				Cambridge University Press can be acquired for about $350. Encamping <cite class="title italic">Poems </cite>with <cite class="title italic">The Bowdler Shakespeare,
                        				</cite>while distantly viable, is to dismiss its achievement as the end result of
                     				another morally squeamish, superficially selective editor whose first purpose
                     is
                     				to serve the family rather than the author. It is also to place Poems in a
                     				timeless void, removed from the very social dynamics upon which production and
                     				dissemination take place in the digital humanities. </div>

                  <div class="ptext" id="p3">More viable is to describe <cite class="title italic">Poems </cite>as an expurgated Whitman.
                     				Rossetti can be accurately but narrowly understood as expurgating <cite class="title italic">Leaves </cite>in his selection criterion to omit entirely
                     				every poem which could with any tolerable fairness be deemed offensive to the
                     				feelings of morals or propriety in this peculiarly nervous age [<a class="ref" href="#whitman1868">whitman 1868</a>, 20]. However, Henrietta’s editing of Shakespeare made no allowance for th
                     				limitations of an age; her Shakespeare was in fact elevated as that fit for all
                     				time. By contrast, Rossetti’s edition was qualified and even necessitated by his
                     				particularly Victorian <em class="emph">nervous age. </em>Just as importantly,
                     				one purpose of Rossetti’s edition was to serve a living author rather than the
                     				sanctity of the family. He upheld American endorsers Burroughs (1867/1971) and
                     				O’Connor (1866/2021), who each declared Whitman to be “<em class="emph">the
                        				</em>poet of the epoch” [<a class="ref" href="#whitman1868">whitman 1868</a>, 4]. In judging Whitman as particularly
                     				suited for the present age of his edition, Rossetti declared that Victorian
                     				readers would benefit by judging for themselves the merits of Whitman, who
                     				“beyond all his competitors” is “incapable of all compromise and an initiator in
                     					the scheme and form of his works” [<a class="ref" href="#whitman1868">whitman 1868</a>, 4]. </div>

                     				First, Rossetti served no official office in presenting his selected Whitman.
                     He
                     				merely offered his edition to the court of literary deliberation. Second, I
                     				doubt any censor has so thoroughly considered and documented a case for
                     				censorship. Rossetti offered his edition at invitation of a commercial
                     				publisher. Further, he did so after first encountering Whitman’s work as a
                     				reader and a leading commentator of Victorian publishing 12 years before his <cite class="title italic">Chronicle </cite>article. That secretary to the Pre-Raphaelite
                     				Brotherhood may have even identified in Whitman the American complement of the
                     				movement. Yet further, his goal was to advance reception of an author rather
                     				than thwart it.</div>

                  <div class="ptext" id="p5">Rather than argue Rossetti was either an advocate for or an expurgator of Whitman,
                     				I offer a conciliatory, more utilitarian position. Rossetti brought forward a
                     					<em class="emph">selected</em> Whitman that he thought possible to publish
                     				within the constraints of his time. Moreover, he did so for the benefit of a
                     				living author and a readership whose understanding of the man was all too
                     				frequently shaped by the hearsay-report of the periodicals of the day. While his
                     				depiction of a democratic spokesman championing the humanity of all is only one
                     				aspect of Whitman, he also presented a Whitman who yearned to receive the love
                     				that he offered to others and yet could only indirectly state. Accordingly, I
                     				argue that Rossetti presented a Whitman who was both an all-too-humanly needy
                     				American citizen and an egalitarian spokesman for the inherent worth of all —
                     				regardless of nationality, vocation or any caste formation. This Whitman should
                     				be the herald for the digital humanities on his dual insistence on hearing
                     				others — all others — well, and being heard. This is a Whitman that should leap
                     				off the page of any particular edition into the life of a poem inside and
                     				outside of an edition. This is a Whitman that can be summoned from the free
                     				access universe of individual editions and re-animated for present readers. </div>

                  <div class="ptext" id="p6">Rossetti’s pragmatism was also noted by Folsom (<a href="#folsom1991">1991</a>), who observed that Whitman

                     				(642). From the 1868 <cite class="title italic">Poems </cite>through <cite class="title italic">Selected Poems</cite> <span class="error"><a class="ref" href="#stedman2008">#stedman2008</a></span>, Whitman

                     				a kinder, gentler introduction. The compromise was not that of Whitman’s
                     				redactors, but Whitman’s in his complicity to allow <cite class="title italic">Leaves
                        				</cite>to be partitioned into slimmer volumes and anthology samples [<a class="ref" href="#folsom1991">Folsom 1991</a>].
                     				Any excerpt — no matter how large or tamed into making Whitman one of other

                     				cultural narrative that locates authorship most authentically achieved in the
                     				literary vision and products of a single writer. Today, <em class="emph">Whitman </em>is a brand name in present publishing, translation and
                     				commentary more than an author who oversaw nine editions of <cite class="title italic">Leaves </cite>in his lifetime. Even from the outset, <em class="emph">Whitman </em>ceased to be an author whose name was merely a placeholder
                     				for various literary works. In reception and by his own design, <em class="emph">Whitman </em>was seen at once as shamelessly

                     				author of the poem that would become “Song of Myself” is not overtly present in
                     					<cite class="title italic">Poems </cite>because Rossetti excerpted no portion of it.
                     				However, a Whitman comprised by and capable of containing multitudes is surveyed
                     				by Rossetti in the various narrative voices that collectively illustrate both

                     				that glossed as gross and indecent — Rossetti included 11 of 40 of those poems

                     				indexing technology by which many of us daily access the world wide web.

                     				envisioned by one writer. The alternative sense of authorship that I explore is
                     				found in a <em class="emph">Whitman </em>who strides among the various editions

                     				pause to frame the case for how Whitman the author was initially presented to
                     				readers on each side of the Atlantic. I merely sample that reception and so
                     				refer Whitman enthusiasts to the exhaustive catalogue of reviews prepared by
                     				Barney et al. (<a href="#barney2007">2007</a>). In doing so, I argue that neither the acerbic dismissals
                     				nor sympathetic receptions were singularly instrumental in shaping the Whitman
                     				whose name came to index a person and poetic more than singular literary works.

                     				Rossetti reading the 1855 <cite class="title italic">Leaves, </cite>recommended to him by
                     				William Bell Scott, the Pre-Raphaelite painter and poet who introduced the
                     				brother of Christina and Dante to the 1855 first edition.
                     				Then, as he argued in a republished letter to Scott prefacing his
                     				introduction to <cite class="title italic">Poems</cite>, Rossetti “perceived its
                     				substantiality and power were still ahead of any eulogium with which it might

                     				Whitman’s poetry in the (London) <cite class="title italic">Chronicle </cite>in 1867. One outcome of that review was an invitation by John
                     				Camden Hotten to edit a selected poems “offering the first tolerably fair chance

                     				fecund, coarse language of the opening poem in which Whitman names himself as
                     				“Walt Whitman, an American, one of the roughs, a kosmos” prompted the reviewer
                     				to declare, “Politeness this man has none, and regulation he has none” [<a class="ref" href="#anonymous2002">Anonymous 1855</a>, 793].

                     				edition written in an equally unorthodox, but ecstatic manner. The reviewer
                     				derided both the style and the man in judging the literary effects as those of

                  <div class="ptext" id="p24">Rossetti’s solution, I argue, was to present the new man of a new democratic
                     				nation, whose love-longings for comrades could be spiritualized as canonically
                     				as did Dante in <cite class="title italic">La Vita Nuova</cite>, Edmund Spenser in <cite class="title italic">Amoretti</cite>, and Elizabeth Barrett Browning in <cite class="title italic">Songs of the Portuguese. </cite> Framing Whitman as a
                     				transcendental wooer of soldiers, stevedores, farmers, and tradesmen was also
                     				resonant with the Pre-Raphaelite standard of naturalism. Those <cite class="title italic">roughs</cite> were for Whitman in his broken prose manifesto “the genius of
                     				the United States [in] Their manners speech dress friendship — the freshness and
                     				candor of the physiognomy — the picturesque looseness of their carriage” [<a class="ref" href="#whitman1868">whitman 1868</a>, iv]
                     				. Perhaps in Whitman’s egalitarian trope of “the President’s
                     				taking off his hat to them not they to him” (<a href="#whitman1868">iv</a>) Rossetti early on found another
                     				Pre-Raphaelite brother. The depiction of Whitman as the outsider artist
                     				“unfettered by existing conventions” [<a class="ref" href="#prettejohn2012">Prettejohn 2012</a>, 5] complemented the
                     				self-creation of an author who learned carpentry from his father and was trained
                     				in a trade at the printing press. More certainly, by 1868, Rossetti surveyed
                     				Whitman’s attempt to define the new man in a new nation by eschewing rhyme and
                     				even blank verse to the point that some poems may be regarded as a warp of
                     				prose amid the weft of poetry (<a href="#prettejohn2012">3</a>). </div>

                  <div class="ptext" id="p25">More urgently, however, Rossetti celebrated Whitman’s open, extending and inviting
                     				humanity. The poet’s subject, he noted in his introduction to <cite class="title italic">Poems, </cite>is “every subject” [<a class="ref" href="#whitman1868">whitman 1868</a>, 5]. He summarized Whitman’s
                     				verve as realizing “One’s self” amid the “En Masse” of humanity. For Rossetti,
                     					<cite class="title italic">Leaves</cite> “is the poem both of Personality and of
                     				Democracy … in it the most literal view of things is continually merging into
                     				the most rhapsodic or passionately abstract” (<a href="#whitman1868">5</a>). Whitman’s British advocate and
                     				Pre-Raphaelite chronicler, thus, illustrates the entanglement of relations that
                     				Womack and Decker observed in reading and positively responding to the
                     				subversive presence of a new art form. </div>

                     				off <cite class="title italic">Poems. </cite>That emendation was entirely Rossetti’s, who
                     				employed it to spiritualize Whitman’s emphasis on the body as another sacred
                     				site of creation. Rossetti excerpted the reflections of the 17th century
                     				Christian mystic on the bodily presence of angels to suggest that both Whitman
                     				and his panoply of American citizens may be regarded as emanations of heaven,
                     				despite the “gross ignorance” Swedenborg observed “respecting Angels and Spirits
                     					as to suppose them to be minds without a form, or mere thoughts” [<a class="ref" href="#whitman1868">whitman 1868</a>, vii]. Through Swedenborg, Rossetti at once elevates the peripheral citizenry of
                     				the United States, exhorts readers for failing to entertain angels well, and
                     				sanctifies Whitman’s work as that proceeding from an other-worldly messenger
                     				finding his subject matter in the very stuff of the world. That gesture could
                     be
                     				understood as an enabling subversion because it honors Whitman’s project of
                     				recognizing the inherent value of the entire citizenry, even those who are
                     				rarely seen and still more rarely lauded. Yet, that spiritualization of people
                     				in their material conditions simultaneously reifies understanding some as
                     				radically Other than the captains of commerce, statesmen and exceptional
                     				artists. In even acknowledging that polarism of spiritual and material
                     				conditions to which Swedenborg objected and by which readers were likely to
                     				dismiss Whitman, Rossetti may be understood to accede to the values and thinking
                     				of a dominant culture well practiced in bigotry. In Rossetti’s gesture of
                     				elevating <em class="emph">manly love</em> as a trope for egalitarianism, his
                     				subversion may be understood to be co-opted and absorbed within the dominant
                     				culture’s practices of finding and treating some more worthily than others. That
                     				is to observe that if the roughs, criminals and men attracted to other men
                     				should be entertained as possible angels, as Rossetti suggests in the epigraph
                     				he appended to his selected Whitman, then the editor has only further muddied
                     				their better reception as members of a common humanity. Likewise, if Whitman’s
                     				celebration of manly love is spiritualized to emphasize a new and better
                     				humanity emerging, then that better world remains shackled in caste and
                     				entitlement by even acknowledging a material-spiritual split. </div>

                     a

                     				appropriate choice. The more radical interpretation is that this inductive model

                     				summon sense, for documents rather than terms are ranked by their singular

                     				springs from my own reading of “Calamus” as a poetic sequence granting that
                     				those who love will experience both a sense of wondrous revelation and
                     				resignation over lovers’ human limitations. I granted, too, at the outset that
                     				one poem may have elements of each sensibility motivating it. A <em class="emph">laud</em> I took to be celebratory of a lover’s progress
                     				through the difficult terrain of desire that can only be sensed at the periphery
                     				of those standards Whitman in “Paths” declared depart from “the pleasures,
                     				profits, conformities” (<a href="#whitman1868">4</a>) of social sanction. I considered a <em class="emph">caution </em>to be either a warning to those who would dare to love or an
                     				illustration of a hazard in love. However, Whitman troping his poems as
                     				“herbage” may make each a laud in celebration of an authentic life, even while
                     				those same poems, or “body-leaves growing up above me above death” (“Scented”
                     				3), resound in caution. </div>

                     				the <em class="term">cosine </em>approximation of relatedness. Most generally,
                     				a cosine may be interpreted as a correlation, which in the present study range
                     				continuously in strength from 0 to 1. Those correlations are more precisely
                     				stated as the “semantic distance between two vectors … given by the cosine of
                     					the angle between them” [<a class="ref" href="#kintsch2014">Kintsch 2014</a>, 559]. Accordingly, I report a degree of

                     				be understood as a correlation, we can expect different statements of concept

                     				included or excluded in Poems to be weak for a cosine of .10, while moderate is

                     				either by the laud or caution distinction earlier described. I further
                     				partitioned the text set by “Calamus” content included or excluded from <cite class="title italic">Poems. </cite>I selected “Elemental Drifts” for two reasons to
                     				explore the resonance of “Calamus” content with an introductory poem Rossetti
                     				believed he could publish without having to go to court (Q3). First, it appears
                     				in Rossetti’s <cite class="title inline">Walt Whitman</cite> cluster, where most of the “Calamus” he excerpted
                     				is contained. Second, “Elemental Drifts” is widely anthologized and so serves it
                     				as its own Whitman introduction to new readers. Finally, to examine the semantic
                     				resonance of “Calamus” content with another of Whitman’s origin poems (Q4), I
                     				selected “Starting from Paumanok” (SP). Grossman identifies what would become
                     				“SP” as “Proto-Leaf,” which introduces the 1860 <cite class="title italic">Leaves</cite>
                     				[<a class="ref" href="#grossman1990">Grossman 1990</a>]. Likewise, Rossetti allowed this “evangel-poem” to introduce

                  <div class="counter"><a href="#p62">62</a></div>
                  <div class="ptext" id="p62">Precisely because of the novelty of trope expected in a poetic sequence, few poems
                     					designated either as a laud or a caution resonate strongly in that distinction.
                     						Rather, some poems celebrate manly love while others caution its practice. That
                     						is clear in the poem to poem
                     					comparisons measured by the averaged correlations of cosine that comprise each
                     
                     					poem. More toward illustrating a method in testing the caution-laud distinction
                     in
                     						“Calamus” 
                     					than toward arguing for its utility, I discuss the relationship of the cautionary
                     						“Whoever” to 
                     					poems I take to be lauds for those who love others unconventionally or in service
                     						of a new 
                     					republic. My primary point is this: Reader’s conclusions can be put to the test
                     						within that 
                     					distributive semantics fundamental to either a count or predict approach. Any
                     						argument can then be assessed and reconsidered by the evidence of document to
                     						document and word to word 
                     					phenomena. 
                     					In the cautionary “Whoever,” the speaker warns away a suitor. That intimate must 
                     					complete an apprenticeship to be in relation with the speaker. Better that the
                     						suitor “Put [him] 
                     					down and depart on [his] way” (<a href="#whitman1868">12</a>) than “give up all else” (<a href="#whitman1868">8</a>). In the laudatory
                     						“Record” that 
                     					warning is not issued to a suitor, but to any who would love as does the speaker
                     						and understands the dread of an indifferent response from another. In “Stranger”
                     						the speaker returns to the direct address, but in possibly warning the stranger
                     						away from the fervor he or she may expect. While 
                     					the speaker in “Whoever” grants the suitor may perhaps be worthy of his attention, 
                     					the counterpart in “Sing” declares he is the only one worthy to praise the love of
                     						comrades. 
                     					By contrast, a troop gathers around him in “Sing.” To that possibly worthy suitor
                     						in “Whoever,” the speaker names himself “the new husband” and “comrade” (<a href="#whitman1868">26</a>).
                     						That identity is most explicit in “Sing” at another pond-side, where “him that
                     						tenderly loves me, and returns again never to 
                     					separate from me” (<a href="#whitman1868">19</a>) receives a“Calamus,”root as token from the speaker. In
                     						“ASong” that 
                     					husband fathers “the most splendid race the sun ever shone upon/ … With the
                     						life-long love of 
                     					comrades” (<a href="#whitman1868">2-3</a>). Those who remember Whitman as the husband of the few who dare to
                     						love as 
                     					completely as he does and father to the many in “Record” should name him “the
                     						tenderest lover” (<a href="#whitman1868">3</a>). Although unacknowledged in “Stranger,” the speaker might
                     						have “surely lived a life of joy” (<a href="#whitman1868">3</a>) with another. Whitman again fancies
                     						himself as the husband who received “parting [as] the 
                     					parting of dear friends” (<a href="#whitman1868">5</a>) in “Pen,” where he sees the embrace of two men on a
                     						pier. In “Full,” which concludes the “Calamus” sequence, the speaker is husband
                     						“to you yet unborn” (<a href="#whitman1868">4</a>). He 
                     					can only fulfill that office by his poems. Yet, the “Calamus” speaker also grants
                     						a legacy of 
                     					being misunderstood, as he does in <cite class="title quote">Whoever.</cite> In “Pen” that speaker cautions that
                     						his subject 
                     					matter is neither the majestic battleship nor “splendors of the past day” (<a href="#whitman1868">3</a>), but
                     						only that scene of two men parting as dear friends. His future readers, he
                     						grants in “Sing,” will find only what they need in his poems, while fewer still
                     						would receive “Calamus,” as their due. That husband-longing 
                     					professed in “Record” reframes the speaker as one “Who was not proud of his songs,
                     						but of the measureless ocean of love within him” (<a href="#whitman1868">5</a>).
                     					The caution-laud distinction, then, does not define a sub-genre for Whitman as
                     						much as provide poles by which a non-scripted love will be experienced by the
                     						wooer, the beloved and 
                     					the society framing both. The non-scriptedness of expressing that love either
                     for
                     						another man or 
                     					in service of a more radically inclusive republic is a topic larger than either
                     a
                     						cautionary or 
                     					laudatory rhetoric. Whitman’s sometimes cautious, sometimes joyful negotiation
                     of
                     						manly love 
                     					returns us to the experience of reading a poetic sequence. The difficult, even
                     						damning terrain of 
                     					loving both out of bounds and out of measure is recognized even within the same
                     						poem 
                     					celebrating that adventure. Accordingly, while the way to that greater love in
                     						“Whoever” is 
                     					“suspicious” and “uncertain,” it rewards by revealing the new husband of a new
                     						republic. 
                     					The “Calamus” content Rossetti selected for <cite class="title italic">Poems </cite>qualifies
                     						the laud or caution theme 
                     					defining each of the selections, for as was shown above, the decidedly cautionary
                     						“Whoever” 
                     					strongly resonates with the exemplary laud found in “Sing.” In Table 3 reported
                     						below, I further 
                     					test that laud-caution distinction in examining the lauds included and excluded
                     						from <cite class="title italic">Poems, </cite>thus 
                     					beginning to explore inter-edition resonance between <cite class="title italic">Poems
                        					</cite>and <cite class="title italic">Leaves. </cite>I next do so with 
                     					poems I take to be cautionary (Table 4). Those annotations I offer in response
                     to
                     						Q2. I continue 
                     					that rippling-outward investigation to examine resonance in two other thematic
                     						groups identified by Rossetti toward answering Q3 and Q4. The first cluster,
                     						“Walt Whitman,” holds most of the 
                     					“Calamus” content excerpted for <cite class="title italic">Poems.</cite> The second cluster I
                     						examine is Rossetti’s “Chants 
                     					Democratic,” which introduces his Whitman edition. I examine the first poem of
                     						that cluster, “Starting from Paumanok” (“SP”), in particular. </div>

                  <div class="ptext" id="p63">“Sing” and “Scented” (.75) most dramatically resonated in the laudatory “Calamus”
                     				content Rossetti included and excluded. Both poems are united in praise for
                     				lovers and in the speaker’s unique ability to issue that praise. More strongly
                     				at the level of trope, these poems advance through catalogues of the natural
                     				world tokens the speaker imparts to those whom he finds have joined him in
                     				approaching a liminal space defined as much by nature as desire. The leaves and
                     				roots of “Scented” are more directly troped as the pages of a book springing
                     				from the speaker that will yet be better regarded in the days to come. In “Sing”
                     				those leaves take many forms: lilac, pine branches, moss from a live-oak,
                     				laurel, maple, chestnut, wild orange and the “Calamus,” root, which is “the token
                     				of comrades” (<a href="#whitman1868">19</a>). These other tokens of the natural world the speaker dispenses
                     				as each follower needs and as he desires. He only reserves the “Calamus,” root “to
                     				them that love as I myself am capable of loving” (<a href="#whitman1868">28</a>).</div>
                  			
                  <div class="counter"><a href="#p64">64</a></div>
                  <div class="ptext" id="p64">The strongest thematic resonance between the poems is the poet commissioned to
                     				represent that love of comrades that will make possible a truly inclusive and
                     				fostering democracy. In “Scented” that commission is expected to enable
                     				“immortal reverberations through the States” (<a href="#whitman1868">25</a>) and will one day be seen when
                     				comrades can “dissipate this entire show of appearance” (<a href="#whitman1868">36</a>). That coming
                     				enlightenment is more immediately sensed in “Sing” as the troop that gathers
                     				around the speaker in his wildwood walkabouts. This troop comes to take on the
                     				presence of a cloud of witnesses (<cite class="title italic">Hebrews </cite>12:1) because
                     				it is comprised by “dear friends dead or alive” (<a href="#whitman1868">13</a>). These friends surround the
                     				speaker, at once commissioning him and in need of the tokens he dispenses.
                     			The poems are also joined in their strong resonance with other poems in the
                     				“Calamus”
                     			sequence. Of the 16 that may be understood to be laudatory, two are strongly
                     				resonant 
                     			(“RootsLeaves” and “Louisiana”) in comparison to “Sing,” while three others.
                     			demonstrate moderate resonance between aggregate cosine relations between .25 and
                     				.49. 
                     			“Scented” resonates strongly with one of the laudatory poems Rossetti included in
                     					<cite class="title italic">Poems, </cite>while moderately so with three others. The
                     				near-zero correspondences of “Calamus” content occur most generally in the
                     				briefest poems (e.g., “Full” and “Prairie”). </div>
                  			
                  <div class="counter"><a href="#p65">65</a></div>
                  <div class="ptext" id="p65">I considered the moderate resonance of “Full” with “Paths” (.38). This final poem
                     				of “Calamus” proposes that the Whitman who was once 40 years old in 1859, then
                     				visible in public and as a poet of these States, would be “invisible” when the
                     				imagined reader finds his poems a century or more later. That second life for
                     				Whitman is in the reader’s imagination, “Fancying how happy you were if I could
                     				be with you” (<a href="#whitman1868">8</a>). The complement for the first poem of the sequence comes also
                     				in 1859, as the speaker is “Bequeathing hence types of athletic love” (<a href="#whitman1868">14</a>). In
                     				establishing the project of the “Calamus” sequence and in anticipation of the
                     				imagined reader finding it one day, the speaker “Proceed[s] for all who are or
                     				have been young men,/To tell the secret of my nights and days,/To celebrate the
                     				need of comrades” (<a href="#whitman1868">16-18</a>). That moderate resonance between its place as a laud
                     				for a comradely literature that Rossetti included in <cite class="title italic">Poems,
                        				</cite> “Full” bears no greater relation to the excluded, far more overtly amorous
                     				content of “Calamus.” </div>

                     				moderate resonance. “Whoever” provides exempla of that point in its various ways
                     				of figuring caution. Its speaker cautions that he is not what a suitor supposes,
                     				for the way to meet him is at best uncertain and even destructive. That suitor
                     				would have to become a novitiate in order for the speaker to become your sole
                     				and exclusive standard (<a href="#whitman1868">8</a>), that requiring the suitor to abandon “The whole
                     				past theory of [his] life and all conformity to the lives around [him]” (<a href="#whitman1868">10</a>).
                     				Because the courtship would require so much, the speaker warns away the suitor,
                     				unless he is willing to seek him “by stealth in some wood for trial” (<a href="#whitman1868">11</a>). Only
                     				in the marginal spaces of “Paths” will the suitor find the speaker as “the new
                     				husband” or “comrade” (<a href="#whitman1868">21</a>). The peril of approaching the Beloved is equal to
                     				that of reading his poems. Those poems, moreover, are evasive, “for it is not
                     				for what I put into it that I have written this book” (<a href="#whitman1868">32</a>). </div>

                  <div class="ptext" id="p67">Of all the poems that may be considered cautionary in the sequence, “NewPerson” is
                     				the most resonant with “Whoever” (.28). That relation is weakly moderate, but is
                     				best underscored by warning a suitor against his suppositions. To press that
                     				point, the speaker of “NewPerson” asks the suitor if he believes friendship to
                     				be an “unalloy’d satisfaction” (<a href="#whitman1868">5</a>). That metallurgical framing of friendship
                     				suggests an unlikely but marvelous union of materials. In “New Person” those are
                     				suggested by regard for trust, fidelity and heroism, all of which the speaker
                     				offers as instances of “maya,” or illusion. That difficult union in “Trickle” is
                     				troped by the wounds the speaker receives “made to free you whence you were
                     				prison’d” (<a href="#whitman1868">4</a>). Those wounds also attend the confessional, sacrificial sense of
                     				authorship summoned in “Whoever,” for they “Stain every page, stain every song I
                     				sing, every word I say” (<a href="#whitman1868">8</a>). Yet, because the caution voiced in each poem is so
                     				differently troped, there is only a weak correlative resonance (.18). </div>

                  <div class="ptext" id="p68">That capacity of the trope to level thematic resonance is clearly demonstrated in
                     				the near zero correlations of <cite class="title inline">Multi</cite> with the cautionary “Calamus” content
                     				Rossetti excluded from <cite class="title italic">Poems. </cite>“Multi” congratulates the
                     				suitor for identifying the speaker by secret and divine signs (<a href="#whitman1868">2</a>), even as the
                     				poem cautions that recognition of a comrade can only proceed by such “faint
                     				indirections” (<a href="#whitman1868">6</a>). The obstacle in recognition catalogued by “NewPerson” is
                     				expecting a more socially scripted, idealistic relationship. Common to both
                     				poems is the speaker acknowledging the interest of another at the cost of
                     				prioritizing the Beloved above all others. Yet, because the poems so differently
                     				address courtship and even recognition by another, they bear almost no
                     				measurable relation (.03).</div>

                  <div class="ptext" id="p70">As I followed the resonance of “Calamus” into “Ebb’d,” in Rossetti’s “Walt
                     				Whitman” cluster, I selected passages from the first two sections of “Ebb’d” I
                     				thought might have counterparts in the “Calamus” content. I also shifted my
                     				analysis from looking at the thematic resonance of entire poems to passages I
                     				sensed following a rhetoric of disclosure modeled by portions of “Ebb’d” and
                     				“SP.” In common for Tables 5-8, I first briefly outline the structure of those
                     				non-“Calamus” poems Rossetti selected. I then examine their counterparts to the
                     				“Calamus” excluded in <cite class="title italic">Poems </cite>and so note that thematic
                     				continuity if I could identify it. I italicize those
                     				structural counterparts when suggested by the very language Whitman employed.
                     In
                     				Table 5, I could find “Ebb’d” counterparts in four “Calamus” poems excluded from
                     					<cite class="title italic">Poems, </cite>but did not find the “Ebb’d” structure of
                     				part 2 as uniformly resonant with “Calamus” content examined in Table 6. In
                     				measuring the similarity I detected, I gathered passages in the “Calamus”
                     				content I found resonant with the non-“Calamus” content. That resulted in the
                     				final row of Tables 5-8, in which I report the aggregated cosine of that
                     				multi-passage similarity for each “Calamus” poem in relation to either “Ebb’d”
                     				or “SP” passages. All passage to passage comparisons were either moderate or
                     				strong in magnitude. Those far more consistently stable statements of thematic
                     				resonance resulted from the tighter focus each demanded. While the poem to poem
                     				comparisons reported in Tables 2-4 are useful in globally examining the
                     				laud-caution tendency I find in “Calamus,” the passage-driven analysis of Tables
                     				5-8 forced me to identify precisely how I found excluded “Calamus” content to be
                     				in dialogue with material in <cite class="title italic">Poems.</cite>

                  <div class="ptext" id="p71">The “castaways” in “Edd’d” trope all who wander, have wandered and will wander the
                     				beach. While Paumanok is a birth site for Whitman who hears a “fierce old
                     				mother” in the surf and embraces a father in the sand, Paumanok is more urgently
                     				an elemental site of creation. The castaways of “Edd’d” then may also be found
                     				in the young and old men whom Whitman addresses in “Paths” as much as in the
                     				“many passing by” (<a href="#whitman1868">6</a>) the poems Whitman tropes as scented herbage, the scents of
                     				foliage brought to those wandering the wild-wood, or the Manhattanese come with
                     				a robust kiss for the “Swarthy” speaker. The “sibilant” surf of “Ebb’d” summons
                     				the standards published and unpublished of “Paths.” In “Scented” the speaker
                     				offers sibilant utterances in those immortal reverberations through the States
                     				(<a href="#whitman1868">25</a>). That revealing spirit requires sympathetic magic, if not also sacrifice,
                     				in “RootsLeaves” as its speaker promises the reader that love-buds will open “If
                     				you bring the warmth of the sun to them” (<a href="#whitman1868">9</a>). In “Behold” the Whitman speaker
                     				performs the sibilant function by drawing to him only those worthy in their
                     				nonchalance. The spirit seizing the speaker of “Ebb’d” may also be understood,
                     				alternately, as the soul rejoicing in comrades in “Paths,” while the spirit most
                     				manifestly reveals itself in the poems of “Scented” speaker. Spirit seizure
                     				prompts a robust kiss in “Behold,” while in “RootsLeaves” it is sensed in the
                     				walkabouts of wild places. At Paumanok Whitman finds “likenesses” of himself
                     				strewn on the beach. In “Paths” those likenesses are resonant with standards
                     				exhibiting themselves as much in the drawing room as in “the margins of
                     				pond-waters.” The “Scented” speaker finds likeness itself blurring the
                     				boundaries between life and death, while Whitman’s catalogue of woodland wonders
                     				in “RootsLeaves” are likened to poems exhorting love for the reader “whoever you
                     				are” (<a href="#whitman1868">7</a>). Nonchalance is likened to the urge to bestow and return a kiss between
                     				comrades in “Behold.”</div>

                  <div class="ptext" id="p72">The speaker of “Ebb’d” is less a spokesperson for Everyman than Just Another
                     				Person as seemingly strewn and randomly assembled in the detritus washed ashore.
                     				That speaker makes no qualification for his ignorance at the start of the second
                     				section. His not-knowing is that of other men and women deposited on shore by
                     				the surf mother of whom they did not ask to be born. His oppression is daring
                     to
                     				speak sense to his condition; more so to ours: “before all my arrogant poems the
                     				real Me stands yet untouch’d, untold, altogether unreach’d” (<a href="#whitman1868">28</a>). That abashed
                     				humility finds counterpart in the “Scented” speaker who writes “to be perused
                     				best afterwards” as much by his readers as himself. The “RootsLeaves” speaker
                     				claims time and practice precede knowledge, for the intuited revelation of a
                     				poem is only seed material for that greater to come. The “dirge” the “Scented”
                     				speaker enjoins comes in recognition of our common end as both bitter and
                     				beautiful. In <cite class="title inline">RootsLeaves</cite> that dirge is the dissatisfaction with the
                     				conventional world that prompts men and women to wander in wild spaces. In
                     				“Louisiana” the speaker again senses himself in another natural world wonder: a
                     				solitary live-oak “rude, unbending, lusty” (<a href="#whitman1868">4</a>). He, then, disavows the trope
                     				because he could not prosper as solitarily since he thinks of “little else” (<a href="#whitman1868">9</a>)
                     				than of friends. That unknown, authentic self of “Ebb’d” seeks the unpublished
                     				standards in “Paths.” Death hiding “in these shifting forms of life” in
                     				“Scented” does so for its own reasons beyond what the speaker can sense in other
                     				than the material world obscuring “the real reality” (<a href="#whitman1868">33</a>). </div>

                  <div class="ptext" id="p73">The thematic resonance above identified brings evidence for the possibility that
                     				the excluded “Calamus” content is more largely at play in <cite class="title italic">Poems </cite>than has been previously acknowledged. However, that resonance
                     				indexed by the aggregate cosine relations of one poem to another simultaneously
                     				illustrates that the thematic resonance suggested by words’ distributional sense
                     				may and may not find complement between poems. The self-confessed ignorance in
                     				“Ebb’d” only speaks in part to the confidence of a speaker dismissing some
                     				standards but affirming others in “Paths” or proposing a trope for himself in
                     				“Louisiana” and then resolving the poem by dismissing it.</div>

                     				“Paths” the speaker is concerned for the standard of a fostering companionship

                     				(<a href="#whitman1868">4</a>) in “Paths” have long enough stifled and choked (<a href="#whitman1868">51</a>) the “Scented” speaker.
                     				The common motivation of seeking companionship enfolds men and women in

                     				winter breaks up” (<a href="#whitman1868">6</a>). The “Calamus” poems become “Love-buds put before you and
                     				within you whoever you are” (<a href="#whitman1868">7</a>). That community united by the need for
                     				companionship fosters love in “Behold,” whose speaker returns the kiss of a
                     				Manhattanese and allows it to become “natural and nonchalant” (<a href="#whitman1868">7</a>). Companionship
                     				is so central of a standard in “Louisiana” that its speaker confesses that he

                     				in these poems, Whitman implies he is such a speaker. The subjects of these
                     				poems — young and old men, the men and women who go a-Maying, American comrades
                     				— number among Ma Femme’s “brood beyond us and of us” <span class="error"><a class="ref" href="#sp13">#sp13</a></span>. Death is the
                     				personified counterpart to Ma Femme in “Scented,” or the “real reality” awaiting
                     				all behind the masks we employ to be perceived (<a href="#whitman1868">33</a>). However, Death is addressed
                     				rather than addresses in “Scented.” Whitman’s various poem-level speakers serve
                     				as proxies to Ma Femme in this group of poems. The commonality of her brood
                     				Whitman finds in our moral condition (“Paths”), condition of lovers’ mixed
                     				desires to increase and be relieved from passion (“Scented”), and in what should
                     				one day be a commonplace exchange of intimacy in the giving and return of a
                     				kiss. The “what goes forward” of these poems is that “athletic love” (<a href="#whitman1868">14</a>), the
                     				tendency of all poems to be understood best in retrospect (“Scented”), the
                     				generative imperative seen in plant life and sensed in love, and the nonchalance
                     				of all enabled to express that love (“Behold”).</div>

                     				associative reading method punctuated by similarity scoring. First, any pattern
                     				is an inference that may or may not fit the sound and sense of a poem. Second,
                     				that intuitive sense of fit I came to only by the strength of semantic resonance
                     				underscored by similarity scoring. In both Whitman editions considered for the
                     				present study, “Calamus” content follows “SP.” Yet, in asking after the
                     				foundational place for the “Calamus” content in Whitman’s work, I had to scroll
                     				up on a monitor and turn back pages from the “Calamus” poems to examine their
                     				resonance in “SP.” The structural patterns of Whitman’s evangel-poem preceding
                     				even “Song of Myself” simply offer possible expressions of similar content, even
                     				while suggesting the merit of a poetic sequence. The four poems excluded from
