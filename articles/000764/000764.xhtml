                  <p>Unjust Readings: Against the New New Criticism" offers a theoretical and methodological
                     defence of the use of digital humanities methods for literary interpretation. 
                     I argue that extant critiques of DH from Fish, Da, Eyers and others depend on an unexamined
                     notion of the appropriate work of the humanities and, in particular, 
                     of literary interpretation. Their claim, that critics should simply "just read" obscures
                     the manner in which literary interpretation is never simply 'just reading.' 
                     I argue that DH not only raises interpretive possibilities that would be impossible
                     without digital tools but also foregrounds the methodological choices and theoretical
                     
                     paradigms that so often are unstated, or implicit, in traditional humanities work.
                     Inherent to the interpretive act that moves between the digital and the humanities
                     is 
                     a need to state how the critic works between the two, thereby making the interpretive
                     frame explicit. I then demonstrate a number of examples, from my research and the
                     work of others, 
                     that demonstrate this productive capacity of DH in order to further refute that critics
                     should simply 'just read' the texts.</p>

                  <div class="ptext" id="p1">Nan Z. Da’s (2019) “The Computational Case Against Computational Literary Study” is a
                     major critique of Computational Literary Studies that attempts to challenge it at
                     both the methodological and theoretical levels. Her essay “works at the empirical
                     level” to identify “technical problems, logical fallacies, and conceptual flaws” as
                     well as methodological inconsistencies and questionable results of a number of CLS
                     projects. She asserts that for these projects, “what is robust is obvious … and what
                     is not obvious is not robust” [<a class="ref" href="#da2019">Da 2019</a>].</div>

                  <div class="ptext" id="p2">Da’s argument is, by now, well known and has been thoroughly examined, challenged,
                     and defended in a number of venues; the goal here is not to rehash the debates of
                     the past few years. Rather, in what follows, I examine the interpretive implications
                     of Da’s argument, shifting the grounds from the so-called “empirical level” to
                     examine the humanistic foundation of her critique and the implications of sliding
                     from her challenge to CLS

                     to the broader critique of the digital humanities made by many of her subsequent supporters.
                     I argue that Da’s
                     critique of CLS, and the subsequent debates concerning her work, open up paradigms
                     of reading and, in doing so, have a tell us a great deal about the general state of
                     the humanities, and the attendant discourse of humanism that undergirds a number of
                     critiques of digital humanities.</div>
                  
                  
                  <div class="counter"><a href="#p3">3</a></div>
                  <div class="ptext" id="p3">Of the numerous responses to Da’s work, Stanley Fish’s (2019) “Afterword” is perhaps
                     the most controversial and least surprising. After first acknowledging his lack of
                     “real credentials in the field,” Fish then asserts that this lack of expertise has
                     absolutely no bearing on his “pronouncing on the Digital Humanities because my [his]
                     objections to it are lodged on a theoretical level in relation to which actual
                     statistical work in the field is beside the point.” He jokes that while his daughter
                     is a statistician, he understood hardly twenty percent of her recent lecture on
                     “some issue in bio-medical statistics”; he comprehends so little of the topic, he
                     cannot identify it. Yet where this mere twenty percent of understanding (presumably
                     this measurement is a statistical Dad joke on his part) impedes his grasp on his
                     daughter’s lecture, this is not the case with digital humanities. Fish needn’t
                     follow the methods or mathematical reasoning by which digital humanities scholars
                     make their arguments because he doesn’t “care what form these analyses take. I know
                     in advance that they will fail.” As he sees it, his ignorance has no effect on his
                     ability to assess this field.</div>
                  
                  
                  <div class="counter"><a href="#p4">4</a></div>
                  <div class="ptext" id="p4">Fish’s “Afterword”is his latest in a series of arguments against Computational
                     Literary Studies and Digital Humanities. His central critique, throughout these
                     complaints, is that digital projects “crank up a huge amount of machinery in order
                     to produce something that was obvious from the get go”
                     
                     <a class="noteRef" href="#d4e259">[2]</a> 
                     
                     and that “they just dress up garden variety literary intuition in numbers”[<a class="ref" href="#fish2019">Fish 2019</a>].
                     He goes on to insist that “the interpretive conclusions they draw from the
                     assembled data are entirely arbitrary, without motivation except the motivation to
                     have their labors yield something, yield anything. Either their herculean efforts
                     do
                     nothing or when something is done with them, it is entirely illegitimate” [<a class="ref" href="#fish2019">Fish 2019</a>].
                     This critique echoes Fish’s past arguments where he describes DH as an
                     “antimethdology that refuses closure” [<a class="ref" href="#fish2012">Fish 2012</a>] while also arguing that digital
                     forms of interpretation are meaningless “because the data, just sitting there in all
                     its empty bulk, can be made to support anything” [<a class="ref" href="#fish2018">Fish 2018</a>]. He elsewhere insists
                     that “The desire to generate insight into human expression by ‘scientific’ means is
                     futile,” [<a class="ref" href="#fish2019b">Fish 2019b</a>] thereby leading to an irreconcilable difference between “real
                     interpretation” and “corpus linguistic analysis” [<a class="ref" href="#fish2018">Fish 2018</a>].</div>
                  
                  
                  <div class="counter"><a href="#p5">5</a></div>
                  <div class="ptext" id="p5">Da works “at the empirical level” to challenge the novelty and conclusions of CLS
                     whereas Fish’s critique works at “the theoretical level” to challenge the paradigms
                     of reading and interpretation upon which (he believes) DH depends. In this vague and
                     ill-conceived division, both critics draw on a false dichotomy. As Katherine Bode’s
                     recent “What’s the Matter with Computational Literary Studies? ”argues, there is a
                     “fundamental agreement between critics and proponents of CLS: that computation is
                     separate from literary phenomena” [<a class="ref" href="#bode2023">Bode 2023</a>]. Bode calls for a ‘performative CLS’
                     that is “Attuned to the coconstitution of computational methods and objects – with
                     each other, and with literary subjectivities and textualities” [<a class="ref" href="#bode2023">Bode 2023</a>]. I extend Bode’s
                     argument to demonstrate that Da and Fish’s illusory splitting of the interpretive
                     act inadvertently bolsters the claims of the digital humanities by offering a fresh
                     critique of the humanities more generally.</div>
                  
                  
                  <div class="counter"><a href="#p6">6</a></div>
                  <div class="ptext" id="p6">Yet, to return to Fish’s argument, what fields and methods is he assessing? While
                     Fish uses DH and CLS interchangeably, Da is explicitly discussing Computational
                     Literary Studies: “Digital humanities … is not the object of my [her] critique” [<a class="ref" href="#da2019">Da 2019</a>].
                     Does Fish’s slip from CLS to DH throughout his numerous critiques indicate
                     that his lack of understanding extends beyond ‘the empirical’? While the
                     distinctions between the two are unclear and also shifting (as Katherine Bode points
                     out in her response to Da’s article), the terms cannot be used interchangeably as
                     Fish does. <a class="noteRef" href="#d4e382">[3]</a> Is this just a
                     careless mistake or does Fish’s slip — or is it a move — from CLS to DH indicate his
                     desire to broaden Da’s case against a narrow subset of CLS to a critique against the
                     larger project of DH? Given the pattern of repetition in Fish’s work, one might ask
                     whether this most recent iteration is an original argument aimed specifically at DH
                     or merely a recycling of his past critiques of stylistics refashioned to suit his
                     new target? Indeed, to what degree does the existence of a throughline in his
                     arguments indicate that Fish is actively transposing his criticism of stylistics
                     onto the digital humanities in order to draw a false equivalency between the two?

                  <div class="ptext" id="p7">As I hope to show, these are not idle questions. Critics of DH cloak traditional
                     articulations of humanities scholarship within <em class="emph">methodological</em>
                     criticisms of DH. Their attack on computational modes of analysis depends upon
                     the defense of a reified vision of “the humanities, as it has been traditionally
                     understood” [<a class="ref" href="#fish2012">Fish 2012</a>]. This traditional vision of the humanities, what Jamie
                     “Skye” Bianco [<a class="ref" href="#bianco2012">Bianco 2021</a>] terms “retro-humanism,” is anti-theoretical and ahistorical in
                     that it imagines that conceptions of humanities work and scholarship are settled
                     rather than the terrain of ongoing struggle. In contrast to Said’s assertion that
                     “Criticism … is always situated; it is skeptical, secular, reflectively open to its
                     own failings” [<a class="ref" href="#said1975">Said 1975</a>], 
                     
                     <a class="noteRef" href="#d4e439">[4]</a>,
                     
                     these critics offer unexamined assertions of the “optimal utility” [<a class="ref" href="#da2019">Da 2019</a>] <a class="noteRef" href="#d4e472">[5]</a> of
                     humanities work or plea for a return to some prelapsarian “humanist sensitivity”
                     <a href="#eyers2013"></a>. Their expressions of retro-humanism circumvent the combined
                     methodological-theoretical questions that are, in fact, one of DH’s most significant
                     contributions to humanities scholarship. This retro-humanism, indicates that the
                     attacks on DH constitute an idealized, unsituated criticism that articulate a narrow
                     conception of the proper questions, methods and objects of analysis for the
                     humanities. 
                     
                     <a class="noteRef" href="#d4e524">[6]</a>
                     
                     Yet, in doing so, they inadvertently raise the more important questions of what it
                     is we do when we read, what we mean by the ‘empirical’ and ‘theoretical’ levels of
                     interpretation, and, more generally, what we mean by humanistic inquiry. Fish
                     stumbles into this realization when he worries that the “digital humanities
                     completely change our understanding of what a humanities goal (and work in the
                     humanities) might be” [<a class="ref" href="#fish2012b">Fish 2012b</a>]. Where most DH scholars would respond to Fish’s worry
                     with a celebratory, ‘Yes!’, Fish, Da, Eyers and others instead set themselves the
                     task of defending a largely unexamined notion of retro-humanism. As such, his
                     ongoing attack on DH constitutes perhaps the clearest instance of this desire to
                     redefine the humanities according to this retro model and therefore merits sustained
                     attention. </div>

                     this lack of expertise doesn’t impede his assessment. Another 84 words comprise

                     the relation between the literary and the computational. Franco Moretti (2013)
                     describes this as “operationalizing,” the process wherein concepts of textual
                     interpretation are <em class="emph">operationalized</em> in software: “building a
                     bridge from concepts to measurement, and then to the world … from the concepts of

                     step further to say (drawing on Alan Galey and Stan Ruecker’s (2010) examination of
                     “How a prototype argues”) that our techniques <em class="emph">are </em>theory.
                     Clement explains the benefits of this methodological articulation, writing that it
                     “gives us an opportunity to explain why we do what we do, which in turn allows us
                     to
                     argue for the specific contributions of our findings to ourselves, to other
                     humanists, to those possible collaborators in other disciplines who rely on
                     methodology as a signpost, and to the world.” To theorize the relationship between
                     the digital and the textual, Clement adapts Marjorie Perloff’s (2004) notion of
                     “differential reading” as the dialogical movement between close and distant

                     adaptation of the concept is more fully developed. Where Perloff, like Fish, is
                     content to let her concepts unfold as part of her poetic interpretation, thus
                     relegating method to the background of the interpretive act, Clement’s attempt to
                     situate the digital in relation to the humanities, by operationalizing differential
                     reading, requires a more explicit methodological framework.</div>

                     attacks on DH attempt to conceal the gap of their own interpretive practices.
                     Invoking the language of “optimal utility” or the “functional operation” of
                     particular critical frameworks and contrasting DH with an unexamined notion of
                     “reading literature well” sutures the productive, conflictual space of the gap in
                     which criticism reflects on its own activity. This is evident in Fish’s (2019)
                     paraphrase of Da’s argument at the end of his “Afterword”: “The antidote to the
                     whole puffed-up thing is nicely identified by Professor Da in her final paragraph:

                     smuggle in their own retro-humanist methodology in their call to “just read the

                     in fact, “just read” or, in Da’s naive formulation, read “literature well.” The
                     methodological laziness of this final section of Da’s piece would be surprising
                     given the intense and unforgiving scrutiny to which she subjects CLS methods until
                     one recognizes that this is not mere sloppiness but a strategic move that asserts

                     “rhetorical ploy,” he warns us against the Fish of 2019 whose imperative to “just
                     read” is precisely such a rhetorical move aimed at circumventing the critical
                     possibilities of digital humanities as well as the “worldliness” (Said) of criticism
                     more generally. “Throughout Is There A Text in This Class?”
                     (1982) Fish challenges unexamined notions of “just reading” by investigating whether
                     the reader, the text, or the interpretive community is the “source of meaning.” He
                     engages in a sustained attack on New Criticism by attending to the dialogical
                     relationship that emerges out of the gap between methodology and textual meaning.
                     We
                     cannot just read the text, Fish argues, because we constitute the text through our
                     acts of reading and our responses to the existing critical paradigms by which we
                     come to experience and know the text. In this sense, Fish demonstrates the manner in
                     which criticism occurs temporally: the text is an organizing centre around which
                     “communities of readers” respond to other communities and form a range of
                     interpretations over time. <a class="noteRef" href="#d4e979">[12]</a>

                     Fish’s criticism has resulted in his becoming the very New Critic whose naive
                     assertion of “just reading” he once sought to expose. Yet this New(er) Criticism 2.0
                     that claims to ‘just read the texts’ retains the same problems as Wimsatt and
                     Beardsley’s original vision. As Jonathan Culler (1981) explains, “New Criticism’s
                     dream of a self-contained encounter between innocent reader and autonomous text is
                     a
                     bizarre fiction. To read is always to read in relation to other texts, in relation
                     to the codes that are the products of these texts and go to make up a culture” [<a class="ref" href="#culler1981">Culler 1981</a>]. New
                     Criticism purports to close the gap of interpretation, imagining that the critic has
                     unmediated access to the text. In place of a criticism that assesses the grounds of
                     its own articulation and theorizes the terms of its own practice, Fish and Da follow
                     their New Critical forebears by attempting to delimit the act of criticism to the
                     act of reading. For Culler, however the problem is worse than merely <em class="emph">how </em>critics read: “the most important and insidious legacy of
                     the New Criticism is the widespread and unquestioning acceptance of the notion that
                     the critic’s job is to interpret literary works” [<a class="ref" href="#culler1981">Culler 1981</a>, 5]. The call to ‘just read’ is
                     misleading because it delimits critical reflection on the task of criticism itself
                     by refusing to acknowledge the worldliness of the text and critic. </div>

                     thus in agreement with Brown in her (2011) assertion that “Working at the gap
                     between humanities research questions and digital humanities development allows
                     digital tools and research results to emerge from a dialectical relationship,
                     allowing the research process to change in concert with the production of new modes
                     of engaging in research” [<a class="ref" href="#brown2011">Brown 2011</a>, 218]. Fish’s observation remains true today: if we
                     conceive of CLS or DH scholarship as generating a set of questions that cannot be
                     asked by traditional methods of literary scholarship then we see the manner in which
                     this work reconstitutes the field in new ways, requiring critics to iteratively
                     theorize the terms and methods of their work.

                     Indeed, this is what Fish and Da primarily miss in their methodological critique of
                     DH and CLS: these methods enable not “just” new forms of asking the same questions
                     but, expand the “field of inquiry” of the humanities by the “questions we are able
                     to ask” using these methods. </div>

                     projects that raise new questions and address a number of Fish’s and Da’s concerns,
                     including the claims that DH results are typically obvious, non-robust, or always
                     over-promised and underdeveloped. These examples are representative of a critical
                     digital humanities that expand the field of humanities inquiry into digital spaces
                     while also reflecting critically on the exclusion or silencing of particular voices
                     within traditional conceptions of the humanities. Furthermore, these projects
                     demonstrate that DH work is not singularly playful or hypothesis-generating but can
                     also answer meaningful research questions, generate plausible new interpretations
                     of
                     texts, and productively situate texts within broader social discourses. Yet, equally
                     important, these cases demonstrate that it through a critical dialogue between the
                     digital humanities and its analogue counterpart that these projects did not merely
                     refine their own method but, in grappling with the relation between the digital and
                     the humanities, also developed a richer sense of humanistic inquiry more generally.
                     These interpretations would have been impossible by “just reading the texts” and
                     instead work in the gap between the digital and the humanities in order to force the
                     humanities to contend with its own silences and structural exclusions. </div>

                     a
                     poet’s work” and the “apparent collocations or associations of clusters of words.”
                     From this, Djwa develops a “selected list of words under the heading of thematic

                     largely unknown DH project by a woman, but also for the manner in which her turn to
                     digital methods required that she develop new paradigms for engaging in humanities
                     research. She is asking questions that are only partially formed while
                     simultaneously inventing, on the go, a method for working through them. She wrestled
                     with familiar questions in DH: which words to exclude (stopwords), how to contend
                     with words that are very similar but with different suffixes (stemming), how to
                     treat multiple editions of a poem, and how to “read” this computational concordance
                     alongside her more traditional dissertation. Furthermore, she had to define, far
                     more accurately than Frye, what she meant by “unity” in a poetic tradition,
                     thematicism, and cluster.</div>

                  <div class="ptext" id="p41">Djwa and Frye were, in many respects, beginning from the same research question: ‘Is
                     there a thematic or formal continuity between Canadian writers that enables critics
                     to identify a distinct Canadian literature?’ Djwa responded to Frye’s inductive
                     approach with her own deductive, digital method that enriches our understandings of
                     theme, image, and national literature. It is in the exchange between these two
                     visions of humanistic inquiry that Djwa developed her analysis.</div>

                     voices use new, digital methods to challenge convention, transform scholarly
                     debates, and pose new questions. Indeed, the influence of her concordance became
                     particularly complex when poet P.K. Page, one of the subjects of Djwa’s study, wrote
                     to her requesting to know the word clusters and themes in her poetry. Djwa employed
                     digital methods to challenge the authority of the male, established,
                     central-Canadian dominance of Klinck, Frye, and others, and to reconstitute the
                     field of inquiry by asking new questions enabled by her DH project.

                     Her digital work enables her to directly challenge Frye’s cruel north thesis: “the isolation of
                     [the] cold north hypothesis is an over-simplification when discussing the
                     development of Canadian poetry, as it represents a concept which does not, in fact,
                     appear to emerge in the earliest poets”[<a class="ref" href="#djwa1964">Djwa 1964</a>]. Her work thus employs digital
                     methods to offer a new conception of national poetic continuity and to foreground
                     authors who were otherwise marginalized from the national canon. </div>

                     humanities research. Klein’s project employs the distant reading method of topic
                     modeling to read the corpora of a collection of abolitionist newspapers. Topic

                     meaningful analytical tool indeed: it not only enables a view from a distance but
                     also helps bring to light certain invisible aspects of knowledge production” [<a class="ref" href="#klein2020">Klein 2020</a>]. Klein

                     Shadd and Child were far more concerned with quotidian experience and reflections on
                     nature, foreign affairs, and family life than Douglass’s paper. Klein demonstrates
                     that Child’s and Shadd’s presence as editors employed depictions of family and daily
                     life, including recipes, songs, and local news, in order to draw readers to the
                     abolitionist cause. Furthermore, Klein argues, the topic models of the newspapers

                     production” [<a class="ref" href="#klein2020">Klein 2020</a>]. Klein’s topic modeling of Child’s archives, for instance,

                     ways in which digital projects require a renewed consideration of humanities work.
                     Djwa’s development of her computational concordances soon give rise to questions of
                     what actually constitutes a national poetic tradition. Klein’s topic modeling
                     reflects both on the meaning of a topic, attendant as it is to both the implicit and
                     explicit content of the papers she analyzes, and the forms of unrecognized labour
                     that Black women engage in as part of their projects of freedom making. Yet beyond
                     these practical, methodological concerns, both examples employ the digital in order
                     to challenge the received orthodoxy of their respective fields. Djwa’s thematic
                     concordance of Canadian poets describes a counter-tradition that identifies a number
                     of thematic clusters of Canadian poetry that challenge Frye’s cruel north thesis.
                     Klein’s analysis demonstrates how digital methods can provide insight into Black

                     “individualistic, masculinist mode of statistical criticism” and offer a competing
                     vision of the humanities. Their critiques cannot account for the exciting and
                     invigorating ways in which “the black digital humanities promotes a system of
                     changes,” particularly as “a mechanism for deregulating the tendency of
                     technological tools, when employed in the digital humanities, to deemphasize
                     questions about humanity itself” [<a class="ref" href="#gallon2016">Gallon 2016</a>]. Similarly, their retro-humanist
                     vision excludes the manner in which “black digital practice is the interface by

                     commodification” [<a class="ref" href="#johnson2018">Johnson 2018</a>]. Indeed, DH scholars “argue for positioning

                     the way they insist that DH “investigations must incorporate race from the outset,

                     always been a site of struggle and they conceal that struggle in their call to a
                     return to past principles of “optimal utility,” “humanist sensitivity,” or “the task
                     of interpretation as traditionally conceived.” At a time when the very value of the
                     humanities is under siege, DH offers opportunities to transform narrow visions of
                     the humanities’ ‘value’ into humanities-based interrogations of the “value of value”
                     [<a class="ref" href="#butler2014">Butler 2014</a>]. The challenge for digital humanities now is not “choose between the
                     philosophical, cultural, and computational,” [<a class="ref" href="#bianco2012">Bianco 2021</a>] or to demonstrate how DH
                     accords with past visions of humanities work. Rather, our challenge is to respond
                     to
                     Diana Brydon’s (2011) call that “the humanities need a new humanism” and to dwell in

                     [<a class="ref" href="#da2019">Da 2019</a>] with no reflection on whether ““utility” is an appropriate measure for
                     modes of reading or what kind of utility she is asserting. Similarly, Tom
                     Eyers’s critique “laments the loss of humanist sensitivity” [<a class="ref" href="#eyers2013">Eyers 2013</a>] that comes
                     with digital humanities should rankle any critic with a cursory understanding of

                     of which have shown the serious limitations of conceiving of traditional forms
                     of “humanist sensitivity” [<a class="ref" href="#eyers2013">Eyers 2013</a>]. Eyers also misunderstands the function of exegesis
                     throughout his article, arguing that DH scholarship fails “to consider the
                     crucial conflict between the methodology employed and the wider, catholic form
                     of interpretation argued for” [<a class="ref" href="#eyers2013">Eyers 2013</a>]. While simultaneously arguing that DH
                     practitioners fall prey to the “alluring transparency afforded by the sharp
                     technological lenses,” he contradictorily also states that DH practitioners,
                     “while acknowledging the fundamental discrepancy between the act of computation
                     itself and the subsequent act of critical interpretation, nonetheless considers
                     the gap easily and unproblematically surmountable” [<a class="ref" href="#eyers2013">Eyers 2013</a>]. Eyers’s argument is not only
                     internally contradictory, it demonstrates a shocking lack of familiarity with
                     the numerous DH critics who, as I will show, have spent a large portion of their

                     to be coherent. Yet he relies on a colloquial, implicit understanding of intent
                     that forecloses certain readings. Said (1975), for instance, conceives of intent
                     as “the link between the idiosyncratic view and the communal concern” and as a
                     “notion that includes everything that later develops out of it, no matter how

                     treating a small subset of DH work as representative of the whole enterprise, he
                     finds himself, here, in agreement with a number of DH scholars. Drucker (2011),
                     for instance, has demonstrated the misuse of diagrams and graphical display in
                     the visualization of data and calls for “a new approach that uses humanities

                     conceive of “reading well” or “just reading” the texts? To answer such a
                     question, we might turn again to CLS in an effort to understand what Da (2019)
                     means by “just reading.” Da uses the word “just” twenty-four times throughout
                     her article, most of which are to comment on the relative insignificance of an
                     aspect of CLS scholarship. These uses of the term are characterized by
                     statements such as: “CLS claims that literary critics will no longer make
                     unsupported claims about whole periods of literary history using just a few
                     texts”“corpus ‘entropy,’ ... is just another way of saying ‘two words that
                     appear together’”“‘narrative events’ are just 3-gram length subject+verb+object
                     sequences”“all the things that appear in CLS — network analysis, digital
                     mapping, linear and nonlinear regressions, topic modeling, topology, entropy —
                     are just fancier ways of talking about word frequency changes” [<a class="ref" href="#da2019">Da 2019</a>]. Throughout her
                     article, Da uses “just” liberally and rhetorically in order to smooth over false
                     equivalencies (topic modeling is not a fancier way of “talking about word
                     frequency changes”) and to undermine or misrepresent the claims of CLS scholars
                     (Algee-Hewitt’s arguments about “corpus entropy” are not just about “two words
                     that appear together). Her use of the term “just” is, as Fish warns, a
                     “rhetorical ploy” designed to minimize the complexity of CLS arguments in order
                     to dismiss them. In these instances, she uses “just” to assert critical
                     expertise that she may not, in fact, possess, while also to conceal the
                     complexity of a number of CLS projects with false simplicity. Da also uses “just”
                     to signify a rational, no-nonsense approach to literary scholarship that
                     contrasts effectively with what she argues is CLS’s overwrought method of sound
                     and fury. She writes: “If the authors wanted to nonarbitrarily study the change
                     in topics covered in journal articles over time, they could have just saved time
                     by looking at journal abstracts”[<a class="ref" href="#da2019">Da 2019</a>]. “Couldn’t someone trained in poetry just find,
                     read, and classify [all the short poems that exist in the world]?” [<a class="ref" href="#da2019">Da 2019</a>] “Functional
                     operations would not be far faster and more accurate if someone just read the
                     texts” [<a class="ref" href="#da2019">Da 2019</a>]. Again, Da’s use of “just” represents a complex CLS procedure (topic
                     modeling the entirety of a corpus of literary journals or training an algorithm
                     to identify a poem as a haiku) as an overly-complex version of a far more
                     straightforward form of interpretation (‘just’ read every abstract of thousands
                     of articles in journals, ‘just’ read every short poem in the world). </span></div>

                     transcendental aspiration, the Canadian backwash of Victorian romanticism” [<a class="ref" href="#djwa1971">Djwa 1971</a>]. Yet,
                     she persists: “granted that the common terms of diction are also very probably
                     inherited, a more helpful approach might be the question of whether or not our
                     poets did something unique with their particular inheritance. Did they construct
                     a particular myth or cosmology from the common terms of romantic diction; and,
                     if so, was there any continuance of myth or diction?” [<a class="ref" href="#djwa1971">Djwa 1971</a>].Djwa shows that Charles
                     G.D. Roberts “consistently uses the word ‘dream’ and that it most commonly
                     collocates with ‘sleep,’ ‘vision,’ ‘spirit,’ and ‘mystic’” all in order to
                     demonstrate how “the ‘dream’ emerges primarily as a description of the poet’s
                     aspiration towards ‘the Spirit of Beauty’ beyond nature” [<a class="ref" href="#djwa1971">Djwa 1971</a>]. She then demonstrates
                     how “Archibald Lampman adopts Roberts’ dream metaphor and with it much of his
                     poetic myth”. After moving through a number of observations of the concordance
                     in dialogue with close readings of the poems, she concludes that “there was, in
                     fact, a very close relationship between the major poet of the 1880s, Sir Charles
                     G. D. Roberts, and the major poets of the 1920’s, E.J. Pratt - a bend in the
                     stream of Canadian poetry rather than the sharp break suggested by present
                     critical comment. Further, it is possible that A.J.M. Smith, D.C. Scott, A.M.
                     Klein, although busy carving out new provinces for poetry, were also fully aware
                     of the work done by their predecessors and contemporaries” [<a class="ref" href="#djwa1971">Djwa 1971</a>].</span></div>
