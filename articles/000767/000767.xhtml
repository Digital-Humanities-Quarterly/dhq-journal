                  <p>Librarians and archivists, particularly those whose work focuses on resources pertaining
                     to the Black diaspora, play a vital role in the 
                     field of Black digital humanities. Yet, all too often they are left out of conversations
                     surrounding the Black digital humanities. This is a 
                     missed opportunity. Reflecting on my own work as a library professional, I argue that
                     bridging the gap between the Black digital humanities 
                     and the social sciences, particularly library science, can prove to be incredibly
                     fruitful in all phases of a digital humanity project.

                     work focuses on resources pertaining to the Black diaspora, 
                     play a vital role in the field of Black digital humanities. In addition to teaching,
                     many library professionals provide subject area 
                     expertise in the humanities to create, curate, and preserve resources that document
                     the history and culture of Black people. As such, their 
                     work extends to the digital humanities in that these library professionals digitize
                     historical materials, create and share born-digital 
                     resources, and think deeply about questions of access. Yet, all too often library
                     professionals are left out of conversations surrounding the 
                     Black digital humanities. This is a missed opportunity. Reflecting on my own work
                     as a library professional, I argue that bridging the gap 
                     between the Black digital humanities and the social sciences, particularly library
                     science, can prove to be incredibly fruitful in all phases 
                     of a digital humanities project.

                  <div class="ptext" id="p2">The work of some library professionals closely aligns with that of digital humanists.
                     As scholars in other fields, academic library 
                     professionals publish books and articles, lead digital projects, and teach classes
                     on how to utilize different digital tools and resources. 
                     In addition, they research, collect, preserve, and make accessible digitized and born-digital
                     resources. Many learn basic coding skills in 
                     library school, create finding aids, and catalog archival materials and other resources
                     in the library. These are just a few examples of how 
                     library professionals are making significant contributions to the field, and these
                     skills should be considered an asset to any digital 
                     humanities scholarship. However, while rightly criticizing gaps and silences in library
                     archives, digital humanities scholarship has 
                     sometimes elided the labor of library professionals who are passionately and diligently
                     working behind the scenes, often dealing with very 
                     difficult circumstances across a range of institutional challenges. As a result, some
                     scholars do not utilize the expertise of library 
                     professionals, are unaware of their skillset, or simply overlook their contributions
                     to digital humanities altogether.
                     </div>
                  
                  <div class="counter"><a href="#p3">3</a></div>
                  <div class="ptext" id="p3">The relative lack of collaboration between Black digital humanists and library professionals,
                     I argue, can also be explained by the fact that 
                     some institutions lack the infrastructure to implement digital scholarship on campus.
                     While there are many colleges and universities that 
                     have successfully incorporated digital humanities work into their academic spaces,
                     there are many more institutions that have yet to do so. 
                     Many factors may account for this, such as a lack of funding or expertise, or a perceived
                     lack of interest amongst faculty, staff, and 
                     students. However, collaborating with those on campus who have knowledge in the area
                     of digital scholarship is advantageous for humanities 
                     scholars, especially those at institutions that have little to no funding to create
                     digital labs, centers, or other dedicated spaces for 
                     digital humanities scholarship. Thus, seeking out assistance from colleagues across
                     campus is imperative.

                     digital humanities scholarship in earnest ought to 
                     turn to their libraries for assistance. Indeed, the tremendous uptick in digital humanities
                     positions within college and university libraries 
                     in recent years, itself a response to the steady rise in digital humanities scholarship,
                     indicates that library professionals would be an 
                     asset to digital humanities and specifically to Black digital humanities. Humanities
                     scholars may be suprrised to learn that their institution 
                     employs a Digital Humanities Librarian or Archivist, a Digital Initiatives and Resources
                     Librarian, a Digital Scholarship Archivist, or even 
                     a Digital Humanities Specialist, to name a few of the positions that have been implemented
                     in recent years. These positions suggest that 
                     institutions are increasingly positioning their libraries to respond to the growing
                     demand for more collaboration and assistance with digital 
                     tools and projects. It is increasingly possible for humanities scholars to visit their
                     institution's library and find library professionals 
                     ready to provide instruction on digital tools, assist with research needs, and share
                     invaluable knowledge as collaborators on digital 
                     humanities projects.

                     new scholarship and resources that pertain to 
                     Black history and culture would likely have much to add to the planning, research,
                     design, and development of any Black digital humanities 
                     projects. These professionals hold titles such as African American Studies Librarian,
                     Black Diaspora Archivist, and Curator for African 
                     American Collections.

                  <div class="ptext" id="p6">Though some institutions have not yet established a concentrated position or dedicated
                     space to focus solely on fostering digital 
                     humanities, all is not lost. It is not a librarian's job to know all things, but it
                     is their job to know how to find all things. Oftentimes, 
                     this knowledge results from assisting a wide variety of researchers and from undertaking
                     continual professional development. It is safe to 
                     say that in the field of library sciences, an effective library professional is a
                     nosy one! In fact, to be effective, library professionals 
                     must seek to know the current trends in scholarship across various disciplines. Once
                     library professionals have gained additional knowledge 
                     and practice in digital humanities, they can share their newly acquired skills with
                     scholars at their institutions. Even though some 
                     institutions do not have funding for professional development in digital humanities,
                     library professionals can and should seek out 
                     opportunities independently.

                     and emerging scholarship to be effective in the field of 
                     library and information science. I strive to know a little bit about a lot of things
                     in order to assist a vast array of researchers and the 
                     community at large, principally the Black community. I offer here some examples of
                     opportunities that have made a difference to my 
                     professional path, in hopes that some of these might serve as bridges for others as
                     well. As a way to continue to develop professionally, I 
                     have sought out learning opportunities which have been an important way for me to
                     gain new knowledge about digital humanities. For example, 
                     in 2022, I applied for and was selected to participate in the inaugural California
                     Digital Humanities Research Institute. This new endeavor 
                     was inspired by The City University of New York's digital humanities research institute and was hosted by UCLA 
                     Libraries and UC Irvine Libraries. That year, the theme for the free Digital Ethnic Studies Institute was
                     
                     “The Black Press”. The virtual three-day institute featured three keynote speakers and was geared towards
                     those 
                     interested in learning about foundational geographic information systems as well as
                     text mining tools that use open datasets related to 
                     African American history. It was a wonderful opportunity to not only learn about different
                     digital projects but also to meet others who were 
                     interested in the intersection of Black studies and digital humanities.

                     have also benefited from several virtual workshops 
                     facilitated by the Atlanta University Center Data Science Initiative, where I learned more about how data sciences can
                     be used

                     instance, I have been a proud scholar of the University of Kansas' Black Book Interactive Project. As a scholar in the

                     accompany their workshops. These are all activities through which younger scholars
                     and those new to the field can contribute meaningfully and

                     opportunities for librarians and archivists to learn and grow in the digital humanities
                     are ripe for the taking. Library professionals, 
                     including those currently working in digital humanities positions as well as those
                     with other specialties who nonetheless participate in 
                     digital humanities professional development opportunities, are uniquely trained and
                     prepared to collaborate on digital humanities projects. 
                     Therefore, Black digital humanists and library professionals can bridge the gap by
                     working together.
