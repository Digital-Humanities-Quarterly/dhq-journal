      <dhq:abstract>
        <p>This article presents the results of a semester-long project designed to determine how
          effectively interactive Web 2.0 technology can facilitate collaborative research in
          undergraduate learners. The study was conducted during a 2007 advanced Shakespeare course
          at the University of Central Florida that focused heavily on a new historicist approach to
          studying literature. In this paper we first establish the theoretical foundation for this
          particular approach to literary studies, then discuss more in-depth how the collaborative,
          inter-connective nature of wikis allowed students to witness first-hand some of the
          concealed assumptions enmeshed in the creation of historical explanation or narrative. We
          also discuss how, in thinking about the past, this technology allowed our students realize
          some of the stakes in describing history for the present. In other words, having students
          create wikis based on the social identities that recur in Shakespeare’s works developed an
          implicit awareness of motives for <q>doing</q> history. We also show how employing open
          source technology in a localized classroom setting can assuage some of the gaps we
          experience in trying to provide enough period coverage while also attending to theoretical
          apparatus and students’ experience of meaningful connections to material. On a larger
          scale, creating inquiry-based projects can alleviate some of the humanities’ disengagement
          from the <q>real world</q> that many have been suggesting of late.</p>

      <quote rend="block" source="#undocumented">...I don’t think or know much about the people in

      <p>The above statements are a sample of responses submitted by upper-division Shakespeare
        students to a question posed at the beginning of the semester: <q>What do you know about
          people in Shakespeare’s time?</q> These quotes reflect some of the <q>facts</q> gleaned by
        students from other classes, movies such as 1998’s <title rend="italic">Shakespeare in
          Love</title>, or perhaps even from the local Renaissance Faire, where turkey legs and dirt
        paths are part and parcel of the historical experience. The responses typically read as if
        students are holding something back, as if they are not sure to what potentially humiliating
        end their answers might serve. But their replies to a second, correlative question suggests
        that these snippets really do represent what they <q>know,</q> or are at least part of what
        they think about when they think of the citizenry of sixteenth and early seventeenth century
        England. To the additional query — <q>is history important in understanding a literary
          text?</q> — everyone assured us that it is. One student, elaborating as if writing for an
        exam, answered, <q>Yes, history gives a text more context and make meaning more apparent,
          make parts of the text more meaningful.</q> Another stated the same thought more casually:
          <q>Yes. The time period affects the writer that affects the piece.</q> No one in a class
        of thirty-eight responded negatively, yet their cautious responses suggest that such reading
        was simply mandatory and without immediate relevance; that reading literature historically
        was just another academic exercise expected of them as English majors in order to move
        forward to graduation.</p>
      <p>The overarching goal of this class is to read Shakespeare in a reflective and ultimately
        relevant way through the integration of historical context. This objective may seem simple
        at first, but it is one that has repeatedly proven difficult to accomplish. Past efforts
        have found that 1) Non-history majors frequently enter literature courses having experienced
        history as an amalgam of mere facts to be memorized rather than material texts worthy of
        analysis and application, and 2) time-strained professors <quote rend="inline"
          source="#schultz2001">trained in their own specialties [may] know very little about areas
          outside their own fields of interest</quote> and thus lack the kind of multi-layered
        knowledge of a particular period or topic needed to facilitate deep textual inter-connection
          <ptr target="#schultz2001" loc="142–3"/>. Textbooks such as the Bedford Shakespeare <title
          rend="quotes">Text and Contexts</title> series that present canonical standards along with
        key primary sources and interpretive essays do help stave off some of the institutional
        fragmentation of historical understanding. However, such texts are ultimately self-contained
        authoritative volumes that don’t necessarily help students become more sophisticated,
        self-reliant researchers who engage fully with the complexity of the period at hand.
        Lectures and other scholarly interpretations of data and significant texts limit students’
        experience of history to a set of prescriptive conditions to read for, rather than part of a
        narrative that, like the imaginative literature itself, is the result of an intellectual,
        dynamic process of interconnected cognitive acts performed by socially, culturally, and
        politically interested beings. This contradiction that favors historical <q>truth</q> over
        literary ambiguity looms always at the back of the classroom. As Donald Ulin writes, for
        those of us <cit>
          <quote rend="inline" source="#ulin2007">juggling history, poetics, and the theory
            necessary for an adequate imbrications of the two...what are we to do with all of this
            material, given the time limitations involved in a semester and our students’ own
            limited grasp of history and theory?</quote>
          <ptr target="#ulin2007" loc="71"/>
        </cit>. </p>
      <p>The project described here was undertaken by a literature professor and a humanities
        librarian at the University of Central Florida and was designed to meet this challenge by
        merging our specialties — Renaissance literature and information literacy — in one
        semester-long Shakespeare course. Our goal was to design an engaging, critical, and
        theoretically reflective project wherein theory would emerge <q>naturally</q> as students
        experienced a full range of written and visual texts pertinent to the vaster understanding
        of our given time period. As will be discussed in greater detail, we found that the
        collaborative possibilities of wiki technology allowed students to witness first-hand some
        of the concealed postmodernist assumptions enmeshed in the creation of historical
        explanation or narrative. Our students were able to make original and meaningful connections
        with both literary and historical material even as they struggled with one another’s
        interpretations of primary and secondary sources. The inquiry-based design of our project
        brought to light deeper and compelling questions regarding historical narratives. We will
        discuss how, in thinking about the past, this technology provided a unique venue through
        which our students were able to realize some of stakes in describing history for the
        present. We will also examine the effectiveness of employing open source technology to
        assuage some of the gaps we experience in trying to provide enough period coverage while
        also attending to theoretical apparatus and students’ experience of meaningful connections
        to material. On a larger scale, creating inquiry-based projects can alleviate some of the
        humanities’ disengagement from the <q>real world</q> that many have been suggesting of late.
        In other words, our classrooms can be laboratories where important questions regarding
        collaborative analysis arise first while we begin to work on the larger <q>Humanities
          2.0</q> projects called for by Cathy N. Davidson in the May 2008 issue of <title
          rend="italic">PMLA</title>. And finally, if our goal is to transmit the riches of the
        past, it is always with an eye towards the future, and releasing curious and critical
        citizens into the world from the confines of our discipline-specific classrooms is no doubt
        one of the most important aspects of our work.</p>

      <div>
        <head>The Ends and Means of Literary History</head>
        <p>New historicist and cultural materialist approaches to literature emphasizes the value of
          reading literary and non-literary texts from the same period as if they are in constant
          exchange with each other. Each version we present, whether through our lectures or the
          texts we assign, holds certain biases, focuses on individual intellectual interests, or
          otherwise produces gaps in historical narratives. History is a narrative that is always
          constructed, and even if we try to keep our own ideologies in check, we may unwittingly
          fall into pitfalls caused by practicalities, such as time constraints and overcrowded
          classes. With only one or two weeks to spend on <title rend="italic">The Tempest</title>,
          for example, should we concentrate on colonial exploration and expansion? Race? Servitude?
          Gender? Magic? Each is represented in the play, and each takes part in a wider early
          modern discourse that sought to define and place emerging categories within boundaries
          familiar to audiences of the time. Each has its own rich historical narrative as well as a
          complicated representation in the play. However, spending time covering one category
          through lectures, handouts, multi-media presentations and class discussion often comes at
          the expense of racing through or entirely omitting another topic of exploration.</p>
        <p>Having students create wikis based on issues of social identity in the early modern
          period allowed us to address these concerns and develop an implicit awareness of motives
          for <q>doing</q> history. Although some have tagged the new millennium as the
            <q>post-identity age,</q> issues of gender, race, ethnicity, religion, class, sexuality,
          and (dis)ability still inform the lived material realities that students, <cit>
            <quote rend="inline" source="#stanley2005">in going about their daily lives, must
              contend with</quote>
            <ptr target="#stanley2005" loc="192"/>
          </cit>. Social identity was very much on the minds of early modern English people as well.
          In the years that make up Shakespeare’s life (1564 to 1616), there was an enormous output
          of manuals advising an increasingly literate public on how to be a good servant, wife,
          soldier, husbandman, magician, and king. Economic, religious, and other complicated
          paradigmatic shifts created an anxiety of identity featured in many of the plays. In the
          popular comedy <title rend="italic">Twelfth Night</title>, for example, male actors become
          women who then disguise themselves as men, servants imagine rising in station through
          marriage, and those of noble birth act in ways unsupported by traditional decorum.
          Creating wikis based on the identities that recur throughout Shakespeare’s plays would
          keep historical research focused and relevant both to our students’ lives and to the
          period we were studying.</p>
        <p>Since many students came to class with some previous exposure to Shakespeare’s works, we
          asked them to generate a list of categories they had encountered in such plays as <title
            rend="italic">The Tempest</title>, <title rend="italic">Othello</title>, and <title
            rend="italic">MacBeth</title> and other texts we would read throughout the semester. The
          primary identities listed were <q>Men,</q>
          <q>Women,</q>
          <q>Nobility,</q>
          <q>Servants,</q>
          <q>Religious Types,</q>
          <q>Professionals,</q>
          <q>Magicians and Witches,</q>
          <q>Colonizer and Colonized,</q>
          <q>Fools,</q>
          <q>Poor Folk,</q> and <q>Villains.</q> Students then formed small groups of three to four
          members and chose a specific identity to focus on for the duration of the semester. Each
          group was then charged with creating a wiki based on the identity they had chosen. The
          wikis would include an array of primary and secondary sources that would serve as a
          research guide — a customizable course-specific database — that this and future classes
          could consult and continue to develop. We said very little about how the wikis should look
          or how the content should be organized. We wanted to give the groups as much creative
          freedom as possible in deciding what these resources would be with one stipulation: the
          wikis needed to include the types of historical and literary resources emphasized above.
          We hoped this approach would allow quality time to be spent on neglected topics such as
          the medical profession as represented by Lady Macbeth’s doctor, even if classroom
          discussion, as is typical, favored the play’s more glamorous villains and witches.</p>
        <p>Moreover, we anticipated that amassing literary, historical, and critical materials
          focused on issues of social identity would provide direct access to what Jameson called
            <quote rend="inline" source="#ulin2007">the radical historicity of everything</quote> —
          that is, the notions of gender, poverty, race, ethnicity, etc., <cit>
            <quote rend="inline" source="#jameson1981">everything we may be tempted to think of as
              permanent</quote>
            <ptr target="#jameson1981" loc="372"/>
          </cit>. Indeed, these are the very topics the class was assigned to explore. In generating
          these topics, it was obvious that our students had already responded to the literary
          creations with some spark of recognition. According to Ulin, initial self-recognition is a
          factor built into literature itself by writers resisting <quote rend="inline"
            source="#ulin2007">conventions of referentiality in favor of abstraction [and]
            idealization,</quote> and is thus typically responded to by readers who <quote
            rend="inline" source="#ulin2007">have been taught to seek literature’s eternal verities
            in preference to anything of local or historical</quote> importance <ptr
            target="#ulin2007" loc="71"/>.</p>
        <p>Shakespeare especially has achieved an appeal based in part on his artful capacity for
          abstraction. Students come to class expecting to <q>relate</q> (earnestly or cynically) to
            <title rend="italic">Romeo and Juliet</title> as <emph>the</emph> great tragic romance
          of all time since they have already become familiar with the play’s themes through work in
          high school and through popular culture. Historical interpretation has the potential to
          unlock difference in even the most familiar literary works. However, doing so forces us to
          engage in de-familiarization, which opens texts to additional possibilities for thinking
          about identity and presents us with the origins and implications of our own ideological
          moment. Pedagogically speaking, real historical work, which entails judging the
          perspectives of authors of primary documents as well as works of literature, can distance
          students from their preconceived notions as much as it can provide a background for them.
          For example, placing the suggestive, personal jests shared by Romeo and Mercutio within
          the discourses of male friendship in the period exposes students to different modes of
          male behavioral acceptability, which may offer options to some of the homophobic
          discourses circulating today. To witness other possibilities for understanding given
          identities is to dislodge stereotypes at their root, exposing each as a vacillating,
          ever-evolving qualifier that has little claim, if any, on an absolute negating
            <q>truth.</q>
        </p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <head>Why Wikis?</head>
        <p>One of our biggest challenges in designing this project was choosing the appropriate
          medium to achieve our goals. Wikis were a candidate because of their easy editing
          functions and low learning curve. However, there is also a stigma attached to wikis thanks
          in large part to the ongoing debate over the value of Wikipedia. The lack of
          accountability and formal training of many Wikipedia users, as well as the absence of a
          peer review process, often frustrates educators when its error-ridden entries are cited as
            <q>authoritative</q> in research papers. A recent example of this sort of backlash is
          the case of the Middlebury College History Department’s decision to ban Wikipedia
          citations. Brock Read writes that <cit>
            <quote rend="inline" source="#read2007">The problem with Wikipedia in the eyes of many
              scholars is its open editing system. The site permits unregistered, anonymous users to
              edit content alongside more traditional contributors</quote>
            <ptr target="#read2007" loc="para. 4"/>
          </cit>. Read goes on to quote Don J. Wyatt, Chairman of the History Department at
          Middlebury College, who says, <cit>
            <quote rend="inline" source="#read2007">Wikipedia is very seductive: We all are sort of
              enamored of the convenience and speed of the Web. From the standpoint of access, it’s
              a marvelous thing. But from the standpoint of maintaining quality, it’s so much
              less</quote>
            <ptr target="#read2007" loc="para. 7"/>
          </cit>. This point about convenience vs. quality will be discussed later, but for now we
          want to focus on the openly accessible quality of wikis and why this makes them such
          useful tools for collaboration.</p>
        <p>For better or worse, wikis coerce users into making connections with other users and with
          the material they present, and despite the ongoing debate over accuracy, wikis are being
          increasingly used by educators who like the ease with which they can put collaborative
          pedagogical values into practice. Most notable among these values is the opportunity for
          students to work together, beyond the confines of the classroom, to negotiate language use
          and the idea of <q>discourse</q> and enact a public presentation of knowledge through the
          blending of image, text, and sound (<ptr target="#desilets2005"/>; <ptr
            target="#pennell2008"/>; <ptr target="#farabaugh2007"/>). Our choice to use wikis was
          made for similar reasons, but perhaps most important was how their flexible functionality
          would provide students a venue through which they could engage with historical contexts
          first-hand. More than just presenting the typical list of disembodied facts delivered
          nervously during ten-minute oral presentations, the process of creating wikis would allow
          our students to forge important connections between historical acts and literary
          representations as a negotiating group. In so doing, they would produce a kind of
          narrative that has its own vested interests in their particular take on the world as well
          as on the early modern period. In other words, they would be taking the same kind of
          postmodern intellectual risk of historians whose work <quote rend="inline"
            source="#farabaugh2007">inevitably entails taking a stand on key theoretical
            issues</quote> and is <cit>

            <ptr target="#fulbrook2002" loc="4"/>
          </cit>. Moreover, this kind of interpretation would be expressed through students’ ability
          to add value through their use of and interaction with resources by taking an active role
          in <q>remixing</q> them and exploring new connections and contexts.</p>
        <p>The notion of context is worth discussing a bit more in-depth. One of the most common
          criticisms of Web 2.0 applications is that they devalue information through a lack of
          context and individual voice. Jaron Lanier, in his critique of Wikipedia entries, writes, <cit>
            <quote rend="inline" source="#lanier2006">Accuracy in a text is not enough. A desirable
              text is more than a collection of accurate references. It is also an expression of
              personality</quote>
            <ptr target="#lanier2006" loc="para. 8"/>
          </cit>. He continues, <cit>
            <quote rend="inline" source="#lanier2006">When you see the context in which something
              was written and you know who the author was just beyond a name, you learn so much more

              anti-contextual brew of the Wikipedia...You have to have a chance to sense personality
              in order for language to have its full meaning</quote>
            <ptr target="#lanier2006" loc="para. 10"/>
          </cit>. Wikipedia contributors generally operate anonymously, and when a large number of

            <ptr target="#lanier2006" loc="para. 19"/>
          </cit>. For this reason, many of these sites have a tendency to seem more ephemeral and
          nebulous than traditional publications, a point that illustrates how, even as we move
          rapidly toward a more digital culture, we still cling to established notions of stability
          and authenticity. Ingrid Mason addresses this idea, writing, <quote rend="inline"
            source="#mason2007">Authenticity is crucial to society’s understanding of historicity,
            whether measured in terms of centuries or seconds.</quote> She adds that <cit>
            <quote rend="inline" source="#mason2007">Digital culture wants to continually revise its
              past as much as project into its future</quote>
            <ptr target="#mason2007" loc="202"/>
          </cit>. A tension exists between the notions of fluidity and fixity but, while both are
          important, it is fixity that gives information a sense of direction and purpose. In
          quoting John Seely Brown and Paul Duguid, she states that fixity <quote rend="inline"
            source="#mason2007">frames information.</quote> Further, <quote rend="inline"
            source="#mason2007">The way a writer and publisher physically present information,
            relying on resources outside the information itself, conveys to the reader much more
            than information alone. Context not only gives people what to read, it tells them how to
            read, what it means, what it’s worth, and why it matters.</quote> Context, in other
          words, creates <cit>
            <quote rend="inline" source="#mason2007">a sense of the past, present, and future —

          </cit>
        </p>
        <p>It is our contention, however, that the pedagogical applications of Web 2.0 technology
          under consideration here provide an outlet through which educators can entice students to
          look beyond fixed notions of authenticity and create new contexts that emphasize
          flexibility in a way that is relevant to the current culture of information. James Hilton
          speaks to this point when he compares current trends in the information seeking behavior
          of college students to what he calls the <quote rend="inline" source="#hilton2006">rip,
            mix and burn</quote> era of music: <cit>
            <quote rend="inline" source="#hilton2006">Today’s students want to be able to take
              content from other people, they want to mix it in new creative ways — to produce it,
              to publish it, and to distribute it</quote>
            <ptr target="#hilton2006" loc="60"/>
          </cit>. He suggests that students raised in the digital age tend to think of value in
          terms of their ability to remix and personalize information. The experience of
          contributing to a wiki does just that — it encourages students to explore and make their
          own connections instead of relying on authorities whose work is typically bound in the
          age-old symbol of authority: the published book. For this reason, we asked our students to
          combine information gathered from traditional sources such as books and journals with
          additional or differently explored primary sources, literature and images from online
          digital collections. By engaging with document creation from the ground up, they would be
          authorizing a vision of the past that related to their findings as well as their points of
          view that would be made apparent, finally, through their visual presentation as well as
          their written interpretation. In other words, instead of relying solely on the research
          paper in which students often mimic authority by reproducing formalized structures, wikis
          would encourage them to rethink their approaches to research and to defend both their
          points of view as well as the form through which they choose to organize and present their
          findings. As James Hilton suggests, allowing students to actively <quote rend="inline"
            source="#hilton2006">remix and personalize</quote> their research would help them find
          their voices as scholars fully engaged in the act of knowledge production.</p>
        <p>Viewed in this light, consensus can be seen, not as a final goal, but as a starting point
          from which students are encouraged to look for gaps in knowledge, imagine alternative
          interpretations, and contribute to the ever-changing, adaptable structure of the wiki.
          This point recalls John Trimbur’s classic essay, <title rend="quotes">Consensus and
            Difference in Collaborative Learning,</title> which is worth examining here. Playing
          mainly off the ideas of Kenneth Bruffee, Trimbur notes some of the most commonly cited
          benefits of collaborative learning: it democratizes the classroom, allows students to
          share in decision-making, and teaches them to take an active role in group life. The
          desired effect, advocates claim, <cit>
            <quote rend="inline" source="#trimbur1989">is to reach consensus through an expanding
              conversation</quote>
            <ptr target="#trimbur1989" loc="602"/>
          </cit>. He adds that <cit>
            <quote rend="inline" source="#trimbur1989">in Bruffee’s social constructionist pedagogy,
              the language used to reach consensus acquires greater authority as it acquires greater
              social weight: the knowledge students put into words counts for more as they test it
              out, revising and relocating it by taking into account what their peers, the teacher,
              and voices outside the classroom have to say</quote>
            <ptr target="#trimbur1989" loc="602"/>
          </cit>. But it is this idea of consensus that worries some critics, who claim that <cit>
            <quote rend="inline" source="#trimbur1989">the use of consensus in collaborative
              learning is an inherently dangerous and potentially totalitarian practice that stifles
              individual voice and creativity, suppresses differences, and enforces
              conformity</quote>
            <ptr target="#trimbur1989" loc="602"/>
          </cit>. Trimbur asserts that the debate framed in these terms presents an either/or
          scenario that misses some of the more nuanced aspects of consensus. He doesn’t want to
          dismiss the notion outright; rather, he wants to <quote rend="inline"
            source="#trimbur1989">revise it, as a step toward developing a critical practice of
            collaborative learning,</quote> and continues to argue that consensus <cit>
            <quote rend="inline" source="#trimbur1989">can be a powerful instrument for students to
              generate differences, to identify systems of authority that organize these
              differences, and to transform the relations of power that determine who may speak and
              what counts as a meaningful statement</quote>
            <ptr target="#trimbur1989" loc="603"/>
          </cit>.</p>
        <p>Trimbur’s words echo a point made earlier about how historical interpretation has the
          power to unlock difference and, in so doing, can open a text to a greater array of
          possibilities. Consensus, then, becomes a source of conflict rather than a mere act of
          assimilation: <quote rend="inline" source="#trimbur1989">Redefining consensus as a matter
            of conflict suggests, moreover, that consensus does not so much reconcile differences
            through rational negotiation. Instead, such a redefinition represents consensus as a
            strategy that structures differences by organizing them in relation to each
            other.</quote> In this way, Trimbur continues, <cit>
            <quote rend="inline" source="#trimbur1989">consensus cannot be known without its
              opposite — without the other voices at the periphery of the conversation</quote>
            <ptr target="#trimbur1989" loc="608"/>
          </cit>. Proponents of collaborative learning might claim that this argument distorts the
          goals of social constructionist pedagogy by disrupting the conversation to <q>force change
            in people’s interest,</q> but Trimbur adds that we need <cit>
            <quote rend="inline" source="#trimbur1989">to look at collaborative learning not merely
              as a process of consensus-making but more important as a process of identifying
              differences and locating these differences in relation to each other</quote>
            <ptr target="#trimbur1989" loc="610"/>
          </cit>.</p>
        <p>We hoped to avoid the afore-mentioned pitfalls and use the technology in a way that would
          not only illuminate the interpretability of historical materials, but would promote the
          sort of difference that Trimbur is concerned with. It is one thing to present students
          with abstract theory, but quite another to have them engage with the phenomenon from which
          theory is created, and forms of history — be they literary, social, economic, or otherwise
          — are written from particular positions and involve judgments made in the present about
          who and what is important in the past. Our students would engage with <q>difference</q> on
          three levels: first, through researching how identities of the past were qualified by
          others, and second, by experiencing how these identities were interpreted by a playwright
          interested in representing them for entertainment purposes in a certain place and time.
          Third, the kind of substantive group negotiation engendered by wikis would enable students
          to recognize their own positions by having to account for the alternative perspectives of
          their classmates. Together, they would <quote rend="inline" source="#dwight2003">hone
            their skills of inquiry by practicing them through collaboratively constructing a
            text,</quote> engaging in a kind of meta-historical conversation while working in a new
          kind of classroom sphere <ptr target="#dwight2003" loc="722"/>. Encountering
          interpretative practices on both textual and interpersonal levels would enable students to
          fully engage with the way apparently seamless veneers of history are built from multiple
          negotiations.</p>

        <head>Information Literacy</head>
        <p>We were also interested in what impact this technology would have on the information
          seeking behavior of our students. As stated above, we sought to embed research methodology
          into the general discourse in what might be thought of as an <q>integrated</q> approach to
          information literacy. While an in-depth analysis of information literacy is beyond the
          scope of this essay, it is worth noting that one trait many such programs share is that
          they treat research methodology as something that can be taught outside of, or as an
          add-on to, course content. The problem with this approach is the assumption that, after
          being exposed to what are often referred to as <q>one-shot</q> instruction sessions,
          students will be equipped to navigate a complex maze of resources and make appropriate
          course-specific choices. However, a number of studies have shown that, by and large, this
          is not the case. Davis and Cohen, for example, conducted a citation analysis of research
          papers in an introductory-level microeconomics course at Cornell University from
          1996-1999. Their findings showed a fairly significant decrease in the number of
            <q>traditional</q> scholarly sources (books and journals) used by students during this
          time. <cit>
            <quote rend="inline" source="#davis2001">In general, students cited fewer books in 1999
              than they did in 1996. Comprising nearly one third (30%) of total citations in 1996,
              book citations dropped to less than one fifth (19%) in 1999. This translated into a
              decrease from 3.5 books per bibliography in 1996 to 2.2 in 1999, with the median
              citation number dropping from 3 to 1</quote>
            <ptr target="#davis2001" loc="311"/>
          </cit>. Although they didn’t analyze the type or quality of <q>web documents</q> cited,
          one might surmise that a general increase in Internet usage during this time played a
          factor in the shift away from books and journals. As a result, the authors conclude that,
          since students are <quote rend="inline" source="#davis2001">very literal</quote> when it
          comes to requirements, instructors should be more prescriptive with the types of resources
          they would like to see students use <ptr target="#davis2001" loc="313"/>.</p>
        <p>To test this hypothesis, Davis conducted a second study in 2000 in which he implemented
          three recommendations based on results from his 1996-1999 study. Those recommendations
          were stricter guidelines about what types of sources students should be allowed to use,
          the creation of scholarly portals to guide students to <q>authoritative</q> sources, and
          more instruction about how to critically evaluate sources <ptr target="#davis2002"
            loc="53"/>. However, even after implementing his recommendations, Davis’s second study
          yielded no new results: <cit>
            <quote rend="block" source="#davis2002">The results of the 2000 update suggest that the
              professor’s verbal instructions had little (if any) effect on improving the scholarly
              component of research papers. The number of traditional scholarly materials cited this
              year was similar to previous years. Bibliographies grew, but only in respect to
              additional web sites and newspapers. When viewed as a percentage of total citations,
              the <q>scholarliness</q> of bibliographies continued to decline</quote>
            <ptr target="#davis2002" loc="59"/>
          </cit> Davis’s response to these disappointing results was to suggest that <quote
            rend="inline" source="#davis2002">A possible crisis in undergraduate scholarship is at
            hand</quote> and that librarians and professors should work more closely and <cit>
            <quote rend="inline" source="#davis2002">provide more clearly defined expectations in
              their assignments</quote>
            <ptr target="#davis2002" loc="59"/>
          </cit>. In a similar vein, Robinson and Schlegl also found that library instruction alone
          has little, if any, effect on the type and quality of sources that students use. Building
          on Davis’s results, they designed a similar study based on what they call <quote
            rend="inline" source="#robinson2004">instruction and encouragement</quote> (typified by
          Davis’s approach) and their own <quote rend="inline" source="#robinson2004"
            >instruction-and-penalty</quote> approach. They ultimately found that <cit>
            <quote rend="inline" source="#robinson2004">instruction and encouragement has very
              limited effect on the quality of student research, but instruction-and-penalty does
              have significant effects</quote>
            <ptr target="#robinson2004" loc="280"/>
          </cit>. When penalties were enforced, the quality of the bibliographies was closer to what
          Davis and Philips had seen in 1996 <ptr target="#robinson2004" loc="280–1"/>.</p>
        <p>While the original results from Davis and Philips may have been surprising, the results
          of the Robinson and Schlegl should be less so. Penalties are no doubt a strong
          motivational tool, but they don’t address a larger issue that is at stake. Jason Martin
          recently surveyed 200 education majors at the University of Central Florida to determine
          what impact library instruction was having on sources used by his selected group of
          students. Martin concluded that, not only is there no clear association between library
          instruction and the type of sources used, but that student behavior is not so much
          informed by what they know to be right or wrong as it is based on comfort and convenience.
          His results revealed that, while 79% of the students surveyed acknowledged that library
          resources were generally more reliable that Internet sources, <cit>
            <quote rend="inline" source="#martin2008">52% of the respondents based their decisions
              more on convenient access than on the authority of the sources</quote>
            <ptr target="#martin2008" loc="9"/>
          </cit>. However, instead of promoting a more prescriptive approach to instruction, Martin
          points out that, while more restrictions may prevent Internet sources from being included
          in the final product, this is only because students know they will be penalized if they do
          so, and there is no saying they won’t rely on the Internet during the research process, or
          that they won’t revert back to their old habits once the specific assignment is over. In
          other words, <cit>
            <quote rend="inline" source="#martin2008">they would not have gained a deeper
              understanding of the critical importance of using academic sources</quote>
            <ptr target="#martin2008" loc="12"/>
          </cit>. This <quote rend="inline" source="#martin2008">deeper understanding</quote> gets
          to the heart of one of the key components of information literacy: self-reliance. Instead
          of using library instruction to guide students through portals of pre-approved,
            <q>authoritative</q> sources, it is our contention that the best approach is to
          encourage students to be self-reliant, critical researchers. As the culture of information
          continues to evolve and become more complex, and lines between library catalogs and the
          Internet become increasingly transparent, distinctions between what counts as
            <q>scholarly</q> and <q>non-scholarly</q> will also become less obvious. In such an
          environment, emphasis should always be placed on the ability to seek, access, and assess
          quality information, but this should be done in a way that accounts for the wide variety
          of new and emerging sources of information.</p>

        <head>Project Overview</head>
        <p>Early in the semester, an introductory session was dedicated to forming the groups
          described above, setting up accounts, and familiarizing students with the key wiki
          functions. During this session, students were also given a list of expectations for their
          online creations (see appendix 1). We created loosely constructed guidelines to allow the
          groups as much freedom as possible in deciding what should be included in their wikis
          while keeping the material task-relevant. After some initial apprehension from students
          who, after being told for so long not to use wikis, were surprised that they were being
          asked to create one of their own, this open-ended approach provided insightful discussion
          on the cultural importance of Shakespeare and of intellectual presentation more generally.
          As Doug Brent suggests, the online environment gives students ample opportunity to <cit>
            <quote rend="inline" source="#brent1997">figure it out from the inside, not the
              outside</quote>
            <ptr target="#brent1997" loc="para. 5"/>
          </cit>. In creating a historicist study guide for future researchers, our students would
          be gaining an insider’s view of scholarly production. We also hope that this less
          prescriptive, open-ended approach would provide insight into the information seeking
          behavior of our students, what they value as emerging researchers, and gaps in their
          skills that would help us develop better research projects in the future.</p>
        <p>In addition to the introductory session, the collaborating librarian, who also provided
          behind-the-scenes technical support, visited class regularly to provide instruction about
          using databases such as MLA and Early English Books Online (EEBO), and to conduct several
          workshop sessions later in the semester to help students in a more informal manner. During
          these sessions, we made a conscious effort to focus on strategies for seeking and
          assessing information gleaned from a wide variety of sources. Since special emphasis had
          been placed on primary sources, we talked specifically about how to search for such
          materials, not only through the UCF library catalog and databases, but also in the
          ever-increasing number of digital collections and other online resources. This approach
          would help us break free of the scholarly/non-scholarly dichotomy, which typically prompts
          students to rely on what is available in a single library collection, and focus more on
          research as exploration in interactive environments.</p>
        <p>Calandra and Lee speak to this point in a recent article about their Digital History
          Pedagogy Project: <cit>

          </cit>. Their emphasis on manipulation and active learning in the digital environment
          speaks directly to our project and encouragement of students to construct their own
          understanding of the past, as it pertains to the life and times of Shakespeare, while
          promoting a more interactive approach to enhancing information literacy skills. As will be
          discussed in greater detail in the following section, the effects of this approach could
          be seen early on as students began exploring outside research almost immediately and their
          findings regularly became part of a more nuanced class discussion that shifted from the
          expected emotional, relatable appeal to a deeper, more historicized understanding of
          Shakespeare’s works.</p>

        <head>Theory into Practice</head>
        <p>In their <title rend="quotes">Manifesto for Instructional Technology,</title> Jim Dwight
          and Jim Garrison suggest that hypertext and hypermedia technologies like wikis are
          poststructuralist in nature, <quote rend="inline" source="#dwight2003">open[ing] new
            realms of creative possibility</quote> by rejecting <cit>
            <quote rend="inline" source="#dwight2003">the notions of a fixed and final telos,

            <ptr target="#dwight2003" loc="699"/>
          </cit>. Our students’ engagement with the collaborative capacity of wikis supports this
          claim. Less abstractly, interactive technologies that have the capacity to engage multiple
          voices and sources can challenge the ideological neutrality of fact, a foremost concern in
          poststructuralist historical and literary thought. The key issue for us was not
          collaboration's impact on factual accuracy - the concern many have about projects like
          Wikipedia - but rather a new perception about the plausibility of objectivity in
          interpreting history. What follows is a partial account of the meta-discourse drawn both
          from student wikis as well as the final reflective essays written during the last week of
          the course.</p>
        <div>
          <head>History as Mediated Interpretation</head>
          <p>The notion that all historical interpretations are colored by perceptions emanating
            from a particular point of view was one of the primary theoretical precepts experienced
            by our students, many of whom were able to recognize how different authorizing
            institutions, namely government and the church, interpreted poverty, and the way
            creative writers such as Shakespeare are always invested in some kind of interpretation.
            One student working on representations of the poor stated in his final analysis that
              <quote rend="inline" source="#figure01">Shakespeare’s work is more than beautiful old
              language and stories; before doing this, I never would have been able to say that
              Shakespeare included references to such political and seemingly esoteric things such
              as houses of correction and criminals and beggars. I had read two of the plays before
              and I think these references just went over my head.</quote> The ability to
            meaningfully connect plays to important social concerns circulating at the time of their
            creation was fostered by having to make critical interpretive choices as a group: <q>We
              started our project taking for granted that the poor were victims,</q> he explained,
              <q>until [one group member] mentioned the Friar [of Romeo and Juliet]. His poverty was
              a choice.</q> The group took a long time negotiating this second insight into poverty
              <q>because we kept arguing over if we should present both views.</q> The title of
            their final wiki, <title rend="quotes">An Exploration of the Poor, Both Deserving and
              Sturdy, in the works of Shakespeare,</title> demonstrates successful intellectual
            collaboration. The group finally defined the identity of the Elizabethan poor as
              <q>those who chose to be poor, and those who had no options to fight against it</q>
            (see <ref target="#figure01">Figure 1</ref>). This group effectively collected and
            situated appropriate Elizabethan tracts to witness agency and then measure how both
            views of agency could be true.</p>

            <figDesc>Screenshot of the Shakespeare and the Poor wiki page.</figDesc>
          </figure>
          <p>Another group member commented on their decision to explore both <q>the merry beggar
              and the resentful poor</q> in several plays. <q>I worried that our definition was too
              loose but it seems to me that Shakespeare always gives us both sides of the same
              coin.</q> For this group, a less abstract view of the Elizabethan impoverished emerged
            through combining references to the poor in plays with poor laws and sermons, source
            materials typically referred to by scholars and advanced graduate students. In other
            words, by assessing primary and secondary source material, students achieved some
            scholarly authority. The off-line collaboration demonstrates some of the highest goals
            we hold for collaborative learning: responsible for creating their own body of
            knowledge, students worked outside of class to discuss and negotiate the information
            that each brought individually to the table, a move that ultimately led to deeper and
            vaster thinking about a subject. Many teams remarked upon Shakespeare’s ability to
            double-deal with both positive and negative discourses of identities circulating in his
            era. This led them to think about the playwright as an active interpreter of his own
            period, and about the intrinsic capacity of <q>facts</q> to be interpreted in multiple
            ways.</p>
          <p>The students charged with creating a page dedicated to the <title rend="quotes"
              >Colonizer and Colonized</title> put a considerable amount of effort into
            understanding their topic in relation to both explorer’s reports of native populations
            such as Richard Hakluyt’s <title rend="quotes">Reasons for Colonization</title> (1585)
            and to Montaigne’s 1580 essay, <title rend="quotes">On Cannibals.</title> Together these
            texts demonstrate conflicting views of entitled, exploitative colonization as well as a
            romanticized misunderstanding of <q>innocent</q> and unsullied native civilization. Face
            to face, the class could spend only one allotted hour comparing both, a conversation
            that ended with most students favoring Hakluyt’s tract as the one that shed the most
            meaning, while the latter seemed only to useful in contextualizing Gonzalo’s famous
            utopian speech. Online, however, students expressed an understanding of a different
            kind. Their wiki discussion of <title rend="quotes">Caliban as a Colonial Other</title>
            acknowledges how the class favored the one reading, but also suggests that a more
            sympathetic kind of <q>framework for representing Caliban</q> is also in play (see <ref
              target="#figure02">Figure 2</ref>). For these students, Caliban appears both as a
            potential rapist of Miranda and a victim of physically torment having had, <q>through
              violence, to learn the language in order to survive...and forced to abandon his own
              language.</q>
          </p>

            <figDesc>Screenshot of student-added wiki information</figDesc>
          </figure>
          <p>This is not to say that at least one student would not have arrived at this more
            inclusive understanding through the process of writing an individual research paper.
            However, the editing history suggests that the collaborative process played an active
            part in increasing the whole group’s sensitivity to Shakespeare’s multiple
            interpretations of his subject. The three most significant edits to the page occurred
            throughout November when we were covering the play in class. One student began the page
            with a few simple reading notes, arguing that <q>Caliban is the colonized other and
              Prospero is the master figure.</q> A week later, another student reminded the group
            that Caliban represented a kind of danger to the newcomers, carrying with him the threat
            of rape and potential for violence. The first student reminded everyone that this early
            suggestion of <q>interracial sexual relations</q> had negative implications that were
            alive and well in our own time (see <ref target="#figure03">Figure 3</ref>, <ref
              target="#figure04">Figure 4</ref>, <ref target="#figure05">Figure 5</ref>). In plays
            such as <title rend="italic">The Tempest</title> and <title rend="italic"
              >Othello</title>, she stated that <q>men of color</q> are <q>often demonized and
              accused of barbarity in order to further <q>other</q> them and justify keeping them
              away from women. The black male rape myth stems from these very notions.</q> Her point
            was taken seriously as there was a week-long lull in the production of the page until
            the young woman finished it herself. The second student summed up the negotiation best
            when, in his final report, he suggested that his reluctance to continue posting on the
            subject came more from indecision than any real power-play between students: <q>I chose
              not to continue working on this page because it occurred to me that Caliban was never
              really there [in the play]. Our group couldn’t decide if he was presented in a
              positive or negative light as a colonial <q>other.</q> I think we never get to view
              him just on his own terms.</q>

        <div>
          <head>Literature as a Historical Construct</head>
          <p>As the class struggled to think about what Shakespeare thought of people in his own
            historical moment, they also fought with the idea that Shakespeare was a historical
            entity or more specifically, a <emph>product</emph> of historical entities that invested
            in his works a certain cultural capital that is perhaps unsurpassed in English literary
            history. As one young woman working on the Nobility wiki suggested, <q>looking at works
              through <q>royal</q> eyes put a new spin on each play. I began reading each play
              keeping in mind that Shakespeare had to be sure not to offend his monarchs and in the
              end, had to always uphold their right to the throne in some way. I have begun to think
              of him as a less brilliant and more sychophantic [sic] playwright...so in some ways
              this project hurt my appreciation of Shakespeare.</q> Despite her engagement with
            James I’s absolutist philosophy of kingship and the play, <title rend="italic"
              >Macbeth</title>, wherein James’ distant relative, Banquo, is not complicit in the
            murder of King Duncan as he appears in Shakespeare’s chronicle source material, this
            student was clearly longing for her formerly romanticized view of the playwright as a
            well-worded individual genius working beyond or in spite of the political realm of his
            day.</p>
          <p>This student’s grievance articulates not only her own individual struggle of
            disenchantment with Shakespeare-the-great-writer but also that of her peers, which was
            expressed less directly in words but perceivable through the images they included or
            failed to include in their wikis. Despite the depth and reflective range of
            historiographical textual interpretations, the limited range of the pictures suggests
            that the students were taking a somewhat different approach to visual presentation. The
              <q>nobility</q> group chose to include pictures of Elizabeth II’s bejeweled crowns and
            lush nineteenth- and early twentieth-century paintings such as John Waterhouse’s <title
              rend="italic">Miranda</title> (1916), works that were visually pleasing but ultimately
            did not support their textual analysis of what they saw as playwright’s struggle to
            appease the crown (see <ref target="#figure06">Figure 6</ref>). Many groups chose to
            include movie posters of contemporary adaptations such as <title rend="quotes">She’s the
              Man</title> (2006) and <title rend="quotes">10 Things I Hate About You</title> (1999),
            both of which fail to illustrate their historically-based arguments and speak instead to
            the sustained and general interest in Shakespeare’s works today. Ideally, students would
            engage with both text and image to develop more accurate representations of each
            identity, but visually, the result of the final wikis is one of topical disconnection
            and, to our surprise, sometimes degradation. The first page of the wiki dedicated to
            women was, at the last moment, emended with a the cartoonish representation of
            Shakespeare under which one student in the group added the comment <q>Yes, he was just that sexy,</q> a superfluous if not comical
            remark given as if the student recognized that the image of the male author
            misrepresented their topic and even devalued the analytic work therein (see <ref
              target="#figure07">Figure 7</ref>).</p>

          <p>The disconnect between text and image presented us with an unexpected and interesting
            dilemma. Our initial reaction was that many groups had fallen into the trap of
            emphasizing style over substance. Many English majors have primarily been trained in
            textual rather than visual analysis, which is still an emerging area of English studies.
            Our students were both negotiating this new technology and struggling to define an
            appropriate audience for the work they were creating. For many, the Internet is
            primarily a place to engage in social interaction and the consumption of popular
            culture, a place to converse with peers rather than serious researchers with whom they
            may not yet feel authorized to speak. Notably, most pictures were situated throughout
            the pages in the upper halves of each field, or used as dividers between topic sections,
            those places where a viewer would immediately encounter new written analysis and might
            expect, magazine-style, an image to <q>hook</q> their interest. If, as John Zuern
            suggests, <quote rend="inline" source="#zuern2004">[t]he most complicated and
              ultimately most productive aspect of the transition from word to image in teaching is
              the capacity of images to do more than simply restate verbal messages, to resist, in
              fact, any mere repetition of the verbal statement,</quote> then the images the
            students chose resisted the socio-political analysis and the historical temporality in
            which they were urged to engage <ptr target="#zuern2004" loc="51"/>. For the students’
            imagined audience, images suggestive of a nostalgic sense of heraldry, love-lorn young
            heroines, and contemporary Hollywood actors, instead of being mere decoration, had the
            power to attract potential readers by maintaining some of the sentiment of which
            Shakespeare is popularly accredited with.</p>

        <div>
          <head>New Gaps in Historical Narratives</head>
          <p>Overall, the project offered students a closer view of Shakespeare’s plays as
            historical material broadly conceived. Characters in the plays were not cordoned off as
            timeless inspirational entities, but instead, became figures that required a special
            kind of consideration grounded in the playwright’s historical moment. This primary goal
            achieved, new kinds of critique was elicited by students who, in seeking ways to
            conceptualize characters as a group and for the public internet, were made savvy of some
            of the pitfalls of <q>doing</q> history. Mid-point in the semester, several students
            realized that the specific kind of history required by the instructor was only one of
            many historical narratives available to explore. One student in the <q>supernatural</q>
            group found her intellectual enthusiasm reined-in by her group: <q>In looking at the witches and witchcraft and mostly <title rend="italic"
                >Macbeth</title>, I realized that I could go off in many directions such as [animal]
              familiars and food. My group had to keep me on target. They let me know that what you
              were looking for was a more socio-historical view of the plays.</q> The editing
            record of this student’s work shows that this conversation occurred early on in the
            semester as she set up fields for these areas to fill in over a weekend, but later in
            the week she had shifted her interest to conform to both group and instructor
            expectation. Admittedly, she was limited by her group missing the creative component of
            doing a socio-political history that <emph>included</emph> food and animal relations,
            but in trying to maintain the integrity of the project, members of this group noted that
            the instructor valued certain historical narratives above others, that she was invested
            in certain questions that would force students to collect and make sense of data in a
            way that would inform certain readings. Some students also picked up on the way the
            project reified intellectual divisions in the same way specialties are developed in and
            supported by the academy. One savvy young woman commented, <q>I know a ton of information about the serving class and can talk more
              concretely than anyone about Malvolio’s expected role, but not so much about other
              areas of interest. I think that this was a good project to help us understand
              Shakespeare’s works, but it does limit us to only being experts on one aspect of his
              works.</q>
          </p>
          <p>The point made by this student is representative of an issue that recurred in many
            final reaction papers; namely that, while the wikis provided students an interactive
            outlet through which they could explore characters and themes that would not have been
            part of regular lectures, there wasn’t enough time to explore wikis other than their
            own. In the end, even though the wikis helped fill in some of the gaps that naturally
            occur in any class, the students didn’t get to experience the full benefit of their
            work. The primary reason seems to be that they were so focused on building their own
            wikis that there was very little time for crossover or interaction between groups. This
            may be because they developed a sense of subject specialization described above, or
            because they felt a natural attachment to their own work. In any case, the nature of the
            research inadvertently enforced subject-specific boundaries while crossing the
            disciplinary limits of literature, history, and information studies. This replicated, in
            a smaller single-classroom form, the larger enterprise of university research, wherein
              <quote rend="inline" source="#radway2004">distinct precincts of the world</quote> become <cit>
              <quote rend="inline" source="#radway2004">scrutinized by a small group of specialists
                reading and writing principally for each other</quote>
              <ptr target="#radway2004" loc="205"/>
            </cit>. It is worth noting, however, that students continued to visit the wikis on a
            fairly regular basis after the semester was over, and in some cases they continued to
            update them even after final grades had been submitted. This continued involvement
            demonstrates how, even though many students fell into the trap of subject
            specialization, they nevertheless felt a great sense of ownership of their work and that
            wikis, in turn, have the potential to extend the life of a project beyond a single class
            or semester.</p>

          coerced students to contend with challenges inherent in postmodern knowledge production.
          This project, with its requirements to link image with text, illustrated how Shakespeare
          always comes pre-packaged as a cultural icon before students enter our classrooms.
          Further, it provided students the opportunity to appreciate Shakespeare through his works
          as a uniquely talented but, like ourselves, politically and socially invested human being.
          Students also recognized gaps inherent in knowledge acquisition when solely depending upon
          their professors as authorities. By recognizing these gaps, they were encouraged to
          explore both primary and secondary resources, text and image, in an attempt to challenge
          established interpretations of these works and make new connections — a potentially
          overwhelming task given the unwieldy nature of Shakespeare studies. As a result, our
          students grappled not only with issues related to historical and literary interpretation,
          but also with the breadth and scope of what they could hope to achieve in one semester.
          Our response was to emphasized quality over completeness and to encourage students to
          rethink their approaches to research and to become more savvy users of information. After
          some initial anxiety, we found that they were, in fact, using a relatively high level of
          resources, especially when compared to other previously cited studies. For example, while
          the average number of citations in our project is on par with the Davis and Cohen study
          (12.3 per wiki to their final result of 11.9 per paper in 1999), the ratio of scholarly
          materials used (books and articles) in each project was much different. While David and
          Cohen saw a decline from 30-19% in three years, we recorded a much higher 43% of total
          citations from books and 22% from articles for a combined total of 65%. After weeding out
          books and articles that were from popular or otherwise <q>non-scholarly</q> publishers, we
          were left with 48% from scholarly books and articles. Additionally, nine out of the twelve
          groups consulted primary sources for a total number of thirteen citations among those nine
          groups. We included these in the <q>scholarly</q> category primarily because they
          demonstrated proficiency using an academic database (EEBO). Along with a few academic web
          citations, this brought our final scholarly/non-scholarly total to 59/41% (see appendix 2
          for a complete breakdown of the citations).</p>
        <p>Our scholarly/non-scholarly ratio is much lower than in the Robinson and Schlegl study,
          which achieved 86% using the <q>instruction + penalty</q> method that we previously argued
          against. It is also worth noting that, while we were happy with the results of the catalog
          and database searches, those results didn’t transfer to the quality of online searches.
          24.5% of all citations were from the Internet, which averages to about three web citations
          per wiki. This number is not overwhelming, especially considering we were working in an
          online medium, but relatively few of these citations were academic (only four out of 36
          total). Although this is clearly an area to improve upon in future classes, we believe the
          results are significant enough to support our assertion about the value of integrated
          library instruction — that by making discussion about research methodology part of the
          general discourse throughout the semester, students would become comfortable enough with
          the library catalog and databases to use them at a higher rate than we have seen in
          previous studies.</p>
        <p>Another area to be dealt with is the problem of subject specialization described above.
          This problem posed a challenge to one of our key hypotheses: that employing open source
          technology would assuage some of the gaps we experience in trying to provide enough period
          coverage while also attending to theoretical apparatus and students’ experience of
          meaningful connections to material. Collectively, the project did start to accomplish this
          task. However, as stated above, because they were so focused on their own creations, there
          wasn’t sufficient time for extensive crossover and exploration. One possible explanation
          for this trend might be that the groups striving for too much coverage, thereby resulting
          in entries that were often too general or uneven. In fact, many students asked about what
          we thought the wikis should look like and how long they should be, always striving, it
          seemed, for a sense of finalization or <term>fixity</term> described by Ingrid Mason who,
          again, asserts that there is a distinct connection between the notions of
            <term>stability</term> and <term>authenticity</term>
          <ptr target="#mason2007" loc="202"/>.</p>
        <p>It would be possible for a wiki, or a community of wiki users, to strive toward a
          finalized authoritative <q>edition,</q> but, as Schroeder and den Besten point out in
          their analysis of the Thomas Pynchon <title rend="italic">Against the Day</title> wiki,
          these projects seem to have more value when they <cit>
            <quote rend="inline" source="#schroeder2008">adopt a more playful approach which treats
              texts as having endless scope for further work</quote>
            <ptr target="#schroeder2008" loc="183"/>
          </cit>. They further add that wikis promote <quote rend="inline" source="#schroeder2008"
            >competition to complete the task</quote> which, they say, would not occur if the wiki
          entries were organized alphabetically or by topic as in a traditional scholarly
          bibliography <ptr target="#schroeder2008" loc="184"/>. The unevenness of the entries, and
          the open-ended nature of the medium, expose gaps in knowledge and encourage users to fill
          in those gaps and make new associations. Wikis seem to be most effective, then, in
          projects that rely on interpretive rather than purely informative entries and <cit>
            <quote rend="inline" source="#schroeder2008">where endless detective work is called for,
              and this may apply to other areas of e-research or online collaborations</quote>
            <ptr target="#schroeder2008" loc="184"/>
          </cit>. The concerns our students had about completeness, and the affect this had on our
          project, points to an issue that is common among undergraduate researchers: an approach
          that focuses on compiling citations from recognized authorities as opposed to genuine
          interaction and discourse with those well-establish ideas. Texts and interpretations are
          often seen as being authoritative and not sources in which to locate difference and expose
          gaps in knowledge. Projects that employ open source technology, such as the one described
          here, have the capacity to release texts from what often seems like interpretive closure
          and, in so doing, they can reopen the seeming finality of printed materials as well as
          historical narratives.</p>
