                <p>The article investigates the continued importance of keywords in digital humanities and especially their relation to recent machine-learning approaches. Different research practices related to digital humanities agree on the importance of keywords to present issues and/or provide the baseline for new stories about the past, about literature or media. Keywords are useful to target ideas that have no clear definitions and productive in describing contested categorisations that are key to humanities scholarship. At the same time, keywords are often employed used without considering specific contexts and how they are generated. To understand the diversity of keywords in digital humanities, we consider three approaches to computationally generating keywords, from traditional and established ones to state-of-the-art language modelling. With these three approaches, we analyse a case where keywords should be especially powerful, as underlying considerations are uncertain. We cover the relation between security, human-rights and freedom according to discussions in United Nations documents. Finally, we present a number of approaches to productively use keywords to tell a different story about the relation of security and freedom according to UN discussions.</p>

                <head>1. Introduction –Keywords Methods in the Digital Humanities</head>
                <p>Keywords have become essential instruments in the digital humanities, bridging
                    the gap between algorithmic processing and human interpretation. Yet, the
                    methods by which these words are identified and the assumptions behind their
                    significance demand closer scrutiny. Far from being neutral markers, keywords
                    are the product of specific methodological and interpretative choices that shape
                    how texts are understood, categorized, and discussed. A <term>keyword</term> is
                    not an intrinsic property of a text, but a term that has been assigned a special
                    status as a clue to the text's significance. </p>
                <p>Words are always present in a text, but we produce <term>keywords</term> through
                    our methods of selecting and analysing them. This practice has a long history
                    with many inflections in the digital humanities, from metadata for discovery
                    (e.g. keyword search) to the focus of this article: methods that computationally
                    identify words as being especially significant for determining a text’s overall
                    meaning, genre or classification. The central question of this article is not
                    about finding keywords but interrogating the methodological choices we make to
                    select certain words and treat them as keywords. This paper argues that
                    computationally-generated keywords should not be treated as objective indicators
                    of textual meaning, but as interpretive tools.</p>
                <p>Using computational methods to navigate complex texts is a by now a
                    well-established approach in the digital humanities <ptr target="#jockers_2015"
                    />. Ted Underwood has shown how text mining can reveal literature genre not as a
                    fixed category but as a <quote rend="inline">set of relations between
                        works</quote>
                    <ptr target="#underwood_2019" loc="41"/>. Machine learning can be attractive to
                    humanities as it helps describe cultural things as heterogeneous, their
                    descriptions as <q>blurry</q> and their distinctions as <q>brittle</q>
                    Similarly, Richard Jean So employs predictive analytics to deconstruct racial
                    inequality in postwar fiction, using computation as an engine to challenge
                    certainty rather than create it <ptr target="#so_2020"/>. He is interested in
                    categories that are not <q>ontologically coherent</q> and uses a range of
                        <q>textual features</q> like narration style or lexical density as inputs to
                    his models. In our own work, machine learning has been employed to decode
                    categories that escape clear definitions. We worked on leadership in a political
                    scientific organisation <ptr target="#blanke_2024"/>.</p>
                <p>While computational methods can identify complex patterns that might be missed
                    otherwise, we still need a way to interpret the results. For digital humanities,
                    this interpretation is overwhelmingly mediated by designating certain words or
                    phrases as significant. We can see this interpretative bridge in action in
                    Underwood’s work. To understand a model that predicts a book's success, he
                    translates its statistical logic into a human-readable narrative. He does this
                    by highlighting the words the model has weighted most heavily, treating them as
                    keywords that signal the model's reading of a text. He writes that the model
                    favours <quote rend="inline">dreams and death... cold, but not hot; fear, but
                        not joy</quote>
                    <ptr target="#underwood_2019" loc="83"/>. The work of the digital humanist,
                    then, is to weave a narrative from the words a machine has been trained to
                    prioritize. </p>
                <p><ptr target="#so_2020"/> performs similar acts of translation when he discusses
                    the outputs of models by focusing on what he calls <term>signals</term>, which
                    are words or textual features his models identify as highly predictive. He
                    explains: <quote rend="inline">If we skim the words that tend to appear in
                        bestsellers [...], a signal arises: <q>divorced</q>, <q>airport</q>, and
                            <q>hour</q>.</quote> He then interprets these signals: <quote
                        rend="inline"><q>divorced</q> supports the claim that bestsellers turned
                        toward stories of private life...; <q>airport</q> echoes the argument that
                        bestsellers were chiefly interested in postwar affluence</quote>
                    <ptr target="#so_2020" loc="123–124"/>. For both scholars, the computational
                    process identifies statistically important words, and the researcher then uses
                    these words as keywords or <term>signals</term> to build their argument.</p>
                <p>This practice of designating words as analytically significant also extends to
                    the digital methods of Internet Studies. Scholars like Richard Rogers focus on
                    methodologies <q>native</q> to the web to study society <ptr
                        target="#rogers_2013"/> and not cultural heritage as Underwood and So. For
                    Rogers, an Internet search ranking does not only reflect information relevance
                    but also societal importance. Scraping Google-news search results allows
                    researchers to understand attention and airtime given to, for example,
                    climate-change sceptics. Keywords as indicators of significance and keys to
                    further computation are a central component of these <quote rend="inline"
                        >methods of the medium</quote> and appear repeatedly in Roger’s book <title
                        rend="italic">Digital Methods</title>to trace <quote rend="inline"
                        >partisanship and issue resonance</quote> online <ptr target="#rogers_2013"
                        loc="113"/>. <ptr target="#burgess_2016"/> are a typical example inspired by
                    keywords as Internet research methods. They explicitly build their analysis by
                    treating the word <q>gamergate</q> as their keyword to define their dataset of
                    Tweets, a conscious methodological choice. They decide which word to treat as a
                    keyword to structure the inquiry.</p>
                <p>Beyond digital humanities and new media research, the practice of designating
                    certain words as analytical lenses has a rich intellectual history in cultural
                    analysis, most famously articulated by the cultural theorist Raymond Williams
                        <ptr target="#williams_1976"/>. Williams deliberately selected a vocabulary
                    of words, his keywords, not to resolve their meanings, but to use them as prisms
                    through which to view cultural debates and controversies. Since then, we have
                    seen many adaptations of keywords for the critical study of (digital) cultures
                        <ptr target="#bennett_2013"/>
                    <ptr target="#striphas_2015"/>
                    <ptr target="#peters_2016"/>
                    <ptr target="#ai-now_2021"/>
                    <ptr target="#thylstrup_2021"/>. While Williams's selection was manual and
                    interpretive, and ours is computational and automated, the underlying principle
                    is the same: Both approaches treat certain words as having a special status for
                    analysing cultural phenomena that resist easy definition.</p>
                <p>This transition from interpretive concept to computational datum carries profound
                    consequences for both research methodology and the nature of textual analysis
                    itself. The significance of keywords is amplified in the digital era, because
                    their very function has been transformed. Once a concept for human-led
                    qualitative analysis, keywords are now systematically operationalized by
                    computational methods. The opportunities for using them as special kinds of maps
                    have therefore changed. This article examines computational production of
                    keywords for the digital humanities and the productive role they could play in
                    both analysing text computationally as well as further interpreting
                    computational results.</p>
                <p>Thus, we understand <term>keywords</term> not as pre-existing entities but as an
                    analytical construct. This construct serves a dual purpose: First, it is the
                    output of a method for condensing texts and identifying their most statistically
                    salient features. Second, it serves as the input for interpretation, allowing
                    researchers to integrate computational findings into their own narratives.
                    Perhaps their most important function has not changed since Raymond Williams
                    described his own project as a <quote rend="inline">special kind of map</quote>
                    <ptr target="#williams_1963" loc="XI"/>. While his selection was manual and ours
                    is computational, the underlying principle holds: Designating certain words as
                    analytically significant is a way of drawing an interpretive map of complex
                    cultural relations. Our research investigates how different cultural map-making
                    tools produce different kinds of maps.</p>
                <p>While the practice of using keywords to interpret computational results is
                    widespread, the analytical consequences of how we generate them are less
                    understood. This paper moves beyond the general claim that keywords are
                    important and instead poses a more targeted set of questions:</p>
                <list type="ordered">
                    <item>How do different computational methods construct the <term>keyword</term>
                        differently?</item>
                    <item>What are the analytical trade-offs between these methods in terms of
                        interpretability, semantic nuance, and conceptual bias?</item>
                    <item>How can we understand computationally generated <term>keywords</term> as
                        map-making techniques of cultural phenomena?</item>
                </list>
                <p>This paper presents a computational investigation designed to answer these
                    questions. We study how three different methods for identifying keywords produce
                    different analytical lenses: TF-IDF, KeyBERT, and a custom attention model.
                    TF-IDF offers a simple, interpretable baseline; KeyBERT leverages pre-trained
                    language models for semantic understanding; and the custom attention model
                    provides a more transparent deep-learning approach, enabling closer scrutiny of
                    keyword relevance.</p>
                <p>We explore the impact of these three keyword lenses on a complex, high-stakes
                    case. In the next section, we introduce the historical and contradictory
                    relationship between security and freedom as one such complex cultural terrain
                    that can benefit from a comparative analysis of these map-making techniques. Our
                    choice of a collection for this experiment is not arbitrary. We require a domain
                    where the concepts are ambiguous, contested and politically charged, to
                    understand the power of keywords and the epistemic and social importance of
                    selecting the right ones. For this reason, we focus on the historical debates
                    surrounding <q>security</q> and <q>freedom</q> in the United Nations General
                    Assembly. Both security and freedom are core concepts in political discourses
                    whose meanings are constantly negotiated and thus well suited for a keyword
                    analysis. Furthermore, the distinction between them is often semantically blurry
                    and historically contingent. Finally, the way these terms are defined and
                    prioritized has real-world consequences. This case allows us to move from a
                    technical comparison of tools to a critical assessment of how our methodological
                    choices can shape our understanding of history. By analysing how each method
                    frames the relationship between freedom and security, we can see directly how
                    the choice of a keyword-generation technique influences the stories we can
                    tell.</p>

                <head>2. A Special Kind of Map of Freedom and Security</head>
                <p>In this section, we delve into the discursive history of security and freedom as
                    debated within the United Nations General Assembly. These terms are not static
                    ideals but cornerstone principles of political life, perpetually in flux as
                    their meanings are negotiated and redefined. This inherent dynamism makes their
                    evolution a particularly fertile ground for a (computational) keyword analysis,
                    revealing shifts in international priorities and power. The distinction between
                    security on the one hand and freedom and rights on the other has been a key
                    debate in culture and society where it is difficult to determine clear
                    boundaries. Both terms are themselves not easy to define and make for even more
                    conceptual difficulties when brought together. <ptr target="#hobbes_2017"/> is
                    often cited for a tradition of thought that wants security first and at high
                    cost. In his political world, we give up individual freedoms to achieve security
                    for all. His is a freedom from fear and not the freedom to do something. This
                    kind of freedom, where security comes first, has since been strongly criticized
                    as fundamentally lacking and reducing the human experience. Freedom has also
                    been defended in its full experience in Hannah Arendt’s work. For her, there is
                    no compromising: <quote rend="inline">Men can only be free with reference to one
                        another, only, that is, in the fields of politics and of the things they do;
                        it is only in these spheres that they come to realize that freedom is
                        something positive</quote>
                    <ptr target="#arendt_1961" loc="191"/>. As freedom is linked to the fact of
                    being in a political community, Arendt has introduced the human <quote
                        rend="inline">right to have rights</quote> (for a discussion see <ptr
                        target="#oman_2010"/>).</p>
                <p>Despite such high-profile contributions, we are still no closer to resolving the
                    relation of freedom and security, which makes it attractive for a
                    machine-learned keyword analysis. The sociologist Zygmunt Bauman sees no resolve
                    for the tension between freedom and security: <quote rend="inline">[W]e cannot
                        be human without both security and freedom; but we cannot have both at the
                        same time and both in quantities that we find fully satisfactory</quote>
                    <ptr target="#bauman_2000" loc="5"/>(. The current debate on freedom and
                    security is hardly ever as radical as Hobbes and is happy to state that tensions
                    cannot be resolved. With machine learning, we can work out these tensions using
                    public discussions about freedom and security. In a computational version of
                    Williams’s special kind of map, keywords will help us describe the key ideas of
                    freedom and security without having to fix them. </p>
                <p>A favourite metaphor of politicians is to <q>balance</q> security and freedom in
                    the work on rights for their citizens. A former UK prime minister once put this
                    at the centre of a new Bill of Rights <ptr target="#cameron_2006"/>. According
                    to critical security studies scholar Didier Bigo who investigated the language
                    used to justify the Global War on Terror, this kind of language is the <quote
                        rend="inline">way to diminish the value of freedom […] The balance metaphor
                        masks the imbalance that exists between the two dimensions and silences the
                        capacity of political judgement</quote>
                    <ptr target="#bigo_2011" loc="398"/>. He observes that there are many different
                    words and languages of freedom, as it is reduced to individual levels. Freedom
                    becomes fragmented while security becomes the global unified goal of safety and
                    protection. </p>
                <p>As freedom and security and their relations escape a clear definition, keywords
                    provide a way to outline their semantic complications and historical debates. To
                    describe freedom and security relations through keywords, we rely on how they
                    are talked about in political debates. What are their associations and how do
                    these change over time? We have decided to focus on the discussions on political
                    freedom and security within an international organisation that has been founded
                    to provide global security after the Second World War and enable the global
                    developments of rights and freedom. The newly established United Nations adopted
                    the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR) in 1948, to protect the rights
                    of all individuals around the world. Amnesty International thus calls it a
                        <quote rend="inline">global road map for freedom and equality</quote>
                    <ptr target="#amnesty_2023"/>. The UDHR manifests for the first time that all
                    people deserve to live freely. It contains thirty rights and freedoms that all
                    humans have, which include freedom of expression and the right to asylum. But
                    the United Nations (UN) assemble are as much about the issue of security, as
                    they are about the issue freedom and rights. The United Nations Charter, the
                    foundational treaty of the United Nations from 1945, is equally committed to
                        <quote rend="inline">further international peace and security</quote> as
                    well as to <quote rend="inline">encourage respect for human rights and for
                        fundamental freedoms for all without distinction as to race, sex, language,
                        or religion</quote>
                    <ptr target="#united-nations_1945"/>. The keyword <q>security</q> dominates the
                    text with over 150 appearances compared to only 6 for <q>freedom.</q>
                </p>
                <p>The UN Charter already mentions the United Nations Security Council (UNSC), which
                    has seen renewed attention through the war in Ukraine. It has almost since its
                    beginnings been criticized for its ineffectiveness, recently criticized even by
                    the UN Secretary General Guterres <ptr target="#bbc_2022"/>. It is, however,
                    still one of the few permanent places where ideas of security are compared and
                    debated internationally. UNSC has five permanent members in China, France,
                    Russia (formerly the Soviet Union), United Kingdom, and the United States as
                    well as several non-permanent members, selected for a period of two years <ptr
                        target="#cfr_2022"/>. It is one of six major organs of the UN and aims to
                    provide international peace and security and friendly international relations.
                    Members of the UN are supposed to carry out the decisions of UNSC, which is the
                    only UN organ that has such direct powers. UNSC can also take direct action to
                    ensure peace by undertaking mediation, through special envoys or dedicated
                    missions.</p>
                <p>To discover the debates on security in the United Nations, we downloaded the UNSC
                    resolutions as PDFs from <ref target="http://unscr.com/en"
                        >http://unscr.com/en</ref>, which offers additional metadata and
                    bibliographic references. The earlier resolutions had to be recreated as JPEG
                    images and then OCR’ed with Tesseract <ptr target="#smith_2007"/>. For future
                    use, we have also downloaded the metadata of the resolutions like related
                    resolutions, cited resolutions, and UNSC composition, although we do not use
                    these in this investigation. In the end, we have a corpus of ~2,600 documents
                    from 1946 until the end of 2021. The first resolution discussed membership in
                    UNSC in 1946, and the last one from 2021, the situation in Libya.</p>
                <p>Whereas UNSC has been a body of the UN from the beginning, stable groupings for
                    monitoring and promoting freedom and rights have followed later. There are also
                    more diverse. To compare the language of security in the UNSC with the UN’s
                    language of rights and freedoms, we have downloaded documents published by the
                    United Nations Human Rights Council (UNHRC) – its predecessor – and related
                    organisations in the same timeframe from 1946 to end 2021. Since its
                    establishment in 2005, UNHRC has aimed to promote and protect human rights, and
                    it is formed by 47 members selected for a term of three years. It has replaced
                    the United Nations Commission on Human Rights (UNCHR) and works closely with the
                    Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR). Like the resolutions,
                    the human-rights documents are PDFs, but they are more varied. The first one in
                    our collection is a yearbook from 1946, while the last one for 2021 is about
                        <title rend="quotes">Promoting accountability in the Democratic People’s
                        Republic of Korea</title> and a report of the United Nations High
                    Commissioner for Human Rights. Whereas the UNSC has been criticized for its
                    ineffectiveness and partisan politics, the UNHRC has been highly controversial
                    at times for including members with a record of human rights abuses. </p>
                <p>Overall, we have downloaded about 2,600 resolutions and about 2,550 human-rights
                    related documents from the UN, which we merged into a common dataset and then
                    removed documents that were either in the bottom 10% quantile or the top 10%
                    quantile of document lengths. We ended up with 4,321 documents in a mixed corpus
                    of UN-documents related to security and human rights. Our corpus contained about
                    11.5 million words with an average of about 2,700 words per document and about
                    380,000 unique tokens. For our further work with keywords, we decided to retain
                    only adjectives, nouns and proper nouns, as these parts of speech are the most
                    semantically informative and relevant for capturing the thematic content of the
                    documents. In the earlier years of the UN, official records frequently included
                    a mix of languages, reflecting its multilingual reporting standard. This led to
                    non-English terms being interspersed throughout the text. To maintain linguistic
                    consistency and improve keyword accuracy, we applied language filtering
                    techniques to exclude non-English words from our analysis. This was particularly
                    important for early documents where parallel translations were often merged in a
                    single source. In later years, however, the UN began releasing separate language
                    versions of documents, allowing us to focus exclusively on the English-language
                    texts for those periods without loss of data fidelity.</p>

                <head>3. Methodologies: A Comparative Approach to Keyword Extraction</head>
                <p>Keywords are foundational to computational analysis in the digital humanities,
                    yet the methods for deriving them are often applied with little critical
                    reflection. To provide more critical reflection for mapping security and
                    freedom, we will compare three distinct methods for keyword extraction: Term
                    Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF), KeyBERT, and a custom attention
                    model. We chose these three specifically because they represent a significant
                    historical path in text analysis, allowing us to examine the trade-offs between
                    traditional statistical approaches, modern pre-trained language models, and more
                    interpretable <q>white-box</q> deep-learning techniques. To explain our
                    rationale, we will first discuss each method, situating it in relation to the
                    broader evolution of these technologies before detailing our specific
                    implementation.</p>
                <p>Our first method, TF-IDF, is a classic and highly influential statistical
                    approach. It is our baseline and builds on the work of <ptr target="#luhn_1957"
                    />, who assumed that a word's frequency (Term Frequency (TF)) correlates with
                    its importance to a document. To offset the prominence of common words (like
                        <q>the</q> or <q>and</q>), <ptr target="#jones_1972"/> introduced Inverse
                    Document Frequency (IDF), which measures a term's specificity by penalizing
                    words that appear in many documents across a collection. The combination,
                    TF-IDF, remains a reliable and widely used baseline in text processing. In the
                    digital humanities research cited earlier, term frequencies are a dominant
                    method, but the IDF component is generally ignored. By employing the full TF-IDF
                    in our experiments, we establish a robust, interpretable baseline that accounts
                    for both term frequency within a document and term specificity across our entire
                    corpus. In terms of TF-IDF, keywords are those words that have a high TF-IDF
                    value based on a pre-defined cut-off value. They are thus keywords within the
                    context of a document and the collection the document is part of. </p>
                <p>Our second method is based on the paradigm shift in text analysis with the rise
                    of language and foundation models. Unlike TF-IDF, which treats words as
                    independent units, these models learn from the sequence and context of words,
                    capturing semantic relationships. This is achieved through transfer learning,
                    where a model pre-trained on a massive text corpus can transfer its general
                        <q>knowledge</q> of language to a specific task, such as keyword extraction. </p>
                <p>For our second method, we use KeyBERT <ptr target="#grootendorst_2022"/>, a
                    state-of-the-art tool that leverages transfer learning. KeyBERT works by
                    creating vector representations (embeddings) for the document and for candidate
                    keywords using the <ptr target="#devlin_2019"/>. The candidates whose vectors
                    are most similar to the document's overall meaning are selected as keywords.
                    This allows KeyBERT to find keywords that reflect the context and semantics of
                    the text, rather than just relying on frequency. Again, a cut-off value
                    determines which words become keywords. A limitation, however, is that this
                    process does not inherently relate keywords to a broader collection. To mitigate
                    this and enable a better comparison with TF-IDF, we implement a two-step
                        <q>guided KeyBERT</q> process. First, we run KeyBERT on the entire human
                    rights and security collections to generate a smaller master list of salient
                    keywords for each domain. Second, we use this list to <q>seed</q> the keyword
                    extraction for each individual document, ensuring the resulting keywords are
                    relevant not only to the document itself but also to its parent collection.</p>
                <p>While powerful, foundation models like BERT are often criticized for their
                        <q>black-box</q> nature; they provide results, but the internal processing
                    is opaque <ptr target="#dobson_2020"/>. To gain a better understanding of how a
                    model determines importance, our third method deconstructs the language model
                    and focuses on its core component: the attention mechanism. At the centre of the
                    seminal paper <quote rend="inline">Attention is all you need</quote> that
                    introduces Transformers <ptr target="#vaswani_2017"/>, this mechanism allows a
                    model to weigh the importance of different words in a sequence when performing a
                    task. </p>
                <p>Specifically, we use a Hierarchical Attention Network (HAN) <ptr
                        target="#yang_2016"/> to determine whether a document belongs to the
                        <q>security</q> or <q>human rights</q> collection. During training, the
                    attention mechanism learns to assign high weights to the words most decisive for
                    making the correct classification of security- or human rights-related. Instead
                    of treating every word equally, attention gives more weight to the words that
                    are more relevant to the task. For example, suppose we want to classify the
                    sentence, <quote rend="inline">The persecuted population is in danger</quote> as
                    related to freedom or security. The model learns to give higher attention to
                    words like <q>persecuted</q> and <q>danger</q>, because those strongly indicate
                    security problems, while giving less attention to filler words like <q>is</q> or
                        <q>the.</q> By focusing on the most important words, attention helps the
                    model get the classification more often right and even helps humans understand
                    why the model made a certain decision. But researchers have debated whether
                    attention weights really tell us how the model is doing <ptr target="#jain_2019"/>
                    <ptr target="#wiegreffe_2019"/>. Our experiments will investigate this for
                    digital humanities.</p>
                <p>Attention is our third way of identifying the most discriminating keywords in
                    comparison to the other two methods which are based on document and collection
                    contexts. While we implemented this model ourselves, we built upon publicly
                    available code repositories for core components. We use a bidirectional Gated
                    Recurrent Network (GRU) to capture word context from both directions. On <title
                        rend="quotes">Papers with Code</title>, HANs still rank number 4 for
                    document classification tasks and are surpassed only by models that employ
                    foundation language models, which is something we explicitly do not want to do
                    because we are interested in deconstructing the work of language models <ptr
                        target="#papers-with-code_2023"/>.</p>
                <p>Using these three distinct methods, a statistical baseline (TF-IDF), a
                    state-of-the-art pre-trained model (KeyBERT), and a purpose-built interpretable
                    deep learning model (attention), we will generate three different sets of
                    keywords for our corpora. In Section 5, we will analyse and compare these sets
                    to understand how each method's architectural biases shape its conception of
                        <q>important</q> terms. Subsequently, in Sections 6 and 7, we will use these
                    computed keywords to analyse historical trends in security and freedom debates

                <p>The differences in outputs illustrate the core logic of each method. TF-IDF
                    operates on a purely statistical principle of rarity. It has no semantic
                    understanding and elevates words that are infrequent across the entire UN
                    corpus. This leads to highlighting rare terms without semantic understanding and
                    elevating OCR errors (e.g., <q>wy</q>, <q>sie</q>) and unusual words
                        (<q>magnificent</q>, <q>happy</q>) in Table 2. In Table 3, Admiral Chester
                    W. Nimitz's first name, Chester, is rare across the collection, granting it a
                    high inverted document frequency. While Chester can be found in an English
                    dictionary, the name Nimitz has been filtered out because it does not appear
                    there. TF-IDF finds what is syntactically surprising, not necessarily what is
                    thematically important.</p>
                <p>KeyBERT is semantic, because it uses embeddings to capture a document’s overall
                    meaning, producing thematic keywords like <q>malawi</q>, <q>reforms</q>, and
                        <q>humanitarian</q> in Table 2. This works well for summaries but can miss
                    specific details, such as the cease-fire line in the India-Pakistan resolution
                    (Table 3), because it favours the general idea. This is a specific detail that
                    is crucial to the conflict but may be less representative of the document's
                    overall diplomatic language.</p>
                <p>Attention models finally are task-specific and emphasize discriminative terms
                    that best predict a document’s status. Its keywords are not necessarily rare or
                    thematic, but discriminative. This explains the prevalence of specific place
                    names in Table 2 like <q>birmingham</q> and <q>belfast</q>, or event-specific
                    words like <q>veterans</q> and <q>charged</q>. For the UNSC Resolution in Table
                    3, identifying line is especially relevant, since <q>cease-fire line</q>
                    distinguishes security-related documents. The trade-off is that attention
                    keywords might yield fragmented, event-specific signals rather than cohesive
                    summaries.</p>
                <p><q>Treasurer</q> is the only keyword all three methods identify, which suggests
                    that it is structural term. It is common enough for KeyBERT, rare enough for
                    TF-IDF and distinctive enough for the attention model. Nevertheless, we were
                    surprized to not find more common terms. In summary, all three methods differ
                    strongly in what they consider to be significant keywords, which emphasizes the
                    need for more critical reflection about which method we choose. TF-IDF tends to
                    overfocus both for the overall summary of the collection as well as specific
                    documents, while KeyBERT provides a good summary but can miss out on specifics.
                    The attention model is better at identifying relevant specifics. Next, we use
                    keywords first to develop a relational view on freedom and security and then to
                    afterwards retell historical stories with keywords through clustering and topic
                    models.</p>

                <p>Predictive analytics can be used to deconstruct ontological assumptions by
                    developing a relational view between its inputs and outputs <ptr
                        target="#blanke_2018"/>. In this section, predictive analytics helps us
                    develop a relational view of the ideas of security and human rights,
                    respectively. To this end, we have created a simple decision-tree algorithm to
                    predict whether a document is about human rights or security. Decision trees are
                    used as a tried-and-tested method for classification and are interpretable <ptr
                        target="#rudin_2019"/>. They learn simple decision rules based on the
                    features of the data, which we will define as the keywords. Based on the
                    features, the data is divided into branches of a tree where the outcomes of the
                    predictions can be found in the bottom leaf nodes. In our case, we employed
                        <q>Gini impurity,</q> which evaluates possible splits of a tree into
                    branches in terms of how <q>impurely</q> each feature/keyword would divide the
                    data at a certain split. The split happens for the feature with the lowest
                    Gini-value. </p>
                <p>In our first set of experiments, we first selected the top 500 keywords for
                    TF-IDF, BERT and attention. We then created three different tokenized versions
                    of the collection, one each for the top 500 keywords of TF-IDF, BERT and
                    attention. Finally, we ran three decision trees, one per method, to predict
                    whether a document is a security or human-rights related one. </p>

                </figure>
                <p>Despite limiting the information to 500 keywords, we have achieved a very good
                    87% accuracy for the TF-IDF corpus with an out-of-bag test collection of
                    documents (see Figure 1). This shows the power of this simple, tried-and-tested
                    method. But the model was slightly overfitting with 92% accuracy for the
                    training collection and 91% accuracy when we ran the model on the whole
                    collection. The model seems to struggle more with the human-rights documents.
                    For the whole collection, 329 were misclassified as security-related with only
                    112 security documents wrongly assigned as human-rights related. That means that
                    over 10% of the human-rights documents are missed. Overall, we are still
                    surprized by such good results, given that the overall corpus contained over
                    252,000 features. It shows the power of simple, tried-and-tested analytics.</p>

                    expectations by far (see Figure 2). With the out-of-bag test collection, we have
                    reached an outstanding 98% accuracy with our simple decision tree. There is no
                    notable difference in the model’s ability to relate a document to either
                    security or human rights. For the whole collection, only 4 human-rights related
                    documents are misidentified and 7 security-related ones. </p>

                </figure>

                <p>The results are a little more mixed for the attention-based keywords in Figure 3.
                    Overall, we have also achieved near perfect performance with only 10 documents
                    missed in the total collection, which is about the same as for KeyBERT. However,
                    out of these, 8 human-rights-related documents are wrongly classified, while 2
                    security-related ones are also misclassified.</p>
                <p>Looking at the missed predictions for KeyBERT and attention, it is first of all
                    interesting that none of the documents missed by attention have also been
                    misclassified by KeyBERT and vice versa. On further inspection, the attention
                    model has done better than the initial numbers suggest. Seven of the eight
                    misclassified human-rights-related documents are almost entirely illegible due
                    to OCR and other character-translation issues. The remaining misclassified one
                    is for some reason truncated. The attention model has shown the limitations of
                    our own attempts to clean the collection and demonstrates how hard it is to
                    operate at scale across such an international, complex set of historical
                    documents. The two misclassified UNSC-resolutions on the other hand, are very
                    close to the corpus of human rights. Resolution 876 (S/RES/876) from 1993 deals
                    with the human rights violations in Georgia and humanitarian assistance.
                    Resolution 568 (S/RES/568) from 1985 covers sanctioning the South African
                    apartheid regime and dealing with refugees. The errors demonstrate how close the
                    work across the UN can be.</p>
                <p>The misclassifications with KeyBERT’s keywords confirm this close relationship
                    between the UN bodies. For instance, it believes wrongly that the <title
                        rend="quotes">Report of the Secretary General on the human rights in the
                        occupied Syrian Golan</title> (A/HRC/22/36) from 2012 to be about security,
                    which is not surprising given that it deals with the direct resolution of the
                    occupation of foreign territory by the Israeli military. UNSC resolution 1293
                    (S/RES/1293) is seen as about human rights, because it covers money in Iraq that
                    can be used to improve local economic infrastructure. KeyBERT, however, does not
                    pick up on any of the documents that are illegible, as it only picks up
                    particular words and not their context.</p>
                <p>In the future, we need to think about better methods to filter out problematic
                    documents before we start our computational analysis. Nevertheless, both KeyBERT
                    and the attention model perform well in detecting the often not well-defined
                    distinction between human-rights and security language at the UN. They both also
                    demonstrate – particularly through their misclassifications and other prediction
                    struggles – how hard it is to separate out the ideas of freedom and security in
                    the first place, supporting a relational view of both.</p>

                <head>6. Keyword Stories</head>
                <p>In this section, we want to turn the task of keywords around from identifying to
                    employing them for in-depth historical and semantic analysis. For our final
                    experiment, we want to find out what kind of keywords describe common issues
                    that could define research narratives about the relation of freedom and
                    security. How can we improve approaches by researchers to narrate the results of
                    their modelling by combining keywords into narratives? To this end, we have
                    chosen the attention model’s keywords and two types of clustering in order to
                    describe their joined appearance in human-rights and security documents. First,
                    we create with the attention-model’s keywords a simple frequency matrix for all
                    the documents, which we have normalized with a z-score to provide an input
                    matrix to the clustering.</p>
                <p>Mean-shift clustering <ptr target="#wu_2007"/> is our first method for this part.
                    First, it calculates the distance between all the data points. Then, weights are
                    added to penalize points further away. The data points are iteratively updated
                    so that they are pushed close to each other. Mean-shift has an important
                    advantage over other better-known clustering variants, as it does not require
                    selecting the number of clusters in advance. Instead, it operates with a
                    parameter called bandwidth, which can be automatically selected. This means we
                    can use mean-shift to examine the diversity of the attention keywords. The
                    larger the number of clusters, the more diverse the keywords.</p>
                <p>For the UNSC resolutions, we have found over 180 clusters, while for the
                    human-rights-related documents there are over 120. This is already interesting,
                    as we would have expected the opposite to be the case as the security documents
                    have been collected from a single source. Furthermore, according to (Bigo 2011),
                    security is supposed to be a more closely defined issue than freedom. But this
                    result should also not surprize us, as we have already seen that the security
                    documents from the UNSC are about a wide range of issues. After all, it is the
                    only UN body that meets regularly for a long time. That it is more diverse in
                    terms of clusters thus rather confirms the insights from critical security
                    studies <ptr target="#bigo_2011"/> that security becomes a unifying element,
                    bringing together diverse political issues. Most of the clusters only consist of
                    one feature and should be seen as outliers, which should not be surprising given
                    that both bodies deal with highly diverse global issues and hard to define ideas
                    of freedom and security.</p>
                <p>Each feature or keyword can also be assigned to one cluster using maximum
                    likelihood. We can thus invert the keyword-generation and go back from the
                    keywords to the documents. For instance, the following attention words are
                    clustered together: <q>previously</q>, <q>form</q>, <q>accordingly</q>,
                        <q>contain</q>, <q>measure</q>, and <q>yes</q>. Together they identify,
                    among others, UNSC resolution 1454 (S/RES/1454) and UNSC resolution 2083
                    (S/RES/2083). Resolution 1454 from 30 December 2002 covers the sovereignty of
                    Kuwait and its relationship to Iraq, while resolution 2083 is about threats to
                    international peace and security caused by terrorist acts. However, these links
                    are generally based on only very few keywords, because the attention-based
                    keywords target specific information.</p>
                <p>Another way of narrating the stories across UN documents using keywords is
                    through topic models, which relate words automatically with each other without
                    relying on existing structures. Topic models offer a way to automatically
                    identify keyword relationships within documents, an approach we have previously
                    shown to be effective <ptr target="#blanke_2017"/>. A common method, Latent
                    Dirichlet Allocation (LDA), assumes each document is a mix of topics, but
                    interpreting these topics can be subjective, like <quote rend="inline">reading
                        tea leaves</quote>
                    <ptr target="#chang_2009"/>. As an alternative, seeded LDA allows researchers to
                    guide the model by providing it with pre-defined <q>seed</q> keywords for
                    certain topics <ptr target="#jagarlamudi_2012"/>. For instance, we could bias
                    the term <q>data</q> toward a specific topic.</p>
                <p>With seeded topic models, we can retell the history in our collection through a
                    visualisation as in Figure 1. To this end, we have divided the top attention
                    keywords into four topics: locations, actions, attributes, and issues. The first
                    covers a range of locations and related activities that have particular
                    importance for attention. The second is about actions or verbs that are
                    stressed, while the attributes topic cluster stands for closer descriptions. The
                    final topic on issues covers discussion areas that the model has paid particular
                    attention to. Each topic consists of seeded attention keywords as well as words
                    the topic model associates with them. Tuning the topic model, we get:</p>

                <p>In Figure 4, we see how locations grow in importance over the years, probably

                    while the topic issues stay fairly constant. Overall, the topic distributions
                    seem to be evenly distributed over the years, providing a good visual summary of
                    UN discussions. The topics are well chosen to summarize the UN-related
                    discussions on security and human rights.</p>

                <head>7. Conclusion</head>
                <p>This article argues that the computational production of keywords should be
                    further critically reflected upon. They should not be taken for granted. Their
                    significance is threefold: They are essential not just for feeding computational
                    models with textual data but also for analyzing their results. Furthermore, they
                    align with the long-standing tradition in the critical humanities of using
                    keywords to describe complex historical-cultural phenomena that escape clear
                    definitions. These three dimensions should motivate a renewed critical focus on
                    the role of keywords. </p>
                <p>Despite different research practices agreeing on their importance for analyzing
                    cultural issues and providing a baseline for new stories about the past, the
                    origins of these keywords are often neglected, perhaps simply because they have
                    been around for so long. Keywords have offered an easy, basic information unit
                    for computational text analysis, with methods like TF-IDF being in popular use
                    since the 1970s. This paper moves beyond this established technique to also
                    explore how keywords are formed and used with two more recent methods: KeyBERT
                    and attention models, which are a core element of the Transformer architecture
                    that has revolutionized natural language processing.</p>
                <p>The power of keywords as a special kind of map remains relevant for computational
                    analysis, where they are increasingly seen as a tool for describing the
                    contested definitions and categorizations central to humanities scholarship. In
                    our case, we apply this approach to the complex and often fraught relationship
                    between security, human rights, and freedom. To this end, we downloaded a corpus
                    of United Nations documents from its human rights bodies and the Security
                    Council. Our analysis demonstrates how extracting keywords with TF-IDF, BERT,
                    and attention models allows us to describe the intricate intersections of these
                    concepts at the UN. Crucially, these complex relations are also expressed in the
                    errors and struggles of the models themselves. Where our keyword methods
                    struggle to cleanly differentiate a document, it is not a sign of technical
                    failure. Instead, these moments reveal the conceptual closeness of security and
                    human rights issues within the UN's discourse and the inherent difficulty of
                    discriminating between them.</p>
                <p>We tested three keyword extraction methods on the UN documents: TF-IDF, KeyBERT
                    and attention-based. Their performance varied significantly by task. For
                    summarizing content, TF-IDF proved least effective, often highlighting terms not
                    central to the documents' main topics. In contrast, KeyBERT generated useful
                    general summaries, while the attention model excelled at identifying specific
                    relevant issues. This suggests TF-IDF (and its TF-only version) should no longer
                    be the default method in digital humanities. However, when we used these
                    keywords to classify documents as <q>security</q> or <q>human rights</q> with a
                    decision tree, all three methods performed exceptionally well, despite selecting
                    largely different keywords. KeyBERT and the attention model were almost perfect
                    classifiers. This strong performance validates our intuition that keywords
                    remain a powerful tool for digital humanities research, enabling us to
                    effectively re-narrate the history of the UN.</p>
                <p>Our research has made it increasingly clear that we must engage more critically
                    with the concept of keywords and how they are generated, interpreted and used in
                    computational analysis. There are numerous methods for both creating and reading
                    keywords, ranging from statistical to deep-learning approaches, and each carries
                    its own assumptions, strengths and limitations. These choices significantly
                    shape what machines <q>read</q> from texts and, in turn, what we as researchers
                    interpret as meaningful output. While this diversity can be challenging, it also
                    presents an opportunity. The plurality of methods opens new avenues for inquiry,
                    allowing us to ask different questions and explore texts from fresh
                    perspectives.</p>
                <p>Importantly, working with keywords allows us to integrate computational models
                    into broader humanities research in a way that supports diverse
                    narrative-formation, visualization and interpretive analysis. But we must be
                    cautious. Deep-learning models, while powerful and promising, often introduce
                    layers of complexity that hinder interpretability. It is essential that we
                    retain the ability to critically engage with and explain these models and their
                    outputs. Furthermore, the uneven availability of language models privileges
                    certain data, and particularly English. Other languages are sidelined, including
                    those with fewer resources or those that are not traditionally written in the
                    Western sense. This article has aimed to interrogate the assumptions underlying
                    the keyword arts, urging a more reflective stance on what we do with keywords,
                    how we use them, when they are appropriate and just as importantly when they are
                    not.</p>
