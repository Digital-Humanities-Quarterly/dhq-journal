                        field within literary and cultural studies. Research focuses on the exploration of
                        the numerous cultural aspects of travel such as: the formation and rules of the literary
                        genre of the travelogue, reception research, research on cultural contacts and stereotypes
                        and gender aspects (see [<a class="ref" href="#bodeker_etal2004">Bödeker et al. 2004</a>], [<a class="ref" href="#maurer1999">Maurer 1999</a>], [<a class="ref" href="#gruber2022">Gruber 2022</a>]). Practical and technical aspects of travel, such as: routes and roads, personal
                        equipment, network and quality of inns, money, currencies and costs, and means of
                        transport (examples: [<a class="ref" href="#maczak1995">Mączak 1995</a>], [<a class="ref" href="#brilli1997">Brilli 1997</a>], [<a class="ref" href="#graf_etal1997">Gräf and Pröve 1997</a>]) are also of importance, as well as travel relationships between certain groups of
                        people such as students, artists and scholars. Mostly the focus is not on the journey
                        itself, but on the destinations and the perceptions of the travellers.</div>

                        discovery of space in social sciences and the development of geoinformation systems),
                        there has not yet been any significant progress in the indexing, processing, and visualisation
                        of travelogues, either in terms of content or method. Current digital travelogue editions
                        can therefore be subsumed into three categories:</div>

                              rudimentary use of maps. Examples are Ernst Samuel Jacob Borchward's Journey to Potsdam
                              of Frederick the Great in 1749<a class="noteRef" href="#d4e279">[1]</a> or the Italian edition of Marco Polo’s travels [<a class="ref" href="#ramusio2015">Ramusio 2015</a>].</li>

                        data modelling. Curation-driven describes the efforts of libraries and archives to
                        record objects in a uniform way. Standards are used to ensure retrievability and transparency.
                        Research driven data modelling aims to answer specific research questions and follows
                        the interest of a researcher.</div>

                     <div class="ptext" id="p11">It is argued that this contrast between research and curation driven data modelling
                        makes the re-use of data difficult or even impossible. The reason for this is the
                        gap created by standardised data collections, as carried out by libraries, which are
                        not sufficient for scientific interpretations and miss the actual research interest.
                        Science-led data collections, on the other hand, are very specific and are rarely
                        oriented towards standards. A feedback into information systems is therefore not possible
                        “because essential information is lacking and because data is captured in non-standard
                        ways”  [<a class="ref" href="#kudella_etal2019">Kudella and Jefferies 2019</a>, 42]. Eide (cf. [<a class="ref" href="#eide2014">Eide 2014</a>]) addresses the same issue by differentiating between “using a model” and “creating a model” when developing data models. He argues that “middle positions can be found when one takes an existing ontology and extends it,
                        or uses terms taken from multiple ontologies in combination”  [<a class="ref" href="#eide2014">Eide 2014</a>, 5]. To ensure re-use and interpretation independent of a specific research project,

                        and interpreted differently. This leads to interoperability problems because of the
                        various possible ways of encoding text elements (e.g., <span class="monospace">&lt;rs&gt;</span>, <span class="monospace">&lt;placeName&gt;</span>, etc.) (see [<a class="ref" href="#unsworth2011">Unsworth 2011</a>]; [<a class="ref" href="#kudella_etal2019">Kudella and Jefferies 2019</a>]; [<a class="ref" href="#burrows_etal2021">Burrows et al. 2021</a>]; [<a class="ref" href="#giovannetti_etal2022">Giovannetti and Tomasi 2022</a>]).

                        for the documentation of museum artefacts and was accepted as an ISO standard for
                        data modelling in the cultural heritage sector in 2006. It is intended to serve as
                        a transdisciplinary “lingua franca” for the standardisation of knowledge on cultural heritage objects and structures
                        and is therefore not limited to pure museum documentation. Based on this harmonised,
                        machine-processable cultural knowledge, the CIDOC CRM aims to facilitate the exchange

                        of event. To be more specific, it is a composite event where a certain person in the
                        role of the traveller is involved throughout all its subsequent events, i.e. travel
                        segments as parts of the travel as a mereological whole. In order to make explicit
                        the segments of a journey reported in a historical travelogue, we need an ontology
                        design pattern to model a journey and all its travel segments including the mereological,
                        chronological, as well as their continuation relations. The traveller conducts several
                        activities (typically observations, arrangements, etc.), which are reported in the
                        travelogue and must therefore be modelled in the database of its digital edition.
                        This includes not only activities when on the move, but also during stopovers. As
                        we have to be able to distinguish between these two modes, we need two major classes
                        to represent a travel as a complex whole composed not only of journey segments, but
                        also of temporary stays at places in between travelling: a class to model travels/travel

                           activities, for example as observations or perceptions. We follow a limited subclassing
                           approach based on frames grasping the specific semantic aspects of the top level categories
                           from a more or less research-driven category system to build subclasses.</div>

                     One direction was the study on modes of travel and mail coaches, especially in Russia,
                     to explain the phenomena Bronner reported upon. This didn't demand many amendments
                     of the existing ontology. The visualisation of travel events, i.e. the path and its
                     sequences, with QGIS<a class="noteRef" href="#d4e801">[22]</a> produced reasonable results, as is shown on <a href="#figure02">Figure 2</a>.</div>

                     traveller in a hired coach, hiring a coach and stagecoach, and for the return trip
                     buying a coach with mail horses. Bronner mentions inns and places where horses were

                     typical activities during Bronner’s travels like the encounters with people. We experimented
                     with the activity types mentioned above and arranged them in various groups, but the
                     preliminary results were not impressive. From the very beginning, we were interested
                     not only in where a meeting took place, but also to what other place it referred to,
                     e.g. when Bronner talked with the physicist Georg Friedrich Parrot during a meeting
                     in Dorpat (now: Tartu), they also discussed the university of Kazan and the university’s
                     curator Stepan Rumovsky who resided in St. Petersburg. An overall view of all these
                     geography-related contacts was processed with Gephi to produce a more objective picture
                     than a mere view on the map.</div>

                     density where the main places of the journey to Kazan appear as closely interrelated.
                     Likewise, many towns on the way back, especially after Bronner’s crossing the Austrian
                     frontier, are clustered together with Vienna as the centre. Munich, as one may notice,
                     does not belong to this cluster. In terms of travel activities, the Bavarian residence
                     is situated much closer to the Kazan university than to the Austrian capital. This
                     clustering occurred because Bronner's travelogue includes reports about letters brought
                     from Kazan and conversations with German colleagues about professors working at the
                     Russian university. In the end, the results of the data modelling we applied came
                     back seemingly inconclusive.</div>

                        region centred around Höchstädt, Donauwörth and Augsburg. After the Swiss Revolution
                        of 1797, he got a position in the administration of the newly founded Helvetic Republic
                        and in 1803, when it was dissolved, he had accepted an ill-paid and insecure position
                        as a teacher in Aarau, the capital of the newly created Swiss canton of Aargau, which
                        Bronner regarded liberal enough to be a safe place for a former revolutionary. Bronner
                        had become a Swiss patriot [<a class="ref" href="#radspieler1967">Radspieler 1967</a>, 13–79]<a class="noteRef" href="#d4e880">[24]</a> and the country, in his comparisons, stood for a lovely landscape, flourishing agriculture
                        and free, wealthy people. Germany, meanwhile, represented in Bronner's view a higher
                        state of culture. Bronner’s home region and the “Upper Germany” (i.e., Southern Germany), however, very seldom appeared as a reference during his
                        journeys. The contrast with Switzerland got marked for Bronner when he entered the
                        Baltic provinces of the Russian Empire, the more so since the serfdom that prevailed
                        there had already reached the attention of the educated public of Germany [<a class="ref" href="#heeg1992">Heeg 1992</a>]. Bronner also made comparisons with places formerly seen on his travels.</div>

                        part of Austria. He commented on these encounters, with one exception, always in a negative
                        way. His critical observations on Jews, however, focused on Eastern Jewish lifestyles,
                        and Jewish prevalence on the whole, in Polish towns. Bronner mentioned Jewish people

                        testifies to his abilities as an accurate observer especially of human relations.
                        He scarcely commented on the many, mostly short, stories with women he reported on.
                        This is why we decided to examine how Bronner represented gender relations in his
                        travelogue.</div>

                        mapping, we already found some interesting features concerning gender relations, as
                        can be seen in <a href="#figure08">Figure 8</a>. Remarks on women can be divided into three categories, here visualised by diamonds:
                        mostly not commenting on them (white diamond), emphasising various characteristics
                        of women (light green diamond), negative remarks about a woman’s character or appearance
                        (various kinds of red diamonds). In the culturally divided Baltic (starting already
                        in Eastern Prussia), the number of observations increased in opposite directions.
                        Bronner saw women dressed in the European or “French” manner and he was astonished at the incomplete, by his standards, clothing of the
                        Baltic and later the Russian peasant women (“just a shirt”). Likewise, he disapproved that their clothes were not figure-hugging.<a class="noteRef" href="#d4e973">[25]</a> In the Baltic, Bronner for the first time encountered prostitutes and prostitution,
                        but he stops mentioning them, as well as observations of flirting with a few exceptions,
                        in Russia proper, only to start anew on the way home after the Austrian border (various
                        shades of blue). Interestingly, on the way home Bronner noted with negative remarks
                        that Russian host peasant women demanded a lot of money for boiling water and importunately,
                        as he saw it, asked for gifts for their children and the elderly. Accustomed to the
                        restrained behaviour of German middle-class women, he, as it seems, could not approve
                        that Russian peasant women strongly defended the interests of their family in the
                        sphere which was under their uncontested control.<a class="noteRef" href="#d4e980">[26]</a></div>

                        – at least as it is portrayed by Bronner as an observer who undoubtedly was determined
                        by the norms of his time.</div>

                     <div class="ptext" id="p47">One way of retaining compatibility with the ontology pattern is to apply the methodological
                        approach of the Actor-Network Theory (ANT). It also uses graph-conform data consisting
                        of vertices (“actors”) and edges, but ANT networks are not set out for being operationalized with mathematical
                        methods nor even for visualisation. Instead, they are an instrument for reflection
                        and constant refinement. A central claim of the ANT is that non-human actors of any
                        kind must be considered, though not as preconceived constructs of the researcher.
                        Instead, they must be discernible in the text as objects, motives, ideas, or clusters
                        of them and human actors, conceived by the author or actors themselves at least in
                        an indirect way.<a class="noteRef" href="#d4e1008">[27]</a> The non-human actors to be defined by us according to the ANT mostly were too vague
                        to be palpable and unequivocally identifiable in the text of the travelogue. Consequently,
                        they could not be tagged and the tight connection of TEI tags and the database could
                        be lost. Furthermore, our design pattern so far did not provide non-human actors.
                        Let us give an example: When mentioning that women in a Riga banquet (<a href="#bronner1810">Bronner 1810, August 30</a>) sat around the housewife, Bronner clearly spoke about a kind of segregation of sexes.
                        This was not the only time Bronner mentioned it, also in the Baltic (<a href="#bronner1810">Bronner 1810, August 26</a>), he wondered that domestic servants and poor travellers of all sexes shared for
                        the night the same main room of an inn. In this example, too, he refers to a norm
                        of segregation of sexes he was accustomed to from German households regardless of
                        their wealth. We therefore have, according to ANT, to consider different norms of
                        segregation of sexes as “actors”: two norms of Baltic origins and Bronner’s accustomed norms which he brought with
                        him from Germany and Switzerland. As non-human actors these norms interact with people
                        who are sharing them or not acting accordingly.</div>
                     
                     <div class="counter"><a href="#p48">48</a></div>
                     <div class="ptext" id="p48">Since agency can be assumed as a unitary action of exerting influence, we decided
                        to treat it with the frame-inspired modelling approach. The representation consists
                        so far of two actors, an activity (using the <em class="term">Activity Types</em> classification system), a determinator of strength ranging from 1 to 3, and the definition
                        of direction. We also provided for the possibility of clustering several actors into
                        one as an important requirement of ANT. Some actor-centred activity types had to be
                        added, among them, of course, such that relate to non-human actors. In ANT, they are
                        conceived vaguely in terms of “participation” which can be grasped via thematic roles in the frame semantics framework. But a person
                        can set pressure upon another person by intentionally appealing to, say, a legal or
                        moral norm, and that norm, in consequence, may become coercive – or just for this

                     the activity. The application of the relationship pattern would be more demanding
                     for semantic annotation because of the additional explicit modelling and classification
                     of roles (via the <span class="monospace">crm:P14.1_in_the_role_of</span> property).</div>

                     we had to make a pragmatic modelling decision: building subclasses for modelling genuine

The
                     subclasses are oriented on FrameNet frames. The event type specific properties of
                     the subclasses are based on the frame elements and therefore represent semantic roles.
