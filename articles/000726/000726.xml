						Introduction</head>
            <p>The project “Digitale Editionen Historischer
					Reiseberichte” (DEHisRe) develops a digital editing approach, enabling editors
					and researchers to make the categories of historical travelling explicit by
					applying ontology design patterns for semantic annotation and interlinking of
					text with data.</p>

							Historical Travel Research and its Digital Representation</head>
               <p>Historical travel research, especially the study
						of travelogues, has been a popular field within literary and cultural
						studies. Research focuses on the exploration of the numerous cultural
						aspects of travel such as: the formation and rules of the literary genre of
						the travelogue, reception research, research on cultural contacts and
						stereotypes and gender aspects (see Bödeker et al. (2004), Maurer (1999),
						Gruber 2022). Practical and technical aspects of travel, such as: routes and
						roads, personal equipment, network and quality of inns, money, currencies
						and costs, and means of transport (examples: Mączak (1995), Brilli (1997),
						Gräf and Pröve (1997)) are also of importance, as well as travel
						relationships between certain groups of people such as students, artists and
						scholars. Mostly the focus is not on the journey itself, but on the
						destinations and the perceptions of the travellers.</p>
               <p>Despite the rise of digital humanities
						(including the field of digital editions, the discovery of space in social
						sciences and the development of geoinformation systems), there has not yet
						been any significant progress in the indexing, processing, and visualisation
						of travelogues, either in terms of content or method. Current digital
						travelogue editions can therefore be subsumed into three categories:</p>
               <p>1. Digital editions based on paper editions,
						which usually manage without maps or with rudimentary use of maps. Examples
						are Ernst Samuel Jacob Borchward's Journey to Potsdam of Frederick the Great
						in 1749<note>
                     <ref target="http://quellen-perspectivia.net/de/borchward/start">http://quellen-perspectivia.net/de/borchward/start</ref>
                  </note> or the Italian edition of Marco Polo’s travels (Ramusio
						2015).</p>
               <p>2. Elaborate digital editions of scholars'
						estates, often with numerous illustrative images and maps from the same
						collection. The digitalisation focuses on the text, its transcription,
						content indexing and annotation, and generally on presentation. Examples are
						“Livingstone Online” (Wisnicki &amp; Ward 2018), the edition humboldt
							digital<note>
                     <ref target="http://edition-humboldt.de/index.xql">http://edition-humboldt.de/index.xql</ref>
                  </note> and the annotated digital edition of Philipp Hainhofer’s
						(1578- 1647) travel and collection descriptions<note>
                     <ref target="https://hainhofer.hab.de">https://hainhofer.hab.de</ref>
                  </note>.</p>
               <p>3. Cartographic visualisation of travel accounts
						(e.g. Orwell with a GoogleMaps map) and elaborate realisations. Examples are
						Karl Grossner’s Linked Paths web application<note>
                     <ref target="http://linkedpaths.kgeographer.org/">http://linkedpaths.kgeographer.org/</ref> and <ref target="https://github.com/kgeographer/linked-paths">https://github.com/kgeographer/linked-paths</ref>
                  </note>
						and based on a fictional work the “LotrProject”<note>
                     <ref target="http://lotrproject.com/">http://lotrproject.com/</ref>
                  </note> with multiple visualisations and evaluations of
						relationships within the work: Genealogies, travel routes (based on
						Tolkien's maps) with travel times, place explanations, place categories,
						graphics on demography, etc. However, a link to the text is dispensed with
						here.</p>

							Structure and Research Questions</head>
               <p>This paper presents a first draft of the ongoing
						work on the edition of Franz Xaver Bronner’s travelogues, in which we apply
						a semantic model that combines widely accepted standards (such as CIDOC CRM,
						Dublin Core, SKOS etc.) with project-specific elements and TEI. We address
						the question of category development for time, space and events through text
						encoding and semantic annotation, and their assets for research while
						focusing on the current DFG-funded project “Digital Edition of Historical
						Travelogues” (DEHisRe).<note>
                     <ref target="https://gepris.dfg.de/gepris/projekt/453498639?language=en">https://gepris.dfg.de/gepris/projekt/453498639?language=en</ref>
                  </note>
               </p>
               <p>After introducing different standards, concepts
						and modelling approaches in the digital edition field, we will focus on the
						ontology development process in chapter two. Edition guidelines according to
						TEI were also developed, but are not part of this article. We describe the
						development of different ontology design patterns and its application to
						travel events and observations. Some examples for travel events are
						illustrated in chapter three.</p>
               <p>In chapter four, we present specific research
						questions which serve as a basis for the development and refinement of our
						ontology design patterns. Here we give an insight into the ongoing iterative
						process based on interdisciplinary exchange between historians and ontology
						developers. The research questions presented focus on the following issues:
						1) observation of practices: ethnic groups and cultural norms, and 2) gender
						encounters: narrating the varied women's agency while on the road.</p>
               <p>This approach is applied to the digital edition
						and additional material of the unpublished travelogue of the German
						expatriate in Switzerland Franz Xaver Bronner (1758-1850)<note> The State Archive Aargau holds the unpublished
								manuscripts written by Franz Xaver Bronner, see the manuscript
								collection: Staatsarchiv Aargau, Nachlass Bronner,
							NL.A-0019.</note>, who in 1810 went to the Russian University of
						Kazan on the Volga to become a professor in theoretical physics and
						travelled back to Switzerland in 1817 (see Beyer-Thoma 2017).</p>
               <p>To conclude the research, we will give a short
						overview of the possibilities of connecting TEI and ontologies. Here,
						suitable tools are presented: advantages and disadvantages as well as the
						different focal points of these tools are discussed. The ideas presented are
						based on initial evaluations of the implementation of concepts (textual and
						ontological) within the project.</p>

						Information Science Perspective</head>
            <p>The main problems arising from digital editions are
					the data models and databases used, which are predominately tailored to the
					delivery of digital products and are thus far too simple to deal with the
					diverse number of current issues.<note> See
							the concept of modelling for production and modelling for understanding
							(Eide 2014).</note> Conventional editions based on document
					modelling with TEI (see the categories in 1.1) do not have the necessary
					expressiveness and flexibility to deal with diverse use cases. To be able to use
					a digital edition of a historical travelogue, as a basis for further analysis
					and visualisation, named entities must be recognised, identified, enriched with
					additional data and the narration of the events must be explicitly
						modelled.<note> We follow the Historical
							Information Life Cycle (Meroño-Peñuela et al. 2014) in creating a
							digital edition, where ontologies are not only used in the enrichment,
							editing, as well as the retrieval phases of the life cycle, but also in
							the analysis and visualisationDOC phases.</note> (see chapter 3)</p>
            <p>“What humanistic data ‘looks’ like, that is, its
					structure and content, is shaped by the researcher’s choice of source material,
					data model, and technology, by decisions regarding the use of external
					resources, and much more.” (Kudella and Jefferies 2019, p. 42)</p>
            <div>
               <head>2.1 Data
							Modeling and Digital Editions</head>
               <p>According to Kudella and Jefferies (cf. 2019), two groups of data
						modelling can be distinguished, curation-driven and research-driven data
						modelling. Curation-driven describes the efforts of libraries and archives
						to record objects in a uniform way. Standards are used to ensure
						retrievability and transparency. Research driven data modelling aims to
						answer specific research questions and follows the interest of a researcher. </p>
               <p>It is argued that this contrast between research
						and curation driven data modelling makes the re-use of data difficult or
						even impossible. The reason for this is the gap created by standardised data
						collections, as carried out by libraries, which are not sufficient for
						scientific interpretations and miss the actual research interest.
						Science-led data collections, on the other hand, are very specific and are
						rarely oriented towards standards. A feedback into information systems is
						therefore not possible “because essential information is lacking and because
						data is captured in non-standard ways.” (Kudella and Jefferies 2019, p. 42).
						Eide (cf. 2014) addresses the same issue by differentiating between “using a model” and “creating a model”
						when developing data models. He argues that “middle positions can be found
						when one takes an existing ontology and extends it, or uses terms taken from
						multiple ontologies in combination.” (ibid., p. 5) To ensure re-use and
						interpretation independent of a specific research project, it is important
						to consider current standards.</p>
               <p>In addition, Eide (ibid.) uses the distinction
						between modelling for production and modelling for understanding in the
						context of TEI encoding (as a form of modelling) of texts. Our approach
						tries to bridge this gap by re-introducing research driven perspectives into
						ontology-based modelling and by extending this distinction to the use of TEI
						editing.</p>
            </div>
            <div>
               <head>2.2
							Existing Standards</head>
               <p>The TEI Guidelines serve as a de-facto standard
						for digital editions. “The Text Encoding Initiative [TEI] is the most
						systematic effort so far to create standards for scholarly memory in an
						evolving digital culture. The TEI markup language includes [...] different
						elements to satisfy all manner of scholarly needs in the humanities.”
						(tei-c.org 2019) The newest version of TEI includes 585 elements (see the
						TEI Consortium 2022)
						and was designed to
						be flexible in order to make it applicable to a wide range of research
						questions. It is not unambiguous, however, and the same information can be
						encoded and interpreted differently. This leads to
						interoperability problems because of the various possible ways of encoding text elements (e.g., &lt;rs&gt;, &lt;placeName&gt;, etc.) (see Unsworth 2011; Kudella and Jefferies 2019; Burrows et al. 2021; Giovannetti and Tomasi 2022). The
						TEI therefore reflects the dichotomy between research and curation driven
						modelling practice mentioned above (see 2.1).</p>
               <p>According to Giovanetti and Tomasi (cf. 2021),
						linking Linked Open Data (LOD) and TEI could address the problem of
						interoperability: “Enhancing TEI-encoded texts with linked open data
						represents a possible way to overcome this limitation.” (ibid.) We therefore
						try to solve the interoperability and expressivity problems of TEI and CIDOC
							“Conceptual Reference Model”
							(CRM)<note>
                     <date when=""/>You are probably referencing the CIDOC CRM here?
							</note> by means of “Deutsches Textarchiv Basisformat” (DTABf) and
						frame-based ontology design patterns. This, in turn, makes the categories of
						travel events and travel observations in historical travelogues explicit for
						further analysis and visualisation.</p>
               <p>We use the CIDOC CRM for the enrichment of the
						text with knowledge made explicit and stored in a database. It is an
						event-oriented and well-accepted ontology in the cultural heritage sector.
						The CIDOC CRM has been developed since 1996 as an Application Ontology for
						the documentation of museum artefacts and was accepted as an ISO standard
						for data modelling in the cultural heritage sector in 2006. It is intended
						to serve as a transdisciplinary “lingua franca” for the standardisation of
						knowledge on cultural heritage objects and structures and is therefore not
						limited to pure museum documentation. Based on this harmonised,
						machine-processable cultural knowledge, the CIDOC CRM aims to facilitate the
						exchange of relevant information between museums, libraries, archives and
						comparable institutions as well as between different research projects. (see
						Meyer 2019).</p>

						Ontology-based Editing of Historical Travelogues</head>
            <p>A selection of competency questions presents some of
					the requirements for data modelling:</p>
            <list rend="bulleted">
               <item>From whence to where did a particular section of the traveller’s route
						go?</item>
               <item>Which scholars were visited during a stay in a city?</item>
               <item>Which items were exchanged during visits during the stopover in a
						city?</item>
               <item>Which other people were met along the way and during a stay?</item>
               <item>Which places were seen or visited during a stay?</item>
               <item>Where did our traveller stay overnight, for a meal, for a snack?</item>
            </list>
            <p>The ontology design patterns presented in
					section 3.1 allow the editor to semantically annotate and represent the
					information which is necessary to answer this kind of questions. It is done by
					means of information retrieval via SPARQL<note> SPARQL Protocol And RDF Query Language.</note> queries from
					the database linked to the edited text of a historical travelogue.</p>
            <p>In terms of narratology, our modelling approach
					focuses on making explicit the ‘fabula’ of a travel report. The ‘sujet’ is not
					explicitly modelled, but it can be derived on demand from the semantic
					annotations: As a byproduct, we are able to query the narrative sequence of
					travel events, stopovers and activities conducted throughout the journey of a
					traveller. This sequence represents the sujet and can be compared to the
					chronological sequence of activities and continuation succession of travel
					sections — the fabula (see also 3.1).</p>
            <p>The historical information life cycle
					(Meroño-Peñuela et al. 2015) envisages various opportunities for retrieval of
					information for further research and analysis, e.g. social networks for network
					analysis and visualisation in Gephi<note>
							Tool for network analysis and visualisation, see <ref target="https://gephi.org/">https://gephi.org/</ref>
               </note> or travel routes in GeoJSON as a data exchange format for map
					making in geographic information systems like QGIS. As Grossner (2010, p. 186)
					suggests, a simple LineString geometry can be constructed out of place
					information from the travel and stopover instances in order to provide for
					example a GeoJSON representation of the whole travel route of a journey for
					visualisation purposes. After the enrichment and editing phases in the life
					cycle of historical information, we are now located at the retrieval phase and
					will proceed to the analysis and presentation phases in the next section.</p>
            <div>
               <head>3.1
							Ontology Design Patterns</head>
               <p>The event-centred modelling approach of CRM (see
						2.2) enables us to model the fabula and sujet of a travelogue (cf.
						Bartalesi, Meghini, and Metilli 2017).<note> According to Russian formalism, the fabula represents the
								chronological sequence as well as the causal and mereological
								relations of travel events reported in a travelogue. The sujet
								represents the narrative sequence of the events, which can deviate
								from the chronological sequence when a travel report does not follow
								the chronological order.</note> As Maurer (cf. 2015, 391f.)
						notes, travelogues written by scientific explorers often follow a thematic
						organisation to present ‘travel results’ instead of simply following a
						chronological order (see 1.1 and 4.).</p>
               <p>To build the annotation scheme and associated
						ontology design patterns, i.e. to interlink text and data, we apply frame
						semantics as a theoretical framework. Frames can be represented as n-ary
							relations<note> Annotation tools
								like brat or INCEpTION provide an annotation and visualisation
								component for n-ary relations (frames or events incl. the roles of
								agent and patient etc.).</note> and used as skeletal structure

               <head>3.2 Developing Ontology Design Patterns for Travel Events and Travel
						Activities</head>
               <p>The ontology design patterns are the basis for
						the ontology-based text enrichment and editing workflow. The reason for the
						frame-like structure of classes for representing travel events and
						activities during travelling and stopovers is motivated by the semantic
						annotation use case of interlinking text and data. Our ontology design
						approach is based on requirement analysis, whereby the competency questions
						are derived from initial user stories to define data modelling and
						information retrieval requirements. </p>
               <p>From an ontological perspective, a travel or
						journey has to be considered as a kind of event. To be more specific, it is
						a composite event where a certain person in the role of the traveller is
						involved throughout all its subsequent events, i.e. travel segments as parts
						of the travel as a mereological whole. In order to make explicit the
						segments of a journey reported in a historical travelogue, we need an
						ontology design pattern to model a journey and all its travel segments
						including the mereological, chronological, as well as their continuation
						relations. The traveller conducts several activities (typically
						observations, arrangements, etc.), which are reported in the travelogue and
						must therefore be modelled in the database of its digital edition. This
						includes not only activities when on the move, but also during stopovers. As
						we have to be able to distinguish between these two modes, we need two major
						classes to represent a travel as a complex whole composed not only of
						journey segments, but also of temporary stays at places in between
						travelling: a class to model travels/travel segments and a class to model
						stopovers.</p>

								Frames as Building Blocks for Ontology Design Patterns</head>
                  <p>A <hi rend="italic">frame</hi> is a
							structured representation of an event or situation (see fig. 1). A
							frame’s <hi rend="italic">frame elements</hi> are the semantic roles of
							the entities involved in the event or situation. FrameNet (Ruppenhofer
							et al. 2016) provides some possibly relevant frames like Departing, Travel, Arriving, and Temporary_stay. The
							frame Travel is
							obviously the best candidate as basis for the central class in our
							“Digital Editions of Historical Travelogues Ontology” (DTO) OWL
								ontology.<note> The ontology
									design patterns are developed by combining OWL classes and
									properties and SHACL node shape constraints. The UML class
									diagrams are drawn with the SHACL2PlantUML tool available on
									GitHub: <ref target="https://github.com/rosecky/shacl2plantuml">https://github.com/rosecky/shacl2plantuml</ref>
                     </note>
                  </p>
                  <p>The best fitting place to locate travel in
							the taxonomy of the CRM core classes is the class crm:E9_Move
							(subclass of crm:E7_Activity) which would satisfy the essential aspects of
							our modelling requirements. Hence, we created the subclasses dto:Travel, dto:Stopover, and
								dto:Transport<note> We
									need this class to model the movement of the baggage of
									historical travellers when this took place on another route by
									different means of transportation than the traveller’s journey.
									It would not make sense to represent ‘travelling baggage’
									because a travel has to be understood as the activity of a
									sentient being.</note> and aligned them to the CRM class crm:E9_Move (see
							fig. 1).</p>

                  </p>
                  <p>The frame element Path of the Travel frame in
							FrameNet is defined as follows: “The Path is the route along which the
							travel takes place.” Thus, we model the property dto:path in our
							ontology design pattern for the representation of travel events as
							subproperty of crm:P7_took_place_at in the DTO and hence has the CRM class
								crm:E53_Place
							as its range (see fig. 1). For example “by sea” could be subsumed under
							the Path element.<note> annotation
									example from <ref target="http://framenet.lexicalsemantics.org/lu/lu5961.xml?mode=annotation&amp;banner=">http://framenet.lexicalsemantics.org/lu/lu5961.xml?mode=annotation&amp;banner=</ref>
                     </note>
							The Path frame
							element in the more general Self_motion frame:
							“Path is used for any description of a trajectory of motion which is
							neither a Source nor a Goal.” The properties for Source and Goal can be aligned
							as subproperties to the properties crm:P27_moved_from
							and crm:P26_moved_to of the CRM class crm:E9_Move.
							Therefore we define the class dto:Travel as a
							subclass of crm:E9_Move. Grossner (2010, 186) defines ‘Trajectory-Path’ as
							“a calculated <hi rend="italic">sequenced bag</hi> of Places associated
							with a complex Event, such as a journey (expedition, pilgrimage, etc.).
							A trajectory can be derived by selecting for the geometries and temporal
							attributes of all sub-event parts of a journey.”<note> According to Grossner (2010, 131) a path
									can be considered as an unnamed place. Though, a path in the
									sense of the frame element can also be a route (specific road or
									seaway).</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>We decided to use only categories to
							describe the mode of transportation instead of representing specific
							vehicles etc. The property dto:mode_of_transportation is connected with a concept from a
							classification system (see the SHACL restriction to the <hi rend="italic">Modes of Transportation</hi> SKOS Concept Scheme in
							fig. 1 providing the categories (‘stagecoach’, ‘own vehicle’, ‘by foot’,
							etc.)). In addition to the description of the mode of transportation by
							means of the classification system, the vessel used for transport can be
							explicitly stated via the property dto:vehicle which
							is aligned to CRM as a subproperty of crm:P16_used_specific_object.</p>
                  <p>In order to enable the ontology-based
							editing of travel-related activities, we had to find a balance between
							building subclasses with specific properties and applying the general
							activity class in combination with classification systems to classify
							activities, for example as observations or perceptions. We follow a
							limited subclassing approach based on frames grasping the specific
							semantic aspects of the top level categories from a more or less
							research-driven category system to build subclasses. </p>

                  <head>3.2.2 Frame-based Semantic
								Annotation
						</head>
                  <p>The major objective of the ontology design
							patterns presented is the semantic annotation and explicit modelling of
							all the travel events reported in the travelogue and to connect them in
							their mereological composition, their chronological sequence, and last
							but not least, their continuation nexus. The narratological sequence of
							the travel events can be retrieved on demand by exploiting the position
							of the semantic annotations in the course of the text. Therefore, the
							narration is not explicitly modelled in our approach.<note> See the CRM-based modelling of the
									narration and textual content introduced by Bartalesi, Meghini,
									and Metilli (2017).</note> We follow the CRM application
							profile from the <hi rend="italic">SDHSS Voyage, movement, transport and
								displacement</hi> project<note> See the project landing page in OntoME: <ref target="https://ontome.net/project/144">https://ontome.net/project/144</ref>
                     </note> by
							reusing the property crm:P134_continued to model the relations between continuing
							travel activities, i.e. the sequence of all waypoints in an intended
							journey — not including the activities of the traveller during a stopover
							(see 3.2.1). The representation of the travel events provides basic data
							for further analysis and visualisation. </p>
                  <p>Travel activities (at stopovers or during
							travel) can also be modelled via ontology design patterns oriented on
							frames, e.g. Activity, Perception_active,
							Meet_with, Sleep etc. Each of
							these frames has at least a frame-element
								to describe the agent, the place, and the time of the activity.
							Types of activity, e.g. attends a performance, complains about, gets a meal, play a more central role and their
							definition is highly driven by research questions, as will be shown
							later. As an idea of a formal approach, frame-oriented ontology design
							patterns were in principle pre-conceived already by the tradition of the
								<hi rend="italic">ars apodemica</hi>, which proposes typical
							activities during a stopover, e.g. visiting public places like
							cathedrals, monuments, museums etc. (see fig. 5 in Maurer 1999).<note> See for the historical item:
										<ref target="https://www.digitale-sammlungen.de/view/bsb10184435?page=24">https://www.digitale-sammlungen.de/view/bsb10184435?page=24</ref>
                     </note>
                  </p>
                  <p>The ontology design patterns predominantly
							use controlled vocabulary from classification systems, the most
							important of which being those providing categories for places, persons,
							groups of persons, means of transport, and types of activity. The
							standardisation allows for information retrieval via SPARQL queries to
							serve the information needs driven by different research interests. For
							the time being, we are using data which is destined for the production
							of graphs, i.e. vertices and edges with additional information retrieved
							from the frame-oriented database entries. Two types of encounters on the
							road will serve as an example of the challenges of this kind of
							research-driven annotation, highlighting the question of ethnic and
							gender stereotypes, and include the following: 1) contacts between the
							foreign traveller and the domestic customs officers and 2) between the
							bachelor traveller and landladies.</p>

            <head>4. Examples
						and Learnings from Franz Xaver Bronner’s Travelogue</head>
            <p>We found early on there were many detailed ways to
					start analysing Bronner’s text. One direction was the study on modes of travel
					and mail coaches, especially in Russia, to explain the phenomena Bronner
					reported upon. This didn't demand many amendments of the existing ontology. The
					visualisation of travel events, i.e. the path and its sequences, with QGIS<note> See <ref target="https://www.qgis.org/en/site/">https://www.qgis.org/en/site/</ref>
               </note> produced reasonable results, as is shown on Map 1.</p>
            <figure>
               <head/>
               <graphic url="media/image2.png"/>

            <p>Map 1: Mode of Transportation; see for map legend:
					https://qgiscloud.com/DEHISRE/Bronner_DHQ_0/</p>
            <p>Bronner used a lot of different means of transport,
					for example travelling as a fellow traveller in a hired coach, hiring a coach
					and stagecoach, and for the return trip buying a coach with mail horses. Bronner
					mentions inns and places where horses were changed, sometimes explicitly
					stagecoach stations. </p>
            <p>It proved to be more challenging to produce useful
					results through visualisation of typical activities during Bronner’s travels
					like the encounters with people. We experimented with the activity types
					mentioned above and arranged them in various groups, but the preliminary results
					were not impressive. From the very beginning, we were interested not only in
					where a meeting took place, but also to what other place it referred to, e.g.
					when Bronner talked with the physicist Georg Friedrich Parrot during a meeting
					in Dorpat (now: Tartu), they also discussed the university of Kazan and the
					university’s curator Stepan Rumovsky who resided in St. Petersburg. An overall
					view of all these geography-related contacts was processed with Gephi to produce
					a more objective picture than a mere view on the map.</p>
            <p>Fig. 2 shows a clustering (by colour) of relations
					between places by modularity, i.e. their density where the main places of the
					journey to Kazan appear as closely interrelated. Likewise, many towns on the way
					back, especially after Bronner’s crossing the Austrian frontier, are clustered
					together with Vienna as the centre. Munich, as one may notice, does not belong
					to this cluster. In terms of travel activities, the Bavarian residence is
					situated much closer to the Kazan university than to the Austrian capital. This
					clustering occurred because Bronner's travelogue includes reports about letters
					brought from Kazan and conversations with German colleagues about professors
					working at the Russian university. In the end, the results of the data modelling
					we applied came back seemingly inconclusive.</p>

            </p>
            <p>To tackle this issue, we took a closer look at the
					distinctive social and other features of the people who made up the contacts,
					marking in the first place, if mentioned, sex and religion. Additionally, we
					introduced a notification of social status and profession, as well as attributes
					of ethnicity or nationality. Most importantly, we started to focus more on the
					outcome from close reading of the travelogue and, in the end, came to readjust
					not only the activity types, but also the inner core of the ontology. </p>
            <p>We will illustrate the issue of adapting the
					ontology to complex research questions, firstly, on several retrievals for
					cartographic visualisation and, secondly, on the subject of female agency as
					reflected in Bronner's travelogue (a popular theme in the history of travel
					writing). This also leads us to discuss the compatibility of network theory with
					actor-network methodology.</p>

               <p>Before Bronner migrated to Switzerland in 1794,
						he had lived in the Swabian-speaking region centred around Höchstädt,
						Donauwörth and Augsburg. After the Swiss Revolution of 1797, he got a
						position in the administration of the newly founded Helvetic Republic and in
						1803, when it was dissolved, he had accepted an ill-paid and insecure
						position as a teacher in Aarau, the capital of the newly created Swiss
						canton of Aargau, which Bronner regarded liberal enough to be a safe place
						for a former revolutionary. Bronner had become a Swiss patriot (Radspieler
						1963, 1967, pp. 13–79)<note> The most apprehensive biographical work on
								Bronner is authored by Hans Radspieler.</note> and the country,
						in his comparisons, stood for a lovely landscape, flourishing agriculture
						and free, wealthy people. Germany, meanwhile, represented in Bronner's view
						a higher state of culture. Bronner’s home region and the “Upper Germany”
						(i.e., Southern Germany), however, very seldom appeared as a reference
						during his journeys. The contrast with Switzerland got marked for Bronner
						when he entered the Baltic provinces of the Russian Empire, the more so
						since the serfdom that prevailed there had already reached the attention of
						the educated public of Germany (Heeg 1992). Bronner also made comparisons
						with places formerly seen on his travels. </p>
               <p>These findings spurred us to refine our ontology
						to more abundantly reflect all kinds of perceptions made by Bronner. To
						start with a narrowly travel-related subject: Bronner's descriptions of
						officials change at the border with Prussia in Treuenbrietzen where he was
						vexed by toll officials. Consequently, we classified professional groups and
						added various types of observations regarding his perception of officials to
						the travel activities classification system to be used in the pattern for
						the Perception_active
						class (see fig. 3). </p>

						Braunau in his draft travelogue: “Compare the honest character of Austrians
						and Bavarians with [that of] Poles and Russians.” (Bronner 1817, December
						1).</p>

               <p>Bronner describes unpleasant encounters with
						Russian people during his journeys but refrains from commenting on them. The
						encounters with Polish and Jewish people, on the other hand, are more
						explicitly commented on. Map 4 shows the authors' perceptions of these two
						ethnic groups according to the travel activity classification system.
						Bronner first encountered Poles in the former Polish territories of Prussia,
						thereafter in the Baltic and in the Ukraine, and the Eastern part of
						Austria. He commented on these encounters, with one exception, always in
						a negative way. His critical observations on Jews, however, focused on
						Eastern Jewish lifestyles, and Jewish prevalence on the whole, in Polish
						towns. Bronner mentioned Jewish people and communities eastbound from
						Prussia onward and on the way back until Bohemia.</p>
               <p>As a result of close reading of the text and a
						refinement and completion of our ontology, we can observe that Bronner’s
						view on “Germany” as a stronghold of higher culture and on “Germans” and
						“Austrians” as more “honest” people is mixed up by his own observations.</p>

               <head>4.2 Gender encounters: narrating women's agency </head>
               <p>Bronner’s text, for the most part written only
						as a draft to be revised later, nevertheless testifies to his abilities as
						an accurate observer especially of human relations. He scarcely commented on
						the many, mostly short, stories with women he reported on. This is why we
						decided to examine how Bronner represented gender relations in his
						travelogue.</p>
               <p>Bronner described the regional costumes of women
						and by applying the method of geographical mapping, we already found some
						interesting features concerning gender relations, as can be seen in Map 5.
						Remarks on women can be divided into three categories, here visualised by
						diamonds: mostly not commenting on them (white diamond), emphasising various
						characteristics of women (light green diamond), negative remarks about a
						woman’s character or appearance (various kinds of red diamonds). In the
						culturally divided Baltic (starting already in Eastern Prussia), the number
						of observations increased in opposite directions. Bronner saw women dressed
						in the European or “French” manner and he was astonished at the incomplete,
						by his standards, clothing of the Baltic and later the Russian peasant women
						(“just a shirt”). Likewise, he disapproved that their clothes were not
							figure-hugging.<note> The
								traditional clothing of Russian women, especially young girls, is
								passim described by Šangina (2008); for an (as it may seem to
								somebody: far-fetched) explanation of the non-figure-hugging clothes
								of Russian women see Puškareva (1995), pp. 64–65.</note> In the
						Baltic, Bronner for the first time encountered prostitutes and prostitution,
						but he stops mentioning them, as well as observations of flirting with a few
						exceptions, in Russia proper, only to start anew on the way home after the
						Austrian border (various shades of blue). Interestingly, on the way home
						Bronner noted with negative remarks that Russian host peasant women demanded
						a lot of money for boiling water and importantly, as he saw it, asked for
						gifts for their children and the elderly. Accustomed to the restrained
						behaviour of German middle-class women, he, as it seems, could not approve
						that Russian peasant women strongly defended the interests of their family
						in the sphere which was under their uncontested control.<note> About the gender-based division of labour in
								the Russian peasant family (see Šustrova 1998; Löwe 1989). It was
								not so different from that in Germany (see Mitterauer
							1989).</note>

						https://qgiscloud.com/DEHISRE/Bronner_DHQ_4/</p>
               <p>These observations aroused the question of
						female agency within these encounters and of the impact of the social and
						cultural norms. To attain results, attention had to be centred less upon the
						perceptions of the author, but upon how women acted and why – at least as it
						is portrayed by Bronner as an observer who undoubtedly was determined by the
						norms of his time. </p>
               <p>One way of retaining compatibility with the
						ontology pattern is to apply the methodological approach of the
						Actor-Network Theory (ANT). It also uses graph-conform data consisting of
						vertices (“actors”) and edges, but ANT networks are not set out for being
						operationalized with mathematical methods nor even for visualisation.
						Instead, they are an instrument for reflection and constant refinement. A
						central claim of the ANT is that non-human actors of any kind must be
						considered, though not as preconceived constructs of the researcher.
						Instead, they must be discernible in the text as objects, motives, ideas, or
						clusters of them and human actors, conceived by the author or actors
						themselves at least in an indirect way.<note> A central manifesto of ANT is the book by Latour (2007). See
								also the research report by Vicsek, Király, Kónya (2016) and the
								collection of articles which is consecrated to ANT in history:
								Füssel, Neu (2021).</note> The non-human actors to be defined by
						us according to the ANT mostly were too vague to be palpable and
						unequivocally identifiable in the text of the travelogue. Consequently, they
						could not be tagged and the tight connection of TEI tags and the database
						could be lost. Furthermore, our design pattern so far did not provide
						non-human actors. Let us give an example: When mentioning that women in a
						Riga banquet (Bronner 1810, August 30) sat around the housewife, Bronner
						clearly spoke about a kind of segregation of sexes. This was not the only
						time Bronner mentioned it, also in the Baltic (Bronner 1810, August 26), he
						wondered that domestic servants and poor travellers of all sexes shared the
						same main room of an inn. In this example, too, he refers to a norm of
						segregation of sexes he was accustomed to from his native German households
						regardless of their wealth. We therefore have, according to ANT, to consider
						different norms of segregation of sexes as “actors”: two norms of Baltic
						origins and Bronner’s accustomed norms which he brought with him from
						Germany and Switzerland. As non-human actors these norms interact with
						people who are sharing them or not acting accordingly. </p>
               <p>Since agency can be assumed as a unitary action
						of exerting influence, we decided to treat it with the frame-inspired
						modelling approach. The representation consists so far of two actors, an
						activity (using the <hi rend="italic">Activity Types</hi> classification
						system), a determinator of strength ranging from 1 to 3, and the definition
						of direction. We also provided for the possibility of clustering several
						actors into one as an important requirement of ANT. Some actor-centred
						activity types had to be added, among them, of course, such that relate to
						non-human actors. In ANT, they are conceived vaguely in terms of
						“participation” which can be grasped via thematic roles in the frame
						semantics framework. But a person can set pressure upon another person by
						intentionally appealing to, say, a legal or moral norm, and that norm, in
						consequence, may become coercive – or just for this reason provoke
						resistance.</p>

            <head>5. Connecting
						TEI and CRM: Related Work</head>
            <p>To conclude the research, we will in the following
					give a short overview of the possibilities of connecting TEI and ontologies. We
					briefly present advantages and disadvantages as well as the different focal
					points of the introduced tools. </p>
            <p>Eide (2014) discusses six different ways of linking
					between TEI text and Resource Description Framework (RDF) data. He proposes an
					approach to link RDF data modelling conforming to a CRM data model to a TEI
					document and a specific TEI element in it (see fig. 7 in Eide 2014). A
					straightforward approach to interconnect the named entities (the traveller,
					departure place, destination place, roads, vehicles, etc.) with their
					corresponding representations in the database is to use XPath Selector to link
					from the RDF representations of the entities to the related TEI tag. Another
					approach would be to use the W3C Annotation Data Model to connect TEI and
					RDF/XML data (cf. Borriello et al. 2016).</p>
            <p>Annotation tools like brat or INCEpTION can be used
					for visual annotation of the frame-based n-ary relations of ontology design
					patterns (see fig. 4).</p>

						ontology design pattern for travels and activities by means of an annotation
						scheme configured for the tool brat</hi>
            </p>
            <p>From a usability perspective, an important benefit
					of the n-ary structure of the frame-oriented annotation scheme is that it keeps
					the manual annotation process simple. It would be quite more cumbersome to
					annotate events based on an ontology with extensive role-based modelling of
					activities of the traveller. EARMARK (Barabucci et al. 2013) representation (see
					fig. 5) of annotations in LEAF-Writer<note>
                  <ref target="https://leaf-writer.leaf-vre.org/">https://leaf-writer.leaf-vre.org/</ref>
               </note> would
					allow stand-off markup for the semantic annotation of the n-ary relations.  In
					the light of recent progress in the natural language processing tasks of frame
					detection and semantic role labelling (see reference to TakeFive below),
					frame-based semantic annotation may serve as an intermediate layer in digital
					edition projects in the long run.</p>

            </p>
            <p>Overall, there are some examples such as the
					Hellespont project (Mambrini 2016) or the Semantic Blumenbach edition
					(Wettlaufer et al. 2015), linking TEI encoded text and CRM modelled data,
					however, our approach goes beyond the existing projects due to the development
					and application of ontology design patterns for more explicit data modelling and
					categorization.</p>
            <p>The Linked Traces<note>
                  <ref target="https://github.com/LinkedPasts/linked-traces-format">https://github.com/LinkedPasts/linked-traces-format</ref>
               </note>
					annotation model utilises the W3C Web Annotation Data Model to trace places
					which were waypoints of a journey. We consider Linked Traces as a data model for
					data exchange and visualisation purposes because of its GeoJSON compatibility
					via the underlying Linked Places format (Grossner, Berman, and Simon 2017).
					However, due to its limited granularity and expressiveness it is not appropriate
					for primary data management and knowledge representation and was therefore not
					considered to be used for building the database in our project.</p>
            <p>There is a CRM application profile to model travel
					events: The profile from the <hi rend="italic">SDHSS Voyage, movement, transport
						and displacement</hi> project is provided via the OntoME ontology management
					environment (Beretta 2021) and is also used in the virtual research environment
					Geovistory (Beretta et al. 2019).<note>
							Ontological problems of CRM’s taxonomy are out of the scope of this
							paper (see ontological analysis by Sanfilippo and Perrine Pittet 2020).
							We are aware of issues with the definition and meaning of the class
							crm:E53_Place. SDHSS tries to overcome these problems with its new class
							sdh:C13_Geographical_Place: <ref target="https://ontome.net/class/364/namespace/3">https://ontome.net/class/364/namespace/3</ref>
               </note>.
					Regarding the modelling of social interactions during travels and stopovers, the
					social relations between persons for example could in principle be modelled with
					the pattern proposed by Hart, Brouillet, and Michon (2021). Their relationship
					pattern (see Hart, Brouillet, and Michon 2021, fig. 12) uses the class crm:E7_Activity with an
					according classification system to typify an particular activity via the
					property crm:P2_has_type
					and the class crm:PC14_carried_out_by (from the CRMpc extension) for role-based
					modelling of an actor’s role played in the activity. The application of the
					relationship pattern would be more demanding for semantic annotation because of
					the additional explicit modelling and classification of roles (via the crm:P14.1_in_the_role_of
					property).</p>
            <p>TakeFive is a method for semantic role labelling
					which “transforms a text into a frame-oriented knowledge graph” (Alam et al.
					2021, p. 309). Frames could become part of semantic editing processes in the
					long run (see section 5). Besides natural language processing resources for
					named entity recognition and disambiguation this would mean to use frame
					ontologies like FrameBase (Rouces, de Melo, and Hose 2015) or Framester (Gangemi
					et al. 2016) in a digital editing environment.</p>

            <head>7. Conclusion and Future Work</head>
            <p>To reach our goal, based on the requirements of user
					stories and competency questions we had to make a pragmatic modelling decision:
					building subclasses for modelling genuine travel events (dto:Travel,
					dto:Stopover as well as dto:Transport) and using more general classes (as
					subclasses of the CRM class crm:E7_Activity) to model activities and type them
					with categories from classification systems. The subclasses are oriented on
					FrameNet frames. The event type specific properties of the subclasses are based
					on the frame elements and therefore represent semantic roles. Ontology design
					patterns enables and enforces to enrich text with data in a consistent way and
					thereby help to produce interoperable and reusable digital editions of
					historical travelogues. Furthermore, throughout the ontology-based semantic
					annotation process SKOS vocabularies ensure a standardised way of applying
					categories for curation and research.</p>
            <p>To be more specific: digital editions of travelogues
					can be enriched with ontology-based semantic annotations not only in the sense
					of modelling for production — ie. creating digital edition of a historical
					travelogue enriched with explicitly modelled travel events and activities during
					the travel and stopovers — but also in the sense of modelling for understanding by
					adding categorizations or data model — e.g., for suitable for a special
					methodology like social network analysis or actor-network theory — in order to
					answer a new research question in a new iteration of the historical information
					life cycle.<note> Eide (2014) uses the
							distinction between modelling for production and modelling for
							understanding in the context of TEI encoding (as a form of modelling) of
							texts. We extend this distinction to the use of TEI editing combined
							with ontology-based modelling of the most essential elements relevant
							for production <hi rend="italic">and</hi> understanding of the
						text.</note>
            </p>
            <p>Whereas the categories from the straightforward
					classification systems and controlled vocabularies <hi rend="italic">Travel
						Types</hi>, <hi rend="italic">Stopover Types</hi>, <hi rend="italic">Mode of
						Transportation</hi>, <hi rend="italic">Measurement Units</hi> etc. are used
					as concepts to specify travels (and parts of travels), their modes of
					transportation, and their dimensions like the travel distance etc., as well as
					stopovers, the activities of the traveller have to be specified by
					activity-specific categories: for example perception activities are typified
					with concepts from the <hi rend="italic">Perception Types</hi> concept scheme.
					These concepts are used as analytical concepts for further analysis.<note> As the handling of terms in the
							context of this DHQ special issue’s topic “Working on and with
							Categories for Text Analysis” may not always be consistent throughout
							presentations, see the ISKO Encyclopedia of Knowledge Organization
							article “Classification” for an elaborately account on definitions of

            <p>At its current state the OWL &amp; SHACL ontology
					design patterns as well as the according SKOS classification systems and
					controlled vocabularies are in continuous development and are therefore not yet
					published.</p>
            <p>Besides the ontology design patterns and knowledge
					organisation systems, a main deliverable of the project is a modular digital
					research infrastructure for the creation and distribution of digital editions of
					historical travelogues. A useful component to be integrated in the prospective
					modular research infrastructure for the retrieval phase in the research data
					life cycle of a digital travelogue edition is Sparql2GraphServer: a server-side
					tool which allows to construct graph data from RDF data (Leskinen, Hyvönen, and
					Tuominen 2021). This is achieved by defining extraction patterns (Ghawi and
					Pfeffer 2020) to extract data in Cytoscape.js compatible JSON response format or
					in GraphML export format.</p>
