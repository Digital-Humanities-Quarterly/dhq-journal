                  <p>From the late 1940s onwards, humanities scholars used computers in order to create
                     new types of research
                     					instruments, e.g., databases, digital scholarly editions of texts and/or archives,
                     computer programs, etc. Their
                     					ambitions in doing so consisted in saving time in tedious, repetitive and error-prone
                     scholarly tasks, enhancing
                     					the circulation of data and/or scholarly information, or even contributing to
                     the “progress” of an entire
                     					discipline. Sharing these research instruments with interested colleagues was
                     then crucial for these scholars.
                     					However, each of these humanities computing collectives developed at the time
                     its own idiosyncratic procedures for
                     					editing, analyzing, and publishing computer-recorded material. This profoundly
                     affected the possibility for these
                     					research instruments to circulate among scholars.</p>
                  				
                  <p>In this article, I present how medievalists debated about a possible circulation of
                     these digital research
                     					instrument in that context, and how it contributes to the development of an early
                     “humanities computing”
                     					organization in Europe. I show how medievalists’ ambitions raised a whole series
                     of material and intellectual
                     					difficulties which are still essential in our current DH practices and organizations.
                     What data should we edit (and
                     					thus, what data are worth sharing)? In what form should we publish these datasets?
                     And do we need common rules for
                     					this purpose? I argue that a precise history of early DH communities highlights
                     a strong continuity with
                     					contemporary DH issues as well as the importance of historical studies of our
                     field.</p>

                        He then identified two

                              							or syntax presented by a work or an author, the essential concern of the historian
                              is to grasp the content,
                              							i.e., the purely documentary aspect of a text, that is in any case devoid of
                              literary value and most often

                     					collection of documents since they may involve smaller sets of sources. Then,
                     the instruments developed in these

                     any intention to produce
                     					material that could be shared outside the working group. The possibilities of

                     					research instruments were therefore quite different from those of the documentary

                        in hand with the question
                        						of making these research instruments available. In the conclusion of the proceedings,
                        Genicot stressed another
                        						dimension of this same issue: 
                        <blockquote>
                           <p>Should concordances of various types be drawn up, and
                              							distributed in book form, as was done by the Centre de traitement électronique
                              des documents, the Cetedoc of
                              							Louvain for Lateran IV or Vatican II? Or do we just keep the list on the computer
                              and offer to take a copy at
                              							their own expense? Or simply transfer the text or analysis to tapes and disks
                              and make them accessible to those
                              							interested? [<a class="ref" href="#genicot1977">Genicot 1977</a>, 430]
                              						</p>
                        </blockquote> These various ways of publishing research instruments were also instrumental in debates
                        about how to
                        						share and make available the products of computer use. While Genicot considered
                        paper publication to be “the
                        							best” solution, he pointed out that its high cost prevents its systematic application.
                        In the case of lack
                        						of funds, it could be sufficient, according to him, to “make it known that a set has been
                        							entered into the machine according to such and such modalities and that it
                        can be consulted under such and such
                        							conditions”

                     					within the discipline. However, I have highlighted that very different rationales
                     were defended in the pursuit of
                     					that goal. Genicot and Fossier’s agenda differed on several points:

                  <div class="ptext" id="p82">My study underlines that two distinct attitudes were adopted. On one hand, Genicot
                     imagined a normative framework
                     					that would aim at defining common rules and standards for the early users of
                     computers in the field. On the other
                     					hand, Fossier did not propose any rules or standards. As I have shown, her empirical
                     approach led her to identify
                     					medievalists’ difficulties. She then created a new canal of communication that
                     will aim at helping or convincing
                     					the scholars who hesitated or were wishing for help: <cite class="title italic">Le Médiéviste et

                     another approach to the history
                     					of early DH than the ones developed since the early 21th century [<a class="ref" href="#hockey2004">Hockey 2004</a>]

                     					application designed by the actors. In that perspective, this case-study underlines
                     that early DH practitioners did
                     					not organize collectively only because of common practices nor methodologies,
                     but mainly because they faced common
                     					difficulties in the access to the information about these original practices.</div>

                  <div class="ptext" id="p84">Second, it suggests that distinct early DH networks arose from distinct rationales
                     before they eventually joined
                     					together to discuss the purpose of a more general framework. This implies that
                     early DH historians need to focus
                     					both on the rationales at stake in each of these networks and on the purpose
                     of a more general computer-related
                     					framework in the pre-existent discipline. In doing so, we might draw a better
                     picture of the early field, which
                     					needs to be considered more as a tree structure than a traditional historical

                     					great benefit in order to fight some of the actual criticism that DH face in
                     the academic world. By focusing on the
                     					rationales at stake in early DH history, I am able to show that DH is not just
                     a label nor a power network [<a class="ref" href="#kirschenbaum2012a">Kirschenbaum 2012a</a>]. DH are the results of a collective organization of researchers debating about

                  <div class="ptext" id="p86">One of the most important debates since the early 2010s is notably the definition
                     of the perimeter of the field.
                     					This debate has been dramatically complicated by the huge development of personal
                     computing and the massive uses of
                     					computers since the 1990s. Moreover, almost every collective in the humanities
                     now produced digital research
                     					instruments in the course of their research, either because of tacit injunctions
                     or data regulations policies. In
                     					that context, how should we consider the specificities of DH practices? And what
                     is the role of DH communities in

                     re-use of digital research

                     digital practices in the humanities.
                     					We also need to engage with a reflexive work on massive development of digital
