                  <p>There are a number of fruitful digital humanities approaches to cinema and media
                     studies, but most of them only pursue traditional forms of scholarship by
                     extracting a single variable from the audiovisual text that is already legible
                     to scholars. As an alternative, cinema and media studies should pursue a
                     mostly-ignored "digital surrealism" that uses computer-based methods to
                     transform film texts in radical ways not previously possible. This article
                     describes one such method using the z-projection function of the scientific
                     image analysis software ImageJ to sum film frames in order to create new
                     composite images. Working with the fifty-five feature-length films from Walt
                     Disney Animation Studios, I describe how this method allows for a unique
                     understanding of a film corpus not otherwise available to cinema and media
                     studies scholars.

               <div class="counter"><a href="#p1">1</a></div>
               <div class="ptext" id="p1">There are quite a number of fruitful digital humanities approaches to cinema and
                  media studies, which vary widely from aesthetic techniques of visualizing color and
                  form within shots to data-driven metrics approaches analyzing editing patterns.
                  Despite their methodological differences, what all these approaches have in common
                  is the reduction of the complex film or television text — image, sound, editing,
                  production history, reception, paratext — to a more limited set of manageable
                  variables: color palette, scripted dialogue, average shot length, budgets, box
                  office results, or social media presence. While any digital humanities project
                  requires the reduction of a complex set of textual elements to a smaller set of
                  abstracted variables, cinema and media studies poses a special challenge to the
                  digital humanist since film and television objects are composed of disparate
                  elements that are as challenging to reconcile as they are to pull apart. That is,
                  it
                  is relatively easy to separate an image from its soundtrack and then do something
                  like time the length of shots, but such a method obscures for the digital humanist
                  the otherwise intractable complexities of film and television texts. While projects
                  that perform textual analysis of a set of screenplays, or that map the relationships
                  between actors and industrial figures, or that compare cutting rates across time
                  periods all acknowledge the limitations of their approaches, they nonetheless
                  reinforce the sense of film and television as a dis-integrated medium whose
                  constituent parts can be analyzed discretely.

               <div class="counter"><a href="#p2">2</a></div>
               <div class="ptext" id="p2">Before readers imagine that I have discovered a solution to this difficult problem,
                  I
                  admit that the film studies work which I describe here is subject to the same
                  criticism, for the same reason I began with: that the digital humanist must make an
                  initial decision about which components to abstract and represent, and in doing so
                  must by necessity omit others. There is not yet something like a "principal
                  components analysis"<a class="noteRef" href="#d4e170">[1]</a> for the media text which can account for the inherent
                  diversity of the physical object. But rather than only pursue digital forms of
                  traditional methods that are already legible to the cinema and media studies scholar
                  (like projects that simply use computers to more efficiently analyze screenplays or
                  editing patterns or industrial business histories),<a class="noteRef" href="#d4e181">[2]</a> what I
                  propose instead is something weirder. To borrow from Stephen Ramsay’s call for a "hermeneutics of screwing around,"
                   [<a class="ref" href="#ramsay2014">Ramsay 2014</a>] I propose a digital humanities project that is more aleatory and aesthetic
                  than it is formal and constrained. This fits within the framework of "deformative
                  criticism," which has emerged as an innovative site of critical practice
                  within media studies and digital humanities, revealing new insights into media texts
                  by "breaking" them in controlled or chaotic ways. Deformance includes a wide
                  range of digital experiments that generate heretical and non-normative readings of
                  media texts; because the results of these experiments are impossible to know in
                  advance, they shift the boundaries of critical scholarship [<a class="ref" href="#samuels1999">Samuels and McGann 1999</a>]. Thus, deformative criticism offers a crucial venue for
                  defining not only contemporary scholarly practice, but also media studies’ growing
                  relationship to digital humanities. So, rather than reduce the film or television
                  text to one of a well-established list of "components" such as the shot or the
                  cut or the soundtrack in order to extract individual "elements," how might we
                  abstract the film or television text so that it is presented to us in a radically
                  new way? How can we transform the object of study into something which retains the
                  organic features of the original, but which is freed from the burdening
                  over-recognition of form? How can we create something from cinema which is familiar
                  but unrecognizable?

               <div class="ptext" id="p3">Here, I describe my method and theory for creating and interpreting "summed frame
                  z-projections" of films. In this process, I compress the visual field of a
                  film into a single image in order to compare a corpus of summed frames and create
                  new avenues of scholarly research. I call this technique "digital surrealism,"
                  since it creates images by means of an automatic process which reveals otherwise
                  unconscious information about film texts. While the resulting images on their own
                  are aesthetically pleasing, a comparative analysis of a corpus of summed images can
                  generate new analytical modes for digital humanists who work with image analysis,
                  raising new, comparative, second-order questions that come out of this
                  digitally-aided abstraction.

                  <div class="ptext" id="p4">I took for my corpus the fifty-five animated feature films produced between 1937
                     and 2016 by what is now known as Walt Disney Animation Studios.<a class="noteRef" href="#d4e241">[3]</a> These include well-known, wildly successful
                     "classics" such as the first feature-length cel animation <cite class="title italic">Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs</cite>, Disney’s first
                     original story <cite class="title italic">The Lion King</cite>, and Disney’s most
                     successful film <cite class="title italic">Frozen</cite>, as well as relatively
                     unexamined films like the Latin American compilation <cite class="title italic">Saludos Amigos</cite>, the commercial and critical failure of <cite class="title italic">The Black Cauldron</cite>, and Disney’s first full
                     computer-animation <cite class="title italic">Chicken Little</cite>. One might expect
                     digital manipulations of animated films to look different from live-action
                     films, but I was surprised that my digital surrealist research strategy revealed
                     very little difference between these two modes of narrative cinema. I have done
                     similar research on a corpus of fifty-four live-action films from the western
                     genre (1993–2007), forty-two gialli (1956–2013), and the twenty-six Japanese
                     <span class="foreign i">Zatoichi</span> films (1962–89), and observed
                     remarkably similar tendencies to those I found in the Disney corpus [<a class="ref" href="#ferguson2016">Ferguson 2016</a>]. The fifty-five Disney films offer a particularly
                     rich corpus for digital surrealist investigation: despite the often rocky
                     history of the studio’s management, Disney is and has been the most important,
                     innovative animation studio ever, releasing a film on average every seventeen
                     months over the last eight decades and pioneering many significant,
                     groundbreaking, and influential animation techniques like fully synchronized
                     sound, three-strip Technicolor, the multiplane camera, multi-channel sound,
                     CinemaScope, and numerous software engineering techniques. As a part of the
                     larger Walt Disney Company media conglomerate (after Comcast, Disney is the
                     second largest media conglomerate in the world by revenue), Walt Disney
                     Animation Studios also plays a significant role in a global marketing juggernaut
                     that continues to shape both multinational industrial media practices and the
                     proliferation of American cultural exports. Indeed, as early as 1934, Walt
                     Disney worked with the United States government to promote cultural exchange
                     with Latin America through feature animation and "by 1943, 94 percent of all the footage produced by the
                     Disney Studio was done under government contract"
                      [<a class="ref" href="#shale1982">Shale 1982</a>, 24]. We can thus reasonably expect the corpus of Walt Disney Animation
                     Studios to represent both a broad range of historical innovation in animation as
                     well as a consistent, calculated, family-oriented production strategy.

                  <div class="ptext" id="p5">Inspired by Lev Manovich’s Software Studies Initiative, I use as my primary tool
                     ImageJ, a public domain scientific image analysis software program developed by
                     the National Institute of Health that works with an increasing library of
                     user-created plugins. ImageJ can process a variety of image types, facilitating
                     simple tasks like scaling, rotation, and contrast adjustments as well as much
                     more highly technical operations such as "morphological data
                     mining,"
                     "trabecular geometry and whole bone shape analysis,"
                     and "comparison of intensity ratios between nuclei and
                     cytoplasm"
                      [<a class="ref" href="#ferreira2010">Ferreira and Rasband 2010–2012</a>]. ImageJ is customizable with any number of plugins and macros, and like
                     other advanced image processing programs such as Photoshop, even its basic menu
                     can be bewildering. For the purpose of analyzing moving images, ImageJ’s most
                     useful functions are found in its Stacks menu; stacks are "multiple spatially or temporally related images," called "slices," that are displayed in a single window [<a class="ref" href="#ferreira2010">Ferreira and Rasband 2010–2012</a>, 12]. Imagine neatly cutting out each frame
                     from a brief filmstrip and stacking them up in sequential order so that you are
                     left with a three-dimensional volume. In effect, ImageJ does this digitally, but
                     it can also analyze each slice as it relates to the entire stack: "in stacks, a pixel (which represents 2D image data in a
                     bitmap image) becomes a voxel (volumetric pixel), i.e., an intensity
                     value on a regular grid in a three dimensional space"
                      [<a class="ref" href="#ferreira2010">Ferreira and Rasband 2010–2012</a>, 12]. That is, with stacks, ImageJ can not only analyze the two dimensions of
                     an individual film frame, but can also analyze any slice or line through the
                     third dimension of the stacked film frames. One typical application of ImageJ is
                     with spatially related images, like those produced by confocal microscopy, where
                     a complete in-focus image of an object is built up from a stack of partially
                     in-focus slices, or for various forms of medical tomography like PET or CAT
                     scans, where successive scans of slices of the interior of the body are stacked
                     to model a hidden structure. In these examples, it is desirable for the captured
                     object to remain as still as possible to get an accurate rendering. So, applying
                     these methods to large stacks of temporally related but spatially unrelated film
                     slices, which not only have moving objects but also numerous scene transitions
                     and framings, leads to unpredictable results. In effect, we are converting the
                     dimension of time that we experience while watching a two-dimensional motion
                     picture into a third spatial dimension that can also be analyzed.<a class="noteRef" href="#d4e1230">[4]</a>

                  <div class="ptext" id="p6">To create a stack in ImageJ, users can import in a number of ways: a video file,
                     an animated gif, or an image sequence. Due to processor memory limitations, most
                     users will find the simplest strategy is to create a folder of "stills" to
                     import; I use Quicktime Player 7’s Export feature, selecting the option "movie
                     to image sequence" to generate a folder of sequential jpegs. For this
                     project, I created image sequences at 0.5 frames per second, or one frame every
                     two seconds.<a class="noteRef" href="#d4e1252">[5]</a> For a 90-minute film, this results in an evenly-distributed
                     sampling of 2,700 frames. I removed errant black frames from the beginning and
                     end of the stack as well as distributor and production logos that were later
                     added for home video release (but kept production or studio logos that are
                     integrated into the opening or closing credits). For example, here is a

                  <div class="ptext" id="p7">Once these slices are imported into ImageJ as a stack, there are any number of
                     manipulations users can perform on a film. Here I describe only one — summed
                     z-projections — which achieve my digital surrealist aim of transforming the film
                     text into a new object of research. This process visualizes films in ways that
                     were otherwise impossible for humans through most of the last century, capturing
                     the extreme boundaries of the moving image and collapsing all of the frames into
                     a single space. ImageJ offers six z-projection methods for creating a flattened,
                     two-dimensional image from the three-dimensional stack: average intensity,
                     maximum intensity, minimum intensity, sum slices, standard deviation, and
                     median. Each projection type works by performing a different mathematical
                     operation on the RGB (red, green, blue) values of each voxel in the image,
                     examining the same pixel location for every slice in a stack.<a class="noteRef" href="#d4e1272">[6]</a>
                     Thus, Minimum and Maximum Intensity simply print the darkest or brightest pixel
                     for each coordinate, while Average and Median Intensity print the pixel color
                     somewhere in the middle and Standard Deviation a new pixel representing,
                     obviously, the standard deviation of all the pixels along a particular
                     coordinate. The one I am most interested in is Sum Slices, which adds together
                     the voxel space of the stack of slices, compressing the film’s visual field to
                     reveal a single representative image. Below is a simple demonstration of the six
                     operations on a small twenty-frame stack.

                  <div class="ptext" id="p8">What does it mean to "sum" a film, to "add it up"? Cinema is excessive:
                     there is too much, either along the diachronic or synchronic axes, for viewers
                     to be able to process the moving image without recourse to a science like
                     mathematics or an art like theory. While most audiences and reviewers would not
                     think specifically of math while watching a narrative film (outside of box
                     office results), mathematical metaphors abound in discussions of film. For
                     instance, contemporary reviews often "sum up" movies, resulting in an image
                     of cinema as having unlike component parts that need to be added together in
                     order to make sense: the acting was good, the dialogue worse, the soundtrack
                     better. An informal search of the film critic Roger Ebert’s website (<a class="ref" href="http://www.rogerebert.com/" onclick="window.open('http://www.rogerebert.com/'); return false">http://www.rogerebert.com/</a>) finds
                     seventy-four uses of the phrase "doesn’t add up" to describe the failures
                     of movies under review. Even the director Sergei Eisenstein, in famously
                     explaining how hieroglyphics inform his theory of montage, resorts to math: "the point is that [the combination] of two hieroglyphs
                     of the simplest series is to be regarded not as their sum, but as their
                     product"
                      [<a class="ref" href="#eisenstein1949">Eisenstein 1949</a>, 29–30]. Rejecting simple addition for complex multiplication, for Eisenstein
                     cinema comes partly from the world of numbers: shots proportioned, framings
                     balanced (or not), and all aspects directly measurable, as in his well-known
                     audiovisual notation of a scene from his film <cite class="title italic">Alexander

                  <div class="ptext" id="p9">While my summed images erase montage and the possibility of two specific images
                     colliding to produce a third dialectical meaning, they do democratize the film’s
                     images in a way that is impossible to imagine while watching, collapsing with a
                     grander equation the important and unimportant, the major and minor, the dark
                     and bright. In these images, all that is left is the trace of the filmmaker’s
                     intentions; even a master like Eisenstein is unable to direct the viewer’s
                     attention to anything other than the sum of everything photographed, intentional
                     or accidental. While collapsing the film text to a single frame might initially
                     strike some as overly reductive, this process magnifies a cinematic experience
                     that is otherwise entirely unnoticeable: the pure, cumulative effect of duration
                     on our eyes and brains without the distraction of narrative or image.
                     Photographer Hiroshi Sugimoto, known for <cite class="title italic">Theaters</cite>,
                     a series of long-exposure photographs of movie theaters lit only by the light
                     reflected off the screen, is also interested in trying to capture the time of a
                     whole film in a single image. Conceptually my work is similar to his, but his
                     process results in black-and-white images with luminous, blank screens, whereas
                     mine reveal color, shading, and depth. Last, I point to artists Jason Salavon
                     and Jim Campbell, who independently worked with statistical processes and
                     averaging in the late 1990s and 2000s on collections of yearbook photos, <cite class="title italic">Playboy</cite> centerfolds, Dutch paintings, novel pages, and
                     films. My use of digital surrealism as a media studies research strategy is thus
                     is conversation with an artistic tradition of visual analysis of groups of
                     images.

                     a wide range of styles, techniques, and years. As a form of scholarship or
                     criticism, then, we would begin simply by comparing and contrasting our
                     transformed films, articulating the final effect and questioning what
                     differences in production might have resulted in the subtle differences in the
                     final result. Thus, glancing at the corpus, one aspect readers will likely
                     notice immediately is the strong symmetry of these images. The majority of them
                     feature a lighter, horizontally central shape on a differently-hued background
                     with a varying degree of darker shaded vignetting in the corners. For example,
                     22 <cite class="title italic">The Many Adventures of Winnie the Pooh</cite> has a
                     very recognizably Pooh-shaped blob smack in the center of a sky blue background
                     and darkened corners and bottom. Likewise, 14 <cite class="title italic">Peter
                        Pan</cite> has a glowing off-white central shape that falls off into blue
                     hues on the left and brown ones on the right, with strong vignetting in the
                     corners and along the top of the image. Forty-three <cite class="title italic">Treasure Island</cite> shows a very distinct yellow central shape
                     surrounded by deep blue with darker magenta in the lower corners. But of the
                     symmetrical center shapes, 13 <cite class="title italic">Alice in Wonderland</cite>
                     is the most remarkable: rather than the triangular pale blobbiness of the
                     others, the central shape here indistinctly shows both Alice’s straw hair and
                     faint blue dress below.

                     summed frames to gain information about framing choices or emphasis on specific
                     characters. For example, we could conclude that <cite class="title italic">Alice in
                        Wonderland</cite> is the Disney film that most consistently frames the
                     titular character, and that it does so to an unusual degree compared to the
                     other films (and to almost all of the other non-Disney films I have analyzed).
                     This is not something that viewers could have intuited across the entire corpus,

                     <cite class="title italic">Frozen</cite>, we see clear evidence of an unusual
                     (for Disney) choice to frame two characters in closeup for extended periods of

                     a darkening of the periphery of an image caused by insufficient
                     light.<a class="noteRef" href="#d4e1520">[8]</a> Vignetting is most pronounced in 14
                     <cite class="title italic">Peter Pan</cite>, 28 <cite class="title italic">The Little
                        Mermaid</cite>, 29 <cite class="title italic">Beauty and the Beast</cite>, and
                     49 <cite class="title italic">The Princess and the Frog</cite>. Compare those four

                     that runs seamlessly to the edges without significant darkening. I attribute
                     this difference both to the conventional wisdom of the cinematic dominant, that
                     moviegoers’ attention can be drawn to the most important subject by making it
                     the best lit, and that the four unvignetted films take place primarily outdoors,
                     while those with vignettes occur inside or in darker, secluded locations. <cite class="title italic">Pocahontas</cite> and <cite class="title italic">Hercules</cite>
                     are nearly identical in this respect, and their sky-blue backgrounds are
                     obviously evident in the summed frame, compared to the relatively shadowed and
                     clouded undersea kingdom of <cite class="title italic">The Little Mermaid</cite> or
                     the forest and castle interiors of <cite class="title italic">Beauty and the
                        Beast</cite>. Vignetting is traditionally considered a problem in
                     photography, with the ideal photograph showing a consistent range of tones all
                     the way to the edge. Obviously, animated films need not suffer from this optical
                     problem, and so many of the images that display strong vignetting do so
                     intentionally in an attempt to imitate a vignetted "historical" look or to
                     illustrate how a scene is artificially lit and to direct the spectator’s
                     attention to the privileged center of the frame. An example from <cite class="title italic">The Princess and the Frog</cite> shows this common strategy,
                     where the central characters in this shot are brightly lit while the background
                     dancers and setting are increasingly (and unrealistically) darker as we move to
                     the edges.

                     compositions, the animation emphasizes vibrant gradient backgrounds, established

                     colored, and changing backgrounds. Thus, compared to the rest of the corpus, the

                     since he himself is asymmetrical, with a hump on his right side, his
                     characteristic features are best portrayed when he occupies the left of the

                  <div class="ptext" id="p26">Closer investigation of the film’s slices shows asymmetry is a visual theme
                     throughout — for instance, Esmerelda wears only one hoop earring in her left ear
                     with a hair scarf dangling on the right and a thicket of bracelets on her left
                     arm offset by a lone bracelet on her right wrist — and the summed image supports
                     this strikingly by showing how often Quasimodo’s back and hump occupies the left
                     third of the frame, even as his face is centered. While we would expect
                     anthology films unintentionally to appear unbalanced given the varying range of
                     source material, we can see clearly in the summed image from <cite class="title italic">The Hunchback of Notre Dame</cite> how carefully the
                     animators worked to create a dominant visual asymmetry for framing Quasimodo and
                     how this is a wholly unique strategy in the Disney corpus. Since Disney’s
                     typical visual strategy is almost entirely conservative, framing characters
                     centrally or following the rule of thirds, we can see just how unique <cite class="title italic">The Hunchback of Notre Dame</cite> is visually, crowding its
                     protagonist’s unruly body to the side. In this way, inspecting the summed frames
                     and accounting for unexpected details allows researchers to pursue new questions
                     from empirical evidence or visually confirm an intuitive hunch.

                     forest floor than it has medium or closeup shots of characters that do not show
                     the ground. This makes some sense for a film like <cite class="title italic">Bambi</cite>, focused on placing a young character in his woodland
                     environment and detailing his interactions with smaller, ground-dwelling forest
                     creatures. And yet, the forest floor in <cite class="title italic">Bambi</cite> is
                     not particularly black, and the film often captures a downward-looking
                     perspective so that the forest floor occupies much of the frame, not just the
                     bottom ribbon.

                     but what they do have in common is that they illustrate the second way that text
                     appears in the summed images, namely, as title or closing credits. In the case

                        Hood</cite>, the fashion at the time was to list production credits at the
                     beginning of the film rather than the end, and so the credits remain on the
                     screen long enough to be amplified in the summed image; for instance, in the
                     case of <cite class="title italic">The Rescuers</cite>, the phrase "With the voice talents of" remains for 16 slices (0.72%
                     of summed frames) while the cast list changes. Interestingly, a film with the
                     same credit sequence strategy, 20 <cite class="title italic">The Aristocats</cite>,
                     does not visibly display text in the summed image, perhaps because the text is
                     in black but on a darker background and thus less distinct (see Figure 39).

                  <div class="ptext" id="p51">Art critic Clement Greenberg championed Rothko’s work as part of a "color field" tradition, which used uninflected color to
                     collapse traditional differences between figure and ground. The summed images I
                     produced achieve in related ways this effect, but are built out of some of the
                     most figural images available. I think the summed z-projections evoke the
                     tradition of Rothko and Newman’s work with color, but on another version of a
                     similar project, Kevin Oleary pointed out to me how similar these summed images
                     are to an earlier tradition — the paintings of English Romanticist J. M. W.
                     Turner, such as his later work <cite class="title italic">Venice with the

                  <div class="ptext" id="p52">So far I have focused on the shapes of these images, but with Turner and the
                     Color Field painters in mind I want to turn to a brief analysis of the color of
                     these images. Below are two simple graphs of all the summed frames created using
                     ImageJ’s ImagePlot macro, plotted first by median hue on the x-axis and median
                     brightness on the y-axis, and then by standard deviation hue on the x-axis with
                     standard deviation brightness on the y-axis. This allows us to more analytically
                     compare the summed frames. We thus expect to see a horizontal distribution of
                     images in the rainbow spectrum of hues (i.e., from red on the left through green
                     in the middle to violet on the right), with brighter images moving upwards.
                     While sourcing and creating digital copies of these texts from DVDs, I
                     discovered that older, softer prints often resulted in lighter summed
                     z-projections. I also question how accurately color was reproduced in
                     transferring older films to home video format, particularly whether or not the
                     color was balanced properly and whether the proper color saturation was achieved
                     (and to that matter, who would be the authority on the "proper" color of an
                     eighty-year-old print and what it means to speak of a film’s projected
                     brightness, which comes down to the age and brand of the light bulbs in the
                     projectors which originally screened these films). So we should be careful not
                     to read too much into our results when comparing films to each other, although
                     we can immediately see patterns and outliers of interest.

                     similarly hued films: the airy blue in the upper right corner that I have
                     discussed, but also the surprising similarity in the upper left between comic
                     western 45 <cite class="title italic">Home on the Range</cite> and the
                     video game world of 52 <cite class="title italic">Wreck-It Ralph</cite>, whose long
                     outdoors sequences in desert-like Sugar Rush Kingdom influenced the hue. The
                     majority of the films are clearly within the blue register, in a tall stack
                     ascending from 14 <cite class="title italic">Peter Pan</cite> to 35 <cite class="title italic">Hercules</cite>, but there is also quite a bit of variance in hue that covers
                     the spectrum almost completely<cite class="title italic">. </cite>02
                     <cite class="title italic">Pinocchio</cite>, whose image looks rather plain and flat,
                     is uniquely the most violet-hued, even more so than the brighter 36
                     <cite class="title italic">Mulan</cite> which has clearer areas of
                     purple. Many pairs of films are practically on top of each other, such as 40 <cite class="title italic">The Emperor’s New Groove</cite> and 34
                     <cite class="title italic">The Hunchback of Notre Dame</cite>, 21 <cite class="title italic">Robin Hood</cite> and 27 <cite class="title italic">Oliver &amp;
                        Company</cite>, and 18 <cite class="title italic">The Sword in the Stone</cite> and 31
                     <cite class="title italic">Aladdin</cite>; remarkably, each of these pairings were
                     separated by at least five other releases, suggesting that while the summed
                     frames can be surprisingly similar this is not necessarily due to the same
                     animators or production methods (for instance, <cite class="title italic">The Sword in
                        the Stone</cite> and <cite class="title italic">Aladdin</cite> are
                     nearly identical and yet were made nearly thirty years apart). This visual
                     evidence of hue and brightness would suggest further archival research to
                     examine how consciously Disney animators wanted to distinguish their use of
                     color from other films.

                     <cite class="title italic">Brother Bear</cite>.
                     <cite class="title italic">Brother Bear</cite> shifts aspect ratios
                     from 1.75:1 to 2.35:1, so the first 28.7% of the film has black side pillarboxes
                     which make it deviate predictably in terms of both hue and brightness. Excluding
                     <cite class="title italic">Brother Bear</cite>, the next film with the most deviation
                     in brightness is 05 <cite class="title italic">Bambi</cite>, which confirms what I
                     suggested earlier about the strangeness of the dark bottom line versus the
                     lightness of the top of the frame. Curiously, <cite class="title italic">Pocahontas</cite>
                     and <cite class="title italic">Mulan</cite>, two of Disney’s three films about ethnic
                     women, are both nearly equal in terms of brightness but completely opposite in
                     terms of hue; that is, compared to the other films,
                     <cite class="title italic">Mulan</cite> displays much more deviation
                     in the hues that make up its summed image, but very little deviation in its
                     brightness (the third, 42 <cite class="title italic">Lilo and Stitch</cite>, is differently
                     hued but is also one of the least bright films). <cite class="title italic">Mulan</cite>
                     bears even more deviation than 51 <cite class="title italic">Winnie the Pooh</cite>; this
                     is difficult for one to tell at first given <cite class="title italic">Mulan</cite>’s even
                     brightness compared to <cite class="title italic">Winnie the Pooh</cite>’s varied
                     brightness. But just as we did with the summed z-projections, we can also create
                     graphs of median hue and brightness for each individual film using our folder of
                     slices. Here are three, plotting as I did before median hue on the x-axis and
                     median brightness on the y-axis, illustrating how the brightness and hue of <cite class="title italic">Mulan</cite>, <cite class="title italic">Pocahontas</cite>, and <cite class="title italic">Bambi</cite>’s individual slices do and do not contribute to the
                     overall summed effect.

                     <cite class="title italic">Mulan</cite> has a wider
                     range. While I will not discuss them
                     in depth here, examining such plots for each individual film allows researchers
                     to compare signatures and see how internally consistent the films are: <cite class="title italic">Mulan</cite>’s summed image makes it look almost entirely
                     violet, but we see that a good percentage of the film is actually red–orange
                     hued. This can be a crucial tool for digital humanities approaches to film and
                     media studies, particularly in terms of quantifying the consistency of a film’s
                     visual style or the historical shifts in a production studio’s filmic look. Here
                     are two such visualizations of the style signatures of all fifty-five films,
                     first a montage plotting the median hue and brightness for each film, followed
                     by a combined image plotting the median hue and brightness for every slice used
                     in this project. The first montage shows how individual films’ varying hue and
                     brightness create a unique signature; the second shows the combined hue and
                     brightness of the entire Disney corpus, offering an unprecedented macro-view of
                     all of their films.

                  <div class="ptext" id="p56">I conclude by putting these summed frames into a larger context. As futuristic or
                     speculative as this work might seem, it is in fact very much in line with
                     mid-twentieth-century formalist theories of literature that sought to treat the
                     text not as the inspired culmination of an author’s intellectual genius, but as
                     an objective structure open to grounded analysis. In addition to contemporary
                     digital humanists and experimental media artists, I am also inspired by what
                     readers will no doubt recognize as a rather old-fashioned line of thought: "the
                     structuralist activity" described by Roland Barthes in 1963, from which even he
                     had moved on by 1970’s <cite class="title italic">S/Z</cite>. Barthes begins his essay by
                     rejecting categorizations of "structuralism" as a school, movement, or even a
                     set of vocabulary, and instead proposes that we understand structuralism more
                     simply as an activity, a labor experienced by both artists and critics. In this
                     formulation, the structuralist critical activity has as its goal to

                     functioning (the "functions") of this object. Structure is therefore actually a
                     <em class="term">simulacrum</em> of the object, but a directed, <span class="hi italic">interested</span> simulacrum, since the imitated object makes
                     something appear which remained invisible or, if one prefers, unintelligible in
                     the natural object [<a class="ref" href="#barthes1972">Barthes 1972</a>, 214–215].

                  <div class="ptext" id="p58">To show how an object works is to reconstruct that object, to make a copy of that
                     object that reveals something hidden or illegible in the original. Thus for
                     Barthes, the structuralist activity of imitation requires an emphasis on
                     technique over mere analysis: this activity is real, tangible labor that
                     reconceives art and analysis as a paired activity, rather than seeing criticism
                     as merely the lofty, disinterested contemplation of a work. Likewise, my project
                     does not intend to offer a definitive solution to a digitally-aided analysis of
                     cinema, but rather to provoke inquiry into how meaning is possible and how
                     different meanings arise from different means. These summed frame z-projections
                     quite literally "make something appear which remained . . . unintelligible"
                     before, and the researcher’s task is to discover in what way these simulations
                     of films are "interested" simulacra.

                  <div class="ptext" id="p59">Barthes’s proto-digital humanist approach foregrounds specific meaning-making
                     techniques of dissection and articulation over the scrutiny of works thought to
                     be previously endowed with meaning, and thus it offers a direction for critical
                     analysis particularly appropriate for the digital humanities. While they may
                     prefer to avoid something as unfashionable as structuralism or semiotics,
                     digital humanists would do well to reconsider the framework introduced in
                     Barthes’s essay. Indeed, Franco Moretti’s lauded work on "distant reading" is in
                     many ways a rewrite and amplification of Barthes; for example, in
                     <cite class="title italic">Graphs, Maps, Trees</cite>, Moretti
                     proposes that we adopt a method whereby we "<em class="emph">reduce</em> the
                     text to a few elements, and <em class="emph">abstract</em> them from the
                     narrative flow, and construct a new, <em class="emph">artificial</em> object" [<a class="ref" href="#moretti2005">Moretti 2005</a>, 53] (italicized in original). These steps of reduction,
                     abstraction, and artificial construction are identical to Barthes’s dissection,
                     articulation, and fabrication of meaning. Stephen Ramsay’s "screwmeneutics" also
                     invokes Barthes, particularly the well-known distinction between the readerly
                     and the writerly text, which Ramsay connects to two modes of using a library:
                     when a person searches a library for bits of information, she invites texts to
                     be readerly in order to be passively consumed, whereas when a person browses a
                     library, "just screwing around," she hopes to encounter writerly texts that
                     might offer "an invitation to community, relationship, and play" [<a class="ref" href="#ramsay2014">Ramsay 2014</a>, 119]. Last, Lisa Samuels and Jerome McGann have made a well-known argument for
                     "deformance" which argues that "<em class="emph">all interpretation is a
                        function of the poem’s systemic intelligibility</em>" and that we should set
                     aside the idea that humanities work applies an interpretation <em class="emph">to</em> a text and instead work to discover a text’s system by performing
                     actions on it that render it strange but reveal something organic (italicized in

                  <div class="ptext" id="p60">Finally, I connect these examples to an older tradition of surrealist engagement
                     with cinema. Film scholar Robert B. Ray calls Barthes "the most obvious heir to
                     the Surrealist concern" with the fragment and summarizes Barthes’s <span class="foreign i">modus operandi</span>: "if the movies’ relentless unrolling
                     prevents your noticing anything except narratively underlined details, the only
                     response is to stop the film" [<a class="ref" href="#ray2001">Ray 2001</a>, 100]. Unspooling a reel on a film
                     editing table, pausing a VCR, stepping frames back and forth on a DVD,
                     converting a movie into a folder of jpegs on a laptop: all of these ways to stop
                     the film’s emphatic focus on narrative allow for renewed pursuit of an abandoned
                     trajectory of surrealist investigation. But whereas the Surrealists and Barthes
                     were limited to working with modernist technologies such as the camera,
                     photograph, or typewriter, the digital humanist can take advantage of more
                     sophisticated computer-aided methods of stopping cinema.

                  <div class="ptext" id="p61">Alongside Barthes’s desire to "stop the film," surrealism offers a way to
                     consider the stopped film’s metaphoric unconscious. That is, I want to move
                     beyond the initial step of using digital tools to pause, enlarge, slow down, or
                     re-edit film texts, and towards a second step of using digital tools to modify
                     the film text in a way that reveals its otherwise unintelligible facets. The
                     surrealists in the 1920s, influenced by Freud’s theory of dreams, privileged the
                     unconscious as a more genuine site of creativity and followed his lead in
                     developing strategies to access this hidden part of the mind, emphasizing in
                     particular "automatic" techniques to shortcut conscious perception and
                     decision-making. Similarly, in my project of digital surrealism, I attempt a
                     computer-based form of automatism, a screwmeneutical, playful, digital
                     surrealist method that extracts what we might metaphorically imagine as a film’s
                     "unconscious" visual field without conscious intervention.

                  <div class="ptext" id="p62">I have given examples here of how summed frame z-projections can open up inquiry
                     around composition, framing, lighting, and color, allowing researchers to gain
                     new information about framing choices or emphasis on specific characters or
                     groups of characters, to offer insight into both the lighting style of
                     live-action films and the imitation of real-world lighting in animated films, to
                     easily reveal outlier films in a corpus, to visualize static shots or repeated
                     camera setups, and in general to either pursue new questions from empirical
                     evidence or visually confirm an intuitive hunch. Future work could extend this
                     method to other corpora of national, historical, or genre films, generating new
                     claims and questions about connections between corpora. This method also lends
                     itself easily to television or other moving image texts, as well as other
                     collections of images such as comic book pages, poetry collections, photographs,
                     or newspapers.

                     analysis of the visual image, I hope to encourage broader digital humanist use
                     of the "interested simulacra" as a site for productive research that is both
                     study and invention. While I move back and forth between summed images and the
                     text itself, this is not to reestablish the text’s meaning-endowed authority,
                     but to show the iterative process of making meaning, which requires speculation,
                     experimentation, and art. Barthes further defines the "<em class="emph">interested</em> simulacrum" that underlines his method: "the simulacrum is
                     intellect added to object, and this addition has an anthropological value, in
                     that it is man himself, his history, his situation, his freedom, and the very
                     resistance which nature offers to his mind" [<a class="ref" href="#barthes1972">Barthes 1972</a>, 215]. The
                     anthropological value of summed film frames speaks very clearly to the
                     contemporary challenges of using a digital humanities approach towards film and
                     media studies: this project is in palpable ways a product of my history as a
                     film obsessive, my situation as a developing scholar in a new field, my freedom
                     to acquire and manipulate digital film, and the constant resistance I experience
                     over the value of this project in its ability to contribute to the scholarly
                     field. For the traditional film scholar, the anthropological value of these
                     images poses a (hopefully liberating) threat to older methods of searching for
                     narrative meaning in the cinema. For the digital humanist, these summed film
                     frames show the resistance both of nature and of our technology, forcing us to
                     confront again the possibility that our faith in the computer’s excellence at
                     producing rational evidence is a flatness we must leaven with a touch of
                     surrealist play. To that end, I conclude with a final image that remains, to me,
                     most fruitfully illegible: the sum of all of the summed z-projections, the sum
                     of 135,000 slices of Walt Disney Animation Studios.
