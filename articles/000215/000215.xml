                <p>As the diversity of digital humanities practitioners grows, the need to construct
                    a framework allowing for equal acknowledgement to all involved has become more
                    evident. In this article, I argue that the perceived immateriality of
                    scholarship privileges conventional academic labor over similar pursuits, such
                    as data curation, resulting in them being glanced over and ignored in tenure
                    reviews and job evaluations. To counter this, I create a theoretical framework
                    that places materiality at the forefront. More specifically, I draw on and
                    expand Gilles Deleuze's notion of assemblages, as outlined by new materialist
                    philosopher Manuel DeLanda, to posit the idea of <soCalled>data assemblages,</soCalled> which are the result of digital
                    humanities labor and consist of material parts contingent on their contextual
                    relations and always in flux. I use the Digital Public Library as a case study
                    and highlight how the reconceptualization of digital humanities labor moves
                    beyond the merely theoretical to allow us to better understand the
                    interdependency of individuals in the academic ecosystem and has broader
                    implications for the nature of materiality in the digital age.</p>

            <head>Introduction</head>
            <p>Despite the prominence of the digital humanities, discussions surrounding the
                assessment and nature of digital scholarship remain at the forefront of
                un/conferences, workshops, and other academic gatherings. Although some prominent
                organizations such as the Modern Language Association and American Historical
                Association have begun to discuss how to evaluate digital scholarship, many digital
                humanists continue to face backlash from peers, department chairs, and in many
                cases, scholarly organizations <ptr target="#mla2013"/>
                <ptr target="#denbo2014"/>. According to Patrik Svensson, <cit>
                    <quote rend="inline" source="#svensson2010">For tenure-track scholars, there is
                        often a sense that digital modes of representation may place you at a
                        relative disadvantage. Indeed, this may be outright advice from senior
                        faculty and administrators</quote>
                    <ptr target="#svensson2010"/>
                </cit>. </p>
            <p>At the same time, we have seen a shift in the types of people engaged in the digital
                humanities. While early practitioners largely came from traditional disciplines,
                digital librarians, data curators, alt-acs, and independent researchers are now just
                as likely to be seen at digital humanities conferences as tenured/tenure-track
                professors. Calls to reform scholarship in the digital age, however, have continued
                to privilege the research of traditional faculty over other practitioners, although
                both often generate similar products. As collaboration between different members of
                the academic ecosystem increases, I contend that it is imperative we create a new
                    <emph>theoretical</emph> framework that adequately acknowledges the parallels
                between the work of conventional scholars and others, especially librarians and
                curators. In this essay, I hope to begin this reconceptualization by accentuating
                the shared materiality of both text-heavy digital humanities scholarship and more
                curatorial work through the notion of <soCalled>data assemblages.</soCalled>
            </p>
            <p> According to Kathleen Fitzpatrick, scholars <cit>
                    <quote rend="inline" source="#fitzpatrick2011">need to let go of some of our
                        fixation on the notion of originality in scholarly production, recognizing
                        that, in an environment in which more and more discourse is available, some
                        of the most important work that we can do as scholars may more closely
                        resemble contemporary editorial or curatorial practices</quote>
                    <ptr target="#fitzpatrick2011" loc="12"/>
                </cit>. The focus on originality has limited digital humanities scholars, and the
                work of some practitioners at the expense of others. As librarian Dorothea Salo
                notes, <cit>
                    <quote rend="inline" source="#salo2011">academia privileges its notion of
                        research to such a degree that it refuses to respect my praxis</quote>
                    <ptr target="#salo2011"/>
                </cit>. Similarly, in response to the failure of some faculty to recognize the work
                of curators and librarians as equal, Trevor Munoz argues that we should frame data
                curation as a form of publishing. According to Munoz, <cit>
                    <quote rend="inline" source="#munoz2013">Data curation as a
                            <soCalled>publishing</soCalled> activity is increasingly relevant to the
                        working lives of digital humanities scholars. Moreover, articulating
                        connections between <soCalled>publishing</soCalled> and data curation is
                        important in the context of strategic decisions libraries might make and, in
                        fact, are making about how to participate in
                        <soCalled>publishing</soCalled></quote>
                    <ptr target="#munoz2013"/>
                </cit>. Overall, calls like Munoz’s and Salo’s highlight how the separation between
                curation and conventional digital humanities scholarship has affected the ability of
                both to push research forward. </p>
            <p>As scholars move back and forth between conventional and
                    <soCalled>alternative</soCalled> academic positions, it becomes necessary to
                examine the equivalences in labor for future job evaluations, promotional reviews,
                and tenure requirements. A key reason why these evaluations sometimes downplay
                curatorial work is because of an enduring perception of research as disembodied
                practice. Jeanne Hamming and Helen Burgess make a similar contention in their
                analysis of materialism in new media studies and scholarship <ptr
                    target="#burgess2011"/>. By drawing on the works of Bruno Latour, they highlight
                that the detachment of the material from the intellectual is continuing evidence of
                modernity’s inability to take hybrids and quasi-objects seriously. <quote
                    rend="inline" source="#burgess2011">This ongoing debate about new media’s
                    functional (an in some cases even biological) difference from old media,</quote>
                they claim, <cit>
                    <quote rend="inline" source="#burgess2011">contributes to a double erasure, for
                        scholars working in multimedia, of both their intellectual contributions and
                        their material labor</quote>
                    <ptr target="#burgess2011"/>
                </cit>. For Hamming and Burgess, it is important to examine the affordances and
                restraints of materiality in intellectual research. Still, despite their
                contentions, Hamming and Burgess maintain a rhetoric that continues to stress the
                importance of <soCalled>traditional</soCalled> academic arguments. For instance, in
                their discussion of Marcel O’Gorman’s <title rend="italic">Dreadmill</title>, they
                point out that <quote rend="inline" source="#burgess2011">he cites Nietzsche,
                    Kittler, Virilio, Haraway, Ernest Becker, among other scholars</quote> in order
                to lend credence to his academic authority <ptr target="#burgess2011"/>.
                Nonetheless, a significant portion of digital humanities scholarship does not
                contain a conventional thesis-driven argument, and this discourse continues to
                reject many non-traditional forms of academic labor. </p>
            <p>The perceived immateriality of scholarship is even more insidiously damaging to the
                digital humanities because it reestablishes the privileging of conventional analogue
                scholarship above curatorial pursuits. In this essay, I seek to counter this by
                positing the notion of <soCalled>data assemblages</soCalled> as a partial solution.
                I begin by briefly surveying the changing nature of research in the era of big data
                and the attempts by both curators and others to make sense of its impact on the
                academy. Next, I provide an overview of Gilles Deleuze’s notion of assemblages as
                outlined by new materialist scholar Manuel DeLanda. By expanding on this concept, I
                detail the way that <soCalled>data assemblages</soCalled> allow us to more easily
                observe the analogous labor of traditional scholars, digital humanists, and
                curators. I define data assemblages as the resulting end product of curatorial and
                digital humanities labor that consist of material parts that are contingent on their
                contextual relations and always in flux. Following this, I use the Digital Public
                Library of America as a case study for my notion of data assemblages. Finally, I
                conclude by demonstrating how this reconceptualization moves beyond the merely
                theoretical to understand the interdependency of individuals in the academic
                ecosystem, and more broadly, permits us to reexamine the nature of materiality in
                the digital era.</p>
            <div>
                <head>The Changing Nature of Scholarship in the Digital Era</head>
                <p> The impact of widespread data on academic research has yet to be seen. Still,
                    numerous groups have contended that this research will impact not only
                    scientific but also humanities research. In this section, I briefly examine how
                    scholars and librarians have viewed the emergence of big data and highlight how,
                    despite numerous attempts, a comprehensive foundation remains unavailable that
                    takes seriously the materiality of digital humanities labor <emph>and</emph> its
                    contextual and fluctuating nature.</p>
                <p> According to Chris Anderson of <title rend="italic">Wired</title> Magazine, we
                    are now living in the Petabyte Age <ptr target="#anderson2008"/>. Anderson
                    polemically argues that this mass quantity of available data is especially
                    important for scholars because it requires us to reexamine our methodological
                    assumptions. According to him, we do not need to know why numbers allow us to
                    predict behavior. Instead, <cit>
                        <quote rend="inline" source="#anderson2008">the point is they do it, and we
                            can track and measure it with unprecedented fidelity. With enough data,
                            the numbers speak for themselves</quote>
                        <ptr target="#anderson2008"/>
                    </cit>. The sciences have led the charge in reevaluating their epistemological
                    assumptions in light of big data. Early attempts at examining data in context
                    emerged in informatics, but a more extensive movement arose in the 2000s known
                    as E-science. E-science provided a lens to deal with the massive influx of data
                    and the increased necessity of collaborative scholarship. According to one group
                    of early practitioners, E-science <cit>
                        <quote rend="inline" source="#lord2004">enables a new order of
                            collaborative, more inter-disciplinary research, based on shared
                            research expertise, instruments and computing resources, and, crucially,
                            increasing access to collections of primary research data and
                            information</quote>
                        <ptr target="#lord2004"/>
                    </cit>. Major scientific research now exists within this E-science paradigm. One
                    example is the Sloan Digital Sky Survey that has resulted in an opening up of
                    scholarship and a reassessment of the role of mass computational methods in
                    astronomical research. The team that led the project regarded it as the
                    beginning of a <quote rend="inline" source="#gray2002">fourth paradigm</quote>
                    in scientific research <ptr target="#gray2002"/>. Similarly, large computational
                    methods have begun to dominate the fields of bioengineering and physics. </p>
                <p>Data curation, a growing faction in library and information science, takes
                    seriously the claims of these scientific big data movements and seeks to address
                    the <soCalled>data deluge</soCalled> more thoroughly. The movement’s most direct
                    precedent is in the notion of digital curation. Digital curation, according to
                    Elizabeth Yakel, is <cit>
                        <quote rend="inline" source="#yakel2007">the active involvement of
                            information professionals in the management, including the preservation,

                    to engage with the research needs of scholars. In contrast, they seek to reframe

                    develops in a context. Still, the perceived materiality of collections

                    an image of a non-fluctuating collection that serves as a singular totality. As
                    a result, the focus is on the materiality of the collection itself rather than
                    the larger fluctuating infrastructural needs of research.</p>
                <p>Despite changes in the library and science communities, humanities scholars, as a
                    whole, have been less likely to view themselves as requiring large-scale
                    infrastructure or needing to examine data contextually. One reason for this is
                    because of the nature of data that humanities scholars find important. Christine
                    Borgman notes, <cit>
                        <quote rend="inline" source="#borgman2009">the humanities and arts are the
                            least likely of the disciplines to generate their own data in the forms

                        <ptr target="#borgman2009"/>
                    </cit>. Humanities scholars are more likely to rely on data created by others —
                    i.e. diaries, literature, and films — than their own. Yet, this may be changing.
                    For instance, large-scale projects in corpus linguistics have gained traction in
                    the digital humanities community. Organizations, such as the HathiTrust, and
                    projects, such as Google Books, now require humanities scholars to seriously
                    examine the infrastructure encompassing their data. Furthermore, national and
                    international funding agencies are now taking data seriously before financing
                    humanities projects. The National Endowment of the Humanities, for instance, has
                    begun to require Data Management Plans in order to secure grant funding <ptr
                        target="#neh"/>. The often-ambiguous guidelines and regulations of these
                    plans demonstrate the embryonic nature of assessing digital materials. Yet, with
                    a large organization such as the NEH leading the charge, other granting agencies
                    will follow suit, and there will be an increased requirement for digital
                    humanities scholars to reassess how they share and store their data. Still, most
                    humanities scholars, outside of the digital humanities, are not trained in
                    computational methods, and the nature of humanities research often discourages
                    collaborative efforts that may yield new insights.</p>
                <p>All this is not to say, however, that humanities scholars have completely
                    neglected to examine changing infrastructural needs in the digital age. Digital
                    history pioneers Dan Cohen and Roy Rosenzsweig noted the difficulty of
                    large-scale information preservation <ptr target="#cohen2006" loc="1–17"/>.
                    Later, Rosenzsweig argued that the problem of digital infrastructure was no
                    longer the question of scarcity but of abundance. He feared that the massive
                    amount of information on the Internet would be too large to preserve and a large
                    record of cultural production would be lost. Rosenzsweig implored historians to
                    think <cit>
                        <quote rend="inline" source="#rosenzweig2003">simultaneously about how to

                        <ptr target="#rosenzweig2003"/>
                    </cit>. In other words, because of the mass of information that was created on
                    the web there were fundamental issues involved in assessing what exactly we
                    should archive. </p>
                <p>Along with grappling with how to save digital data, humanities scholars have also
                    sought to create new degree programs that address the need for graduate training
                    in digital methods. Regarding an attempt to form a Master's Degree in Digital
                    Humanities at the University of Virginia, John Unsworth noted that the catalyst
                    for the degree was based on: <cit>

                            new intellectual and creative possibilities it offers, we will need
                            trained professionals who understand both the humanities and information
                            technology, and we will need them in a number of different areas — in
                            museums, libraries, teaching, scholarship, publishing, government,
                            communications, entertainment, and elsewhere</quote>

                <p>Despite these outliers, however, few humanities practitioners are deeply engaged
                    with the digital humanities. According to Shelia Anderson and Tobias Blanke, <cit>
                        <quote rend="inline" source="#anderson2012">Except for a small minority the
                            humanities do not have a tradition of dealing with machine algorithms,

                            and other forms of visual representation that arise from big data

                    handling large data structures, and a theoretical structure that acknowledges
                    the often-equal input of all camps is imperative.</p>

                    </cit>. For many, data exists in the immaterial space of the digital. The notion
                    of cyberspace as immaterial is a common one in science fiction, and popular
                    movies, such as <title rend="italic">The Matrix</title>, perpetuate an image of

                    association of cyberspace with the immaterial comes from pioneers of modern
                    science fiction, such as William Gibson. According to Gibson's definition of

                    developments such as cloud computing harken to an ephemeral and illusory

                    As Jean-François Blanchette notes, <cit>
                        <quote rend="inline" source="#blanchette2011">computing systems are suffused

                    </cit>. In addition, Ian Bogost and Nick Montfort demonstrate that it is crucial
                    we take the materiality of computation seriously in our examinations of digital
                    culture <ptr target="#bogost2009"/>. Asserting data’s materiality, however, is
                    not enough. A more comprehensive framework is needed, and the digital humanities
                    has yet to provide a widely adopted ontological basis for research projects that
                    deviate from orthodox textual scholarship. Due to the nature of digital culture,
                    it is important that this ontological framework earnestly examine not only the
                    fluctuation of data but also the changing relationship between different forms
                    of data. As Joris van Zundert notes, <cit>
                        <quote rend="inline" source="#vanzundert2012">transformed by digital
                            technology, text and digital editions – digital humanities data in

                    </cit>. In order to provide a more comprehensive framework for digital projects
                    and to highlight the relationship between curation and conventional scholarship,
                    I examine Manuel DeLanda's expansion on Gilles Deleuze's notion of <soCalled>assemblages</soCalled> in his <title
                        rend="italic">New Philosophy of Society</title> as a partial solution. </p>
                <p>The concept of assemblages may be unfamiliar to many — although it is gaining
                    some academic interest — and a key reason for this is that the literature on it
                    is nebulous and scattered throughout Deleuze’s work. DeLanda reformulates
                    Deleuzian assemblages into a comprehensive framework and seeks to broadly
                    examine social institutions through a realist perspective. However, instead of
                    viewing his framework as only relevant to social institutions, I adapt it as a
                    broader way to view digital humanities data and scholarship. Specifically,
                    through the notion of assemblages, I seek to conceptualize curatorial work and
                    digital humanities praxis as resulting in <soCalled>data assemblages.</soCalled>
                    While curation has made a case for the reexamination of data management
                    techniques, it has often continued the rhetoric that poses a fundamental
                    dichotomy between research and curatorial activities. Curation, in this sense,
                    becomes a service that operates as the back-end of digital humanities work but
                    is not an equal part of it. Data assemblages, on the other hand, provide one way
                    to help curators and digital humanities scholars move forward while
                    acknowledging their reliance on one another. By reframing the notion of
                    projects, collections, and research as data assemblages, we can see the dynamic
                    relationship between various groups and productions in the digital humanities. </p>
                <p> Assemblages in their most basic definition are material component parts that
                    form wholes. These wholes are notable in that they resist totalities and are
                    made up of assemblages themselves. DeLanda asks us to remove the Hegelian focus
                    on relations of interiority because the autonomy of component parts is
                    questionable in a framework that defines their very characteristics based on
                    their relative relationships. Instead, assemblages focus on relations of
                    exteriority. These relations of exteriority are not exhaustive of the
                    ontological properties of a component part. For instance, if an arm becomes
                    removed from a body in a relationship of interiority it fails to be an arm. In
                    contrast, in relationships of exteriority, the arm has the potential to maintain
                    some aspects of itself as it becomes part of a new system of relations <ptr
                        target="#delanda2006" loc="9–11"/>. As a result, component parts become
                    fluctuating in assemblages, or as DeLanda states, <cit>
                        <quote rend="inline" source="#delanda2006">a component part of an assemblage
                            may be detached from it and plugged into a different assemblage in which

                        <ptr target="#delanda2006" loc="10"/>
                    </cit>. Component parts, notably, also remain in flux and are made up of
                    different assemblages themselves.</p>
                <p> In a data assemblage, the same focus on materiality allows us to reorganize our
                    thinking of bits and their role in research. As noted earlier, data are
                    material, and their material existence is not contingent on their relationships
                    in curatorial practice. This moves away from earlier notions such as
                        <soCalled>collections</soCalled> and <soCalled>contextual mass</soCalled>
                    where the relationship between components is so strong that their
                    characteristics within a new framework are problematic. Notably, while data
                    curation allows us to gather bits in an assemblage that can then be used for
                    further research, it perpetuates the perception that curation is done for
                    research purposes rather than something analogous. In data assemblages, this is
                    altered, as the relationships of interiority are no longer characteristic of the
                    material but rather by relationships of exteriority. This allows us to maintain
                    a focus on contextual relationships while still resisting totalities, and also
                    allows us as researchers to focus on some aspects of data, even those assembled
                    by data curators. Scholars can reconfigure this data for their own personal
                    research, and the component’s relation of exteriority changes from one data
                    assemblage (explicitly that of the libraries) to the data assemblage of the
                    researcher (namely the project). Because the results of these data assemblages
                    are not dichotomous but mutually reinforcing, they allow us to more clearly see
                    the link between curatorial and text-heavy work. </p>
                <p> Assemblage theory is not only notable for stressing the material characteristics
                    of data, but also because it provides an additional framework for the
                    examination of these material parts. Through a framework of three separate
                    dimensions that correspond with three axes, assemblages become more than just a
                    focus on the need to assess fluctuation in ontology. Each axis allows us to
                    investigate the link between digital materials and their corresponding data
                    assemblages. I go through each axis individually using the example of a
                    literature review. While some may contend that literature reviews are only used
                    in conjunction with larger scholarly pieces, this is not always true. Perhaps,
                    most prominently, scholars often publish literature reviews in journals as
                    articles overviewing the state of disciplinary fields, and graduate students
                    sometimes submit them separately before embarking on the dissertation and
                    thesis. Nonetheless, the general framework should be applicable to other forms
                    of print scholarship. While such an exercise may seem tedious, I believe it will
                    more lucidly describe the link between analogue and digital modes of
                    scholarship. In addition, I also emphasize what each axis means in the spectrum
                    of data curation and digital humanities praxis.</p>
                <p> The first dimension of data assemblages focuses on the material and expressive
                    roles of components <ptr target="#delanda2006" loc="12"/>. The material role of
                    assemblage parts correspond to their physical existence within an ecosystem, and
                    in the case of the literature review, these are the actual books and articles.
                    Often, scholars creating literature reviews will make copies of relevant pages
                    and cut them up into different sections. They then place the different pieces
                    thematically to create sections of an outline. The materiality of conventional
                    research becomes more apparent through this process. In data assemblages, the
                    material roles of component parts exist on one end of an axis with the
                    expressive role on the opposite end. These are the actual characteristics of the
                    books and articles, such as their color and form. These expressive roles should
                    not be understood as inherent characteristics of a component part but rather as
                    also contingent and in flux.</p>
                <p> The most obvious analogy of material and expressive component parts in current
                    digital media scholarship is within the framework of Matthew Kirshenbaum’s data
                    forensics. For Kirschenbaum, like DeLanda, focusing solely on the material
                    structure is problematic. He posits that the material can be further broken down
                    into forensic and formal materiality <ptr target="#kirschenbaum2012"/>. Forensic
                    materiality focuses on individualization and the reduction of physical matter
                        <ptr target="#kirschenbaum2012" loc="12"/>. Formal materiality, on the other
                    hand, are the <cit><quote rend="inline" source="#kirschenbaum2012">imposition of

                    <ptr target="#kirschenbaum2012" loc="12"/></cit>. For Kirschenbaum, formal materiality
                    can be understood as the <cit>

                            and are instead solely the function of the imposition of a specific
                            formal regimen on a given set of data and the resulting contrast to any

                    </cit>. It provides the illusion of immateriality in the material. </p>
                <p>Because Kirschenbaum seeks to maintain the ontological distinctiveness of
                    material objects through their reductive individualized traces, he is often
                    ambiguous on the distinction between formal materiality and forensic materiality
                    in things such as firmware. He implores us to not draw an analogy between the
                    formal and forensic and hardware and software, since this hardline distinction
                    is itself a result of industrial practices by companies such as IBM <ptr
                        target="#kirschenbaum2012" loc="14"/>. Data assemblages remove this
                    ambiguity by not only making the fluidity of the forensic a critical aspect of
                    the material but also by leaving open the possibility of the heterogeneous
                    nature of expressive and material forms. In data assemblages, the material role
                    is exemplified by the electrical impulses in data. The expressive role
                    represents the forms that these electrical impulses take. These roles and
                    materials are constantly shifting allowing for a more formal structure to
                    understand heterogeneous entities such as firmware. As DeLanda notes <cit>
                        <quote rend="inline" source="#delanda2006">these roles are material and may
                            occur in mixtures, that is, a given component may play a mixture of
                            material and expressive roles by conveying different sets of
                            capacities</quote>
                        <ptr target="#delanda2006" loc="12"/>
                    </cit>. </p>
                <p> The second axis deals with the territorial and deterritorial roles of
                    assemblages <ptr target="#delanda2006" loc="12–13"/>. DeLanda cautions us
                    against viewing assemblages as totalities but instead as continuously
                    fluctuating collections of material. Territorialization is the process of
                    component parts of an assemblage coming together. These can be
                        <soCalled>accidental</soCalled> and evolutionary in nature or purposeful
                    curatorial acts. Deterittorialization, on the other hand, represents the
                    opposite process of breaking apart assemblages. Again, these parts do not lose
                    their autonomy because their characteristics are not contingent on their
                    relationships of interiority. In the example of the literature review, the
                    reviewer exemplifies the territorializing aspect of the assemblage by placing
                    corresponding works in distinctive sections of the literature review. He or she
                    can also remove parts from different sections, and this exemplifies
                    deterittorialization. Normally, things that we have traditionally seen as having
                        <soCalled>agency,</soCalled> such as sentient beings, deterritorialize
                    assemblages, but non-sentient beings can also engage in the process. In this
                    sense, data assemblages take seriously the role of quasi-objects and the need to
                    reexamine what Latour refers to as the modernist constitution, which views
                    nature and society as unattached <ptr target="#latour1993" loc="13–48"/>. For
                    instance, a fire can erupt in the location where the reviewer is conducting his
                    research and cause the work to become ash. In either case, the
                    deterittorialization of the assemblages requires reexamining the relationship
                    between various component parts. </p>
                <p> In data assemblages, the territorialization and deterittorialization of
                    component parts are a result of the labor of digital humanities scholars and
                    curators. For instance, as curators organize and collect these assemblages, they
                    create new data assemblages made up of material components. Databases, in this
                    sense, are digital materials that create larger digital infrastructure. Similar
                    to how a scholar creates a literature review, digital humanities projects
                    reconfigure electrical material into assemblages. Projects as diverse as digital
                    historical maps and text mining initiatives are all, in this sense,
                    analogous.</p>
                <p> The third and final dimension of assemblages corresponds to a coding/decoding
                    axis <ptr target="#delanda2006" loc="14–16"/>. In many ways, this dimension
                    should not be considered separate from the territorialization and
                    deterittorialization dimension but as intertwined. Linguistic and genetic
                    phenomena can be seen as part of this dimension. These are special cases that
                    often provide the illusion of the immaterial and work at multiple scales of
                    assemblages. Still, they contain a material functionality. Case in point, DNA
                    represents a physical chromosome structure while language represents
                    neurological phenomenon. These help in territorializing assemblages by giving
                    them distinct linguistic structures. According to DeLanda, language often causes
                    us to lose site of relationships because of the <cit>
                        <quote rend="inline" source="#delanda2006">linguisticality of experience,
                            that is, the idea than an otherwise undifferentiated phenomenological
                            field is cut up into discrete entities by the meanings of the general
                            term</quote>
                        <ptr target="#delanda2006" loc="45"/>
                    </cit>. In a literature review, such a form of coding exists in the linguistic
                    assertion of the arrangement itself, and the act of a scholar declaring the
                    literature review as complete and ready for submission. A coding function also
                    manifests itself in regards to the transitions and thesis of the literature
                    review itself and highlights the way that coding can affect assemblages in
                    diverse scalarity. </p>
                <p> In data assemblages, the coding/decoding dimension is exemplified by the
                    assertion of collections as singular totalities and metadata. Research projects
                    and curatorial collections of data are not ontologically separate from one
                    another but become distinct through this linguistic maneuvering. Due to the
                    algorithmic coding of computer software, a territorialization of bits exists
                    that move through the material structure of the computer processing unit. For
                    librarianship, a more pertinent example is metadata that provides the
                    ontological significance of material along with an examination of the
                    connections between these materials. </p>
                <p> Together, the three dimensions of data assemblages provide an additional
                    framework for the discussion surrounding data curation and digital humanities.
                    It also permits us to examine the various aspects of digital materiality and see
                    their relationship between one another without confining them to relationships
                    of interiority. I believe that such a framework makes it easier to create
                    collaborative opportunities between different groups in the digital humanities
                    because it posits the emergence of data assemblages as the resulting outcome of
                        <emph>both</emph> research and curatorial labor. </p>

                <head>Case Study: The Digital Public Library of America</head>
                <p> In order to provide an overview of how this framework works with an actual
                    project, I use the Digital Public Library of America (DPLA) as a case study for
                    data assemblages. The organization began in 2010 with forty leaders and sought
                    to make <cit>
                        <quote rend="inline" source="#dpla">an open, distributed network of
                            comprehensive online resources that would draw on the nation’s living

                            educate, inform, and empower everyone in current and future
                            generations</quote>
                        <ptr target="#dpla"/>
                    </cit>. Through the support of the Alfred P. Sloan Foundation and the Berkman
                    Center for Internet and Society at Harvard University, the DPLA launched after
                    nearly two years of planning in April 2013. Although it calls itself a library,
                    it does not circulate any non-digital materials and at this time, does not
                    create new conventional content itself. Instead, it curates the digital metadata
                    of other libraries and cultural heritage organizations and puts them in one
                    place for easy access. Through this aggregating approach, the DPLA has been able
                    to create partnerships with the HathiTrust, the Smithsonian Institute, the
                    Internet Archive, and the Library of Congress. Still, despite its success,
                    measuring the academic impact of the DPLA as a scholarly project remains
                    difficult because the link between curatorship and scholarship is unclear. By
                    reassessing the DPLA as a data assemblage, I seek to demonstrate that the DPLA’s
                    efforts are ontologically analogous to other scholarly activities, such as a
                    literature review. </p>
                <p> The DPLA is an important case study for the scholarly use of data assemblages
                    for three important reasons. First, created by a largely academic organization
                    housed at Harvard University, it requires constant funding and infrastructural
                    requirements from scholarly resources, and these often cut into and compete from
                    funding for more orthodox academic research. By examining the DPLA’s
                    relationship to routine scholarship, we can better make sense of the pitfalls
                    and benefits of sharing and competing for the same resources. Second, created by
                    both academics and other leaders, the DPLA makes apparent the collaborative and
                    similar nature of traditional scholarship and curatorship. This convergence of
                    roles is important not only for collaboration but for future tenure reviews and
                    job evaluations as individuals move more fluidly between academia and
                    infrastructure customarily seen as supporting it. For instance, Dan Cohen, the
                    current Executive Director of the DPLA, gave up his professorship at George
                    Mason University to head the organization. For Cohen, his movement to the DPLA
                    advanced the work he already did in academia at the Roy Rosenzweig Center for
                    History and New Media <ptr target="#cohen2013"/>. Yet, in the current academic
                    climate his work at the DPLA, would not count towards a tenure review. Finally,
                    the DPLA is an important analysis of data assemblages because it outlines many
                    of the same elements in its philosophy, <quote rend="inline"
                        source="#cohen2013">three main elements,</quote> and mission. </p>
                <p> The collective nature of the components that the DPLA aggregates exemplifies the
                    material and expressive components of the first axis of data assemblages. The
                    DPLA’s <title rend="quotes">Philosophy</title> page illustrates the importance
                    of materiality for the organization: <cit>
                        <quote rend="inline" source="#dplac">To help organize and structure
                            metadata, the DPLA falls back on some pretty philosophical concepts.
                            Perhaps the most important of these is the idea that things in the
                            physical world can be represented at a number of different
                            levels</quote>
                        <ptr target="#dplac"/>
                    </cit>. While the DPLA turns each item into metadata that it aggregates, this
                    accumulation also results in the material bits of these items to become
                    flattened ontologically as they move through the DPLA’s servers. The expressive
                    component of the first axis deals with the forms of these bits, and by
                    manipulating the arrangement of electricity, the DPLA is able to create an
                    aggregation of metadata that it allows others to handle. </p>
                <p> The territorialization and deterittorialization of material bits is, in many
                    ways, the core of the DPLA’s mission. On it’s <title rend="quotes">About</title>
                    page, the organization lists <soCalled>three
                        main elements</soCalled> that outline the nature of the DPLA. The first of
                    these focuses on how the DPLA seeks to be <cit>
                        <quote rend="inline" source="#dpla">a <emph>portal</emph> [emphasis in

                        <ptr target="#dpla"/>
                    </cit>. In the parlance of data assemblages, this portal is a result of the
                    territorializaiton of material bits in different libraries and cultural heritage
                    organizations. The second main element of the DPLA demonstrates its role in
                    deterritorializing these material bits. According to the organization, the DPLA
                    seeks to be <cit>
                        <quote rend="inline" source="#dpla">A <emph>platform</emph> [emphasis in

                        <ptr target="#dpla"/>
                    </cit>. The organization hopes to accomplish this using Application Programming
                    Interfaces (APIs) that permit others to manipulate the its own data. For
                    instance, <title rend="italic">Serendip-o-matic</title>, an application built in
                    a single week for the One Week | One Tool project at the Roy Rosenzweig Center
                    for History and New Media, allows scholars to search for relevant sources in the
                    DPLA using any text they may have <ptr target="#serendip2013"/>. By doing so,
                    the application lets them deterritorialize material bits on its servers and
                    manipulate them to make curatorship easier and more integral to scholarly
                    research. The importance of examining relations of exteriority also becomes more
                    evident. As Catherine Adams and Terrie Lynn Thompson highlight, <cit>
                        <quote rend="inline" source="#adams2014">Within a sociomaterial reading,
                            data is not really a thing but rather a relational effect: it is what it
                            is in a particular moment because of the temporal and spatial networks
                            of relations in which it is ensnared</quote>

                    </cit>. As these bits move through various networks, coding and decoding
                    perpetuate the perception of these bits as frozen totalities. </p>
                <p>The third axis of coding/decoding corresponds to the process of declaring
                    discrete material entities as unified wholes. The DPLA’s main website
                    exemplifies this by fashioning bits in curatorial form as virtual timelines,
                    maps, and exhibits. As mentioned earlier, we should not view the coding and
                    decoding aspects as necessarily different from the territorializing and
                    deterritorializing aspects as both highlight our ability to see things as
                    distinct or compiled. Furthermore, along with manipulating the coding and
                    decoding of its own resources, the DPLA also makes a concentrated effort to
                    understand the linguistic and rhetorical moves that work for and against it as a
                    library. Case in point, in its final <soCalled>main
                        element,</soCalled> the DPLA seeks to be <cit>
                        <quote rend="inline" source="#dpla">an advocate for a strong <emph>public

                        <ptr target="#dpla"/>
                    </cit>. Specifically, it hopes to create a way for people to have access to
                    different sources of knowledge, and it presents itself in a longer line of
                    public libraries in America. This rhetorical move flattens the dissimilarity
                    between digital libraries from more traditional ones.</p>
                <p>Still, despite its success, the DPLA continues to face numerous challenges. While
                    the academic community is supportive of the organization’s mission, it continues
                    to view the activities as secondary to scholarly research. The lack of a
                    scholarly thesis or traditional format also means that the labor of those in the
                    DPLA may seem less valuable in future tenure reviews or job applications. As a
                    curatorial activity in the library community, the DPLA has a better record in
                    gaining support, although criticisms were prominent before launch <ptr
                        target="#enis2013"/>. As one group of curators notes, <cit>
                        <quote rend="inline" source="#palmer2010">Digital aggregations can provide
                            essential metastructures for unifying distributed content…. however, the

                            collections does not guarantee that the resulting aggregation will be a

                <p>Data assemblages provide a structure for future digital humanities research that
                    collapses this dichotomous vision of back-end and front-end digital production.
                    While scholars of the humanities have increasingly pushed for interdisciplinary
                    research, the resulting methodologies have continued to stress endeavors
                    traditionally considered “academic.” This has forced curators and librarians to
                    continuously reassess the work they do with a focus on orthodox researchers.
                    This same attention on research needs, however, has resulted in a glancing over
                    of the importance of curatorial activities as something valuable in and of
                    themselves. Data assemblages, as a result, have broad implications for curators,
                    digital humanists, and the broader digital age beyond the mere theoretical. </p>
                <p> For curators, the notion of data assemblages allows us a way to view curation as
                    an activity in and of itself. Tenure, in traditional academic settings, has
                    relied on the dissemination of scholarly information, usually in the form of
                    published articles. While such scholarly publications are important, they
                    perpetuate, at least in the humanities, an ideal of the lone scholar working
                    outside of any broader non-academic infrastructure. Curators in this context
                    fail to be given due credit for their work despite being in the academic
                    ecosystem and often must rely on the occasional acknowledgement within a
                    scholarly monograph for appreciation of their labor. In many ways, this
                    problematizes not only the way that conventional scholars view research but also
                    the ways curators see their work. As Trevor Munoz and Julia Flanders write, <cit>
                        <quote rend="inline" source="#flanders2011">data curation is…both a
                            scholarly research area and a praxis and, increasingly, data curation
                            too uses a distinct methodology to advance itself as both a discipline
                            and a profession</quote>
                        <ptr target="#flanders2011"/>
                    </cit>. These curatorial activities will be critical to researchers, especially
                    since groups like the data curation community take the link between their work
                    and other researchers to be central to their praxis. The data assemblage model
                    pushes this further by asking us to question the distinction between research
                    and curatorial activities altogether. Because all data assemblages exist on an
                    ontologically flat surface, these activities should not be differentiated from —
                    or at least not seen as antithetical to — scholarly publication. </p>
                <p> For digital humanists, the data assemblage model, along with causing us to
                    question the nature of scholarly publishing, allow us to create new forms of
                    scholarly activities that are not oriented around traditional narrative
                    structures: maps, games, databases, etc. In other words, the larger digital
                    ecosystem causes us to reexamine our scholarly publishing and the role of
                    diverse media formats in the academy. By viewing scholarly activity as something
                    that must be in the form of print, we perpetuate the notion that narrative
                    structures are the only meaningful forms of communication. Unfortunately, the
                    coding ability of narrative is hard to get away from, and digital scholars
                    should be wary of viewing their activity as separate from data curation and vice
                    versa due to these narrative characteristics. Of course, the value of
                    scholarship is not strictly in the format it takes but also in its ability to
                    stay in conversation with other scholars. Curatorial activities, however, also
                    do this when they seek collaboration with other curators. While these activities
                    are not stated explicitly as scholarly dialogue, we should be wary to discount
                    them as existing in a structural vacuum.</p>
                <p>More broadly, the notion of data assemblages allows us to reconsider our place in
                    the digital ecosystem. According to Matthew Kirshenbaum, we must confront the
                    .txtual condition. As he shows, <cit>
                        <quote rend="inline" source="#kirschenbaum2013">the preservation of digital
                            objects is <emph>logically inseparable</emph> from the act of their
                            creation — the lag between creation and preservation collapses
                            completely, since a digital object may only ever be said to be
                                preserved <emph>if</emph> it is accessible, and each individual
                            access creates the object anew</quote>
                        <ptr target="#kirschenbaum2013"/>
                    </cit>. In other words, a deep examination of digital material shows that access
                    and duplication are inherent to the digital world, and there is no separation of
                    access from creation. We can never really touch the same file because the
                    postmodern nature of computers means files are continuously located in new
                    memory, which are fluctuating electrical pulses. Such electrical impulses are
                    themselves part of a slow evolution into the computer that begins with parts
                    assembled throughout the world. Kirshenbaum argues that the
                        <soCalled>fingerprint</soCalled> of the files that we touch in the .txtual
                    condition causes them to change. Of course, the same fingerprints apply to the
                    real world, as criminal forensics has made clear. We see that the assemblage of
                    objects such as books changes along with the data itself, as it is stored in and
                    out of the correlating neurological memory of the observer. In data assemblages,
                    no claims to ontological totalities are made. As a result, the .txtual condition
                    vanishes, or at least becomes temporarily manageable. </p>
                <p>Furthermore, data assemblages expand on our understanding of ourselves in the
                    digital environment and as researchers. New media scholar Lesley Gourlay argues, <cit>
                        <quote rend="inline" source="#gourlay2011">The academy has become saturated
                            by technologies to the point that there can be no meaningful distinction
                            made between digital and analogue, embodied and virtual,
                                <soCalled>face-to-face</soCalled> and
                            <soCalled>online</soCalled></quote>
                        <ptr target="#gourlay2011"/>
                    </cit>. In their examination of digital materialities and posthumanism,
                    Catherine Adams and Terrie Lynn Thompson discuss the need for four
                        <emph>posthuman fluencies</emph>
                    <ptr target="#adams2014"/>. The first and second of these fluencies deals with
                    our ability to understand our shared agency with digital technology and the way
                    that these digital technologies lead to a de-skilling and up-skilling of
                    research activity. Data assemblages make this shared agency more apparent since
                    the ability to territorialize and deterritorialize not only deals with sentient
                    agency, such as humans, but also, as in Latourian actor-network-theory, the
                    agency of non-sentient actors such as computers, cameras, and servers. The third
                    of these posthuman agencies deal with the ability for data to become frozen in
                    time for research and the importance of flux for data assemblages. <quote
                        rend="inline" source="#adams2014">When data is viewed as frozen
                            <emph>but</emph> [emphasis in original] lively and mobile,</quote> write

                    </cit>. The final of these agencies concerns the importance of understanding the
                    tensions and affordances that come with increased collaboration and
                    fragmentation of research practices. By viewing curatorial and digital
                    humanities scholarship as data assemblages, these posthuman fluencies become
                    more apparent and allow us as scholars to grapple with new questions about our
                    research praxis in the digital age. </p>
                <p>As digital humanities increases as a field, the need to examine our
                    methodological assumptions will be more apparent. The field has defined itself
                    as a revolutionary force in the academy, and this same revolutionary impulse
                    provides scholars a leg up in collaborative techniques that bridge curatorship
                    with more conventional digital humanities scholarship. As Kathleen Fitzpatrick
                    notes, <cit>
                        <quote rend="inline" source="#fitzpatrick2010">the key problems that we face
                            again and again are social rather than technological in nature: problems
                            of encouraging participation in collaborative and collective projects,
                            of developing sound preservation and sustainability practices, of
                            inciting institutional change, of promoting new ways of thinking about
                            how academic work might be done in the coming years</quote>
                        <ptr target="#fitzpatrick2010"/>
                    </cit>. This piece sought to outline one way to increase collaboration and
                    acknowledgement by recognizing the material ecosystem surrounding digital
                    scholarship. Still, it is not perfect, and I hope that others will carry out
                    further research and to make the link between the curation and conventional
                    scholarship even more clear.</p>
