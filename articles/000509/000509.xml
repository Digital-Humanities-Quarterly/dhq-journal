          <p>This paper introduces and unpacks several challenges faced by
            stewards who work with audiovisual resources, departing from the
            premise that audiovisual resources are undervalued and

            therefore receive less attention in the sphere of digital

            Airwaves: Revitalizing an Early Public Radio Collection. As a case
            study, Unlocking the Airwaves successfully meets these challenges
            by employing strategies such as virtual reunification, linked data,
            minimal computing, and synced transcripts, to provide integrated
            access to the collections of the National Association of Educational

            University of Maryland (audio files) and the Wisconsin Historical
            Society (paper collections). The project demonstrates innovative
            approaches towards increasing the discoverability of audiovisual
            collections in ways that allow for better contextual description,
            and offers a flexible framework for connecting audiovisual

      <body>
        <div><head>Introduction</head>
        <p>It is difficult to talk about audiovisual archives as a field of practice,
        since audiovisual collections are never typical, existing in institutional
        repositories so varied as to make it impossible to talk about them as a
        monolithic whole. Audiovisual media collections are found within museums,
        libraries, historical societies, private collections; within media production
        units; and within traditional archives (only a small percentage of which
        are specifically dedicated to audiovisual collections). This wide array of
        communities and institutions has developed unique principles and standards,
        each individual community or institution borrowing the professional descriptive
        approaches needed for their particular circumstance, with no unifying
        methodology.</p>
        <p>These splintered approaches have led to a particular set of challenges
        with a/v collections, which are woefully underdescribed and often segregated
        from contextual resources. This separation from contextual resources prevents
        understanding of the conditions that produced a/v materials, often limiting
        the types of research questions that can be answered by the a/v media alone.
        An additional challenge is what scholar Sarah Florini has called a "temporal
        commitment barrier," meaning that users of a/v collections can easily become
        overwhelmed by the sheer listening hours needed to research time-based
        collections <ptr target="#vinson2019"/> <ptr target="#florini2017"/>.
        The unfortunate result of the above
        three challenges is that a/v resources are undervalued and underutilized as
        primary source materials for scholarship, which in turn has meant that they
        also receive less attention in the sphere of digital humanities. The field of
        digital humanities is poised to innovate and meet these challenges by employing
        methods such as linked data and virtual reunification to virtually connect
        audiovisual collections to related contextual resources. DH can also exploit
        its ability to experiment and push boundaries by encouraging the use of new
        standards such as WebVTT and new approaches like minimal computing, to enable
        distant reading and increase searchability via synced transcripts.</p>
        <p>This paper will describe original research at the Maryland
        Institute for Technology in the Humanities (MITH), in conjunction
        with the University of Wisconsin-Madison and the Wisconsin Historical
        Society, on a project entitled <ref target="https://mith.umd.edu/research/unlocking-the-airwaves/"><emph>Unlocking the Airwaves:
        Revitalizing an Early Public Radio Collection</emph></ref>.
        The project aims to provide a model for innovation within digital humanities by
        virtually reunifying two geographically segregated collections of the National
        Association of Educational Broadcasters (NAEB), which are currently split
        between the University of Maryland (audio files) and the Wisconsin Historical
        Society (paper collections).The NAEB collections provide an in-depth look
        at the messages being broadcast to the general public through the rubric of
        'educational radio,' which predated (and heavily informed) what we now know as
        public radio, between 1950-1970. By coordinating the expertise of archivists,
        humanities researchers, and digital humanists, the creation of this new online
        resource for humanities research will deliver enhanced access to important,
        mostly hidden, archival audiovisual materials.</p>
        </div>
        <div><head>Research Questions</head>
        <p>At the heart of this project lies a question that we have identified
        as being central to many ongoing conversations surrounding the role of
        the audiovisual in digital humanities: <emph>how can we utilize digital
        humanities methods to encourage the use of audiovisual collections as primary
        historical records, both in and outside of the academy</emph>? To move towards
        an answer to that question, it was necessary to unpack why A/V collections
        are underutilized in the first place. We identified three core reasons:
        A/V collections are a) underdescribed as a whole, trending towards skeletal
        descriptions at the item level, b) are often segregated from related contextual
        resources, and c) present an additional challenge in the form of a temporal
        commitment barrier. The below sections of this paper will walk through each
        of these three reasons more in depth, before returning to our central research
        question.</p>
        <div><head>Why are audiovisual collections underdescribed?</head>
        <p>The term underdescribed is used here as an overarching descriptor for the
        whole of audiovisual materials across the globe, which as a general rule, do
        not enjoy a level of descriptive attention anywhere close to their textual
        counterparts. A/V collections exist within and have borrowed strategies from
        libraries and museums <ptr target="#becker2001"/>.
        However, this paper will limit discussions
        to scenarios when A/V collections exist in an archival context — a situation
        that can be particularly complex due to the ways that audiovisual materials can
        challenge archival conceptions of uniqueness and authorship. The provenance of
        an archival audiovisual collection can fall into one of these categories:</p>
        <list type="ordered">
          <item>It is part of a traditional, primary textual or paper-based archival
          collection;
          <list type="unordered">
            <item>Ex: Mixed paper/audiovisual collections at
            the <ref target="https://www.aaa.si.edu">Smithsonian Archives of American Art</ref>;
            the <ref target="https://bfca.sitehost.iu.edu/home/">Black Film Center/Archive</ref>
            at Indiana University, Bloomington;</item>
          </list></item>
          <item>It has been constructed entirely separately from a textual archive, but
            has a shared provenance, or a substantial number of shared characteristics or
            authorities;
            <list type="unordered">
              <item>Ex: Several distinct collections related to the
                Jam Handy Organization (JHO), a producer of sponsored
                films, exist at the Detroit Public Library (<ref target="https://www.worldcat.org/title/jam-handy-organization-records-1894-1984/oclc/547043600">paper</ref>),
                Stanford Archive of Recorded Sound (<ref target="https://oac.cdlib.org/findaid/ark:/13030/kt4f59s18n/">audio</ref>), the University
                of Michigan (paper), and the Prelinger Archives (<ref target="https://archive.org/details/prelinger">paper and film</ref>)
              </item>
            </list></item>
          <item>It was once part of a whole collection which was subsequently split
            up;
            <list type="unordered">
              <item>Ex: the National Association of Educational Broadcasters
              (NAEB) collections at University of Maryland Libraries (<ref target="https://archives.lib.umd.edu/repositories/2/resources/1666">audio</ref>)

              </item>
            </list></item>
        </list>
        <p>Some collections do inevitably get described at the collection level as
        per traditional archival principles, particularly in category 1, where they
        are often (but not always) folded into the container list of a finding aid
        as a separate series. But many stewards of audiovisual collections tend
        to focus on item level description for various reasons. They sometimes
        do this to maintain bibliographic control, in circumstances like where
        the collection comprises primarily completed works, or in instances when
        'the work' is clear and has available bibliographic information. This
        approach is employed for the majority of a/v holdings at the UCLA Film
        &amp; <ref target="https://www.cinema.ucla.edu">Television Archive</ref>, which includes
        records for their materials in the MARC-based <ref target="https://www.library.ucla.edu">UCLA Library Catalog</ref>
        <ptr target="#leigh2006"/>.
        More often, however, item-level inventories are created to
        prepare for a preservation effort, frequently in the form of inventories
        concentrating on condition assessment. Many of the materials in these
        collections are rapidly decaying, or their physical format is in a
        state of obsolescence such that they cannot even be played back without
        some level of repair or preservation. Thus, for many such collections,
        there is less description even possible without reformatting or
        digitization. This is the case with the mass surveys undertaken by Indiana
        University-Bloomington and the Smithsonian, both of which undertook
        initial inventories, simple counts that took years just to get to the
        point of funding a preservation effort, which needed to happen before
        the inventory records could become part of any collection- or item-level
        descriptive process
        <ptr target="#indiana2011"/>
        <ptr target="#forsberg2017"/>
        In these cases, the requirements for preservation often necessitate descriptive
        choices which cannot always be reconciled with collection-level processing.</p>
        <p>Michael Heaney has previously described a typology for
        collection description, which now exists as the basis for Dublin
        Core's Collection Description Type (CDType) Vocabulary
        <ptr target="#heany2000"/>.
        Using this vocabulary, the collection level approach most used by traditional
        archivists would be classified as a unitary finding aid (contains information
        solely or primarily about the collection as a whole), and the item-level
        approach would be classified as an analytic finding aid (contains solely
        information about individual items and their content, much like a library
        catalog). Andrea Leigh's 2006 piece "Context! Context! Context! Describing
        Moving Images at the Collection Level" in <emph>The Moving Image</emph>
        goes into great detail describing how these different approaches apply to
        A/V collections, using the UCLA Film &amp; TV Archive's various collection
        categories as a case study <ptr target="#leigh2006"/>. UCLA began shifting its approach
        to accommodate collection-based description when it began to receive large
        collections of home movies, commercials, promotional or educational materials
        which were sometimes (but not always) related to other collections, or were
        too vast to describe with the amount of bibliographic control given to the core
        film collections <ptr target="#leigh2006"/>.</p>
        <p>When thinking about the very salient points that archivists make to
        defend the use of each of these different approaches, a useful exercise is
        to review an online discussion in 2013-14 that occurred between Megan McShea
        of the Smithsonian Archives of American Art and AVP's Josh Ranger. Ranger
        originally published a blog post entitled 'Does the Creation of EAD Finding
        Aids Inhibit Archival Activities?' which posited that using Encoded Archival
        Description (EAD) in the most traditional sense is problematic for A/V
        collections, since EAD often has issues with discoverability through Internet
        search engines, and partially because the lack of item-level information
        does nothing to prepare/plan for preservation efforts <ptr target="#ranger2013"/>.
        McShea replied to this post with a longer retort on the values of EAD for
        certain situations, addressing a significant number of Ranger's points
        as valid, but arguing that in many cases, finding aids become the easiest
        way for archivists with mixed collections to deal with institutional
        realities. And that, if proper measures are taken (as with the practices
        she'd established at the Smithsonian), archivists can effectively combine
        item-level and collection-level processing <ptr target="#mcshea2013"/>
        <ptr target="#mcshea2015"/>.
        This approach is in line with category 1 above. Ranger replied that
        every one of McShea's points was also valid, but then delivered a set
        of final points about EAD. He posited that "item level processing is
        really the only way to tell what's what and find the right pieces to
        preserve or transfer for access, and that EAD does not achieve this
        level of need. In my view the reliance on EAD has resulted in it becoming
        an endpoint or cul de sac, not a pivot point" <ptr target="#ranger2014"/>.</p>
        <p>In many ways, these two outlooks are equally valid, as both integrate
        concerns over utilizing More Product, Less Process (MPLP) techniques to
        maximize descriptive efficiency, and also reflect the nature of each person's
        position and institutional mandate. Ranger frequently worked on consulting
        projects with archives who often needed a complete item-level inventory
        to prepare for a preservation project with as much metadata as possible,
        whereas McShea works at a research institution with a substantial amount of
        both textual and audiovisual collections, whose goal is to make materials
        available for research. In either case, institutional needs determine the
        level of description, both of which lead to collections being 'underdescribed'
        in different ways. With an item-level approach, descriptive data about the
        collection can remain inaccessible to researchers for longer; whereas with a
        collection-level approach, the audiovisual resources can either become subsumed

        <div><head>Why are audiovisual collections segregated from related contextual
          resources?</head>
        <p>Over the past two decades, the archival field has taken great strides
        in the area of capturing contextual associations as part of the description
        and arrangement continuum. Heany's typology of a "unitary finding aid" was
        written in 2000 <ptr target="#heany2000"/>. Joseph Deodato wrote an evocative piece in 2006
        calling for archivists to employ postmodern strategies in description and
        arrangement as part of a call for archivists to be 'responsible mediators'
        of history, recalling and building upon the earlier work of Terry Cook, Wendy
        Duff, and Verne Harris in evoking the role of the archivist in constructing
        meaning
        <ptr target="#deodato2006"/>
        <ptr target="#cook2001"/>
        <ptr target="#duff2006"/>. What Deodato called
        a '"creation continuum" is "but one aspect of a complex provenance that also
        includes the context in which the records were created, the functions they
        were intended to document, and the record-keeping systems used to maintain and
        provide access to them" <ptr target="#deodato2006"/>. Since that time, standards have emerged
        such as Describing Archives, a Content Standard (DACS), which is "consciously
        designed to be used in conjunction with other content standards to meet local
        institutional needs for describing collection materials," <ptr target="#dacs2019"/> and
        includes a newly revised Part II section devoted to the creation of context
        through archival authority records, or records about the people, corporate
        bodies, and families associated with archival collections <ptr target="#dacs2019"/>.
        The emerging standard Encoded Archival Context — Corporate bodies, Persons, and
        Families (EAC-CPF) was designed to standardize the encoding of such archival
        authorities leigh2006.</p>
        <p>What Heaney invoked in his discussion of a unitary finding aid was similar
        to other movements in the field to address ideas of context and distributed
        collections, going as far back as documentation strategy in the late 1980s
        <ptr target="#samuels1986"/>, Carole Palmer's notion of 'Thematic Research Collections'
        in 2004 <ptr target="#palmer2004"/>, and virtual reunification, which has appeared in
        the literature as early as 2004 and evolved into its current form over
        the past five years or so due to the work of Ricardo Punzalan. As one of
        the preeminent scholars continuing to define and contextualize the forms
        and trajectory of distributed collections and the 'Archival Diaspora' that
        results from dispersed materials, Punzalan has continuously championed and
        focused on virtual reunification as an emerging and flexible strategy which
        exhibits some of the more useful qualities of several other methodologies
        and theories. In both his 2013 dissertation <ptr target="#punzalan2013"/>
        and subsequent pieces in <emph>Library Quarterly</emph> and <emph>American
        Archivist</emph> <ptr target="#punzalan2014a"/> <ptr target="#punzalan2014b"/>,
        he tracks and analyzes different
        projects which have employed the strategy, while drawing parallels and
        distinctions between it and other approaches. At the heart of his analysis
        is an acknowledgement that all virtual reunification projects require an
        'unprecedented' amount of inter-institutional collaboration a broad swath
        of technical expertise, and doing more than simply reuniting geographically
        separated collections, but producing an entirely different digital entity.</p>
        <p>Acknowledging that A/V collections are also part of the 'Archival Diaspora',
        it follows that they are often constructed in an entirely different sphere
        from the paper materials of their various creators (producers, artists,
        studios, etc.). Compounding this are the issues described in the above section,
        with long-standing descriptive standards for processing paper collections
        simply diverge from many of the needs of an audiovisual collection. The facts
        surrounding this phenomenon can widely vary, but it leads to a number of
        different scenarios where you end up with A/V collections which have little
        to no contextual information available to their stewards, although that
        context exists elsewhere in the information sphere. With the exception of
        certain categories of orphaned works (home movies, educational, sponsored,
        experimental, and amateur films), most of the time there is some extant
        documentation of a media object's creation and dissemination — transcripts,
        production and field recording notes, press kits, photos, correspondence,
        provenance and copyright materials. That documentation can exist in different
        divisions of the same institution, either at the same or a different geographic
        location, or at an entirely different institution altogether.</p>
        <p>Within that context, archival collections are often "mixed," meaning that at
        some point in their chain of custody (at or before the point of accession) they
        include both media materials as well as the related textual or photographic
        materials that are part of a shared provenance. It is a very common scenario
        when these mixed collections are accepted into archival repositories,
        accessioned, and then broken apart and processed using very different and
        separate techniques, guidelines, and description schemas. The Academy of
        Motion Picture Arts &amp; Sciences (AMPAS)
        contains several divisions comprising one of the world's largest repositories
        devoted to film history, including the Academy Film Archive, the Margaret
        Herrick Library, the Academy Oral History Projects, and the Science &amp;
        Technology Council. AMPAS has been receiving donations and gifts in the
        form of these "mixed" collections for years, from producers, artists,
        private collectors, and studios. Depending on the division receiving the
        accession, it was standard practice for years to split them, a practice
        that they've actively been shifting away from over the past 5-7 years by
        integrating an enterprise collections management software product called Adlib,
        which grants them to capability to unite
        and ontologically link film and paper collections sharing provenance or shared
        authorities across different divisions. These shifts, and the earlier pivots
        taken by UCLA, demonstrate that these two repositories, as two of the world's
        largest collections of our audiovisual history, have had to adapt to changing
        realities in the field and within their institutions. Both have the resources
        for some form of solution when they receive and handle 'mixed' collections
        comprising both A/V and paper resources. It also stands to reason that the
        types of collections that each of these repositories receive most often (with
        notable exceptions) are more cleanly identifiable by a shared provenance,
        shared authorities, and some level of bibliographic control.</p>
        <p>But quite often, either in situations where the institution doesn't have
        the kind of resources needed to direct attention to this kind of work, or when
        the collections fall under the category of so-called 'orphaned' works, the
        two collections never get near each other again – physically or ontologically.
        It is these circumstances which lead to culturally rich collections being
        siloed, underdescribed, under-contextualized, and thus largely ignored by
        the larger sphere of possible users. For the category of orphaned works, the
        value of the materials for researchers frequently remains unrealized, as the
        archival practices outlined above tend to separate them from the contextual
        associations that clarify their historical and social importance. Scholars
        such as Devin Orgeron, Marsha Gordon, and Dan Streible have addressed this
        problem, noting in <emph>Learning with the Lights Off: Education Film in
        the United States</emph> that nontheatrical films have experienced limited
        availability in archives, which has in turn caused a lost sense of their
        historical significance <ptr target="#orgeron2012"/>. In recent
        years, sustained archival and scholarly interest has led to a number of
        projects attempting to reinstate this historical value by providing context for
        orphaned media objects. For example, the Canadian Educational, Sponsored, and
        Industrial Film (CESIF) project, led by Charles Acland and Louis Pelletier, in
        part contextualizes orphaned films through a set of circulating institutions,
        showing the range of nontheatrical materials that were produced in Canada
        <ptr target="#acland2016" loc="138"/>. Other projects have invited user contributions in these
        efforts. Mark Williams's Media Ecology Project at Dartmouth College allows
        users to add information, including metadata, to create contextual connections
        across archival collections, intended to "facilitate a dynamic context of
        research that develops in relation to its use over time by a wide range
        of users" <ptr target="#williams2016" loc="336"/>. This approach has been applied to orphaned
        collections in the Media Ecology Project's Historical News Media Study.</p>
        <p>For split collections, contextual information that can highlight the
        significance of the audiovisual materials already exists, so the obstacle
        becomes connecting the media objects and their contextual materials. This
        challenge provides an opportunity for enterprising archivists who are
        able to approach a more postmodern approach to description, or for digital
        humanists who have the ability to help archivists innovate in these areas,
        to think about virtually unifying the two collections. The collections of
        the National Association of Educational Broadcasters (NAEB), which are at the
        heart of the case study below, are a prime example of this lost potential for
        discoverability.</p>
        </div>
        <div><head>What is a 'temporal commitment barrier,' and how does it pose
        challenges for the use of audiovisual collections as primary resources?</head>
        <p>In a <ref
        target="https://mith.umd.edu/dialogues/dd-fall-2017-sarah-florini/">2017 talk at
        MITH</ref>,
        scholar Sarah Florini discussed how black social media fandom employed
        strategies to mitigate the affordances of particular platforms, including
        podcasts, invoking the term "temporal commitment barrier." <ptr target="#florini2017"/>
        Lifting that out and employing it here, it becomes a useful term
        to invoke the notion of how users of A/V collections can easily become
        overwhelmed by the sheer listening hours needed to research time-based
        collections. Obviously, this barrier increases in size exponentially with
        a large corpus of materials and many thousands of hours of content. A
        solution to overcome this barrier, the use of time-stamped, synchronized
        transcripts, has been increasingly adopted by the audiovisual archiving
        field. An early adopter was the WGBH Media Library and Archives,
        who employed it for their project <emph>Vietnam:
        A Television History</emph>
        as early as 2006. Use of this approach has been fueled in part by access
        to automated speech-to-text tools, which has lowered the barrier of
        entry and made it so that human labor was not needed to transcribe entire
        time-based works. Oral histories are most often embracing the technology,
        as evidenced by the popularity of the open source software OHMS (Oral
        History Metadata Synchronizer) out of the University of Kentucky
        <ptr target="#breaden2016"/>.
        OHMS employs both transcripts and indexing functionality to gain
        access to subparts of a time-based asset. The consulting company AVP
        (formerly AVPreserve) uses OHMS as the basis of its popular platform
        Aviary, which AVP licenses as a robust front-end interface. Aviary can
        be integrated with a variety of platforms, providing a functional, usable
        display next to descriptive context. The AMPAS Oral History Projects
        department uses OHMS to index and display synched transcripts for its
        collection of filmmaker interviews.</p>
        <p>Scholar Tanya Clement has discussed the use of transcripts as a means
        to link a single audio or video event together with transcripts as a sort
        of scholarly primitive, invoking John Unsworth's use of the term [Clement
        2015], while also acknowledging the limitations and limited vision of such
        approaches, stating "It is also our inability to conceive of and to express
        what we want to do with sound — what Jerome McGann (2001) calls 'imagining
        what you don't know' — that precludes us from leveraging existing computational
        resources and profoundly inhibits DH technical and theoretical development
        in sound studies" [Clement 2015]. The use of transcripts to 'read the text'
        of time-based media objects may indeed be a form of scholarly primitive, but
        it's still only just gaining traction in the field, with many adopters still
        struggling to implement synced transcripts in a usable fashion. It was only
        this year when the OHMS software was even able to introduce the ability to
        import pre-existing time stamps for transcripts — previously the tool required
        its users to manually create the sync points through a very clunky process
        of hearing beeps and marking the text you hear. The Pop Up Archive,
        a nonprofit which for several years received copious financial support from
        various government and private funders, provided speech to text services
        as well as integrations and features to correct, reuse, and embed those
        transcripts in other applications. The service fulfilled a need which was
        acknowledged and lauded by the funding community, before it closed down
        services in 2017 after being bought out by Apple.
        Since then, former users of the service have splintered off and utilized
        different methodologies to achieve this same need. Some of them go towards open
        source solutions, some develop their own approaches. One of the transcription
        formats that Pop Up Archive provided included WebVTT.
        Since 2012 WebVTT has been supported in all major Web browsers. The
        standardization of WebVTT was not without controversy, due to its decision to
        forgo the use of the XML based transcription standard TTML.
        However, browser support for WebVTT and the
        Web Audio API <ptr target="#adenot2018"/>
        make it a logical choice for audio transcription projects because it greatly
        simplifies the synchronization of audio and transcripts in the browser.</p>
        </div>
        <div><head>Increasing
        the use of audiovisual collections for scholarly study</head>
        <p>Scholars have addressed the enormous challenges of arrangement and
        description for the vast amount of audiovisual material now produced every
        day, such as Virginia Kuhn's discussion of this problem in her argument for
        a mixed methods approach to analyzing filmic media <ptr target="#kuhn2018" loc="301"/>. But the
        issues outlined above have contributed to a situation in which archival A/V
        collections similarly face problems of underdescription and temporal barriers,
        leading them to become neglected materials despite their availability to
        researchers. Many collections lack the detailed metadata and clear contextual
        explanation that would make them more accessible, so a/v materials often remain
        underexplored by scholars and educators. Digital humanists have an opportunity
        to promote the use of a/v materials by restoring the relationships that were
        severed by split collections, highlighting their value as primary historical
        records alongside contextual paper materials. As one example of a project with
        this goal, <emph>Unlocking the Airwaves</emph> is presented<emph>.</emph> The
        section starts off with some background into both the NAEB collections and the

        and workflows.</p>
        </div></div>
        <div><head>Case Study: The Unlocking the Airwaves project</head>
        <p><emph>Unlocking the Airwaves</emph> was in development and fundraising
        between 2013-2018 prior to being funded by the National Endowment for the
        Humanities in April 2018. As of June 2020, the project team has launched a
        beta version of the website, and has made substantial progress towards a final
        launch in Fall 2020. Although we still have five months to complete the final
        stages of the project, including the publication of exhibits and teaching
        tools, we have leveraged a range of digital strategies to bring together
        the NAEB's split paper and audio collections. Throughout this project, we
        have successfully combined existing tools and frameworks, such as a minimal
        computing application design, linked data, and synced transcripts, to make
        the collections accessible to users while minimizing cost and long-term
        maintenance. Although every split collection poses different problems for
        potential reunification efforts, <emph>Unlocking the Airwaves</emph> provides
        one method for digital humanists to reunite collections, creating new access
        points to A/V materials and positioning them within their historical context.

        <div><head>The NAEB Collections</head>
        <p>Before the ubiquity of National Public Radio (NPR) and the Public
        Broadcasting Service (PBS), the National Association of Educational
        Broadcasters (NAEB) was the primary institution responsible for
        promoting and distributing public broadcasting content in the
        United States. The NAEB was initially established as the Association
        of College and University Broadcasting Stations in 1925.
        Member stations attempted to share programming resources in various ways
        until the organization created a distribution network in 1949, which was run
        from the NAEB's first national headquarters at the University of Illinois in
        Champaign-Urbana beginning in 1951. The organization grew steadily during the
        1950s and 1960s, achieving a key moment in its history when the NAEB's director
        of radio distribution Jerrold Sandler successfully lobbied to insert language
        supporting public and educational radio into the Public Broadcasting Act of
        1967. While this led to the creation of NPR, it also caused the demise of the
        NAEB in 1981 and preceded the separation of its historical records. Thousands
        of audio recordings were transferred to NPR in Washington DC and later
        added to the University of Maryland Libraries' National Public Broadcasting
        Archives, whereas the paper records were mostly archived in the Wisconsin
        State Historical Society (now Wisconsin Historical Society, WHS), deposited
        by longtime NAEB President William G. Harley. This separation of the NAEB's
        audio and paper collections complicates a full understanding of broadcasting's
        history in the United States.</p>
        <figure xml:id="figure01">
          <head><emph>NAEB Newsletter</emph>, archived in the collections of the Wisconsin Historical Society.</head>
          <graphic url="resources/images/figure01.jpg"/>
        </figure>
        <p>Unfortunately, although researchers at the WHS could <emph>see</emph>
        these aspects of the NAEB, they could not <emph>hear</emph> them. The split
        between the paper and audio materials in the collection prevented the discovery
        of connections between the everyday practices of the NAEB and the media it
        presented to the public. Considering the two sides of the archival collection
        together can contextualize the philosophy, objectives, and practices of the
        organization that broadcast the radio programs. In the daily correspondence
        of the NAEB's staff and key members and publications like the <emph>NAEB
        Newsletter</emph> (see <ref target="#figure01">Figure 1</ref>), the paper material covers everything from
        aesthetic norms to political aims, and illustrates how the values and goals
        of the organization influenced the types of programs it broadcasted and the
        eventual development of the public radio that we know today. The importance of
        the NAEB cannot be fully understood without restoring the connections between
        the audio and the paper materials, and the NAEB collection is just one of many
        collections that could benefit from this reunification of split materials.</p>
        <p>The availability of A/V materials, like the NAEB radio programs, can allow
        scholars and educators to answer significant research questions that might
        not be possible with only a collection's paper materials. In the case of the
        NAEB, the content of thousands of episodes reveals distinct perspectives on
        key social and political topics from the period. For example, <emph>People
        Under Communism</emph> focuses on various aspects of life in Soviet Russia,
        including music and literature, and <emph>Seeds of Discontent</emph> examines
        the disadvantages facing various "discontented forces" in the United States
        through interviews with groups ranging from black artists in the entertainment
        industry to public school teachers. Other programs like <emph>American
        Adventure</emph> and <emph>The Jeffersonian Heritage</emph> seek both to
        educate and entertain with dramatized figures and moments from American
        history. Even when the paper materials might include summaries or outlines
        of a program's individual episodes, accessing the audio itself affords the
        study of aesthetic questions beyond content alone, like music, performance,
        audio effects, and timing. The topics generated by the audio programs can
        fruitfully intersect with the paper materials, like the correspondence and
        reports from the NAEB that reveal the program committee's aesthetic priorities
        and tastes. The committee's discussions cover everything from the quality
        of acting to the adequacy of episode introductions in program submissions,
        providing context for the types of radio that the NAEB preferred, as well
        as the responses to programs that did not fit the members' interests.</p>
        </div>
        <div><head>Background &amp; Project Goals</head>
        <p>At the onset of the project, the radio programs were already digitized and
        transcribed through the University of Maryland Libraries' prior collaborations
        with the American Archive of Public Broadcasting (AAPB) and Pop Up Archive. The paper
        collections had been described in an online finding aid, but not yet digitized.
        As of June 2020, we've achieved four of the project's five major milestones and
        are quickly approaching the completion of the fifth:</p>
        <list type="ordered">
          <item>Digitize an identified subsection of the NAEB paper collection in-house
          at the Wisconsin Historical Society;</item>
          <item>Create new metadata about the digitized material, including a
          set of archival authority records about early educational and public
          broadcasting;</item>
          <item>Design the backend structure of the application utilizing a combination
          of select linked data and minimal computing methodologies;</item>
          <item>Design and test a user interface informed by gathered user
          stories;</item>
          <item>Integrate exhibits and teaching guides in the application, as well as
          curated access points both in and outside of the application.</item>
        </list>
        </div>
        <div><head>System Design and Object Model </head>
        <p><emph>Unlocking the Airwaves</emph> employs a minimal computing application
        design, which combines static site generation, client-side web framework and
        indexing technologies to minimize server side dependencies, and greatly reduce
        the cost of deployment and long-term maintenance. As the Internet has become
        more central to the practice of humanities research and cultural heritage, the
        tools to publish websites have become increasingly complex. This is especially
        true for websites meant to serve as digital collections or archives. While
        many libraries, archives, and museums now recognize the value of having their
        collections accessible online — and while many humanities scholars build
        personal or thematic digital research collections as part of their scholarship
        — the tools and infrastructure to achieve this can strain the capabilities and
        resources of even privileged institutions. One of the primary goals of minimal
        computing is to reduce the dependence on costly web and Internet service
        infrastructures.</p>
        <p>"Static site generators" are pieces of software for generating static
        content that can then be copied to and served up by web servers. This web
        content is called "static" because of its representation as simple files
        on disk (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, images, video) that do not require content
        management software (CMS) to access, and can simply be viewed as-is in a web
        browser. Static websites are useful for sustainability since they require
        very little in terms of maintenance and monitoring. But this sustainability
        is achieved by pushing some of the complexity of a dynamic website into
        the static website's build process. Fortunately, this build process happens
        just once when the site is deployed, rather than every time a resource is
        fetched by a user. Although tools such as Columbia University's Wax
        and University of Idaho's Collection Builder
        have used static site generators to provide a generalized framework for
        building digital exhibitions and collections in an easily deployable, portable
        and low-maintenance web application, none of them have attempted to do so while
        simultaneously reunifying distributed collections. Combining minimal computing
        and static site generation with the aforementioned methodologies of virtual
        reunification, linked data, and synced transcripts allows us to examine facets
        of digital collection building and maintenance that have been explored with
        "standard" online platforms and software, but which have not been investigated
        in these more complex frameworks.</p>

        website is being generated as a static site using Gatsby
        which is a static website generator written in the NodeJS development
        environment. Even though the website is deployed as a set of static

        its <emph>build</emph> and <emph>runtime</emph>. The <emph>build</emph> is
        a process that happens once when the site is deployed, and
        the <emph>runtime</emph> is the process run by a browser when a user accesses
        the site. These services include:</p>

        <p>The audio files are redundantly stored on the servers of the American
        Archive of Public Broadcasting (AAPB) and
        on hard drives at UMD Libraries, with streaming copies hosted in an Amazon
        Web Services S3 bucket. Machine-generated audio transcripts are currently
        being stored as WebVTT files, also in an S3 bucket, which feeds into the
        application and merges the audio and transcripts for display in <emph>a</emph>
        WebVTT player designed by MITH Developer Ed Summers. This display creates one
        way to work around the 'temporal commitment barrier' that often accompanies
        audiovisual collections, as users will be able to search for terms that appear
        in the episode transcripts or scroll through and navigate to certain parts of
        episodes based on their interests, without having to listen to them in their
        entirety.</p>
        <p>The digitized images of the paper collections are being redundantly stored
        on a 34TB RAID at the University of Wisconsin-Madison's CommArts Instructional
        Media Center, as well as on Internet Archive (IA) servers. Co-PI Eric Hoyt
        has been utilizing the Internet Archive for materials he and his team have
        produced for the Media History Digital Library, which creates automatic
        access derivatives including OCR files. Since the Internet Archive offers
        integration with the International Image Interoperability Framework (IIIF),
        the project team
        made the decision to use the IA as part of our digitization workflow, not only
        for redundant storage/access points and creating derivatives for all scanned
        materials, but also so we could utilize the Mirador image viewer.
        Mirador supports the IIIF standard, and the new version is written in the
        JavaScript library React, which dovetails nicely with Gatsby. This approach
        has saved us significant time and effort, as we can capitalize on linked data
        technology to display the documents, as opposed to hosting them on our own
        servers.</p>
        <p>To track and consolidate metadata for the paper and audio materials, we
        opted to utilize the cloud-based relational database software tool Airtable
        for distributed data curation. This Airtable database has the added benefit of
        functioning as a project management tool for the digitization process, and as
        a means for publishing the digitized materials to the Internet Archive. Summers
        also developed a custom uploader program that utilizes Airtable's Application
        Programming Interface (API) to automatically take a folder of individual
        digitized images from a given folder, bundle them into one package, upload
        them to the NAEB collection on the Internet Archive, and map the metadata from
        Airtable into the Internet Archive's metadata schema. More about our choices
        for descriptive workflows and standards is included in the section below.</p>
        <p>The exhibits and teaching tools are created by a distributed team of
        curators, who enter text, links, images, and captions into a graphical user
        interface using Netlify CMS. Netlify watches the airwaves GitHub repository,
        automatically builds a distinct staging site used for development and testing,
        then generates the exhibit pages in the application. As a plugin, Netlify is
        also responsive to our content model, which means that curators are able to
        directly attach links to people, organizations, or programs directly from its
        user interface.</p>
        <p>The CSS files comprising the front end design graphics are being generated
        by MITH Designer Kirsten Keister using Dreamweaver, then published to
        the Airwaves application in GitHub. Tweaks and modifications to text on
        static pages can be modified directly in GitHub, but design changes must
        be separately committed by Keister. Select screen captures from the beta
        version of the application website can be viewed below (see <ref target="#figure02">Figure 2</ref>

        <p>The challenge inherent with possible data models for this application is
        that we want to enhance discoverability between these two major collections,
        while retaining the semantic and descriptive properties of each. Utilizing
        virtual reunification and linked data, our approach allows us to meet the
        challenges presented by the Archival Diaspora, while respecting institutional
        mandates and priorities. Below (see <ref target="#figure06">Figure 6</ref>) is the object model, which
        recalls key elements and components of the project data such as radio series,
        radio episodes, archival series, archival folders, and authorities (Person,
        Organization, Topic).</p>
        <figure xml:id="figure06">
          <head><emph>Unlocking the Airwaves</emph> Object Model.</head>
          <graphic url="resources/images/figure06.png"/>
        </figure>
        <p>Both the NAEB paper materials (at WHS) and the NAEB audio materials (at UMD)
        had already been cataloged and described according to established professional
        standards. The finding aid for the paper materials at WHS were encoded with the
        Encoded Archival Description (EAD) standard (see <ref target="#figure07">Figure 7</ref>). The audio materials
        had been described at the item level using the PBCore standard, which is based
        on the Dublin Core metadata schema with a number of added elements useful for
        media, making it possible to extend basic descriptive records by specifying
        sources, taxonomies, and parts of a media object.</p>
        <figure xml:id="figure07">

          <graphic url="resources/images/figure07.png"/>
        </figure>
        <p>Recognizing the aforementioned challenges with different institutional
        imperatives driving archival description choices, we wanted to identify and
        track descriptive data about digitized materials in a manner that didn't
        interrupt or fundamentally change each collection's canonical metadata. The
        choice of Airtable as an interlocutor of sorts helped us enable our virtual
        reunification strategy, serving as a centralized location where we could create
        these links within the database by harnessing Airtable's various features,
        while also exploiting its API to connect this connective tissue out to various
        endpoints at various stages in the workflow.</p>
        <p>Folder level details already present in the EAD were imported into an
        initial table in the Airtable base, which was then used to a) identify and
        prioritize boxes and folders to digitize, b) monitor their digitization and
        description progress, and c) use the Dublin Core metadata schema to describe
        the paper materials at the folder level.</p>
        <p>PBCore records for the audio materials were also imported into the same
        Airtable base as a separate table. This allowed us to connect the paper to
        the audio by linking key descriptive elements where they align across the
        Dublin Core and PBCore schemas: by Creator, Contributor, Subjects, Temporal
        and Spatial Coverage, and Dates. These linkages were achieved through separate
        tables for People, Corporate Bodies, Subjects, and Geographic Locations.
        Figures 8-12 below illustrate how all of these various tables were structured
        within the Airtable base.</p>

        </figure>
        <p>In the final phases of the project, we are establishing workflows and
        documentation for porting the newly created metadata back out to select
        endpoints. This involves utilizing Airtable's API to generate JSON files, which
        we can then be transformed into different formats:</p>
        <list type="ordered">
          <item>valid PBCore XML records to deliver to University of Maryland Libraries
          and to the AAPB in order to respect the descriptive formats and choices of the
          institutional stewards of the collections';</item>
          <item>EAC-CPF records to submit to the Social Networks and Archival Context
          (SNAC) project in order to encourage wider adoption of standardized authority
          records about early educational radio by other institutions with complementary
          holdings (thus bridging the Archival Diaspora); and</item>
          <item>mapping archival authorities to Wikidata, in order to further extend the
          use of the newly created authority records to a wider audience.</item>
        </list>
        <p>For the latter two, we are identifying a key subset of archival authorities
        (roughly 200) for People and Corporate Bodies which are either central/crucial
        to the NAEB's development, initiatives, or programs, or not currently
        represented in the broader world of published authorities, i.e. in the Library
        of Congress, SNAC, VIAF, or Wikidata. All of the above choices reflect a
        calculated assessment of established and emerging descriptive standards and
        practices in the archival field, while also harnessing digital humanities
        tools, methodologies, and workflows to deploy them in innovative ways.</p>
        </div></div>
        <div><head>Conclusions and Possible Futures</head>
        <p>Digital humanities projects like <emph>Unlocking the Airwaves</emph> not
        only make A/V materials more accessible to scholars, but they also position
        A/V within their specific contexts of production and distribution. Split
        collections make A/V materials less accessible and obscure the connections that
        can emerge from contextual resources, so virtual reunification projects offer
        the possibility of elevating A/V materials as research sources. In the case of
        the NAEB, the paper records tell the story of an organization as it developed
        an infrastructure for national educational radio, and the A/V materials
        include hundreds of programs covering a wide array of topics and approaches.
        The NAEB's programs, produced between 1952 and 1970, represent a period of
        astonishing growth, turmoil and social change in the United States. Bringing
        the NAEB's papers and audio together can reinstate the centrality of the radio
        programs in the story of the NAEB, while presenting them in the context of
        their circulation. Beyond its obvious relevance to scholars interested in the
        history of educational and public media there is also an important pedagogical
        added value to such an approach. In its present form, the online collection
        can be integrated into curricula in American History, Politics, Social Science,
        African American History and Culture, Art and Music. This approach thus not
        only enriches research possibilities, but also restores the status of A/V
        collections as primary sources worthy of attention and analysis.</p>
        <p>Although we are still of the project's final stages, including the
        development of all exhibits and teaching tools, the team is already
        thinking through ways we can improve our interoperability and linked
        data approaches to exploit the possibilities of the semantic web. We
        have been thinking through transformation of project data into JSON-LD,
        developing workflows with OpenRefine, using
        Wikidata to display knowledge graphs within the application,
        and integrating our archival authorities with other related collections within
        SNAC. For these future phases, we welcome inquiries and ideas from potential
        collaborators working in similar ways with similar resources.</p>
        <p>A major benefit of this work will be demonstrating new and innovative
        digital humanities approaches towards increasing the discoverability of
        audiovisual collections in ways that allow for better contextual description,
        and a flexible framework for connecting audiovisual collections to related
        archival collections. With the publication of this resource, we will have
        documented a tangible solution for this set of challenges.</p>
