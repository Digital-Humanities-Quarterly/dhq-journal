                  <p>In this article I call for more recognition of and scholarly engagement with
                     public, volunteer digital humanities projects, using the example of LibriVox.org
                     to consider what public, sustainable, digital humanities work can look like
                     beyond the contexts of institutional sponsorship. Thousands of volunteers are
                     using LibriVox to collaboratively produce free audiobook versions of texts in
                     the US public domain. The work of finding, selecting, and preparing texts to be
                     digitized and published in audio form is complex and slow, and not all of this
                     labor is ultimately visible, valued, or rewarded. Drawing on an ethnographic
                     study of 12 years of archived discourse and documentation, I interrogate digital
                     traces of the processes by which several LibriVox versions of <cite class="title italic">Anne of Green Gables</cite> have come into being, watching
                     for ways in which policies and infrastructure have been influenced by variously
                     visible and invisible forms of work. Making visible the intricate, unique,
                     archived experiences of the crowdsourcing community of LibriVox volunteers and
                     their tools adds to still-emerging discussions about how to value
                     extra-institutional, public, distributed digital humanities work.</p>

                  <div class="ptext" id="p1">At LibriVox.org there are eight different audiobook versions of Lucy Maud
                     Montgomery’s <cite class="title italic">Anne of Green Gables</cite>, all created by
                     volunteers for LibriVox’s public domain audiobook collection. The most recent of
                     these versions was begun and completed in 2016 — not in response to any great
                     need for another free digital audio version of the book, but explicitly because
                     such a well-loved story was seen as an unintimidating and fun way for those less
                     familiar with LibriVox to engage and become more familiar with the community’s
                     audiobook-making processes. Another children’s classic, <cite class="title italic">Little Women</cite>, was also being re-recorded in its fourth version that
                     summer, and veteran volunteers like MaryAnnSpiegel<a class="noteRef" href="#d4e175">[1]</a>,
                     who coordinated the 2016 <cite class="title italic">Anne</cite>, recognized the
                     popularity of these works as potentially useful gateways through which newer
                     LibriVox volunteers could learn and engage with the production processes of the
                     LibriVox audiobook project [<a class="ref" href="#spiegel2016">Spiegel 2016</a>].</div>

                  <div class="ptext" id="p2">LibriVox workflows have developed in an ad hoc manner, across multiple online and
                     offline spaces, negotiated by volunteers who were learning together how best to
                     support and steward this open digital project. Built upon the affordances
                     provided by new models of collaborative production [<a class="ref" href="#howe2006">Howe 2006</a>]

                     [<a class="ref" href="#shirky2010">Shirky 2010</a>] and the increasing availability and accessibility of
                     digital tools and platforms, the LibriVox project invites any willing volunteers
                     to join in their mission “To make all books in the public
                     domain available, for free, in audio format on the internet”
                     [<a class="ref" href="#librivoxnd">LibriVox, n.d.</a>]. LibriVox productions are most often deeply
                     collaborative, with several readers recording smaller sections of a text. All
                     languages, accents, and reading styles are welcome, and anyone willing to
                     propose, manage, and complete an audiobook project is encouraged to contribute.
                     Aside from an insistence on public domain content recorded in standard,
                     accessible file formats, there are no firm rules about how volunteers perform
                     this work. LibriVox volunteers operate collaboratively, but independently,
                     without institutional sponsorship and without much official direction or
                     management beyond their own transient, global, online community of practice.
                     However, there is a need for consistency and some degree of shared policy in
                     coordinating the contributions of thousands of diverse volunteers. Volunteers
                     must find ways to reliably coordinate the labor not only of recording and
                     distributing audiobooks, but also the labor of developing, documenting, and
                     maintaining a set of “standard,” inviting production
                     processes, while also allowing the project to remain open, flexible, and
                     relatively convenient for current and prospective members. The dual priorities
                     of maintaining an open, inviting community while also aiming for clear,
                     accessible, and consistently high-quality recordings from all volunteers can
                     occasionally seem at odds. Each volunteer confronts and negotiates her own sense
                     of balance within that tension, and along the way, subtly reinforces or
                     undermines the current status quo within the wider project. Within such a
                     context of production, where individuals from diverse cultures are encouraged to
                     contribute as much or as little as their time and interests allow, how do
                     LibriVox volunteers (collaboratively and individually) navigate the technical,
                     sociocultural, and material contexts in which their audio recording and editing
                     work takes place?</div>

                  <div class="ptext" id="p3">By tracing the digital publishing history of LibriVox and examining how its
                     volunteers have managed and negotiated procedures and policies for their ongoing
                     collaborative work, I begin to make visible the intricate, unique, archived
                     experiences of these volunteer digital humanists, while acknowledging that there
                     are myriad ways in which volunteers’ efforts — whether with LibriVox or any
                     other public digital humanities endeavor — can never fully be accessed or
                     quantified. In what follows, I situate LibriVox as a valuable digital humanities
                     project and argue for more scholarly recognition of and engagement with public,
                     volunteer digital humanities projects. I ask that we consider what digital
                     humanities work can and does look like outside of the constraints and
                     affordances of institutional or scholarly sponsorship.</div>

                     allows us to begin to understand the evolving workflows of this public, open
                     digitization work and to make visible the work that has helped support thirteen
                     years of functional, productive, and sustained collaboration across cultures,
                     languages, platforms, and media. Often the work of organizing, networking,
                     planning, meta-writing, negotiating change, accommodating new members,
                     moderating disputes, and other behind-the-scenes work that is often a part of
                     complex digital humanities projects can be erased or made less visible. Such
                     foundational, behind-the-scenes work can easily blend into the shapes of larger
                     tasks that leave deeper, more obvious traces. As Star and Strauss (1999)
                     discuss, what is “counted” as work may be marked by a
                     “gamut of indicators” — physical, social, legal,
                     and so on, and “All along this continuum, the visibility and
                     legitimacy of work can never be taken for granted”
                     [<a class="ref" href="#star1999">Star and Strauss 1999</a>, 15]. Impressive finished projects can easily
                     eclipse the smaller, more thinly-spread negotiations and interpersonal work
                     taken on by multiple volunteers across weeks or months or years. Circumstances
                     of material or social privilege can also very easily be overlooked, made
                     invisible by the assumptions we make about the supposedly egalitarian nature of
                     digital technology and distributed, networked communities. Only in retracing the
                     archived conversations of the LibriVox community can the extent of volunteers’
                     collaborative thinking, rethinking, and working be made more consistently
                     visible.</div>

                     should necessarily be granted any of the recognition we tend to assign to work
                     in a traditional sense, but in order to showcase the significance and impact of

                     way most cars are produced), but social — or “how most

                     pressure from any outside economic or political interests. Within the strict
                     legal boundaries of the US public domain, LibriVox volunteers otherwise have the
                     freedom to determine their own policies and workflows amongst themselves. Five
                     fundamental principles frame the project’s mission and practices:

                     </ul>Because all LibriVox audio editions are donated back into the public

                     personal, educational, or commercial purposes. Thus, in the case of LibriVox,
                     value produced within the group is also shared with non-members, who are welcome
                     to share and distribute that work further.</div>

                     copyright restrictions is eligible for inclusion; volunteers have recorded
                     novels, plays, poetry, cookbooks, textbooks, and government documents. Included
                     among these are versions of well-known stories like <cite class="title italic">Beowulf</cite> and <cite class="title italic">Hamlet</cite>, as well as many
                     other more obscure texts that commercial publishers would have very little
                     incentive to reproduce. Monetary incentives and financial profit are not the
                     primary values driving community-based production models — the novelty of
                     participating, the social capital or ethos gained through providing service, and
                     personal enjoyment of the activity can be equally powerful motivations. Because
                     LibriVox functions so separately from commercial frames of value and production,

                     and preparing texts to be digitized and published in audio form can be complex
                     and slow. According to the needs of each project, LibriVox volunteers may
                     perform the labor of curators, copyright sleuths, digital content managers,

                     time since its founding, the Librivox project has grown and shifted in response
                     to new technological developments and as a result of volunteers’ changing levels
                     of engagement and literacy with regard to what LibriVox is about. As LibriVox
                     founder Hugh McGuire reflected in a 2007 blogpost, “the
                     whole thing — the system — evolved like an organism, getting more complex in
                     response to environmental challenges. More readers, more books, more
                     languages, more projects required a slow evolution of a management”
                     [<a class="ref" href="#mcguire2007">McGuire 2007</a>]. Audio recording practices, project management
                     practices, and digital cataloging procedures at LibriVox have evolved under the
                     influence of past practices. Community norms and standards have been shaped by
                     small, ad hoc, or makeshift decisions influenced by the material circumstances,
                     constraints, and affordances of the project’s context overall and various
                     volunteers’ contexts individually. Some of this growth and evolution is recorded
                     and visible in the archived digital artifacts of the community. Some, however,
                     is more hidden, or has been lost, ultimately making a full recovery of
                     LibriVox’s distributed history impossible.</div>

                     of project types (collaborative, individual, and one dramatic performance).
                     Together, all eight versions include contributions from 51 individual volunteer

                     contingent of LibriVox members. By reviewing this range of audio production

                     true provenance of her performance. This instance in which the true embodied
                     practice of an individual LibriVox volunteer is hidden behind a screen of
                     metadata, presumed policy, or other project management convention, is one among
                     many. Conversely, there are also examples where community policies and
                     conventions are superseded by the specific needs or constraints of a volunteers’
                     material situation. Inconsistencies are prevalent across many of the very first
                     items cataloged. Only later in LibriVox’s development were readers regularly
                     given instruction to read from a specific digital text and only that text. Even
                     still, knowing precisely which text (or in which format, browser, or type of
                     screen) an individual reader read from in every particular case would be a
                     difficult matter to ascertain.</div>

                        LibriVox was roughly four months old at this stage, and much of its
                        infrastructure had yet to be built. That month, the number of active
                        volunteers fell just short of 200, and only a dozen audiobooks had been
                        completed [<a class="ref" href="#mowatt2007">Mowatt 2007</a>]. Standard technical specifications for

                        Smith’s observations about communities of practice: “Unlike the trajectory of a team that’s planned from the start,
                        communities unfold over time without a predefined ending point.
                        Communities often start tentatively, with only an initial sense of why
                        they should come together and with modest technology resources”
                        [<a class="ref" href="#wenger2009">Wenger, White, and Smith 2009</a>, 540]. The beginnings of LibriVox were
                        tentative, but also bold. Volunteers gathered first to a simple blog, then
                        to forums, making do with whatever other digital platforms and tools they
                        found useful. Several coordinators donated their own server space as
                        temporary storage for the audio files of projects-in-process, and others
                        used third-party file transfer sites such as <cite class="title italic">yousendit.com</cite> or <cite class="title italic">megaupload.com</cite>.
                        Hyperlinks to these temporary sites of storage are still present, but
                        broken, in this and many other early LibriVox project threads. Though no
                        longer useable as paths to the works-in-progress they once were, they leave
                        traces that evidence volunteers’ generosity, savvy, and resourcefulness in
                        the early days of LibriVox. The ability and willingness to share/donate
                        personal resources (such as time and server space) and the technical savvy
                        to do so were important factors in helping LibriVox grow and settle into the
                        robust volunteer space it has ultimately become.</div>

                        sites or from generous volunteers with their own server space, continued for
                        several months. It wasn’t until nearly two years later when LibriVox could
                        claim its own central server space (also maintained via donation, and also
                        meant to be temporary — all finished audiobooks are hosted more permanently
                        at <cite class="title italic">archive.org</cite>). Even still, to some extent,
                        the transient nature of works-in-progress at LibriVox persists. Completed
                        projects at LibriVox still bear consistent marks of a transience, since even
                        the central LibriVox file storage space is continually overwritten with new
                        works-in-progress as previous works are finished and moved to their final
                        catalog spaces. Evidence of this in-between labor is not meant to last, but
                        does leave behind traces of past infrastructure (or lack thereof) and
                        infrastructural development. As the LibriVox project has become more
                        established and developed more standardized, centralized procedures, its
                        community has also become more accessible to volunteers who may lack the

                        as little effort as they wish. Volunteer LibriVox coordinators do not
                        require previous audio recording experience and do not necessarily expect
                        any lasting commitment. When sections or roles in a project are claimed but
                        not completed within a reasonable time (determined by the project’s
                        coordinators), the convention at LibriVox is to “orphan”
                        those sections and open them up for other volunteers to take on. Orphaned
                        sections are common; all four of these collaborative <cite class="title italic">Anne of Green Gables</cite> project threads contain comments about or
                        other evidence of orphaned sections.</div>

                     <div class="ptext" id="p28">In the case of this dramatic reading, seven volunteers, most of them brand
                        new to the LibriVox forums, arrived in the project thread to claim roles in
                        the dramatic reading. Then — for reasons that now remain largely invisible
                        and unknown — these individuals never completed their planned contributions.
                        One would-be reader for the project, AmateurOzmologist (Miriam Esther
                        Goldman) did submit two chapters’ worth of Mrs. Rachel Lynde’s lines, but
                        disappeared from the thread with no public explanation before the project’s
                        end. AmateurOzmologist’s work with this text, because it was incomplete, is
                        entirely absent from and entirely unacknowledged in the finished
                        audiobook.</div>

                        it, whose un/recorded voices or other prospective efforts may ultimately not
                        make it in to the final catalog, are still a part of LibriVox. The community
                        values their willingness to volunteer even if it is only potential, put off
                        until “someday, eventually.” And ideal of loose,
                        open, volunteer-powered project means that the possibility (and apparent
                        risk) of volunteers disappearing as quickly and easily as they arrive at
                        LibriVox, of course, is unavoidable. These realities — where volunteer
                        relationships and connections are tentative, easily breakable, and often
                        lost — are part of the inviting, practical modularity of LibriVox. In
                        response, the general attitude at LibriVox is one of understanding,
                        tolerance, and patience. To tolerate so readily the apparent
                        “failure” of seemingly earnest volunteers may seem
                        something of a burden to the volunteers who do complete their work in good
                        time. But part of LibriVox’s loose and open structure involves making space
                        for those invisible, not-yet contributions from potential members of the
                        project. Perhaps if they are too busy this time, they will come back to
                        volunteer next year, or the year after that. Overall, volunteers have
                        responded to the project’s open flexibility with an impressive number of
                        volunteer hours, the true quantity of which is only hinted at by the

                        as <cite class="title italic">Anne of Green Gables</cite> Version 6, she was
                        brand new to LibriVox and especially enthusiastic about recording this
                        children’s classic with which she strongly identified. The project took her
                        about six months to complete and was cataloged in July of 2013. This date
                        places WoollyBee’s solo chronologically between Version 7 (the dramatic
                        reading completed in 2010, discussed above) and Version 8 (the most recent
                        collaborative reading, completed in 2016). The reasons for the oddly
                        anachronistic tagging of both the solo recording and the dramatic reading
                        are not fully made clear in any LibriVox records I investigated, but the
                        issue is likely tied to the major catalog update that took place during the
                        summer of 2013. That August, the final stages of an in-depth, year-long
                        overhaul of the LibriVox databases, workflow tools, and infrastructure were
                        implemented [<a class="ref" href="#librivox2012a">LibriVox 2012a</a>]

                        the first half of August 2013, including one from Woolly Bee herself

                              definitely the huge update that happened maybe 3, 4 years ago. Once
                              everything was updated there was definitely a huge learning curve,
                              but I like our new system so much more. It’s so much easier to be a

                        potential to outgrow their tentative beginnings enough to warrant drastic
                        changes in infrastructure and procedures. Whether that change emerges from
                        within or is imposed from without, it will require flexible, patient human

                        generation and cost recovery. It’s about relationships, about personal

                     both, LibriVox volunteers are engaged in a particularly open and inclusive

                     This realization echoes Griffin and Hayler’s (2018) reminder that “DH tools and practices reinforce, resist, shape, and encode
                     material realities which both pre-exist, and are co-produced by
                     them.” The labor practices behind LibriVox’s ever-expanding audiobook
                     catalog are not neutral, no matter how much LibriVox as a collective might
                     espouse an ideal of impartiality. As is true of much volunteer work, individuals
                     and groups who are most resource-rich, whether in material/monetary terms,
                     education or expertise, or free time, are most likely to engage in and to
                     benefit from such labor [<a class="ref" href="#musick2008">Musick and Wilson 2008</a>]. Similarly, as Bourg (2018)
                     points out, the risks and benefits of participating in open projects are “unevenly distributed in patterns that match existing systems
                     of oppression”
                     	[<a class="ref" href="#bourg2018">Bourg 2018</a>, ¶51]. No matter now democratic or equitable
                     new digital spaces and platforms may seem, we cannot merely assume that all
                     identities or perspectives are being included. Nor can we take for granted that
                     current systems and norms are adequate for supporting and serving the needs of
                     all who might wish to be a part of public digital humanities work.</div>

                     scope of this study, but efforts to do so could add depth to further discussions
                     of public digital humanities work. Future research might also attend more
                     specifically to the reception, circulation, and wider cultural effects of

                     re-use. In retracing the archived conversations of LibriVox and in
                     re-articulating some of the organization’s changes over time, I’ve begun to make
                     more visible the extent of volunteers’ collaborative intellectual, social, and
                     material work. Though their efforts do not necessarily stem from scholarly
                     interest nor have the rigor that more academic digitization projects might
                     require, LibriVox volunteers are engaged in a thoroughly public and thoroughly
                     digital project, making extensive portions of human culture more widely
                     accessible to more humans. As part of this ambitious public domain project, the
                     relatively undirected work of amateurs and volunteers can make small but
                     meaningful differences in how the world’s knowledge and information is preserved
                     and passed down across media and across time. In turn, the kinds of documented
                     culture available will influence the identities and lives of those audiences:
                     the perspectives they are exposed to, the histories they may consume or to
                     contribute to, the educational opportunities they are allowed or able to access,
                     and the creative or economic or vocational decisions they might make.</div>

                     established, yet unique, institutions of digital publishing and public digital
                     humanities work, we also are more likely to remember that all institutions were
                     once new, contingent, and shaped by the small decisions of regular humans making
                     things happen as best they could with what was around. Recognizing the
                     digitization and re-mediation work of such digital humanities projects,
                     especially in spaces outside the typical institutions of workplaces and
                     academia, is important in context of our increasingly distributed and
                     decentralized world and the economic transformations that may attend increasing
                     globalization and ongoing technological advancement. Inviting and involving more
                     people into the processes of preserving human culture will mean that more kinds
                     of culture, more perspectives on and from those cultures, and more embodied
                     experiences from across diverse cultures will also be preserved and

                     on the forums and yet use their real names in their recordings, though some
                     use aliases for both and some use real names (or close variations of real
