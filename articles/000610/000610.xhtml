                     <p>This article analyzes a one-month, intensive digital collections lab focused on
                        queer and trans community history, in partnership with the LGBTQ Oral History
                        Digital Collaboratory, and based at Toronto’s The ArQuives: Canada’s LGBQT+
                        Archives. This collaboration between ten intergenerational scholars and two
                        community organizations produced three digital exhibitions, focusing on post-1945
                        Toronto-based queer and trans activist history: “Not a Place on the Map: The Desh
                        Pardesh Project,” an oral history project about the queer South Asian diasporic
                        arts and culture festival Desh Pardesh (1988 - 2001); the Foolscap Gay Oral
                        History Project, a 1980s community-based oral history project of Toronto gay life
                        pre Stonewall; and <cite class="title italic">gendertrash from hell</cite>, an early 1990s zine published by
                        transsexual artists, sex workers, and activists Mirha-Soleil Ross and Xanthra

                     <p>In analyzing our work within the context of radical pedagogy and critical DH
                        practice, we focus on how we mapped spaces, (dis)inherited metadata, and designed
                        interfaces that would offer tactile, affective engagements with these histories.
                        We analyze our work through the lens of trans(affective)mediation, an approach
                        that understands the conversion of analog to digital objects for online archives
                        in relationship to anti-racist trans studies, affect, and the collaborative
                        potential of community-engaged DH. We argue that this concept offers queer and
                        trans community-based DH scholars and practitioners a means of challenging the
                        ways in which white, cis-normativity is naturalized within both LGBTQ+ community
                        archives and digital humanities tools and practices. </p>

                     Xanthra Phillipa McKay for their 1990s zine <cite class="title italic">gendertrash from hell</cite>, the poster
                     hilariously reproduces the cut-letter aesthetic of a ransom demand, using schoolyard
                     argot to threaten “stupid dicks and wee-wees” while, at the same time, admonishing
                     their
                     faggot readers to “grow up.” The carefully cut-and-pasted magazine lettering references
                     anonymity (the form uses mechanically printed lettering to shield the individualizing
                     
                     “tell” of the hand-written), as well as the circulation of media: demands such as this
                     one show up ominously — in the movies anyway — in the target’s mailbox. Appearing
                     in
                     <cite class="title italic">gendertrash</cite>, Ross and McKay repurpose this older media form — the ransom note — as part
                     of a zine, a paper DIY publication that circulated to trans activists and others in
                     
                     Canada, the U.S. and Europe in the 1990s. Now, our collaborative team transitions
                     the
                     media once more, from analogue to digital, as we digitize <cite class="title italic">gendertrash</cite> for an open-source
                     queer and trans community archive and digital exhibition. To borrow from Jessica Marie
                     Johnson, we are recreating trans feeling in digital form: by gently releasing an
                     artifact of trans femme becoming into a digital environment, this zine will become
                     mediated through devices, metadata, “likes,” retweets, and a network of trans
                     commenters, creating in the process an instance of trans femme digital practice.[<a class="ref" href="#johnson2018">Johnson 2018</a>]</div>

                  <div class="ptext" id="p2">This essay is about how ten diverse queer and trans DIY digital humanists, mostly
                     students and all social justice oriented, created three digital exhibitions on queer
                     and
                     trans history, with accompanying podcasts, over the course of four weeks. Our project
                     was based at The ArQuives, the largest independent LGBTQ+ community archive in the
                     world, and the three projects focused on a wide range of Toronto-based queer and trans
                     activist history: “Not a Place on the Map: The Desh Pardesh Project,” an oral history
                     project about the queer South Asian diasporic arts and culture festival Desh Pardesh
                     (1988 - 2001); the Foolscap Gay Oral History Project, a 1980s community-based oral
                     history project of Toronto gay life pre-Stonewall; and <cite class="title italic">gendertrash from hell</cite>, the trans
                     zine published by Ross and MacKay in the early 1990s. We worked together daily on
                     a
                     collaboration that brought together the LGBTQ Oral History Digital Collaboratory (the
                     Collaboratory), a multi-year project on US and Canadian queer and trans oral history
                     directed by Prof. Elspeth H. Brown; The ArQuives; the South Asian Visual Arts Centre
                     (SAVAC); the

                  <div class="ptext" id="p3">Our collaboration emerges from the recognition that many gay and lesbian community
                     archives founded in the 1970s are no longer necessarily outside the mainstream and,
                     in
                     fact, now benefit from varying forms of structural inequality. Projects like ours
                     are
                     necessary in intervening in the “symbolic annihilation” of trans and BIPOC people within
                     the queer community archive [<a class="ref" href="#caswell2014">Caswell 2014b</a>] [<a class="ref" href="#caswell2017">Caswell 2017</a>] [<a class="ref" href="#brown2020">Brown 2020</a>]. These gay and lesbian archives, radical in their time in
                     many ways, are also bound up in histories of cisnormativity, whiteness, and settler
                     colonialism; this history leaves a complex affective terrain that QTBIPOC
                     activists-students-scholars must necessarily navigate as they encounter materials
                     in the
                     queer community archive. This work requires not only the labour of everyday DH praxis
                     —
                     digitizing, writing metadata, building exhibitions and podcasts — but also the affective
                     labour of navigating the archival silences and information taxonomies built for
                     documenting cis, white, gay and lesbian social movements. As Marika Cifor has argued,
                     the turn to recognizing the distinctive affective experiences of LGBQT persons and
                     collections within the archive can surface the specific needs of queer and trans people
                     whose histories have been long-denied through processes of marginalization and
                     non-recognition.[<a class="ref" href="#cifor2016a">Cifor 2016a</a>] [<a class="ref" href="#cifor2016b">Cifor 2016b</a>] [<a class="ref" href="#cifor2017">Cifor 2017</a>] While some of these affective encounters can produce a radical empathy
                     as project members encounter materials that are personally meaningful, other encounters
                     can produce more complex responses of disidentification and refusal [<a class="ref" href="#caswell2016">Caswell 2016</a>]. </div>

                     institutional boundaries of both the liberal, LGBTQ+ community archive and the
                     neoliberal university. Indeed, if part of the point of doing queer/trans digital histories
                     is providing meaningful access to generational knowledge transfer,

                     rework the idea of transmediation — the transformation of one medium to another —
                     to
                     account for the “affective stakes in the process of moving between print and digital” [<a class="ref" href="#brouwer2016">Brouwer 2016</a>].
                     Their work has focused on the affective terrain of both zine makers and zine readers,
                     who experienced contradictory feelings of affirmation and loss as digital preservation
                     intervened in zine culture’s attributes of immediacy, material vulnerability, and
                     haptic
                     intimacy. We have drawn from this work to consider the affective terrain of the queer,
                     trans, and BIPOC DIY archivists who have engaged with QTBIPOC archival objects en
                     route
                     to building DH public humanities projects. Trans(affective)mediation, we argue, is
                     a
                     valuable tool for archival and DH activists whose project goals, like ours, seek to
                     decenter whiteness, destabilize assumptions about ability, value horiztontal digital
                     labour structures, and elevate the experiences of trans and nonbinary peoples of colour.
                     In migrating media in this way, we consider transmedia as about both media and
                     embodiment: trans studies asks us to consider “trans” as not simply about embodied
                     histories, but also about movement and migration more broadly — in this particular
                     case,
                     the migration of media from analogue to digital. Our projects have addressed two forms
                     of silences: the silencing of specific voices and
                     experiences within the LGBTQ+ community archive and the erasure of marginalized,
                     non-white community members who do the daily work of curating, maintaining, researching,
                     analyzing, writing, digitizing, recording, and making within these archives [<a class="ref" href="#boellstorff2014a">Boellstorff et al. 2014a</a>]. At the
                     same time, this work has provoked mixed feelings. A methodology of
                     trans(affective)mediation has enabled us to account for this contradictory emotional
                     terrain as we both transform one medium into another and encounter both affirming
                     archival objects and those that naturalize systemic inequalities based on race, gender
                     expression, and ability. By documenting the processes that informed the mounting of
                     these three projects, this article argues that through its call to focus and reflection
                     in digital praxis and process, trans(affective)mediation offers queer and trans
                     community-based DH scholars and practitioners a means of challenging the many ways
                     that white
                     cis-normativity becomes naturalized within both LGBTQ+ community archives and digital
                     humanities tools and practices. </div>

                  <div class="ptext" id="p6">In what follows, we reflect upon and document the various methods, practices, and
                     mediations that came together in the mounting of our three projects. Through
                     trans(affective)mediation, we offer “lessons learned,” so to speak, the varying
                     affective engagements that emerged, as well as a set of protocols for what we
                     nonetheless believe is a radical, community-engaged vision of queer and trans-positive
                     DH. The first portion of our article contextualizes our work with two sections on
                     radical pedagogy and critical DH practice, as well as the challenges of “inheriting
                     [archival] data” within radical DH work. The second portion of our essay delves more
                     deeply into the specifics of the work we did together, including the ambivalences,
                     frustrations, and utopian visions of intergenerational and inter-community solidarities
                     which emerged. Following this, a section entitled “Mapping Space and Time” reflects on
                     how digital explorations of spaces using the open-source GIS platform integrated with
                     Omeka can spatialize histories of gentrification and colonization as they shape queer
                     communities over
                     time; in this section we reflect on the limits of our project for achieving the
                     intersectional results we sought. The following section, “Making Data,” reports on our
                     discussions and evolving practices around queering metadata description as a
                     materialization of complex identity formations through the deceptively simple choices
                     we
                     make about tagging. Our final section, “Trans(affective)mediation and Tactile Digital
                     Histories,” discusses the affective dimensions of working in “analog” archives in which
                     our own racial, ethnic, sexual, or gender identities are implicated, and reflects
                     and
                     reports on both content and interface design choices we made in order to offer users
                     of
                     our digital collections potential entries into these experiences with the past. Drawing
                     together the method, the making, and the digital materials that resulted, this essay
                     argues for a trans(affective)medial vision of critical DH: an approach that is deeply
                     reflective upon process; maintains a robust community-engaged praxis; and that
                     challenges both DH and archival scholars alike to consider how normative forms of
                     DH and
                     archival making, maintenance, and curation enforce dominant structures of power. </div>

                     pedagogy that values horizontal, shared leadership and open, democratic exchange is
                     central to building a critical DH praxis that is socially just and meaningfully engaged
                     in feminist, anti-racist, and anti-ableist perspectives. Early in our time together,
                     we
                     discussed our ethical commitments as a diverse collaboration of queer, trans, and
                     non-binary scholars and activists, reflecting upon how we wanted these commitments
                     to
                     shape our digital methods, our practices, our project development, and our final
                     outcomes. We wanted to develop what Anthony Bayani Rodriguez has described as a
                     “guerilla praxis,” one that “allows students to approach academic knowledge production
                     as a public good and a form of social movement activism relevant to the material conditions
                     of our times” [<a class="ref" href="#rodriguez2017">Rodriguez 2017</a>] [<a class="ref" href="#yao2018">Yao 2018</a>]. These reflections proved central to developing a
                     shared DH practice defined by 1) horizontal work relations and a meaningful division
                     of
                     labour, 2) drawing from DH’s roots in feminist pedagogy, a shared commitment to
                     intersectionality, and 3) a recognition of critical disability studies’ important
                     role
                     in the development of socially just digital projects. We sought modes of DH protocol
                     and
                     practice (transmediation) that reflected our affective-ethical commitments as DH
                     scholars and activists. As we argue here, these methodological commitments challenge
                     underlying, normative assumptions in popular DH research and teaching projects. </div>

                  <div class="ptext" id="p8">In our case, we have followed a feminist pedagogy that is both anti-racist and trans
                     centric, and which has brought together digital humanities praxis with community-engaged
                     queer and trans history. As Jessica DeSpain has argued, digital humanities’ emphasis
                     on
                     experiment, making, and collaboration is deeply indebted to a longer history of feminist
                     pedagogy, even though so much of recent digital humanities work occludes this history
                     [<a class="ref" href="#despain2016">DeSpain 2016</a>].
                     Feminist DH pedagogy foregrounds the goal of collaboration over hierarchy; designs
                     the
                     research environment so that a range of abilities are welcomed; examines the
                     relationship between technology, media, and structural inequality as the work unfolds;
                     and works closely with communities beyond the classroom. These feminist principles
                     have
                     been central to how many progressive digital humanists have understood their praxis,
                     including our own, even if they are often dismissed for their DIY roots. </div>

                     work
                     of legal scholar Kimberlé Crenshaw, an intersectional approach — one that foregrounds
                     the intersections of race, gender, and class in the analysis of structural inequality
                     —
                     allows digital humanities practitioners to overcome the field’s current divisions
                     of making/programming

Yet pursuing an intersectional approach within digital
                     humanities projects is to work against the grain because, as Tara McPherson has argued,
                     the difficulty in bringing together an analysis of race with an engagement with
                     technology is “an effect of the very designs of our technological systems, designs that
                     emerged in post-WWII computational culture” [<a class="ref" href="#mcpherson2012">McPherson 2012</a>]. We recognized that this seeming
                     difficulty in bringing together race and technology is itself a problem of privilege.

                     among others, foreground questions of race and racism in the context of white supremacy,

                     expertise in. CDS examines why and how certain body-minds are deemed normal and natural,
                     while others are not.<a class="noteRef" href="#d4e580">[3]</a> The field challenged us to conjure up alternative
                     material-discursive, labour, and digital spaces in which disability is both anticipated
                     and desired. Disabled scholars and activists have long used digital tools to participate
                     in humanities scholarship as their work has often been excluded from more traditional
                     avenues of publication.<a class="noteRef" href="#d4e586">[4]</a> Recently, digital humanities scholars have begun to consider the
                     importance of building accessible digital tools and spaces as part an intersectional

                     practice, rejecting a view of DH “tools of the trade” as neutral technological objects

                     disability studies pushes critically engaged digital humanities practitioners to
                     reimagine the form of digital tools, work, and spaces. This commitment reminded us
                     to
                     contest digital tools which function only within a system of compulsory able-bodiedness
                     and to welcome the difference in form our tools and projects

                     together, we recognized the silences which an ableist model of digital space can
                     enforce. As such, we took several steps to increase the accessibility of our three
                     exhibitions. First, any audio materials in our collections were uploaded along with
                     full
                     transcripts. Second, we used ABBYY Finereader software to apply optical character
                     recognition to all of the text-based archival materials in our collections. This allows
                     the texts to be read by screen readers, a technology which reads texts out loud and
                     is
                     used by many people who are blind or low-vision. And third, we included image
                     descriptions for any image based materials in our digital collections, and embedded
                     alt-text for images whenever possible. We used these three accessibility tools as

                  <div class="ptext" id="p12">Working with archival collections, we soon recognized our three projects as a form
                     of
                     transmedial intergenerational cultural and political transfer and inheritance, and
                     yet
                     we also recognized how both the archival collections we selected and our group itself
                     looked decidedly different from the kinds of white, cis, and heteronormative narratives
                     which are often celebrated in LGBTQ+ community archival practice. The data we inherited,
                     and the DH practices that we undertook, would have an uneasy relationship to where
                     many
                     of us understood our own position to be in LGBTQ+ history and life. We recognized
                     these
                     tricky encounters as precisely the kinds of trans(affective)mediations described by
                     Brouwer and Licona. Where they documented the various affects that emerged when using
                     queer ephemera that had been digitized, we sought to
                     explore trans(affective)mediation through the process of digitization and mounting.
                     Practically speaking, our projects drew on a range of analog and born-digital objects.
                     In some cases, we digitized oral history interviews from cassette tapes that had not
                     been listened to since the early 1980s. Other interviews conducted more recently came
                     to
                     us as digital audio, and in these cases, our “digitizing work” meant creating
                     transcripts, abstracts, metadata, and streaming audio. Across all three projects,
                     we
                     accessed larger, paper-based archival collections to curate the exhibitions, choosing
                     appropriate material to digitize and finding documents, images, photographs, and other
                     ephemera that would bring these rich histories to life for users. We designed three
                     creative exhibitions using Omeka and its Neatline plugin, an open source platform
                     for
                     digital collections designed by the Roy Rosenzweig Center for History and New Media
                     at
                     George Mason University. All three exhibitions were accompanied by podcasts, specific
                     to
                     the content and process of collaborative, critical DH praxis. Our undergraduate
                     participants curated the digital exhibitions and made the podcasts while more senior
                     members of the lab provided mentorship, including scholarly and technical support.
                     In
                     addition to the podcasts, we also took turns creating reflective social media content
                     (blogs for The ArQuives and the Collaboratory websites; Facebook, Twitter and Instagram
                     posts) about our work in progress: a form of public-facing outreach to the communities
                     we hoped to reach with our digital projects. To learn all of these technical processes,
                     we came up with a series of workshops on topics such as writing abstracts, creating
                     metadata, and using Omeka. We taught each other skills that were specific to particular
                     collections, such as digitizing cassette tapes and records, or scanning photographs.
                     In

                     Project, and a few DH librarians, via Twitter and Facebook when we wanted to learn
                     best practices
                     around document accessibility. Through these practices, all of us explored the wider,

                     As the
                     largest independent and community-based LGBTQ+ archives in the world, The ArQuives
                     houses records related to LGBTQ+ activism, art, and community life in Canada and around
                     the
                     world. The archives holds a significant periodicals collection, along with oral
                     histories and other audio; film and video; books; banners and other textiles; a modest
                     art collection; and other forms of ephemera crucial to queer world-making, such as
                     pin-buttons and nightclub matchbooks. Building the archives’ trans collections has
                     been
                     a significant focus in recent years, through partnership with the Collaboratory. Like
                     many other community archives, The ArQuives has invested heavily in developing digital

                     longer gay and lesbian history presents specific challenges to contemporary queer
                     and
                     trans archival activism, however. The ArQuives, like many 1970s gay organizations,
                     was
                     founded by a generation of gay, white, cis gendered men whose organization and activism
                     helped end the criminalization of same-sex desire and who helped found keys institutions
                     of gay and lesbian sociality, politics, and history during this period. It can be
                     difficult for activist archivists, perhaps for some white gay men in particular, to
                     understand how and why histories and methods imbricated with a heroic narrative of
                     “gay and lesbian” sacrifice and struggle can, at the same time, be a site for the
                     ongoing preservation of white, middle-class, cis values. Left unexamined, these embedded
                     narratives, which shape decisions around collections and resource allocation,

                     can learn about our intersectional, queer, and trans past while at the same time
                     learning about the The ArQuives and its extensive holdings. </div>

                     should intersect with praxis and protocol. We are an intergenerational group with
                     different relationships to the university, to gay and lesbian archives, and to the
                     labor
                     of making digital collections. Each of us contributed in significant ways to the
                     intellectual design of the digital collections we worked on. At the same time, students
                     expressed some frustration with the theory/praxis divide in DH and our projects, and
                     reflected in their evaluations that as we progressed, more and more time was spent
                     “learning technologies and putting together the exhibits.” As one student wrote in their
                     evaluation, these technical tasks were “challenging in and of themselves. But I
                     definitely [think] we could have done more to make links — like how are power relations
                     reproduced in the creation of metadata? How does our exhibition ‘trans-mediate’ these
                     materials?” That students left the lab able to frame these kind of questions in
                     relationship to the digital humanities is impressive, but it is also clear that the
                     practical work of building digital collections, which is often repetitive or even
                     mundane, overshadowed the theoretical
                     outcomes we hoped for. This article is, in part, a way of bringing those threads
                     together, to create that space and time. </div>

                     our team brought together faculty, community members, undergraduate, and graduate
                     students into work models that emphasized collaboration, presence, and co-creation.
                     As
                     one student wrote in their evaluation of the lab, “It was really great to have
                     undergrads, graduate students, postdoc, and professors all in the room together learning
                     from one another. I witnessed some really beautiful moments of mentorship, and to
                     me this
                     was an example of the way we can combat this individualistic [neoliberal] culture
                     of
                     academia in which we are told to consistently put ourselves and our careers first.”
                     Students noted that they chose projects they cared about because they aligned with
                     their
                     own interests or identity formations. At the same time, students expressed some
                     frustration with working on three separate collections, instead of drawing connections
                     across projects. As one student wrote, “I also hoped that we would do more collaboration
                     in the larger group of five rather than entirely working in the sub-groups. I had
                     hoped
                     there would be a bit more inter-group exchange. It was hard to facilitate that as
                     we
                     were short on time!” This student’s critique of collaboration illuminates some of the
                     problems that come along with grant or task based DH projects that pursue ambitious
                     outcomes in short periods of time. Sometimes “the work” gets in the way. </div>

                     allowed us to draw connections across Toronto’s queer communities, for example, by
                     connecting gay men’s cruising spaces to histories of colonization. At the end of the
                     project, we found that while these connections were often visible to us as makers,
                     they
                     did not necessarily come across for users of these discrete collections: our materials,

                     the
                     military logics of its origins as a technology. Like Gieseking, we felt this affective
                     tension acutely. We found ourselves in need of “new and easier-to-use technologies,
                     algorithms, and tools” that worked more effectiuvely against the grain of colonial

                     to become mapmakers, answering questions such as “How are places racialized, gendered,
                     classed, designated or felt as safe or dangerous? …What knowledges come from being
                     part

                     Engagement with the politics of gentrification is common to DH mapping projects that
                     draw on
                     interviews and oral histories, and recent notable examples include Kristy Kang’s Seoul

                     pursued an “old-school” approach to learning about these histories: Rodríguez led us on
                     an real-life “Radical Queer Walking Tour” shaped by their research for the GIS-enabled
                     Mapping QTBIPOC Toronto project. With this tour, Rodríguez and their collaborators
                     seek
                     to displace white supremacist histories of Toronto’s “Gay Village” with stories focused
                     on BIPOC activism, sex work, gentrification, and other ongoing struggles as they might
                     be connected to the past. <a class="noteRef" href="#d4e792">[9]</a> The tour provided students with a model for translating 
                     their own critical engagements with lived space to the histories they were working
                     on.
                     Ideally, this intersectional approach to mapping Toronto’s queer and trans past would
                     inform the curatorial approach to the students’ digital cultural mapping. </div>

                     as
                     they came together in the physical space of the city. For example, as the Foolscap
                     oral
                     histories show, one of the city’s key spaces for gay cruising and public sex had been
                     the bandstand located in (the appropriately named) Queen’s Park.<a class="noteRef" href="#d4e799">[10]</a> But in 1969 the city dismantled the 
                     bandstand and installed, in its place, a five-ton equestrian statue of King Edward
                     VII
                     donated by the Indian government while “in the process of getting rid of reminders of
                     the days of British rule” [<a class="ref" href="#wencer2014">Wencer 2014</a>]. Working with maps allowed us to understand how the
                     landscape itself functioned as a material palimpsest for overlapping histories of
                     both
                     global and local structures of power: one concerning the histories of British
                     imperialism, the Commonwealth, and the South Asian diaspora; the other concerning
                     illicit sexualities in the space of the city.<a class="noteRef" href="#d4e810">[11]</a> These overlapping histories were visible 
                     to us, as makers, to some extent, but the decision to keep the three digital collections
                     separate renders these connections invisible to users. At the end of our project,
                     we
                     concluded that what had began as a division of labour aimed at “getting as much done” as
                     possible over the course of the month reinscribed the original archival logics of
                     each
                     collection in digital space. We knew going into this project that the design of digital
                     collections would impact how users learn about Toronto’s queer and history from the
                     The
                     ArQuives’s Digital Collections site; we didn’t realize until the end of the project

                     achieving the intersectionality we sought at a deep, technological level would have
                     required us to think outside existing models for building archives and organizing
                     work. </div>

                     digitize collections that included histories of queer and trans people of colour,

                     the Mirha Soleil Ross and Desh Pardesh collection. Because we organized our work around
                     already existing collections, rather than a set of thematics that linked all of them,
                     our research design maintains the liberal tokenism of “adding” QTBIPOC to the historical

                     inundate digital archives with the same oppressive dynamics as their physical counterparts
                     by imagining movements across “separate” collections.

                     essentialisms that are sometime useful at the level of pedagogy where, for example,
                     students work on the projects that most closely match their identities while, at the
                     same time, interrogating and complicating the stability of such identity categories?
                     As
                     one of the students who worked on the Foolscap collection wrote in their evaluation
                     of
                     the lab, while they felt ready to challenge the racism and misogyny built into the
                     collection’s logic, they needed more interaction with their peers and mentors working
                     on
                     other collections in order to find the tools to do this. In retrospect we wonder what
                     this experiment would look like if we had, instead, developed a project not around
                     existing archival collections that were already organized by identity categories but
                     instead had focused on a thematic that crossed these categories — queer arts organizing
                     in Toronto in the 1980s and 90s, as one example. While our digital collections don’t
                     begin from this kind of productive schema, our interventions in writing metadata
                     achieved some success in using digital tools to undo some of the logics that govern
                     (white) “gay and lesbian” archives. We explore this work in the next section. </div>

                     political implications imbued in processes of making and revising data, weighing both
                     the necessity and limitations of standard classification practices, and discussing
                     the
                     need to critique and demystify how databases are built [<a class="ref" href="#bowker1999">Bowker 1999</a>]. We found it necessary to
                     improvise and bend some of rules that guide best practices in using controlled

                     oriented our work toward each of our political commitments and ideas about
                     identity-based terminologies. As we added objects to our digital collections and came
                     up
                     against the inevitable compromises that invoking standards requires, we moved toward
                     a
                     more flexible understanding of description [<a class="ref" href="#duff2002">Duff 2002</a>]. Our lab was an immersive experience in
                     data as something that is made through small, singular acts that add up to larger

                     and Mirha-Soleil Ross collections, digitizing the Desh
                     Pardesh oral history project made us aware of the vocabulary’s 2017 limitations for
                     describing the archives of queer of color diasporas. We discovered, for example, how
                     LGBTQ+ metadata interventions such as Homosaurus had been organized around
                     whiteness as a structuring logic. </div>

                     Desh Pardesh (“home away from home”) was a groundbreaking multidisciplinary
                     queer South Asian arts festival that operated in Toronto from 1988-2001. Bakirathi
                     Mani
                     has written that “for the decade of its existence, Desh Pardesh was a monument to the
                     possibility of creating diasporic communities that worked through national, linguistic,
                     and religious differences in order to create a queer, anti-racist, and activist South
                     Asian collectivity” [<a class="ref" href="#mani2001">Mani 2001</a>]. Since its closure in 2001, the festival has become a relic for
                     the Toronto South Asian arts community. While the festival has been sporadically
                     commemorated with a few events, reflections, and critical essays over the past 15
                     years,
                     there had yet to be any sustained investigation into this queer diasporic festival
                     which
                     took hold of the Canadian arts scene in the 1990s [<a class="ref" href="#fernandez2006">Fernandez 2006</a>]. In part, this is due to the paucity
                     of archival sources; as Gayathri Gopinath has argued, events such as Desh Pardesh
                     often
                     resist textualization because the “queer spectatorial practice and the mercurial
                     performances and more informal forms of sociality” that occur at queer diasporic night
                     clubs, festivals, and community events are not easily documented [<a class="ref" href="#gopinath2005">Gopinath 2005</a>]. To address this
                     archival silence, in 2013 Indu Vashist, SAVAC’s Executive Director, created “Not a Place
                     on the Map: The Desh Pardesh Project,” a three-year oral history project about queer
                     South Asian history in Toronto focused on Desh Pardesh. Hired in May 2014, SAVAC’s
                     Anna
                     Malla mobilized the festival’s networks to complete 36 oral interviews over two years.
                     Coinciding with the month-long research lab, the accessioning of the Desh Pardesh
                     research material at The ArQuives gave us the opportunity to tease out the
                     complexities of writing metadata for archives of queer diasporic communities and lives.
                     In using the Homosaurus to write metadata for the Desh Pardesh Project, we encountered
                     many examples that show how whiteness as normativity is embedded within LGBTQ projects.
                     “Asian Cultures” and “Anti-racism” drawn from the Homosaurus, for example, would only
                     scrape the surface of this project’s descriptive needs. The team lamented that the
                     Homosaurus could only tag queer South Asian dance practices that involved dance
                     traditions such as Bharata Natyam or Giddha as “exotic dancers,” for example; they
                     bristled at how distinctions between events and projects involving Tamil, Goan or
                     Punjabi communities would be conflated into “Asian Cultures,” “Asian Religions” or
                     “Asian Studies.” Beyond its Anglophone commitment, the use of “Asian” as a cultural and
                     racial referent exposes the Homosaurus’ Anglo-European roots. In wrestling with these
                     limits, team members
                     encounteresed and navigated what Brandon Walsh, drawing on Sianne Ngai, has described
                     as
                     the “ugly feelings” of failure as epistemology, where “frustration and anxiety are
                     central components of the classroom, not experiences to be delicately avoided” [<a class="ref" href="#walsh2019">Walsh 2019</a>]. While
                     we initially considered writing to create a new standard vocabulary for writing queer
                     South Asian diasporic metadata, this proved far too ambitious for a month-long lab.
                     In
                     the end, we took a DIY approach, blending the Homosaurus with a modest, standard
                     vocabulary that two members of our team generated out of listening to the oral history
                     interviews, and considering the language used across narrators to describe queer and
                     trans South Asian diasporic experience. Further considering the
                     cultures-religions-studies triad used to complicate “Asian” in Homosaurus, we thought
                     about the ways in which the practice of writing metadata in (white) LGBTQ archives
                     has
                     been historically marked and continues to be marked by Orientalist imaginations of
                     the
                     (Asian) Other. In the face of these LGBT archival practices, we opted to contextualize
                     the
                     project by writing into the digital collection an analysis of the further entrenchment
                     of neoliberal governmentality in Ontario under the Mike Harris government of the 1990s.
                     We hope that this reframing encourages alternative reading practices of this queer
                     diasporic archive. Since taking over the Homosaurus, Rawson has been addressing critiques
                     such as this one by working with collaborators to expand the vocabulary in key areas,
                     such as slang, BDSM, Indigenous and Black terms; the Homosaurus welcomes collaborators

                  <div class="ptext" id="p31">For the Mirha-Soleil Ross collection, another team created a page about their own
                     relationships to identification and the terminology used in <cite class="title italic">gendertrash</cite> to describe
                     trans people and trans community. As K.J. Rawson has shown, digital humanities projects
                     provide methodological tools for tracking shifting terminologies within trans
                     communities across literary and cultural production. For Rawson, DH tools are entries
                     to
                     doing community-based etymologies, which matter for understanding the shifting cultural
                     conditions in relation to which trans communities make themselves intelligible [<a class="ref" href="#rawson2014">Rawson 2014</a>]. In the
                     <cite class="title italic">gendertrash</cite> <a href="http://digitalcollections.clga.ca/exhibits/show/gendertrash/a-note-on-terminology" onclick="window.open('http://digitalcollections.clga.ca/exhibits/show/gendertrash/a-note-on-terminology'); return false" class="ref">exhibition</a>’s “A Note On Terminology,” three team members identify,
                     respectively, as a “bisexual trans man, a queer cis femme, and a queer trans man” who
                     “encounter <cite class="title italic">gendertrash</cite>’s unusual terminology not merely as an historical artifact, but
                     as a radical challenge to the way we understand identity, community, and attraction
                     that
                     remains just as relevant and necessary today.” Narrating our own reading practices
                     around identity labels and search terms makes more transparent the role of makers
                     in 
                     community-driven databases, emphasizing our subjective investments in materials as
                     a
                     force that inevitably shapes how trans histories become intelligible in the present.
                     Weaving these self reflexive discussions about terminology and its categorizing effects
                     into our digital collections mirrors the care with which we have written metadata
                     — with
                     knowledge that these terms orient users to the histories they encounter. While tags
                     and
                     keyword classification often operate in the background of user’s search retrieval
                     and
                     navigation experiences, our outward reflections on description seek to bring these
                     behind-the-scenes processes to the fore of the interface. </div>

                  <div class="ptext" id="p32">Trans(affective)mediation was central to our deliberate engagement with remediation
                     as
                     an active, and often uncomfortable process that is an inevitable part of making digital
                     objects from paper documents. As Jay Bolter and Richard Grusin have argued, remediation
                     is a primary characteristic of digital media; digital media reproduce, adapt, or
                     otherwise reference older forms [<a class="ref" href="#bolter2000">Bolter 2000</a>]. While remediation is a temporal phenomena that
                     describes the relation between “old” and “new” media, the idea of transmediation
                     explored by Henry Jenkins and others points to the difficulty of conceptually or
                     technically sustaining divisions between media forms in the context of digital
                     platforms. Techniques and aesthetics from “print,” “video,” and “the web” productively
                     converge [<a class="ref" href="#jenkins2017">Jenkins 2017</a>]. Digital archives present a peculiar kind of transition across media in that
                     they at once seek to promote and obscure the digital object’s status as reproduction.
                     Online archives promise wide access to audiences who might not ever visit a
                     brick-and-mortar archive and they do this, in part, by separating digital objects
                     from
                     their referents. On the other hand, digital archives are invested in creating
                     experiences for users that are “as good as the real thing,” a promise that rests, in
                     part, on denying the digital encounter’s status as substitute. Most members of our
                     group
                     are millennials accustomed to encountering queer and trans historical materials through
                     platforms such as Instagram; for many of us, the lab presented a first encounter with
                     archival research, and we learned basic practices in handling documents well, alongside
                     some more critical introductions to archival arrangement. We were at once captivated
                     by
                     the aura of these objects and invested in their presentation in the age of digital
                     reproduction, to paraphrase Walter Benjamin [<a class="ref" href="#benjamin1969">Benjamin 1969</a>, 217–251]. Playing with the relationship between
                     digital objects and their analog “originals” was, for us, a purposeful practice. It
                     became a significant focus when we considered selection, description and display,
                     accessibility, but also the affective encounters we were staging for ourselves, and
                     others. </div>

                     dimensions of digitized versions of queer, trans, and P.O.C. cultural heritage
                     materials. Transmediation, which they define “as the translation, or transformation, of
                     one medium into another medium, a crossing over and a conversion of one already existing
                     medium into another,” is here marked with affective potentiality, as digitization may
                     provide opportunities for distinct sensory possibilities [<a class="ref" href="#brouwer2016">Brouwer 2016</a>] [<a class="ref" href="#jenkins2021">Jenkins 2021</a>]. Brouwer and Licona capture,
                     in part, the ambivalence of digitization with this term, thinking through how online
                     reproductions of queer, trans, and P.O.C. zines offer wider access and preservation,
                     but

                     encounters for users through experimentation with the Omeka platform, as we describe
                     below. The anecdote about Mirha-Soleil Ross and Xanthra Phillippa MacKay’s “Dicks and
                     Weewees” collage that opens this article gives a sense of how our work brought this
                     attention to form, and the affective dimensions of working with paper zines, to bear
                     on
                     both digital collection design and encoding queer and trans life against the normativity
                     of metadata. </div>

                     for her video and performance art, her role as editor of the 1993-1995 zine <cite class="title italic">gendertrash</cite> and as 1997-1999 organizer of Counting Past 2 – the first international trans
                     film festival in Canada. Her sizable personal fonds at The ArQuives consists of books,
                     periodicals, videos, physical artifacts, correspondence, working papers, and periodical
                     clippings that represent not only her own work and interests as a collector, but also
                     material traces of the collaborative and more broadly social aspects of much of her
                     work. The <cite class="title italic">gendertrash</cite> series that became the focus of our digital collection contains a large amount of
                     correspondence with retailers,
                     subscribers (including prisoners who received the zine for free), and hopeful or
                     successful contributors — as well as draft manuscripts, clip art, zine pasteups, and
                     financial documents. The correspondence, more than anything else, demonstrates how
                     much
                     Ross’s practice built upon networks of trans activists, artists, and publishers across
                     North America and Europe who supported each other by the transnational exchange of
                     information, social connections, subscriptions and advertising space, despite a lack
                     of
                     complete consensus around issues like sex work, prison reform, medico legal gatekeeping,
                     and activist strategies. Our digital collection sought to reproduce, or at least gesture
                     toward these networks in some way, building upon Brouwer and Licona’s assertion that
                     digitized zines ought to be understood and experienced within extensive, complex
                     networks that reproduce but also depart from paper circulation methods [<a class="ref" href="#brouwer2016">Brouwer 2016</a>, 80]. </div>

                     centered around images of the original artwork and paste-ups used to produce the zines,
                     and activist buttons (made by Ross and Mackay) that could be ordered through forms
                     published in <cite class="title italic">gendertrash</cite> and other trans periodicals. We furthermore uploaded a modified
                     version of one of these order forms to the Neatline plugin for Omeka, and made it
                     so

                     place by organizing the collection around the pre-printed form as a media infrastructure
                     of engagement. These are affective gestures that form part of what it means to

                     and racialized communities, outsiders to normative representations of “maker cultures,”
                     are often excluded. Podcasting is not actually that difficult, technically speaking,

                     allows students to engage with processes of making that enrich humanities education
                     and
                     provides opportunities for self-expression. In each of these podcasts, students found
                     ways to place themselves within the stories they told about making digital collections.

                     being brown and queer and encountering these records of a history in which you might
                     locate yourself. As one of our group described it in their podcast, “I wish that a
                     community as large and as strong as Desh still existed. What amazes me is that in
                     2017,
                     I don’t feel the same sense of empowerment as Natasha. With Desh, people weren’t alone,
                     and had the space to explore their identity within the safety of a group that feels
                     the
                     same way.” Through these podcast stories, creating queer, trans, and P.O.C.-centred
                     digital collections became precisely about critical forms of inheritance, finding
                     an
                     explicitly queer, trans, brown, or anti-racist history of the city that mirror
                     experiences today, while recognizing differences that matter. </div>

                  <div class="ptext" id="p40">Our experiments with trans(affective)mediation techniques drew on critical approaches
                     to
                     digital mapping, writing queer and trans metadata, and building online interfaces
                     in
                     order to offer users engagements with the past that were also engagements with how
                     digital collections get made. Our work together and our reflections on collaboration
                     brought forward some challenges, which will shape our work in the future. As we have
                     suggested here, while aspects of our research
                     design limited the ability of our finished collections to fully realize the anti-racist,
                     intersectional approach to queer and trans history we aimed for, we believe our approach
                     offers critical DH practitioners many entries to thinking about digital archives and
                     the
                     labouring conditions that shape how queer and trans scholars, students, and activists
                     do
                     research together. Our work is one instance of how social justice-engaged university
                     researchers from all stages of academic life can collaborate with community groups
                     to
                     produce digital collections that transmediate our relationships to the past: this
                     aspirational process draws connections across communities of struggle by breaking
                     down
                     more rigid archival logics; it can re-write the database forms and standards used
                     to
                     describe and mediate access to collections; and in turn, can offer ways to re create
                     the
                     tactile and affective dimensions of “touching” queer and trans histories. </div>
