         <dhq:abstract>
            <p>The government of the United Kingdom is offering significant amounts of funding to
               increase engagement between researchers and technology companies involved in the
                  <q>creative economy</q>, a sector worth £100b per annum. The sector has naturally
               evolved into clusters involving actors as diverse as the BBC, the Victoria and Albert
               Museum, and freelance game designers. It collaborates and competes with multinational
               powerhouses including Google, Microsoft, and Pixar. The imbrication of academic
               researchers in the sector makes it a good example of the extension of academia to
               industry, raising ethical but also methodological and practical questions. This
               article describes a project that embedded a research software engineer (RSE) from a
               digital humanities (DH) laboratory into a small technology start-up engaged in high
               risk R&amp;D of an immersive narrative story-telling platform. The platform is
               enabled by artificial intelligence and has the capacity to remember user input and
               modify narrative options and character mood accordingly. The team included a
               researcher specialising in narrative theory and digital production. The project
               demonstrated the utility of the critical application of DH methods and the need to
               develop career pipelines to produce people capable of working at the intersection of
               higher education and industry.</p>

            <head>Introduction</head>
            <p>New entertainment technologies are creating technical, intellectual, and HR
               challenges. The problems extend from issues of technology integration to enabling and
               critiquing hybrid forms of expression that defy categorisation, and finding employees
               with the skills needed to thrive in the industry. Products powered by artificial
               intelligence, natural language processing, and immersive technologies (AR, VR,
               chatbots, games, interactive story dramas, and affective systems) are technically
               complex to design and build, and require diverse teams including writers, designers,
               developers, artists, and project managers <ptr target="#mcduffandczerwinski2018"/>.
               New multimedia and transmedia design and engineering paradigms need to be found to
               foster innovation, and new career paths and skillsets are needed to enable creative
               production. Without solutions to these problems the United Kingdom’s £100bn
               investment in creative industries will stand little chance of success. To compete,
               small to medium enterprises (SME) are engaging in high-risk R&amp;D to find new ways
               to build talent and manage production. They need the support of research software
               engineering (RSE) and academic partners to ensure technical, creative, and
               intellectual quality. Digital humanities teams have an important part to play in this
               process. </p>
            <p>These issues have become a focus of the UK government’s research and funding policy,
               coupled to a wider industrial strategy designed to retain the country’s global
               competitiveness. The problem domain provides a classic example of Henry Etzkowitz and
               Loet Leydesdorff's <q>triple helix</q> of industry-government-university
               collaboration (<ptr target="#etzkowitzandleydesdorff1995"/>; <ptr
                  target="#Etzkowitzetal1998"/>) and an opportunity to explore the potential of
               applied methods in Digital Humanities (DH). This article describes one such
               experiment, demonstrating theories and methods that can facilitate the application of
               DH perspectives to the creative industries and (by extension) the skills and career
               pathways needed to produce people capable of delivering such work. </p>
            <p>Section I describes the project at the heart of the paper, <title rend="quotes"
                  >Applying AI to Storytelling — bringing computational research into the creative
                  industries</title> (Applying AI), a collaboration between a London technology
               start-up specialising in immersive narrative storytelling (<name>Charisma
                  Entertainment</name>), and researchers and engineers at King’s College London.
               Applying AI offers important insights into the challenges of producing non-linear and
               affective technological systems and narrative content that aspire to world-building
               and intensive human-computer interaction (HCI). Section II explains why this project
               is best understood theoretically in terms of applied or <quote rend="inline"
                  >interested methods</quote>
               <ptr target="#asdal2018"/>, and its relationship to global trends in academic
               research. Section III provides socio-technical, economic, and theoretical context for
               the experiment, to position it within the United Kingdom’s funding and policy
               environment and frame it with relevant scholarly literature. Section IV outlines
               potential new production pipelines capable of enabling the production of immersive
               products, and the need to develop people with blended creative and technical skills,
               and Section V describes the challenges of knowledge transfer and pedagogy in emergent
               convergent zones such as the UK’s creative economy. In taking this ambitiously
               holistic approach, bringing a broad conceptual apparatus to bear on the problem of
               immersive engineering in DH, we hope to open multiple avenues simultaneously and
               prompt conversations about future directions in research, engineering, pedagogy, and
               career development. </p>

            <head>Section I: Applying AI to Storytelling — bringing computational research into the
               creative industries</head>
            <p>The project <title rend="quotes">Applying AI to Storytelling — bringing computational
                  research into the creative industries</title> (Applying AI) brought together two
               streams of inquiry. The first was centred around embedding a DH RSE from King’s
               Digital Lab (KDL) within a creative industry SME (<name>Charisma
               Entertainment</name>), to function as a connection point between industry and
               academia. The aim was to facilitate traffic in ideas and methods between the creative
               industries, RSEs, and academics, and to overcome cultural and institutional barriers
               that inhibit collaboration. It also sought to develop career pathways and skills for
               RSEs to help them work effectively with industry through embedded co-creation,
               understanding the culture and working practices of a start-up and how they align with
               RSE practice. This work was led by James Smithies of KDL, with Elliott Hall as the
               KDL RSE who would embed with the SME. A workshop on RSE/Industry collaboration was
               held midway through the project, bringing together representatives from higher
               education, the creative industries, and related fields to disseminate the project’s
               work on collaboration and to generate feedback on how it could be taken forward in
               the future. </p>
            <p>The second stream of research was led by Sarah Atkinson and centred around evolving
               new working principles, practices, and workflows in the creation of interactive and
               immersive narratives and the development of the charisma.AI interactive media
               platform. This work package was the primary reason <name>Charisma
                  Entertainment</name> approached King’s College London for assistance. The
               optimisation and refinement of the machine learning algorithms that powered their
               charisma.AI platform was essential in creating compelling and rounded human
               characters and convincing character interactions between the AI and the audience, and
               (crucially) AI-character memory. This raised complex issues relating to the creative
               writing process. The work package involved an initial workshop for new media authors,
               writers, and narrative designers to adapt and adopt their established working
               practices for an AI environment where character memory was of profound importance.
                  <name>Charisma Entertainment</name> needed the narratives generated for
               charisma.AI to be subjected to critical examination in both literary and social
               science terms, identifying how conscious and unconscious bias informs the author’s
               conception of the character and the player’s responses to it. </p>
            <p>A second workshop involved audience and user testing, enabling feedback and responses
               to be provided to the creative team. The initial shape of the collaboration was
               designed for Hall to take on a facilitation role during production of the project’s
               showcase demo. He was to use his skills as a published novelist and RSE to enhance a
               collaboration between <name>Charisma Entertainment</name> and Parabolic Theatre, a
               performance theatre company known in London for their immersive show <title
                  rend="italic">For King and Country</title>. The aim was to adapt the show into a
               Unity-based game that would use charisma.AI for all character interactions. <title
                  rend="italic">For King and Country</title> was chosen as a demo because it would
               stretch the capabilities of the charisma.AI platform. An example of a relatively new
               genre of theatre, associated with a broader trend towards immersive experiences <ptr
                  target="#atkinsonandkennedy2018"/>, the show has proven to be a popular experience
               in London. Its narrative is compelling: Germany is winning World War Two and about to
               invade the UK. The audience meets in a rump parliament, then splits off to work in
               the various ministries before coming back to parliament to hear the results of their
               work: has the UK been defeated, or has their work repulsed the invasion? The aim was
               to create a game demo that would replace the actors and facilitators with AI
               characters, and for audiences to interact as avatars in the game. The characters
               would interact with the audiences through text-based conversation and (of fundamental
               importance) remember and sometimes misremember what they had said. The AI characters
               had been programmed so that they could also lie and remember when they were lied to. </p>

            <p>In many ways, charisma.AI is the latest iteration of a long-standing tradition in
               electronic and interactive literature, which spanned chatbots such as Eliza (1964 -
               1966), early iconic text-based games known as Multi-User Dungeons (MUDS), and
               hypertext fiction that once held great promise for the development of new modes of
               narrative experience. Such products were related to the well-known <title

                  <quote rend="block">a short circuit between signifier and signified, a suspension

                     beyond the text, a primary metaphysical structure that generates both textual

               </cit> The belief was that new technologies were radically transforming the
               experience of reading from a passive to an (inter)active experience. 1990s critics
               noted similarities between ergodic literature and elements of postmodern fiction such
               as Barthes labyrinth, itself reaching back to Greek myth <ptr target="#aarseth1997"
               />. </p>
            <p>As Dave Ciccoricco has pointed out, these kinds of narrative in fact implement a
               range of different <quote rend="inline">networked</quote> narratives, from simple
               branching to more complex tree-like structures <ptr target="#ciccoricco2007"/>. The
               genre has never quite broken through into widespread mainstream acceptance, but there
               has been a steady stream of innovation over the years and recent technological
               developments have prompted creative renewal. In 2005 the video game Façade
               illustrated the potential of generative AI narratives. In 2018 Netflix produced the
               interactive branching narrative show <title rend="italic">Bandersnatch</title> (to
               mixed reviews) and the same year the live streamed show <title rend="italic"
                  >Artificial</title> was released by Twitch, winning an Emmy for Innovation in
               Interactive Media. <title rend="italic">Artificial</title> enabled direct interaction
               with the audience, including votes to fundamentally alter the plot and even remove
               characters, suggesting something of the potential of the new generation of
               technology. <name>Charisma Entertainment</name> are contributing to this same history
               of creative and technological development with charisma.AI, hoping for simultaneous
               breakthroughs in technological and creative development.</p>
            <p>High quality academic critique is essential to this process. Interest in ludology
               (the study of games not only as cultural artefacts but as expressions of human
               identity and phenomenological experience) based on Johan Huizinga’s 1938 book <title
                  rend="italic">Homo Ludens</title>
               <ptr target="#huizinga1938"/> ground criticism of early multimedia products in a
               philosophically serious tradition and suggested that multimedia and transmedia
               products resist <quote rend="inline">narrowly instrumental analysis</quote> and are
               properly conceived as both a foundational human experience and art <ptr
                  target="#rodriguez2006"/>, but criticism of electronic literature waned when
               narrative quality failed to attain the expected heights. The ideas that had been
               generated were enough to feed new modes of critical interpretation that remain
               relevant, however, including Donna Haraway’s articulation of a <quote rend="inline"
                  >cyborg manifesto</quote>
               <ptr target="#haraway1991"/> and Katherine Hayles’ notion of <quote rend="inline"
                  >intermediation</quote> that suggests an electronic text <quote rend="inline"
                  >performs actions that bind together author and program, player and computer, into
                  a complex system characterized by intermediating dynamics</quote>
               <ptr target="#hayles2008"/>. The wider tradition can be usefully read through these
               critical lenses, and beyond to articulations of <quote rend="inline"
                  >imagineering</quote> and immersion <ptr target="#demetriou2018"/>, and
               transhumanist <ptr target="#chu2014"/> philosophies that emphasise the blending of
               human and machine. There is widespread acceptance that adding aesthetic experience to
               human-computer interaction heightens phenomenological entanglement.</p>
            <p>The team at <name>Charisma Entertainment</name> were aware of the creative and
               critical tradition their charisma.AI platform was part of but they were primarily
               responding to the narrative potential inherent in emerging technologies. In the case
               of charisma.AI that related to character memory, and the ability of AI characters to
                  <q>remember</q> and <q>misremember</q> information (such as a player’s name, but
               also narrative decisions and other aspects of gameplay) relayed to them by players.
               The charisma.AI system has been developed to connect with external services such as
               weather reports, via Application Programming Interfaces (API), and alter the gameplay
               accordingly (for example, mirroring the weather outside the player’s physical house
               in the virtual environment). </p>
            <p>The <title rend="italic">For King and Country</title> demo included additional
               challenging requirements, requiring the team to create several different kinds of
               character-to-audience conversations: one-on-one between players, ministers, and other
               heads of state (for example the American President); a version of a parliamentary
               debate where the player was part of conversations with several AI characters, and
               would need to influence them to vote in their favour; and multi-character,
               free-flowing conversational exchanges which would be very different to the one-on-one
               conversations from other charisma.AI projects. In one key speech, the player, acting
               as Prime Minister, tries to sway the AI characters to their point of view, creating a
               range of technical and creative challenges: in one scenario, for example, AI
               characters do not respond to the player’s speech if they have not interacted with
               them or have had negative interactions with them during the preceding narrative. It
               is worth noting that before the project started, charisma.AI’s natural language
               processing (NLP) could only parse short, declarative sentences, not the multiple
               sequential sentences that would be required for a convincing and compelling speech. </p>
            <p>The creative implications of this narrative complexity were commented upon by writers
               attending the writer’s workshop at the start of the project. The group had a wide
               range of experience writing for the television and gaming industries (working on high
               profile productions including the BBC’s <title rend="italic">Sherlock</title> series)
               but were struck by the cascading complexity that accrues from the ability of
               AI-enabled characters to remember and – more problematically – to strategically
               misremember information. To simplify the problem, the workshop participants thought
               through the implications of a character in a basic whodunnit narrative being able to
               remember or misremember player information. When should the writer save a piece of
               information, and when should they release it (at a dinner party with everyone
               present, in a private exchange between two characters)? How would they write a
               narrative that included one thread where a character faithfully remembered a piece of
               information, but in other contexts duplicitously misremembered it? How could writers
               control the exponential layers of complexity generated by such scenarios, and how
               could a writing interface be designed to ensure writers could keep track of the
               various narrative permutations? The narrative complexity that could be facilitated by
               charisma.AI is significantly increased by the ability of the writers to define and
               assign moods to characters, which can act as additional narrative gateways to new
               scenarios: say the wrong thing or ignore an important character, and they could
               choose to misremember rather than remember information conveyed at an earlier stage
               in the narrative. </p>
            <p>Revealingly, given the analysis about skills requirements that we will detail below,
               Hall’s role changed significantly as the project progressed. The lead writer for
               Parabolic Theatre was unable to contribute to the project as intended due to
               scheduling conflicts. Hall took over primary writing duties for the <title
                  rend="italic">For King and Country</title> demo, as well as designing new logical
               structures inside charisma.AI to adapt its workflow for use as a plugin inside Unity,
               while working with the <name>Charisma Entertainment</name> team on the demo’s game
               flow. He continued in these roles when the project’s focus moved to a new demo, an
               adaptation of John Wyndham’s <title rend="italic">The Kraken Wakes</title>. This
               evolving collaboration led to several meaningful outcomes: two functional showcase
               demos - <title rend="italic">For King and Country</title>, and <title rend="italic"
                  >The Kraken Wakes</title> - were written by Hall. The deeper collaboration on the
               two demos created a test case for how a DH research software engineer (RSE) could be
               embedded within a commercial development team, providing both technical and creative
               input. The changing priorities and roles during the project provided an important
               test of institutional flexibility and a model for effective collaboration between
               higher education and the creative industries.</p>

            <head>Section II: Pure versus Applied Research</head>
            <p>Applying AI therefore raises interesting questions about the nature of applied DH
               research. The project was initiated in conversations between <name>Charisma
                  Entertainment</name> and King’s College London but was oriented towards answering
               problems for the industry partner, rather than research questions developed
               independently in the university. This is, of course, the essence of <q>applied</q>
               research in the formal Science and Technology Studies (STS) sense of the term:
               industry partners (whether in the creative industries or other industrial sectors)
               seek out research teams who can help them navigate an impasse in their R&amp;D or
               product development process, and research questions are designed with the sole
               purpose of resolving that impasse. Research is <q>applied</q> to <q>real world</q>
               problems, to develop new products or services for the marketplace. The fact
                  <name>Charisma Entertainment</name> operates in the creative marketplace is
               incidental to this more reductive point. In this telling, applied research is opposed
               to <q>pure</q> research, which originates in the laboratories and offices of
               researchers free from outside influence. Pure (or <q>basic</q> or <q>fundamental</q>)
               research aims to build theories or produce knowledge but often has no practical or
               clinical application: it represents research in the sense implied by the Oxford
               English Dictionary’s quotation of E. Grimeston tr. J. de Acosta in 1604: <quote
                  rend="block">Whether these two great gulphes do ioyne in any other part of the
                  world, which was the enterprize of Fernando Magellan a Portugall gentleman, whose
                  great courage and constancie in the research of this subject, and happy successe
                  in the finding thereof, gave the name of etenall memory to this straight (O.E.D.
                  Online).</quote> Pure research is designed to fill in empty space on the map of
               knowledge, not to resolve practical problems. In this definition of the term, digital
               humanists do not engage in nearly as much <q>applied</q> research as they might
               think. Technical effort generally aims to fill gaps in the map of knowledge, not to
               build new products and services or solve problems encountered in the corporate or
               government worlds. </p>
            <p>And yet, as many readers will have surmised, the distinction established in STS
               between pure and applied research is anything but straight-forward. Indeed, as Zoe
               Nyssa <ptr target="#nyssa2019b"/> has pointed out, STS scholars have built a
               discipline out of exploring and ultimately collapsing the distinction, variously
               noting the rather fine semantic distinction between knowledge sought to <said>fill in
                  blank spaces on the map</said> and knowledge sought to increase our ability to
               manipulate or intervene in the known world: the cultural and politically mediated
                  <ptr target="#knorrcetina1981"/> aspects of both modes of research, the inherently
               messy <quote rend="inline">mangle</quote>
               <ptr target="#pickering1995"/> of researchers, tools and methods, or the way in which
               objects and humans involved in the research process can be conceived (famously, by
               Bruno Latour) as mere actants <ptr target="#latourandwoolgar1979"/> in a continuous
               process. Simplistic binary conceptions of applied versus pure research collapse under
               even limited scrutiny: in theoretical terms, and as a way of understanding the
               research endeavour in all its complexity, it provides the flimsiest of foundations.
               The fact the OED entry does not make a distinction between the two modes is telling. </p>
            <p>And yet the distinction retains utility in the context of the DH work described in
               this article. While it is undoubtedly necessary to collapse the pure versus applied
               distinction when exploring the epistemological and methodological depths of
               laboratory science and DH projects designed to advance knowledge, it remains
               conceptually useful in the context of projects designed to enable commercial sector
               partners. Perhaps controversially, the distinction also sheds light on the
               relationship between DH, neo-liberalism, and the corporate university, highlighting a
               nascent area of DH practice that is presumably even more controversial than the
               production of historical databases or use of machine learning algorithms <ptr
                  target="#allingtonetal2016"/>: if the use of digital tools by humanists in the
               service of general humanities scholarship is controversial, their use in the service
               of commercial profit must surely be doubly so. </p>
            <p>It is important to note in this context that, rather than being merely arguably
               connected to the corporate university, applied DH (in the strict sense of applied
               research intended by STS scholars) reflects hard commercial relationships between
               universities and the commercial sector initiated by the United States Bayh-Dole Act
               (1980). Bayh-Dole has been identified as a watershed moment by historians of higher
               education, changing the social and economic contract between universities and funding
               agencies and allowing them to pursue intellectual ownership of an invention
               themselves instead of needing to assign it to the federal government. This opened the
               research environment to market conditions, incentivising universities to define and
               protect their intellectual property (IP) and monetise it through the development of
               commercial ventures. Other governments (notably the United Kingdom, Australia, and
               New Zealand) watched with interest and, over time, increasingly oriented their
               policies to commercial concerns too. In simple terms, the Act was the legal
               instrument in America (and the model in many other countries) by which <quote
                  rend="inline">highly contentious</quote>
               <ptr target="#murray2010"/> forms of neoliberalism were unleashed on the university
               sector. As Allington et al notoriously implied in 2016 DH, whether the community is
               comfortable with it or not, it is imbricated in this wider context <ptr
                  target="#allingtonetal2016"/>. </p>
         </div>
         <div>
            <head>Section III: The Creative Economy</head>
            <p>The Applying AI to Storytelling project occupied the intersection of these currents,
               as much as being a straight-forward DH project. Significant amounts of funding have
               been directed towards Etzkowitz and Leydesdorff’s <quote rend="inline">triple
                  helix</quote> in the United Kingdom, characteristic of a <quote rend="inline">new
                  social contract between the university and larger society</quote>
               <ptr target="#etzkowitzandleydesdorff1995"/> and based on intensive knowledge
               transfer and co-production across the full spectrum of research, development, and
               production. Noting progressive changes in the orientation of universities to the
               private sector since the 1980s, Etzkowitz and Leydesdorff’s 1995 paper claimed that
               university-industry relations had <quote rend="inline">become a laboratory for the
                  conscious reshaping of…knowledge infrastructure</quote>
               <ptr target="#etzkowitzandleydesdorff1995"/> in a manner that was transforming <quote
                  rend="inline">the role of the state in academia, the role of corporations in
                  innovation and of the university in the economy…</quote>
               <ptr target="#etzkowitzandleydesdorff1995"/>. In the United Kingdom, research
               activities (often conceived as <q>applied</q> research) that encourage collaboration
               between academia, industry, and government reflect this larger international
               reorientation of knowledge production towards instrumentalist concerns. </p>
            <p> And yet, the Applying AI project demonstrates why this activity is justifiable in
               academic and creative as well as purely commercial terms. As is shown below, the
               success of the project hinged on the proper functioning of an interdisciplinary team
               involving technical developers, businesspeople, academics, and creative writers. The
               contribution of the RSE developer and creative writer were particularly essential;
               their lack of progress or unavailability was enough to halt the entire production
               process. It is not so much that Etzkowitz and Leydesdorff’s triple helix pulls
               otherwise purely creative writers and academics into the commercial world, in other
               words, as it creates a new set of creative challenges that require inter-disciplinary
               approaches to resolve. Projects such as Applying AI allow those new approaches to be
               trialled, for the benefit of commercial and research partners alike, creating
               significant creative and intellectual insights as well as new career paths. It is
               unreasonable to assume that cross-sector co-creation unwittingly acts as a Trojan
               horse for capture and the warping of HE priorities.</p>
            <p>This has unfortunately become a natural assumption in some areas of humanities and DH
               scholarship. It is difficult to be sure of the precise intellectual genealogy, but it
               appears to be built on methodological positions established in STS by scholars such
               as Knorr-Cetina, who view <quote rend="inline">knowledge as practices - within
                  structures, processes, and environments that make up specific epistemic
                  settings</quote>
               <ptr target="#knorrcetina1999"/>. This created an excellent framework for holistic
               analysis of scientific and technological initiatives but negative perceptions of
               applied research built on such work too, culminating in the work of Sheila Slaughter
               who coined the term <term>academic capitalism</term> and suggested it exposes the
                  <quote rend="inline">neoliberal tendenc[y] to treat higher education policy as a
                  subset of economic policy</quote>
               <ptr target="#slaughterandleslie2001"/>. Another strain of literature built directly
               on Etzkowitz and Leydesdorff’s 1995 paper, criticising its emphasis on linear modes
               of knowledge transfer that assumes the progressive evolution of concepts from R&amp;D
               to production without an allowance for iterative cycles, co-production, and failure.
               Many humanists find it difficult to see the possibility of creativity or intellectual
               freedom in such models. </p>
            <p>The conversation is becoming increasingly nuanced, however. Carayannis and Campbell’s
               Mode 3 Innovation Ecosystem emphasizes more fluid interaction between participants,
               and what the authors refer to as <quote rend="inline">a multi-layered, multi-modal,
                  multi-nodal and multi-lateral system, encompassing mutually complementary and

               abundantly clear that policy changes at national level and economic pressures at a
               global level since World War Two have resulted in fundamental changes to the
               operational context of academic research, creating opportunities for new modes of
               creative production and collaboration. </p>
            <p>In the United Kingdom this crystalized in 1997 in the policies of the New Labour
               government led by Prime Minister Tony Blair, which established a Creative Industries
               Task Force (CITF) within its newly established Department of Culture, Media, and
               Sport (DCMS). This taskforce, and the resulting Creative Industries Mapping Document
               (CIMD), has been widely credited with establishing the modern notion of the
                  <q>creative industries</q> in the UK and positioning it at the forefront of
               national and international efforts to extract economic value from cultural activity.
               As Terry Flew notes, the CIMD defined the creative industries as <quote rend="inline"
                  >those activities which have their origin in individual creativity, skill and
                  talent and which have the potential for wealth and job creation through the
                  generation and exploitation of intellectual property</quote>
               <ptr target="#flew2012"/>. New Labour subsequently positioned the creative industries
               at the heart of national identity, using the <quote rend="inline">then-new concept of
                  convergence to argue that the future of arts and media in Britain lay in a
                  transformation of dominant policy discourses towards a productive engagement with
                  digital technologies, to develop new possibilities for the alignment of British
                  creativity and intellectual capital with these new engines of economic
                  growth</quote>
               <ptr target="#flew2012"/>.</p>
            <p>Applying AI to Storytelling provides an excellent example of this new model of
               government/creative industry interaction, contributing to policy changes designed to
               enable economic and cultural <q>clusters</q> the government identified as key drivers
               of Carayannis and Campbell’s fractal innovation ecosystem. In a 2009 article the
               authors identified three different kinds of clusters of <quote rend="inline"
                  >fractally connected</quote> organizations dependent upon rich cross-sector
               interactions and complex transfer and production of R&amp;D activity: geographic,
               sectoral, and knowledge clusters <ptr target="#carayannisandcampbell2009"/>. These
               clusters - often overlapping and almost always interacting in complex
               cross-functional configurations - include a <quote rend="inline">pluralism of a
                  diversity of agents, actors and organisations: universities, small and
                  medium-sized enterprises and major corporations, arranged along the matrix of
                  fluid and heterogeneous innovation networks</quote>
               <ptr target="#carayannisandcampbell2009"/>. They function as what military analysts
               might term force multipliers, aggregating diverse economic and methodological
               capabilities in either real-world or virtual configurations and creating the
               conditions for exponential levels of creative and technical innovation and economic
               growth. </p>
            <p>The concept of clusters clearly resonated with UK policy makers, who are eager to

               country <ptr target="#hmgovernment2018b"/>. In a clear signal that the country
               acknowledges the synergistic relationship between scholarly analysis and economic
               production, an associated Policy and Evidence Centre was funded to work out how to
               best measure and enable future initiatives. A further £33m was allocated to an
               Audiences of the Future programme designed to enable cross-sector R&amp;D resulting
               in virtual and augmented reality (XR) products <ptr target="#ukri2018"/>. </p>
            <p>The Applying AI project was funded by a related Innovate UK scheme, similarly aimed
               at enhancing knowledge and skills transfer between elements of the triple helix <ptr
                  target="#innovateuk2018"/>. The Creative Clusters and Innovate UK programmes
               amount to an overt attempt to extend the United Kingdom’s competitive advantage in
               the creative industries, in support of a plethora of flagship institutions such as
               the BBC, the Victoria and Albert Museum, the British Museum, the Tate Modern, the
               Royal Opera House and in the context of emerging technologies that at once threaten
               and promise to transform their potential and scope. Revealingly, Carayannis and
               Campbell’s Mode 3 model extends the innovation environment from these traditional
               organisations to myriad small, medium, and large technology start-ups alongside
               established vendors, freelance designers, and gaming studios. The complexity is
               overwhelming but forecast disruption caused by emerging technologies and a related
               skills shortage has prompted remarkably directed action <ptr target="#innovateuk2018"

            <head>Section IV: Production Models for Immersive Engineering</head>
            <p>Any robust analysis of Applying AI needs to take this policy context into account.
               The primary aim of the project was to enable the commercial goals of <name>Charisma
                  Entertainment</name>, who were grappling with issues endemic to the creative
               industries, beset by increasingly complex design and engineering problems at the
               intersection of art and technology. Hall’s work with the charisma.AI platform
               reflects this challenge: his work took on recursive characteristics as he moved
               between the role of writer, developer, and product consultant. Working with an
               evolving technical product, he realised its support for branching narratives would
               not be able to support the complex plot and character developments required for
                  <title rend="italic">For King and Country</title>. Using computational logic and
               working closely with the core development and creative teams at <name>Charisma
                  Entertainment</name>, he surmised that the interface could be stretched to
               accommodate a more complex hub and spokes plot configuration. This made management of
               the various story nodes difficult, so he hacked together a basic external technical
               solution (something that could later be integrated into the main product) to keep
               track of the narrative. </p>
            <p>High quality production models for immersive engineering need to account for this
               symbiotic relationship between creative artists and technologies, enabling creative
               collaborations between artists and machines <ptr target="#sandry2017"/>. A 2018 UK
               report into production pipelines for immersive engineering noted companies were
               experiencing difficulties across the entire spectrum, from budgeting to managing
               small teams, consumer expectations, design, dynamic workflows, inadequate and fast
               evolving toolsets, and a lack of people with appropriate skills and experience <ptr
                  target="#opposablegroupandtechspark2018"/>. Stuart Whyte, Director of VR product
               development at Sony’s SIE London Studio, framed the issue in stark terms, noting that
                  <quote rend="block">[i]t’s so new. I think in traditional games we’ve taken many
                  generations and iterations of designs, around control schemes, and so on. The
                  challenge and excitement around VR is that it is a very new space and some of
                  those designs and languages from other games just don’t work so well in this
                  medium and yet there are alternate ways you can do it that are even better (Whyte
                  cited in <ptr target="#opposablegroupandtechspark2018"/>).</quote>
               <name>Charisma Entertainment</name> experienced much the same pressures as other
               start-ups building products for the creative industries during the Applying AI
               project (tight budget, small team, competing demands) and their production pipeline
               was similarly challenged. Hard choices had to be made between additional R&amp;D or
               creative effort and technical investment, and the ultimate decision to transition
               from production of the <title rend="italic">For King and Country</title> demo to
                  <title rend="italic">The Kraken Wakes</title> required resolution of complex
               business, technical, and creative issues. </p>
            <p>At a more granular level, tension between creative and technical expression in
               Applying AI was generated from the characters in the charisma.AI system being
                  <q>audience aware</q>. This means that they could: react to the language, mood and
               conversations of the players; <q>remember</q> previous interactions with a player;
               access a knowledge base of that character’s interactions with other players; and use
               this data to provide responses tailored to the user (implicitly in the way a chatbot
               learns from interactions, and explicitly, in directly challenging users with their
               shared history e.g., <quote rend="inline">yesterday you said this.</quote>). While it
               might seem premature to read phenomenological significance into such interactions,
               even with the critical apparatus provided by critics such as Aarseth <ptr
                  target="#aarseth1997"/> and those that followed him, it is worth noting the deep
               ramifications of memory for our understanding of not only human experience, but the
               nature of intelligence and artificial intelligence (AI). As Gisela Bahr et al note,
                  <quote rend="inline">[h]uman long-term memory is [merely] an example of naturally
                  occurring big data</quote>
               <ptr target="#bahretal2017"/>. As rudimentary as contemporary chatbot and AI
               technology currently may be, and as minuscule as contemporary computing storage is
               next to the exabyte capacity of the human brain, the underlying mechanisms at work -
               especially in use cases as fundamental to experience and identity as narrative -
               provide valuable insights into the boundaries between human and machine intelligence.
               The study of memory and forgetting, and its implications for next-generation
               computing systems that struggle to manage the vast quantities of data being funnelled
               into them, is just one example of the strangely synergistic tensions emerging between
               the creative industries and industry proper. Production models for immersive
               engineering are likely to offer practical applications in a range of industrial
               settings.</p>

         <div>
            <head>Section V: Knowledge Transfer and Talent Pipelines</head>
            <p>Production pipeline issues were not satisfactorily resolved by the Applying AI
               project, although that was a key focus of the grant application. Progress was made
               identifying issues, and acknowledging the complexity of issues in play, but the
               problem is a generational one. Hall’s hybrid role as technical consultant and writer
               greatly increased the technical and creative capacity of the charisma.AI platform but
               was unsatisfactory as a long-term solution. Demand for hybrid talent is strong enough
               that Hall became unavailable for future phases of the project, and the Applying AI
               project made no provision for passing his skills on to another RSE. That issue was,
               of course, intractable in the short time available for the project. Hall’s skills
               have been developed over the course of more than a decade working as an RSE in
               digital humanities and creative writing. </p>
            <p>Developing workers with Hall's blend of technical and creative skill is something
               that would ideally begin at primary and secondary school and be laced throughout
               university experience as well. It may be that practical masters, doctoral and
               post-doctoral fellowships will help in the interim, perhaps augmented by more
               vocationally focused apprenticeships and on the job mentoring, but they will need to
               be extremely flexible in their capacity to foster people with diverse talents
               expressed with different emphasises on different areas. Hall’s balance between
               technical and creative knowledge was useful but in many cases an inflection towards
               one or the other would be optimal. It is unusual to find someone with equal parts
               creative and technical talent, and more feasible to provide people with the skills
               they need to contribute to multi-disciplinary teams. Similarly, it will often be
               useful to involve people with theoretical academic knowledge as well: perhaps
               possessing barely enough technical knowledge to work closely with engineering teams
               but deep understanding of the creative and theoretical aspects to a problem. </p>
            <p>An emphasis on teamwork skills, and confidence working across disciplinary boundaries
               will resolve many issues — accepting the need for hybrid teams as well as people with
               rare hybrid skills — but this will not resolve the deeper issues of narrative and
               aesthetic quality demanded by next-generation creative products. At some point the
               education system will need to adapt to the challenging requirements imposed by the
               creative industries and develop graduates with myriad indefinable mixtures of talent,
               fusing computational and creative skills along tailored learning pathways. The
               transfer of knowledge between university research teams and the creative industries
               is in this sense merely the first act in a wider process of a humanistic re-tooling
               of (a growing part of) the engineering profession. The development of robust talent
               pipelines from the education system into the creative industries should be the
               medium-term goal. </p>
            <p>Applying AI to Storytelling was an ambitious and complicated interdisciplinary
               project undertaken in the context of a complex intellectual, creative, technical, and
               policy development landscape. The United Kingdom’s cognizance of the difficulties
               (and potential economic benefit) in the development of next-generation immersive
               products, and their proactive funding of applied research activity between academic
               and commercial partners, made it possible to engage in the relatively high-risk
               R&amp;D necessary to make progress but significantly more work is needed. A
               full-spectrum approach is needed to understand the implications of immersive product
               development in applied and theoretical terms. The goal must be to enable development
               of more sophisticated products (dare we hope, on a par with the centuries of
               tradition inherited by the creative industries), enabled by interdisciplinary
               academic enquiry, improved design and engineering processes, more effective
               pedagogical approaches, and enhanced career pipelines. The humanities, and DH in
               particular, are well positioned to contribute to this process but experimentation
               will need to occur across many concurrent areas of activity, and we will — in order
               to work at the cutting edge of creative endeavour and have a voice in the development
               of next-generation creative products — need to reconcile ourselves to contributing to
               commercially driven endeavours. </p>
