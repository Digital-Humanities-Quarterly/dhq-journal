        <dhq:abstract>
          <p>Current theories about the significance of annotations in literary
            studies are based primarily on assumptions developed in print
            culture about verbal texts. In these textual theories, the text is
            typically present, authorized, and centralized as the ideal text
            for an ideal reader, and to annotate is to add authorized comments
            in a sociotechnical system that includes publication, dissemination,
            and reception. To audiate is to imagine a song that's not playing.
            In music learning theory, audiation is based on the concept that
            the musician learns to play music by developing their own musical
            aptitude, her individual interpretation of a musical score based
            on her particular experience of the music. This short article
            introduces audiation as an alternate theoretical framing for
            articulating the significance of personal literary annotations.
            Comparing commentary on psalms in the Middle Ages to IIIF
            (International Image Interoperability Framework) web annotations,
            we use the concept of audiation to situate annotations within
            literary study in terms of a more capacious understanding of the
            individual's interpretation of text and of the reading experience
            as part of an unauthorized, distributed, and decentralized system.
            By bringing together theories and technologies of annotation with
            sound, we offer the concept of audiated annotations as a means to
            re-evaluate modes of access, discovery, and analysis of cultural
            objects in digital sound studies.</p>

        <div><head>Annotations in Textual Theory (paratext, marginalia, metadata)</head>
        <p>Scholars have long theorized annotation in the creation and analysis
        of literature as <emph>paratext</emph>, <emph>marginalia</emph>, and
        <emph>mark-up</emph>
        <ptr target="#audenaert2010"/>
        <ptr target="#bernstein1998"/>
        <ptr target="#bernstein2011"/>
        <ptr target="#bradley2007"/>
        <ptr target="#bray2000"/>
        <ptr target="#hillesund2010"/>
        <ptr target="#jackson2001"/>.
        Paratext includes peritext, such as those materials in the interstices of
        the book, such as chapter titles or notes, and epitext. Epitexts are other
        texts outside of the central text that influence the ideal or typical reader's
        interpretation, such as "interviews, conversations, and confidences" (Genette
        10). Revealing the political and social perspectives about the "ideal" reader
        that such contexts engage, Genette includes "contextual paratexts" in this
        category that include politicized information about the author, such as
        "Proust's part-Jewish ancestry and his homosexuality" (8). Not surprisingly
        then, paratext is authorized by the author or by his (in this case) social
        demographics or discourse community: it "is always the conveyor of a commentary
        that is authorial or more or less legitimated by the author", Gennette writes
        (2). Indeed, "by definition, something is not a paratext unless the author or
        one of his associates accepts responsibility for it" (9). Authorized by the
        surrounding discourse community, paratext is also authorized by the text itself
        through its physical association. Paratext is "situated in relation to the
        location of the text itself: around the text and either within the same volume
        or at a more respectful (or more prudent) distance" (4). Genette's concept of
        paratext essentializes authorial intention and the immediacy of the textual
        object.</p>
        <p>Marginalia in literary study is also interpreted based on its proximity
        to the text as well as the extent to which it is authorial or authorized.
        H.J. Jackson argues that marginalia of significance includes notes inside of
        books, not outside of books, citing "significant differences between notes
        made on separate sheets of paper or in a notebook and notes made in the book
        that becomes part of the book and accompany it ever after"
        <ptr target="#jackson2001" loc="14"/>.
        Beyond its locative status, marginalia is more or less important if the person
        creating the notes is "authorial." According to Jackson, notes by the authors
        themselves are the most significant, then marginalia by other authors, of equal
        or greater literary importance, and finally, granted the least status, are
        general readers' notes: "Our own notes we like, or have learned to live with,"
        Jackson writes, "those we resist are always written by somebody else" (235).
        Marginalia plays a minor role in textual theory by reflecting an association
        with other authors in reception theory and in a history of reading or as
        biography when the author corrects writing about themselves (243), but Jackson
        generally argues that marginalia has not been considered significant enough to
        study because marginalia is generally non-authorial and often ephemeral, not
        physically attached to the authorized text.</p>
        <p>Metadata, or data about data, are also significant forms of annotation in
        recent literary study, deemed less and more important based on their authority
        and textual proximity. In the digital realm, activities such as searching and
        retrieving texts in library systems, sharing scholarly or pedagogical work
        with students and researchers, and using artificial intelligence and machine
        learning to discover patterns are activities that share a common reliance
        on metadata. Much like paratext in the publishing industry, metadata has
        more official functions in libraries (for access) and archives (for context)
        <ptr target="#gilliland2008" loc="2–3"/>.
        In both cases, metadata is information that is lacking
        in the "information object" within a sociotechnical system. In the library
        setting, metadata might include the author name or genre information, which is
        gathered in order to facilitate finding that object. In an archive, metadata
        might include a previous researcher's notes, which can provide important
        contextual clues for future researchers. In general, Gilliland notes that
        "[i]n all these diverse interpretations, metadata not only identifies and
        describes an information object; it also documents how that object behaves,
        its function and use, its relationship to other information objects, and how
        it should be and has been managed over time" <ptr target="#gilliland2008" loc="7"/>.
        Consequently, metadata's
        function is entangled with making an "information object" system-aware,
        whether that system is a human-readable metadata standard or a technological
        process. In contrast, unauthorized, "user-generated" metadata such as
        community-generated "folksonomies," while a nice record of general user's
        experience, are system-adverse since such metadata often do not fit with the
        established socio-technical system at hand. Indeed, such out-of-system metadata
        is "idiosyncratic" and, therefore, "untrustworthy", Gilliland argues, because
        it can "negatively affect interoperability between metadata and the resources
        it is intended to describe" <ptr target="#gilliland2008" loc="8–9"/>.
        Like paratextual and marginal annotations,
        metadata has been considered meaningful in literary study when they are
        authorized and in proximity to the text. <note>One exception is the history
        of conversations in the Text Encoding Initiative (TEI) surrounding
        stand-off markup. See <ptr target="#spadini2019"/>, and
        <ptr target="#tei2003"/>.</note></p>
        <p>In each of these examples (paratext, marginalia, and metadata), the
        sociotechnical systems in which annotations circulate represent discourse
        fields where authority is crucial to the significance or signifying
        capacity. Yet, there are other, under-theorized examples in literary
        study in which annotations reflect the individual, unauthorized reader's
        interpretation of an absent text, and the reading experience is part of
        an unauthorized, distributed, and decentralized system. Below, we discuss
        two seemingly disparate examples of such annotations across time, in the
        context of medieval psalm commentary and open web IIIF (International Image
        Interoperability Framework) standards for annotations. We are calling these
        <emph>audiated</emph> annotations to emphasize the three principles these
        kinds of unauthorized and extra-textual annotations share: namely, what we
        are calling audiated annotations are often (1) self-described and independent,
        removed from the object of comment itself and reflecting a textual condition
        <ptr target="#mcgann1991"/> in which (2) annotations are understood as compound objects that
        are (3) embedded in a particular, user-generated reading experience rather than
        an authorized, ideal reading experience.</p>
        </div>
        <div><head>Annotations in Medieval Literary Culture</head>
        <p>In pre-print, medieval literary culture, annotations still took place next
        to full texts, but commentary forms were not reliant on the centrality of an
        ideal text. In the medieval tradition, orality and aurality were central to
        literacy, and psalm commentaries circulated in an unauthorized, distributed,
        and decentralized community of texts, readers, orators, and listeners. For
        Benedictine monks, in particular, Psalms were a major part of medieval monastic
        life, and weekly recitation of the psalms was recommended. Like later proteges
        learning to audiate using Edwin Gordon's theories of musical education
        <ptr target="#gordon2007"/>,
        an ability to memorize the psalms was seen as an early indication of intellect
        among monks in training <ptr target="#dyer1989"/>.
        Psalms were not simply recited like other
        prayers and readings; psalms were nearly always sung. As a natural consequence
        of years of daily recitation, monks were expected to have the verse and tune of
        all 150 psalms memorized.</p>
        <p>Consequently, the practice of audiation, of using inner-hearing to imagine
        what a song sounds like, was key to medieval psalm-singing. In medieval
        devotional practice, there is a concept of "the inner senses" which operate
        separately from, but are related to, the physical senses of sight and sound,
        an inner sense of sight at the origin of the phrase "the mind's eye." Beth
        Williamson discusses the way the physical sense of sight and the inner sense
        of hearing work together in medieval music, especially psalm-singing (2013).
        Psalms often have two sections between which is a pause, represented on the
        page as a space and musically as a breath. Williamson says this pause is not an
        absence, but a shift in the site of meaning:</p>
        <cit>
          <quote rend="block">[A]t such a point, the music may not be sounding, but it has not stopped.
        The singers are aware, within their own interiority, of its continuation, and
        though they do not hear in their physical ears they hear it still inwardly. In
        this moment of silence, music does not disappear, but functions temporarily — and
        temporally — on a different level. <ptr target="#williamson2013" loc="31"/></quote>
        </cit>
        <p>What Williamson describes is similar to Gordon's descriptions of audiation — 
        the presence of meaning (the concept and construct of music) in the absence
        of sound. While Williamson regards that state of inner hearing as temporary in
        the moment of performance, the implication is that the singers, like Gordon's
        students, hear the psalms when reading the text.</p>
        <p>Annotations were common in the psalm commentary tradition. The psalter
        was the most commented upon book of the Middle Ages, and all monks would have
        had access to at least some kind of commentary in their library (Dyer 1989).
        There are several ways these commentaries are presented on the page. The
        most standard presentation of medieval commentary is the way the <emph>Glossa
        ordinaria</emph> (the standard biblical commentary) is usually written:
        the main text is in one column in a large script, with commentary in the
        surrounding margins in a smaller script. Privileging the main text, this layout
        looks much like texts today. Because the practice of audiation was a common
        mode of interacting with the psalms, other commentary forms perform audiatated
        annotations.</p>
        <p>The popular psalm commentary of Gilbert of Poitiers, for example, privileges
        the commentary over the primary text. The Gilbert Psalter comes in two layouts:
        <emph>cum textu</emph> ("with the text") and <emph>catena</emph> ("chain"). In
        the <emph>cum textu</emph> format, the page is divided into two columns: the
        inner column (near the spine) for the main psalm text, and the outer for the
        commentary. In this format, the relative width of the columns is adjusted, and
        the main text is sometimes abbreviated to ensure the main text and relevant
        section of commentary stay in sync (Salomon 2012, 43). This layout puts the
        main text and the commentary on a more equal status: the main text is still
        usually larger, but takes up less of the page, is not centered and may be
        altered to accommodate the commentary. Unlike the <emph>cum textu</emph>
        format, the <emph>catena</emph> format of the Gilbert Psalter places more
        emphasis on the commentary. The page is still divided into two columns, but
        the commentary occupies both. When the commentary for a new verse starts, the
        first few words of the psalm text are given in extreme abbreviation. Aside from
        the first new words, the psalm text itself is absent from the page. Theresa
        Gross-Diaz describes the appearance of this layout in her study of the Gilbert
        Psalter as follows:</p>
        <cit>
          <quote rend="block">[T]he first words of the verse given in full, the end of the text sometimes
        disintegrating into a string of initials in the interest of economy of space,
        time, and parchment. Despite this interpolated repetition of the psalms in
        this 'simple' format, one would be hard-pressed to reconstruct each psalm from
        the lemmata provided, since the order of words and even of verses is often
        scrambled beyond recognition. <ptr target="#gross1996" loc="48"/></quote>
        </cit>
        <p>Such extreme abbreviation of a commented-upon text is only possible if the
        reader either has a separate copy of the text to use side-by-side or can call
        the text to mind with minimal prompting. In the case of the psalms, the latter
        is more likely: as discussed, readers who memorized the psalms as text and as
        sound encounter the psalms aurally with the mind's ear. A medieval reader who
        knows his psalms coming to Gilbert's commentary does not need the psalm to be
        present on the page or audibly because it is present in the mind.</p>
        <p>Gilbert's Psalter offers an early example that demonstrates how commentaries
        are at a remove from the text through extreme abbreviation, but also how
        these audiated annotations function as compound objects that reflect a
        particular, rather than a general, reader's experience. Commentaries in
        the <emph>catena</emph> layout are "chains "not only in the sense that
        they move on the page as an unbroken string of commentary but also in the
        sense that they link together previous commentaries. Where a <emph>Glossa
        ordinaria</emph>-style commentary isolates the words of each commentator — in
        one corner what Augustine said, in another corner what St. Hippolytus said — the
        <emph>catena</emph> makes a new, continuous commentary text by pulling
        together pieces of existing, multi-authored commentaries. As David Salomon
        says, a <emph>catena's</emph> author "joins the links in the chain but does
        not necessarily have a hand in constructing those links themselves" (47).
        It is important to note that Gilbert's Psalter is not, according to Saloman
        and Gross-Diaz, a "true" or typical <emph>catena</emph> for this reason
        since the commentary seems to be his own rather than just pieces of existing
        commentaries. Finally, <emph>catena</emph> psalm commentary is embedded in a
        particular rather than a general reading experience. While psalm commentaries,
        like Gilbert's, are sometimes "authorized" in that they were widely read
        and copied, some <emph>catena</emph> texts were unauthorized, created by
        individuals for their private use and not widely copied or, currently,
        discoverable (Salomon 2012).</p>
        </div>
        <div><head>Annotations in IIIF</head>
        <p>Today, the most ubiquitous audiated annotations are web-based.
        Audiated (unauthorized and extra-textual) annotations in open Web
        standards such as the IIIF (International Image Interoperability
        Framework) extend the use, shareability, and accessibility of
        online cultural artifacts. The IIIF consortium adopts the principles
        of <ref target="http://linkeddata.org/">Linked Data</ref> and the <ref
        target="http://www.w3.org/TR/webarch/">Architecture of the Web</ref> via a <ref
        target="https://iiif.io/model/shared-canvas/1.0">Shared Canvas data model</ref>
        and the use of <ref target="http://www.w3.org/TR/json-ld/">JSON-LD</ref> "in order
        to provide a distributed and interoperable framework" <ptr target="#appleby"/>
        for the presentation of Web content. Essentially, linked data on the Web are
        interrelated--they are data that refers to and "are aware of" other similar
        data — making semantic queries across platforms more productive and useful. The
        IIIF standard places particular emphasis on facilitating the creation of links
        (or references between bits of data) that are unauthorized or user-generated
        annotations of content because often, such contextual information is not
        well-described by current metadata schemas, especially in the context of
        cultural heritage institutions such as libraries, archives, and museums. The
        "Introduction to IIIF" <ptr target="#crane2017"/> claims:</p>
        <cit>
          <quote rend="block">While a multitude of different standards and practices are expected and even
        desirable for descriptive metadata, they do nothing for the content itself.
        There has been no standardized way of referring to a page of a book, or a
        sentence in a handwritten letter, from one digitised collection to the next.
        Descriptive metadata standards don't help us. It is not their job to enable
        us to refer to parts of the work, down to the tiniest detail - interesting
        marginalia, a single word on a page - and make statements about those parts in
        the web of linked data. It is not their job to present content, or share it, or
        refer to it.</quote>
        </cit>
        <p>This statement functions as a kind of manifesto for a distributed and
        unauthorized annotation environment that is not beholden to the kind of
        authorizl, often ideal-text-centric, metadata standards on which library,
        archive, and museum systems typically depend.</p>
        <p>In IIIF, the manifest is the primary document. The manifest is a plain
        text file written in JSON that privileges a reader's perception of how an
        object should be presented on a Web page. Manifests can be created and shared
        by institutions and read by presentation software, but IIIF manifests can be
        created or copied and reshared by readers who may wish to reorient how that
        object is presented online. By referencing or creating links to only the
        tiniest detail of an object such as an image or an audio file (the brightest
        star in Van Gogh's "Starry Night" or one phrase in a poem spoken by Maya
        Angelou), that reader can create a manifest that reorients completely how an
        object is read or accessed. In a IIIF manifest, all of the instructions about
        how the object should be presented are conceptualized as annotations on a
        canvas. Even what we might consider the main object of study — an image of the
        page of a book, a photograph of a painting, or a snippet of sound or video — is
        noted in the JSON manifest as an annotation to this canvas of the reader's
        mind. In this way, the idea of the idealized text is reoriented toward a
        privileging of the reader's instructions in the manifest about the presentation
        of that object.</p>
        <p>The IIIF manifest is a capacious document, containing multiple links
        brought together to create a particular reading, viewing, or listening
        experience; it reflects the object as constituting many parts, as a
        composite. For example, the manifest for a particular presentation of
        a medieval manuscript might include a canvas that links images of every
        manuscript page and the binding, multispectral images showing text that had
        been erased and written over, transcriptions, and explanatory notes that
        refer to each. This textual constellation, linked from the manifest and
        presented on the Web page seamlessly by software, may or may not be created
        or owned by the same people. Pieces of manuscripts that were cut apart
        and sold to different libraries can be reunited virtually on a new page as
        directed by a IIIF manifest.<note>For an example of this, see
        Lisa Fagin Davis' work with books "broken" by Otto Ege in the early
        twentieth century (Davis 2016).</note> If a reader's primary object of interest
        is the digitized Gilbert Psalter manuscript in the Parker library, they can
        create annotations describing the large, decorated initials in the book, and
        present those annotations on the Web using IIIF with or without the manuscript
        image. Without the image, the reader would not see the illuminated initials,
        but audiated annotations describing them can still be shown in spatial relation
        to one another. With IIIF, readers can create audiated annotations for the
        present absent text. In both Medieval and online cultures, audiated annotations
        circulate as composite, unauthorized, and decentralized objects for study.</p>
        </div>
        <div><head>Conclusions</head>
        <p>In the digital environment, collections that might include manuscripts or
        musical, spoken, or bioacoustical artifacts will require audiated annotations
        to be discoverable. Often, for privacy or copyright reasons, audiovisual
        cultural heritage objects such as historical audio and film are not freely
        available online. In the analog world, without annotations, we cannot find or
        know what is in or on a sound or image artifact unless someone has annotated
        a name on the back of a polaroid or on a written label on an audio reel or a
        cassette tape. Similarly, without metadata or descriptive information embedded
        in or associated with a digital file, we cannot search for or discover that
        object. As a result, audiated annotations — annotations that are unauthorized,
        decentralized, and composite — sometimes serve as the only access point into
        important cultural objects in literary study.</p>
        <p>Likewise, annotations on an audio object that may never circulate freely
        for copyright or privacy reasons can be described in temporal relation to that
        absent object and shared widely, like a playlist on an old mixed tape or liner
        notes on an album that points to and tells us more about the present, absent
        content. Such community-based, unauthorized sharing of scholarly annotations
        already exists in free and minimally produced scholarly editions using Jekyll
        to produce GitHub pages emphasized by scholarly editors who follow the tenets
        of Minimal Computing in DH including Minimal Editions (Minimal Computing n.d.),
        Wax (with IIIF-based static exhibits mimicking Omeka's functionality) (Nyröp
        n.d.), and the Versioning Machine (Schreibman 2015). The AudiAnnotate project
        is developing similar workflows for producing the same kind of community-based
        and composite annotations for audio (HiPSTAS 2020). This ability to share
        audiated annotations on an inaccessible object increases discoverability
        and that object's circulation in our cultural imaginary through scholarship,
        teaching, and learning. Untethered from a "main text", which is decentered
        as yet another annotated link on the IIIF canvas, readers can compile any
        Frankenstein canvas, that beautiful corpse.</p>
