                Digital Humanities (DH) scholars, many of whom continue to be more interested in how

                interest in <emph>also</emph> making sense of and understanding that information.
                For such a turn, computer scientists need input from the humanities whose specialty

                interpretation and contextualization.</p>
            <p>The arguments made by Anne Burdick, Johanna Drucker, Peter Lunenfeld, Todd Presner
                and Jeffrey Schnapp in <title rend="italic">Digital_Humanities</title> (2012) may
                serve as an illustration. For these authors, the core human values of DH are the
                digital enfranchisement of the public and the promotion of a core curriculum for
                undergraduates that will <cit>
                    <quote rend="inline" source="#burdick2012">make them active participants and
                        stakeholders in the creation and preservation of cultural materials.</quote>
                    <ptr target="#burdick2012" loc="23"/>
                </cit> In terms of humanities scholarship Burdick, et al. hope that the constant
                spread of information and knowledge across networks may give rise to <cit>
                    <quote rend="inline" source="#burdick2012">a state of <soCalled>ubiquitous
                            scholarship,</soCalled> of ever-more interconnected, publicly engaged,
                        participant citizens.</quote>
                    <ptr target="#burdick2012" loc="30"/>
                </cit> Again, the idea is to democratize, to reach out to broader publics and to
                have the university scholar work together with the citizen or amateur scholar. The
                    <soCalled>read-only</soCalled> ethos of the old humanities should be replaced
                with a <soCalled>read/write/rewrite</soCalled> ethos rooted in making - highlighting
                    <quote rend="inline" source="#burdick2012">the processes of design and the
                    creation of the experiential, the social, and the communal.</quote> Indeed, <cit>

                </cit> The kind of scholarship that this results in is <quote rend="inline"
                    source="#burdick2012">by definition, applied.</quote> It is scholarship that
                values the <soCalled>how</soCalled> over the <soCalled>what</soCalled> and that is
                much closer to what the Greek poet Archilochus, and later also Isaiah Berlin,
                referred to as <soCalled>fox</soCalled> knowledge rather than
                    <soCalled>hedgehog</soCalled> knowledge.<ptr target="#burdick2012" loc="93, 57"

            </p>
            <p>It is not, the authors of <title rend="italic">Digital_Humanities</title> assure us,
                that deep, specialized knowledge of the kind that humanities scholars used to be
                fond of and excel at - hedgehog knowledge - is useless. It is just that <cit>
                    <quote rend="inline" source="#burdick2012">there can be little doubt that the
                        technologies that give rise to the Digital Humanities push us - scholars,
                        students, and citizens alike - into the fox family. The nature of discourse
                        and debate in networks, the reality of study in multimedia environments, and
                        the inexorable splintering of attention that multiple windows and channels
                        afford lead to pursuing <soCalled>many ends</soCalled>.</quote>

                </cit> If at all possible, we should not give up - at least not yet and not entirely
                - on that <soCalled>inner hedgehog</soCalled> but instead try to create
                    <soCalled>hedgefoxes</soCalled>: hybrid creatures who combine the hedgehog’s
                ability to go deep with the fox’s wide-ranging curiosity.<ptr target="#burdick2012"

            <p>Toward the very end of <title rend="italic">Digital_Humanities</title>, however, we
                are told that: <cit>
                    <quote rend="block" source="#burdick2012">The prevailing research culture of the
                        Digital Humanities will become entrepreneurial, much like design or certain

                        humanist’s sense of identity will be less anchored in a discipline or
                        disciplinary specialty than in a sense of <emph>belonging to a community of

                    <dhq:citRef>
                        <ptr target="#burdick2012" loc="117"/> (my emphasis)</dhq:citRef>
                </cit>
            </p>
            <p>This sounds very much like a dismissal of the possibility described earlier of
                creating hedgefoxes - of somehow also cherishing that part of humanities scholarship
                which is based on the hedgehog’s ability to work long and hard and with intense
                rigor on one particular topic. Are Burdick, et al. telling us, we cannot help
                wondering at this point, that humanities scholarship will only be concerned with
                process, form, design - in short, the <soCalled>how</soCalled> - after all? What
                happened to the <soCalled>what</soCalled> - and what happened to those very central
                questions asked a few pages earlier: <cit>
                    <quote rend="inline" source="#burdick2012">How can the Digital Humanities keep
                        the ways of the hedgehog alive in the era of the fox’s ascendance? How do we
                        inject deep digs into the free-ranging ways of networked
                        scholarship?</quote>
                    <ptr target="#burdick2012" loc="98"/>
                </cit>
            </p>
            <p>To this reader, these last two questions posed by Burdick, et al. are the very
                questions that Digital Humanities (DH) scholars ought to become more interested in
                answering at the present moment. If none of the willingness to discuss the
                    <soCalled>what</soCalled> and to encourage hedgehog competences survives, then
                the humanities and its scholars will stand in danger of losing core competences such
                as engaging with <cit>
                    <quote rend="inline" source="#burdick2012">questions of value and
                        interpretation, with the realms of rhetoric as well as logic, with
                        subjective judgment alongside attention to verifiable truths.</quote>
                    <ptr target="#burdick2012" loc="4"/>
                </cit> Seeking to be like the social sciences and the natural sciences by
                appropriating quantifying methods and approaches will not make the humanities less,
                but more obsolete.</p>
            <p>In the following, it is the <soCalled>what</soCalled> that concerns me rather than
                the <soCalled>how</soCalled> - scholarly arguments rather than concrete DH
                practices. Though teaching and core curricula are - and should be - related to
                scholarship in obvious ways, the pursuit of basic knowledge and cognition in
                humanities research merits our attention in and of itself, it seems to me. The more
                widespread the use of digital technology becomes, and the more humanities scholars
                start working through as opposed to merely with computers, the more important it
                becomes for us to look at the ways in which digital technologies transform knowledge
                production and scholarly research.</p>
            <p>Arguing for the need to find a better balance between the <soCalled>how</soCalled> of
                the new digital methods and technologies and the <soCalled>what</soCalled> of older,
                more traditional humanities methods, my article will be divided into three parts. I
                will start by discussing the wish, expressed by some DH scholars, for a new, digital
                    <term xml:lang="de">Bildung</term>. What does this <term xml:lang="de"
                    >Bildung</term> consist of, how will it be propagated and what role will it
                conceivably play in rethinking the humanities? The second part of the article
                discusses the encounter between what C.P. Snow once called the <title rend="quotes"
                    >Two Cultures</title>: the arts and humanities on the one hand, and the natural
                and technological sciences on the other. DH is one hybrid meeting point between the
                two cultures and it is no coincidence that the <q>two
                    cultures</q> debate has since come to be echoed in various DH connections.
                Part three concerns what Arthur Schlesinger Jr. in 1962 referred to as the <q>mystique</q> of quantitative research: the
                hegemonic drive of the quantitative approach. Questioning, a mere six months after
                F.R. Leavis had delivered a vicious response to Snow’s <title rend="quotes">Two
                    Cultures</title> lecture, the assumption that quantitative research can handle
                everything, Schlesinger essentially repeated Leavis’ main arguments.</p>
            <p>Leavis and Schlesinger were right, I conclude, in pointing to the problems inherent
                in the wish to quantify humanities teaching and scholarship - a wish that is today
                often repeated by DH scholars.</p>

                <p>Berry’s recommendation that a humanistic approach concerning the reading and

                    Drucker, Peter Lunenfeld, Todd Presner and Jeffrey Schnapp promote what they

                    Though they do not play with a possible third-wave DH, but more or less stay

                        Manifesto 2.0</title>, their stated goals are rather similar to Berry’s.
                    Topping that list of goals is the creation of a core curriculum for
                    undergraduates that is built around <soCalled>fundamental activities</soCalled>
                    such as curation, analysis, editing, and modeling. It is one that emphasizes
                    design, multimediality and the experiential, encourages process rather than
                    finished product, and views the creation of works of art as a communal process,

                <p>One important part of this visionary digital enfranchisement discourse is its

                        scholars have attempted to draw our attention to the fact that human beings
                        have always accumulated technology because it increases our opportunities,
                        individually as well as collectively. For some, this imposes a moral duty on
                        us to further technological development because we thereby increase the
                        options and opportunities for people around the world. See <ptr

                    Rosenzweig maintained, for example, that the two most important contextual
                    frames into which to put the rise of digital computing were the Establishment
                    1960s of the Vietnam War and the Cold War, and the 1960s as counter-culture and
                    antiwar movement. Both the <soCalled>closed world</soCalled> discourse of the
                    Cold War and the <soCalled>open-world</soCalled> discourse of the counterculture
                    had to be taken into account as discourses that helped shape the internet.
                    Understanding these dual origins would make it possible, also, <cit>

                <p>Time has proven Rosenzweig right. Those controversies over the internet are still
                    very much with us; indeed, they have in some ways become more bitter as a result
                    of what has come to be known as <q>the copyright
                        wars</q> - the pitched battles over new technology, business models and
                    consumers, between those attempting to expand copyright protection and those
                    trying to circumvent it. But this only goes to show the importance of the
                    internet and of digital communication, and several historians have followed
                    Rosenzweig’s invitation to historicize and contextualize both. Some have been
                    especially interested in the <soCalled>closed world</soCalled> discourse <note>
                        As historians concentrating on the <soCalled>closed world</soCalled>
                        discourse have pointed out, it was U.S. Cold War spending on military
                        projects that originally funded many of the most important post-World War
                        Two technological discoveries. With both an economic crisis going on and
                        support for deregulation growing, public funding for science and technology
                        started to drop in the late 1970s, though. One result was that the internet
                        was privatized and computers became a private, individual and commercial
                        project. See e.g. <ptr target="#reynolds2010"/>. </note> while others have
                    focused more on the <soCalled>open world</soCalled> discourse.</p>
                <p>Historians focusing on the <soCalled>open world</soCalled> discourse have shown
                    how the computer quickly came to be considered a tool for global learning and
                    thereby helped shape the process of globalization and a growing consciousness of

                </p>
                <p>More recently, DH scholar Patrik Svensson has also emphasized the link between
                    visionary thinking and technological development (Svensson 2012, 65). Remarking
                    how the constant challenges waged at core approaches and methods add to the
                    sense of a field that is dynamic and constantly changing, he sees the truly
                    interdisciplinary nature of DH and the way in which it potentially operates
                    across all humanities disciplines as a big advantage when it comes to applying
                    for funding, national as well as international, where there may be a need for
                    Big Humanities to match Big Science projects. <ptr target="#svensson2012"
                        loc="22–24"/>
                </p>
                <p>Key words - for Svensson as for Burdick, et al., Berry and many other DH scholars
                    - are urgency and change; the need for rethinking and pushing against the
                    boundaries of existing and established structures and ways of thinking. Because
                    most of the work done within DH is collaborative and project-based and its
                    concrete outcome often is digital publications that do not fit easily into
                    traditional academic patterns of reward and support, moreover, many within the
                    DH community press for changes to accommodate their work. When we add to this
                    the sense that many humanities scholars have of competing for funding,
                    recognition and the place of their respective disciplines within higher

                <p>There is indeed much at stake for the humanities and for its students and
                    scholars, as Kathleen Fitzpatrick sums it up in <title rend="italic">Planned
                        Obsolescence: Publishing, Technology, and the Future of the Academy</title>
                    (2011): Whether or not we believe in those beautiful visions for a
                    transformative discourse in relation to DH, humanities scholars have to embrace
                    a new digital <term xml:lang="de">Bildung</term> at this point. Otherwise, our
                    disciplines will simply cease to be relevant. The economic crisis has given
                    urgency to debates about the role of the humanities – again and again. From
                    fights over academic publishing to debates about what form academic writing
                    should take in the digital age, humanities scholars are faced with major
                    challenges. And the only thing that is certain, Fitzpatrick argues, is that if
                    we hide our heads in the sand and refuse to engage with the new media, we will
                        lose.<ptr target="#fitzpatrick2011"/>

                        cultures</q>?</head>
                <p>It is interesting that at the core of the wish for digital enfranchisement of the
                    public we find a somewhat traditional (American) multicultural argument. As the
                    authors of <title rend="italic">Digital_Humanities</title> see it, today’s
                    humanities curricula suffer from a gap between traditional methods of pedagogy
                    focusing on linear text and those of the multidimensional world of the Web and
                    the mediated culture in which we live today. Directed as they were at <cit>

                    </cit>, the culture wars and canon debates of the past thirty years were an
                    attempt to bridge that gap - an attempt that has unfortunately not been entirely
                    successful. The result has been that the humanities have come to be seen today
                    as out of touch with life outside the walls of the university. This has in turn
                    led to an attempt to move more students into vocational training in order that
                    higher education may be reserved for more elitist-minded students (Burdick, et
                    al. 2012, 23).</p>
                <p>It was a different, though related, kind of gap that inspired F.R. Leavis to
                    engage in fierce dialogue with his Cambridge colleague C.P. Snow in the early
                    1960s: that between what the latter termed <q>the
                        Two Cultures</q>, the technological and natural sciences on the one hand
                    and the arts and humanities on the other. The interest in higher education was
                    one that Leavis shared with Burdick, et al. and other DH scholars, though - at
                    bottom, the famous <q>Two Cultures</q> debate
                    had everything to do with what ought to be the core curriculum of the
                    humanities. It is therefore perhaps no coincidence that echoes of the old debate
                    have found their way into the DH community. Indeed, from the very beginning,

                <p>Humanities computing, which later developed into DH, has always been a visionary
                    discourse, as we saw. One such visionary attempt to use the digital as a means
                    of renegotiating the humanities and to rely on digital networks to further
                    interdisciplinary work is the Humanities, Arts, Science, and Technology Advanced

                <p>HASTAC wishes to provide a forum for, and thereby further, the interconnected and
                    interactive global nature of knowledge today – a forum that will blur sharp
                    distinctions between research, education and other activities and that will
                    extend DH beyond the humanities themselves to industry, cultural institutions
                    and the art world. The ultimate vision, though, is finding a way of bridging the
                        <q>two cultures</q> – defined here as not
                    only those of the humanities and the sciences/technology, but also those of
                    theory versus practice. What is interesting about the HASTAC statement is the
                    way in which it also includes a vision of bridging social divisions as well as
                    national borders digitally. Many of these elements were present in the debate on
                        <q>the two cultures</q> between C.P. Snow
                    and F.R. Leavis.</p>
                <p>Sir Charles Percy Snow did a Ph.D. in Chemistry at the University of Cambridge,
                    but it was as a novelist and government official that he became a well-known
                    figure to the English public. Between 1940 and 1970, he published eleven novels
                    that became known collectively as <title rend="italic">Strangers and
                        Brothers</title>. These novels were very successful; they sold widely and
                    were translated into many different languages. Frank Raymond Leavis was less of
                    a public figure. Within the academic community, though, he was recognized as one
                    of the most influential figures in twentieth-century English literary criticism.
                    He did a Ph.D. in English at the University of Cambridge where he taught for
                    many years and was well known for his decisive and often provocative
                    judgments.</p>
                <p>
                    <title rend="italic">The Two Cultures and the Scientific Revolution</title> was
                    the Sir Robert Rede Lecture at Cambridge of 1959. In it Snow brought to public
                    attention what he considered to be a dangerous divide between the ethos and
                    practices of the sciences and those of the old humanities (especially Latin and
                    Greek). The British educational system had over-rewarded the latter at the
                    expense of scientific and engineering education with the result that people in
                    politics, administration, and industry were ill-equipped to manage the modern
                    scientific world. Snow’s lecture started a debate about the relative importance
                    for British culture and for the British educational system of <q>the two cultures</q> - a debate to which
                    Leavis contributed with his Richmond Lecture, entitled <title rend="italic">Two
                        Cultures? The Significance of C.P. Snow</title> and delivered in Downing
                    College, Cambridge, in February 1962.</p>
                <p>It is Leavis’ reaction to Snow’s lecture that concerns me here. Elsewhere, I have
                    written at greater length about both Snow’s and Leavis’ points of view <note> My
                        interest in the Snow-Leavis debate was raised while I was working on DH as
                        an Arcadia Fellow at the University of Cambridge in the fall of 2011. The
                        article that was my output as an Arcadia Fellow is available at <ref

                        The following paragraphs build on this article. </note> - arguing for a
                    better balance between the <soCalled>how</soCalled> and the
                        <soCalled>what</soCalled> of DH, as I am in this particular context, it is
                    especially Leavis’ view of things that is relevant because it was precisely the
                        <soCalled>what</soCalled> that also concerned Leavis, and that he kept
                    defending vis-à-vis Snow’s <q>Technologico-Benthamite</q> view of the world.<ptr
                        target="#mackillop1995" loc="321"/> In and of himself, Snow did not matter
                    to Leavis; it is what he represented that was the problem. With all his clichés,
                    repetitions and sentimental banalities, Snow was too obvious, too lacking in
                    depth in the sense of questioning the received truths of the <term xml:lang="de"
                        >Zeitgeist</term>, material but especially spiritual, Leavis thought. Snow
                    could not stop talking about <soCalled>social hope</soCalled> and he preached a
                    way of salvation that entailed <soCalled>welfare</soCalled> for all in terms of
                    material standards of living, advantages of technology and scientific
                    hygiene.</p>
                <p>The dimension that Leavis most of all found lacking in Snow was the individual,
                    the human one. Though all human beings share certain common features - hunger
                    and thirst, for example, and the fact that we all have eyes, noses, legs and
                    arms - <cit>

                    </cit> Spiritually, we are all different and it counts - or ought to count - how
                    each individual human being thinks and feels. Snow’s <soCalled>social
                        hope</soCalled> did not catch that inward quality of individual life, that
                    kind of existential thought and experience which might ultimately lead to
                    something as old-fashioned as wisdom. At one level, what was at stake was what
                    the Germans would call <term xml:lang="de">Weltschmerz</term> - the tragic
                    feeling and creative probing into the big questions about life and death which
                    may at its best produce great art and literature: <cit>

                            what I can only call a religious depth of thought and feeling.</quote>

                </p>
                <p>At another level, the issue, as Leavis saw it, was the pace of life that modern
                    science and technology seemed to result in. Snow had kept stressing, in his Rede
                    Lecture, the urgency of his concerns, the speed with which today turns into
                    tomorrow - <cit>

                    </cit> - but he hadn’t really paused to consider the deeper implications of
                    this. Brakes must be applied sometimes, Leavis thought. It was not that Snow was
                    wrong in advocating improvements in scientific education and in living standards
                    for everyone; it was more that <cit>

                    blunders which, in the atomic day and age, could have fatal results. Moreover,
                    important ethical issues could well be at stake - issues that perhaps scientists
                    themselves would not be aware of: <cit>

                            mankind - this is surely clear - will need to be in full intelligent

                            haven’t chosen to say that mankind will need all its traditional wisdom;

                            less, is something with the livingness of the deepest vital instinct; as
                            intelligence, a power - rooted, strong in experience, and supremely
                            human - of creative response to the new challenges of time; something

                    - meaning which was then transmitted through literature as a <q>cultural community or consciousness.</q> The
                    place where this cultural consciousness might be sustained was the university,
                    and because language was central to thought and thought, past as well as

                <p>Throughout his lecture, Leavis anxiously claimed that he was not himself a
                    Luddite, but that he would be dismissed by Snow and his cohort as being one, the
                    moment he pointed to the complexity of current technical and intellectual
                    developments. Any criticism voiced would be seen as inevitably <q>highbrow</q> - a negative term wielded against
                    anyone who attempted to work toward qualitative, rather than quantitative goals: <cit>

                <p>Just as Snow personified for Leavis everything that was currently wrong, so
                    Leavis was for Snow in the end just another Luddite. Today, the name of each is
                    very much associated with the two cultures debate of which they were the main
                    protagonists. As we find ourselves in the middle of another technological
                    revolution - this time a digital one - we are once more very concerned with what
                    the implications will be for our research and our way of thinking and writing.
                    To what extent will the technologically savvy, already as fully converted to the
                    digital cause as Snow was to the scientific revolution, carry the day - and on
                    what terms? And to what extent will those of us who care about the humanities be
                    allowed to fret about the present state and future of our disciplines in the
                    same way that Leavis wondered about what can and should be done, without being
                    considered <q>highbrow,</q> elitist snobs?</p>

                <p>Snow’s lecture got an immediate response, both positive and negative, and he

                    others obviously did not - he was on to something that greatly interested
                    people. In fact, there was a similar debate going on at the University of
                    Oxford. Here, Isaiah Berlin took the leading part in building a new graduate
                    college, Wolfson College, which would promote the powerful scientific and
                    technological developments of the time.<ptr target="#hardy2009"/> And across the
                    Atlantic, famous historian and special assistant to President Kennedy between
                    1961 to 1963 Arthur Schlesinger, Jr. gave a talk to the American Sociological
                    Association at its fifty-seventh annual meeting in August 1962 (a mere six
                    months after Leavis had reacted so strongly to Snow) in which he discussed what
                    he considered to be the hegemonic drive of the quantitative approach. This
                    particular annual meeting of the ASA being in honor of Paul Lazarsfeld, who was
                    considered by many to be one of the founders of modern empirical sociology,

                    address concerned the way in which many sociologists had come to consider
                    empirical social research <q>not one of several

                    these sociologists had increasingly come to understand empirical social research

                        <quote rend="block" source="#schlesinger1962">There is much, I would add,
                            which we must leave, whether we like it or not, not just to historians
                            but to poets, novelists, painters, musicians, philosophers, theologians,
                            even politicians, even saints - in short, to one form or another of
                            humanist. For an indefinite future, I suspect, humanism will continue to
                            yield truths about both individual and social experience which
                            quantitative social research by itself could never reach. Whether these
                            truths are inherently or merely temporarily inaccessible to the
                            quantitative method is a question which only experience can answer.
                                <p>In the meantime, this humanist is bound to say that, as an aid to
                                the understanding of society and men, quantitative social research
                                is admirable and indispensable. As a guide to the significance of
                                problems, it is misleading when it exudes the assumption that only
                                problems susceptible to quantitative solutions are important. As a
                                means of explaining human or social behavior, it is powerful but
                                profoundly incomplete. As the source of a theory of human nature and
                                of the universe, it is but a new formulation of an ancient romantic
                                myth.</p>

                <p>Leavis would have agreed wholeheartedly. As Guy Ortolano has shown, it was not
                    the importance of science and technology that Leavis questioned, but rather the
                    complete endorsement by modern civilization of ideals such as description, logic
                    and clarity - to the exclusion of older, more qualitative ideals.<ptr

                    instead a question of finding the right balance between quantifying and

                    bias and/or emotion. Reminding us how, in the nineteenth century, the drive for
                    objectivity led to the belief in <soCalled>mechanical objectivity,</soCalled> and how this
                    very belief was fought tooth and nail up through the twentieth century by
                    humanists who wanted the role of human interpretation to be recognized, Rieder

                    that, the quest for universalism. To the lure of objectivity must be added the
                    power of visual evidence. While having previously often questioned scientific
                    images by raising the issue of representation and referentiality, humanities
                    scholars now increasingly use images in their own research - seemingly

                <p>Like Rieder and Röhle, I think - and have in this article argued - that the many
                    new developments within DH must be discussed with a view not only to their
                    potential, but also to their limits. Whether or not it may properly be
                    classified as a Kuhnian paradigm shift - and the vote is still out on this - the
                    digital turn and the involvement with computer-based approaches will cause
                    substantial changes for both the teaching and the research in the humanities. A
                    number of humanities scholars have not yet understood the importance or, indeed,
                    the enormity of this turn - especially when it comes to their way of doing basic
                    research. Whereas a lot has been written on the impact on our teaching and
                    dissemination of knowledge in the humanities, not that many scholars have tried
                    to grapple with the impact on humanities research and recognition - with the
                    epistemological consequences of working through computers. </p>
                <p>We are repeatedly told, by politicians, funding agencies and colleagues in other
                    parts of Academia, that if we want to stay vital, interesting and relevant we
                    need to <soCalled>reformat</soCalled> ourselves in the humanities. In the late
                    1950s and early 1960s, F.R. Leavis and Arthur Schlesinger, Jr. perceived their
                    core humanities disciplines - literature and history, respectively - to be under
                    duress by the hegemonic drive of the quantitative approach, so highly
                    recommended by people such as C.P. Snow and Paul Lazarsfeld. This made them take
                    up and rephrase for their own time the age-old debate about <q>the two cultures.</q> Perhaps we should do something similar
                    today, as computer-based approaches force us to reexamine the relationships of
