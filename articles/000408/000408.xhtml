                  <p>Data visualizations are inherently rhetorical, and therefore bias-laden visual
                     artifacts that contain both explicit and implicit arguments. The implicit
                     arguments depicted in data visualizations are the net result of many seemingly
                     minor decisions about data and design from inception of a research project
                     through to final publication of the visualization. Data workflow, selected
                     visualization formats, and individual design decisions made within those formats
                     all frame and direct the possible range of interpretation, and the potential for
                     harm of any data visualization. Considering this, it is imperative that we take
                     an ethical approach to the creation and use of data visualizations. Therefore,
                     we have suggested an ethical data visualization workflow with the dual aim of
                     minimizing harm to the subjects of our study and the audiences viewing our
                     visualization, while also maximizing the explanatory capacity and effectiveness
                     of the visualization itself. To explain this ethical data visualization
                     workflow, we examine two recent digital mapping projects, Racial Terror
                     Lynchings and Map of White Supremacy Mob Violence.

                  <div class="ptext" id="p1">In March 2016, Microsoft’s Technology and Research division released an
                     artificial intelligence chatbot known as TayTweets under the handle @TayandYou
                     on Twitter. Microsoft had programmed the chatbot to interact with the online
                     community and subsequently learn from the tweets of users mentioning it, in
                     order to improve its natural language communication abilities. Though unlikely
                     to pass the Turing Test any time soon, TayTweets was nevertheless able to
                     generate its own internet memes, crack its own jokes, and participate in the
                     regular back-and-forth of online conversation.

                  <div class="counter"><a href="#p2">2</a></div>
                  <div class="ptext" id="p2">Microsoft presented TayTweets as a value-neutral project that would showcase the
                     technological achievements of its research division, and early on the AI was
                     seemingly innocuous, posting anodyne responses to tweets welcoming it to Twitter
                     and asking it mundane questions. With its first tweet of “hellooooooo
                     w¿¿¿¿rld!!!” — a riff on the traditional output of a computer
                     programmer’s first program — TayTweets had virtually stepped onto the world
                     stage and greeted the Twitterverse in a seemingly innocent, even youthfully
                     naive, way.
                  </div>
                  
                  <div class="counter"><a href="#p3">3</a></div>
                  <div class="ptext" id="p3">Within 16 hours, however, the experiment had to be shut down, as TayTweets had
                     algorithmically learned to be racist. Posting inflammatory tweets championing
                     white supremacy and denigrating racial minorities and marginalized groups, the
                     artificial intelligence program had become an online menace and in fact a
                     cyberbully. TayTweets’s rapid descent into racist demagoguery serves as a
                     harrowing reminder that our digital productions are not free from the cultural
                     assumptions and prejudices that shape everyday human experience. Microsoft’s
                     designers had a blind spot about the depth and breadth of American racism, which
                     allowed TayTweets to replicate deep-seated preconceptions and prejudices without
                     critically examining them. 
                  </div>
                  
                  <div class="counter"><a href="#p4">4</a></div>
                  <div class="ptext" id="p4">For our purposes, what is interesting about TayTweets is not its experimentation
                     with artificial intelligence, but the project’s apparent assumption that an
                     algorithm — the set of rules by which any programmatic approach operates,
                     whether digital or analog — is value neutral and divorceable from human
                     prejudice and malice. On the contrary, humans are at the center of algorithms,
                     not only as their creators but, in the case of data-driven algorithms, as the
                     producers of the content they shape and present. Though an extreme example,
                     TayTweets clearly demonstrates how wider cultural assumptions, prevalent
                     political ideologies, and public discourses shape the output of our algorithmic
                     productions, potentially replicating what we already know instead of aiding us
                     to discover the new and uncover the unexamined. In other words, TayTweets tapped
                     into an American zeitgeist riddled with detrimental preconceptions with regard
                     to race.

                  <div class="ptext" id="p5">Ethical visualization is essentially a human-centric approach to algorithmic
                     production, considering the underlying biases, ideologies, and beliefs that
                     animate algorithms as they structure and reproduce past inequities and harmful
                     realities. All data visualizations — whether static or interactive, printed or
                     digital, computer-genecomplexrated or hand-drawn — are algorithmic by nature, in
                     the sense that they solve complex problems of representation and require a set
                     of tree-based actions and decisions for their success. Ethical visualization
                     practices sit at the intersection of humanistic inquiry, ethics, and
                     communication design. We define ethical visualization as the presentation of
                     visualized information in ways that acknowledge and mitigate the potential for
                     harm engendered within the visualization form and content. While good design
                     practice forms the backbone of ethical visualizations, ethical visualization
                     practice goes one step further to consider the ultimate societal impact of such
                     design choices: do such choices cause harm or mislead, either intentionally or
                     unintentionally? Do they result in a net societal benefit, or do they prove
                     deleterious to marginalized individuals? These questions must be brought to the
                     forefront when considering good design, because a visualization can follow good
                     design practices and consequently be easy to understand, but still produce a
                     negative societal impact for its subject matter all the same.

                     humanists must adhere to a form of visualization ethics that considers how both
                     choices about working with data and the rhetorical qualities of communication
                     elements — color, composition, line, symbols, type, and interactivity — shape
                     users’ understandings of represented people and places. Given the “racism in the machine” — the ways
                     in which our digital tools can inadvertently recreate the latent racism,
                     underlying prejudices, and cultural blind spots in our society — the goal of
                     this visualization ethics should be “increasing understanding [for users] while minimizing harm” to
                     represented people and places [<a class="ref" href="#cairo2014">Cairo 2014</a>].

                  <div class="ptext" id="p7">To propose a methodology for visualization ethics, this article examines two
                     projects that visualize the horrific history of racial lynching in the United
                     States, Lynching in America by the Equal Justice Initiative and Monroe Work
                     Today by Auut Studio, in order to show that no visualization is ideologically
                     neutral, but is instead part of an argument that must be critically examined. In
                     contrast to TayTweets’s outright bigotry, Lynching in America and Monroe Work
                     Today both present visualizations that demonstrate to varying degrees ethical
                     visualization practices, though one succeeds in producing an ethical
                     visualization to a greater degree than the other. This paper showcases ethical
                     visualization in practice to varying degrees in these two digital mapping
                     projects, demonstrating how choices about representation, interaction, and
                     annotation in their data visualizations either do harm in the sense described
                     above, or challenge dominant narratives. In comparing these two projects, the
                     article outlines a workflow that can ensure that data visualizations adhere to
                     best practices in visualization ethics and thereby present opportunities for
                     more inclusive and critical interaction with represented data.

                        this interactive choropleth map of the United States purports to depict

                        minimalist in presentation, and is tied directly to the state and county

                        Mason-Dixon line, while in larger screens the entire contiguous United
                        States is shown. However, in both cases, the American south grabs attention
                        with many southern counties highlighted. Users can click on any county or
                        state, and are taken to a zoomed-in view of the state, with the total
                        reported lynchings in that state displayed in large letters. The user can
                        then hover over individual counties to find out how many lynchings were
                        reported in that county (see <a href="#figure02">Figure 2</a>). This
                        zoomed-in view focuses on the number of lynchings per state and county —
                        represented by polygons shaped according to county boundaries — creating a
                        visual argument that encourages measurement of states and counties as more
                        or less reprehensible in terms of number of lynchings. It is focused on
                        lynchings in the context of political boundaries, and thereby presents a
                        strong geopolitical argument about recorded lynchings that appears
                        definitive and damning, particularly of the states with the most counties
                        marked in bright red: Alabama, Florida, Louisiana, and Mississippi. There is
                        a straightforwardness about this visual argument: racial terror was and is
                        morally wrong, and its contours are plain to any competent observer.

                        with a dark grey United States segmented by black state lines, placed in a
                        dark blue sea. This mostly dark color scheme is dramatically interrupted
                        with many counties highlighted in various shades of red, with bright red
                        indicating 20 or more lynchings recorded in the county (see <a href="#figure01">Figure 1</a>). The color scheme of red on an
                        otherwise dark, monochrome palette compounds the visual argument described
                        above, as it references the brutality and violence inflicted upon African
                        Americans in those locations, recalling the blood stains on United States

                        visualization than the minimalist Racial Terror Lynchings. It is an
                        interactive map within Monroe Work Today (<a href="http://www.monroeworktoday.org" onclick="window.open('http://www.monroeworktoday.org'); return false" class="ref">http://www.monroeworktoday.org</a>), a website dedicated to
                        publicizing the research of sociologist Monroe Work, who systematically
                        documented lynchings in the United States. Created by education-focused
                        digital agency Auut Studio, this interactive map of the United States
                        depicts lynching records in the context of historical racial violence and
                        public discourses of white superiority, and is consequently subtitled “The lynchings and riots to enforce racial superiority in
                        the US”. Upon first page load, Map of White Supremacy Mob
                        Violence stands in stark contrast to Racial Terror Lynchings, presenting the
                        entire contiguous United States center of screen, irrespective of screen
                        size, and representing each recorded case of lynching as a single grey dot
                        on a white national landmass background (see <a href="#figure03">Figure
                           3</a>). State borders are not visible in this view, and a single,
                        bright, attention grabbing color is only found on instructions for users.
                        This initial map view — including map framing, choice of colors, and the
                        carefully worded title and subtitle — provides a strong and markedly
                        different message than the Racial Terror Lynchings map. Collectively, these
                        elements present a strong visual argument that discourses of white supremacy
                        are a nationwide reality in the United States, one that has historically
                        been enforced through lynchings and riots by mobs. The geopolitical framing
                        of lynching as a nation-wide reality is balanced with the acknowledgement of
                        a crucial aspect of the historically pervasive intellectual climate, one of
                        white superiority, and an important aspect of the social behavioral climate,
                        mob violence. At the center bottom of the page is a key annotation: a label
                        that reads “Should I trust this? Find out.” If users click this
                        message, they are taken to a plethora of information about the veracity of
                        the data used, and a discussion of the importance of thinking critically
                        about the visualized data.

                     <div class="ptext" id="p12">Although it is not entirely clear from this initial page view what the grey
                        dots represent, the user is presented with instructions to zoom in and click
                        on individual points. After the user follows these instructions, the map
                        gains more color, and individual dots become more visible, along with state
                        and county boundaries (see <a href="#figure04">Figure 4</a>). In this
                        view, state and county lines are visible, as are the boundaries of Native
                        American reservations and areas that historically were Spanish colonies.
                        However, these geographic lines are indicated with subtlety, using pale
                        colors. In contrast, the dots representing each individual lynching are
                        highlighted using bright colors and an <span class="hi italic">onclick</span>

                        combined with emphasizing each individual lynching with bright colors, makes
                        the visual argument that lynchings occurred in the context of geopolitical
                        boundaries, but that the individual deaths are of greater significance than
                        the boundaries themselves.

                        represented in the current view, and a color-coded legend of dot colors. Six
                        different dot colors are used: five to represent races of lynched people,
                        and one to represent “other”, where the race recorded in the historical
                        records does not fall into one of the main five. Notably, the “other”
                        category includes lynchings of white abolitionists, thereby demonstrating
                        the complexity of the history of lynching in the United States, and that
                        white people were also, however rarely, victims of lynching in the name of
                        white supremacy.

                     <div class="ptext" id="p14">Both the timeline and the legend serve two purposes: one functional, the
                        other persuasive. Users can select a time period using the timeline, which
                        then alters data presented on the map, so they can see how many lynchings
                        occurred in an area over a specific timeframe. Secondly, the timeline
                        provides a persuasive visual cue that racial superiority-motivated lynchings
                        occured continually over a long timespan, with some time periods seeing
                        evidence of significantly more racial superiority-motivated lynchings. The
                        legend also works on these two levels. It firstly allows the user to
                        identify the race of a lynched person based on the color of the dot used to
                        represent them, and secondly provides a strong visual counterargument to the
                        widespread public assumption that lynchings were perpetrated exclusively on
                        African Americans. These two elements, the timeline and the legend, confront
                        the user with the temporal and racial extent of white superiority-motivated
                        lynchings, both qualities that are absent from the Racial Terror Lynchings
                        map.

                     <div class="ptext" id="p15">Most strikingly, the zoomed-in view of Map of White Supremacy Mob Violence
                        contains a list, in the bottom left hand corner of the screen, of the name
                        (where available) of every lynched person represented by a dot in the
                        current map view, and the year they were lynched. Clicking on any individual
                        dot brings up a <span class="hi italic">callout</span> box containing extra details
                        of the lynching available in the historical record, including the county in
                        which it occurred, the details of mob violence in which the lynching
                        occurred, the accusation made before the lynching, and links to every
                        available historical source that verifies the record (see <a href="#figure05">Figure 5</a>). Naming individuals who were lynched,
                        and providing circumstances surrounding their death, focuses attention on
                        the humanity of victims of lynching and on the social circumstances in which
                        lynching was a viable possibility. In the present day context of many white
                        supremacists denying their racism, it is worth noting that these historical
                        records rarely mention race as a motivator for lynching. For example,
                        William B. Willis of Richmond County, Georgia, was accused of murder before
                        being lynched. The Map of White Supremacy Mob Violence does an exemplary job
                        of demonstrating that racism was indeed the motivating factor in lynchings,
                        and also that racism was largely hidden in the official historical record by
                        documenting other, non-racial reasons. Providing links to multiple
                        historical sources within the interactive map increases trust in the
                        veracity of data, while at the same time giving users the opportunity to
                        investigate the historical evidence themselves. Map of White Supremacy Mob
                        Violence uses multiple compelling strategies to both humanize the data it
                        represents, and to contextualize it in the societal racism and discourses of
                        white supremacy in the United States.

                        accounted for by the fact that the former only depicts lynchings of African
                        Americans, whereas the latter depicts lynchings of African Americans, Native
                        Americans, Latinos, Italians, and other races. The view of the American West
                        depicted in Map of White Supremacy Mob Violence in <a href="#figure06">Figure 6b</a> provides a compelling visual narrative that lynchings
                        were common across California in the name of enforcing white superiority.
                        The view of Racial Terror Lynchings Map depicted in <a href="#figure06">Figure 6a</a>, by its lack of clarity about exactly which data is
                        being represented (i.e. historical records of lynchings of African Americans
                        only), its use of a bold and expansive title that suggests comprehensive
                        coverage of lynchings of all races (i.e. Racial Terror Lynchings), and its
                        tonal emphasis on the south (California appearing grey, while visual
                        attention is drawn to the large amounts of red in the bottom right hand
                        corner of the map), makes a visual argument that California had few
                        instances of racial terror or lynchings. This is particularly problematic
                        because the Equal Justice Initiative’s stated goal is to challenge black
                        incarceration, and a key part of their organizational message is that this
                        goal is urgent and directly related to the history of lynchings motivated by
                        white supremacy. Black incarceration rates in California are among the
                        highest in the nation today: according to the U.S. Bureau of Justice,
                        California imprisons blacks 8.8 times more frequently than whites, well
                        above the national average of 5.5:1 [<a class="ref" href="#sp2015">"The Sentencing Project"</a>]. Consequently
                        EJI’s visual argument in the Racial Terror Lynchings Maps inadvertently
                        breaks down in advocacy regarding California prisons.

                        America is a promotional and advocacy tool for the Equal Justice Initiative,
                        primarily created to visualize data within (and thereby promote) the report
                        “Lynching in America”, which records
                        lynchings of African Americans and frames lynching as a societal tool —
                        enabled through mob violence and discourses of white superiority — to
                        subjugate African Americans between slavery and mass incarceration. It is in
                        the Equal Justice Initiative’s interests to visualize historical lynching
                        data in a way that draws attention to geopolitical divides, so that clear
                        links can be made between historical lynching events and present-day
                        constituencies of sitting politicians as well as county and state local
                        governments. The map provides compelling visual evidence for the

                        incarceration of black Americans, the case of California notwithstanding.
                        The problematic aspect of this is that the Equal Justice Initiative’s
                        website, report, and Racial Terror Lynchings map are unfortunately named to
                        suggest that they cover all historical records of lynchings in the United
                        States. The Lynching in America report includes instructions for educators
                        who wish to use it as a teaching resource. In this context, the geopolitical
                        emphasis, use of color, use of summary data, and lack of links to sources
                        give a concerning impression that African-American lynchings were the
                        complete record of lynchings in the United States for the purposes of racial
                        terror.

                        centers on the experience of African Americans in the Southern United
                        States, and for good measure: for blacks in the Jim Crow South, lynchings
                        represented a terrifying aspect of everyday life. In the grand scheme of
                        racial violence, however, lynchings represented one small piece in a complex
                        puzzle of individual, institutional, and structural racism. The conflation
                        of lynching with the full extent of racialized violence in United States
                        history obscures the historic depth and breadth of the oppression of people
                        of color. A black individual was far more likely to suffer public
                        humiliation, assault, rape, and murder than a public lynching. While
                        lynchings do not represent the totality of racial violence in America, they
                        come to the fore because they were highly symbolic affairs: gruesome
                        spectacles of white supremacy, racial violence, and bodily mutilation meant
                        to suppress and intimidate as much as they were meant to kill [<a class="ref" href="#wood2009">Wood 2009</a>, 1–4]. Due to their highly symbolic nature and
                        the lasting implications of racist attitudes, policies, and actions for
                        African Americans today, lynchings have become synonymous with racial hatred
                        in the postbellum American south.

                     the standard visualization conventions that we are most familiar with — bar
                     charts, line charts, pie charts — were all created in European countries at the
                     height of their colonial expansion and industrial transformation. They were
                     created to track demographics, trade, war, and debt; all the trappings of their
                     growing empires [<a class="ref" href="#wainer2013">Wainer 2013</a>]

                     intelligible to the intended audience, and that they foster consideration of the
                     dignity of the represented subjects. Therefore, we propose an ethical
                     visualization workflow (see <a href="#figure07">Figure 7</a>) that
                     operates within existing data collection and information design frameworks but
                     ensures that any given visualization’s argument provides a compelling yet

                     reviewing, collecting, pruning, describing, surveying, and pre-visualizing.
                     These steps involve processes that many digital humanities scholars will be
                     familiar with, with the important difference that they are suggested here with
                     alterations that we believe will result in an ethical data visualization. The
                     steps can be grouped into three standard digital humanities practice phases:
                     pre-data collection (defining, reviewing); data collection and curation
                     (collecting, pruning, describing); and data visualization and argumentation

                        the subject area that the data visualization will depict, while the second
                        step involves reviewing the latest secondary literature on the topic at
                        hand. Reviewing subject area literature would inform the remaining steps in
                        the ethical data visualization workflow, inviting the researcher to
                        compensate for the data set’s shortcomings by seeking out and including new
                        information, or to limit the scope of the visual argument to be produced
                        with said data. Doing so would avoid the glaring oversights and interpretive
                        overreach that plagued the EJI’s Racial Terror Lynchings Map.

                        producing an ethical data visualization, precisely because it is so
                        frequently overlooked. The third step in the ethical visualization workflow
                        involves collecting primary documents, artifacts, and datasets, as well as
                        secondary datasets of potential relevance, while the fourth step involves
                        checking the appropriateness, authenticity, veracity, and feasibility of use
                        of collected primary and secondary materials, and pruning those that don’t
                        hold up under scrutiny. Once these two critical data collection steps have
                        been finished, the researcher completes the fifth step, describing, by
                        creating their own dataset that combines the collected materials.

                        eliminates other people’s and institutions’ biases from the data, ensuring
                        erroneous arguments are not unintentionally added through using unaltered
                        historical datasets. This process of collecting, pruning, and describing
                        data sets was undertaken by Auut Studios for ten years before visualization,

                        the Map of White Supremacy Mob Violence. Similarly, EJI created an extensive
                        dataset of over 4,000 public lynchings based on work done by Tuskegee
                        University and the research of E.M. Beck and Stewart E. Tolnay that
                        compellingly shows the long legacy of terroristic violence in the American
                        south. Nevertheless, decisions made about what counts or does not count as
                        “racial terror violence” made during the data collection phase —
                        namely to exclude the American frontier — ultimately shaped EJI’s visual
                        argument, making it overreach in its claims and thereby creating a narrative
                        around racial violence that excludes other minorities and other geographic
                        locales.

                           sixth step: surveying the latest literature from the small but growing
                           interdisciplinary field of ethical visualization. Surveying this
                           literature allows the researcher to keep abreast of ethical
                           visualization innovations and recommended best practices. The seventh
                           step, pre-visualizing, involves considering the contextual factors
                           around the visualization: normalizing representations of the data;
                           selecting the publishing medium; identifying intended and potential
                           unintended audiences based on that medium; and discerning between
                           visualization formats possible in that medium. When making decisions
                           about the argument produced by the visualization, it is imperative to
                           consider the larger contextual framing and the story that it tells. For
                           instance, in the case of EJI’s Racial Terror Lynchings, the data isn't
                           normalized against census population data. Normalizing the data in this
                           way would show how frequent these lynchings were in a population of
                           people rather than a geographic space, thus showing the relative
                           societal impact of a lynching of two people in a county of 100 rather
                           than 5 people in a county of 10,000.

                        <div class="ptext" id="p36">In considering these contextual factors, the researcher can then select
                           the most appropriate visualization format, creating test visualizations
                           (these are more rudimentary than, and distinct from, alpha prototypes)
                           and performing any necessary re-structuring of the dataset based on
                           findings of this prototyping. In the pre-visualizing step, the selection
                           of visualization format is particularly important. The mechanics and
                           conventions of specific visualization formats contribute to determining
                           meaning. For example, Mercator geographic projections have been
                           criticized for privileging Northern Europe and underemphasizing the
                           Global South [<a class="ref" href="#monmonier2010">Monmonier 2010</a>]. While they receive less
                           attention for their distortional effects, pie charts encourage a
                           comparison between visualized elements as if they make up a unified
                           whole, whether or not they actually do so in reality [<a class="ref" href="#tufte1998">Tufte 1998</a>]. It is not that such visualization formats are
                           by definition unethical to use, but that a critical perspective can
                           unearth the ways in which they limit or close off possibilities of
                           argumentation.

                           have a much smaller audience than they have as web-based documents. This

                           headers, legends and interaction experiences need to be considered. The

                           marker for every person killed, so that their name and details could be
                           uncovered by the viewer. While more visually complex than a choropleth
                           map, as was used in Racial Terror Lynchings, creating individual markers
                           conveys the sheer gravity of the violence while not losing sight of the
                           individuals who suffered at the hands of white supremacy. As the
                           director of Auut Studio, RJ Ramey, explains, 
                           <blockquote>

                                 decision to include every person killed as their own marker on
                                 the map — so that their name could be discovered. I have
                                 received suggestions that a more “efficient”
                                 visualization would have been a choropleth map or graduated
                                 symbol size — and visualizers at EJI and the NYT have utilized
                                 these methods. However, for purposes of respecting the gravity
                                 of the violence and the humanity of the victims, I very much
                                 believed it was most appropriate to provide the audience a
                                 census of the lynching record, not a visual or numerical
                                 analysis.

                           does not show. Effacing the data, along with its assumptions, within the
                           visualization itself, as Map of White Supremacy Mob Violence so
                           admirably does, invites the user to judge the veracity and scope of the
                           data themselves, providing an opportunity for users to build informed
                           trust in the visualized data. Auut Studio makes plain the decisions made
                           during all of these pre-visualization steps, encouraging the user to
                           take a critical stance toward the argument ultimately put forth by the
                           visualization itself. On the other hand, while EJI does provide a link
                           to its full lynching report, which goes into detail about how the
                           dataset was collected and why it was bounded in such a way as to exclude
                           the American frontier, this link stands apart from the visualization
                           itself, buried within the website’s navigation drawer. Moreover, the
                           report does not address the translation of those choices into the
                           rhetorical qualities of the visualization itself, which purports to show
                           the entirety of American Racial Terror Lynchings. As the argument
                           presenting the data, an ethical visualization should provide clear and
                           apparent options for users to investigate sources, so that the user will
                           be able to get a critical sense of the underlying data set. Showing the
                           data effectively equates to showing your work for the user, but it does
                           not necessitate providing the user with what amount to false choices
                           that obfuscate the rhetorical value of the visualization in the first

                           with an alpha prototype, ending with a final visualization, and
                           including rounds of user testing with intended and unintended audiences
                           after each round of iteration. While user testing is not commonplace in
                           the digital humanities, it is a long-established practice in the allied
                           fields of computer science and visual communication design [<a class="ref" href="#nielsen1993">Nielsen 1993</a>]

                           ensures the research mitigates harm to audiences that may result from
                           drawing associations and conclusions that are false, and that the
                           researcher could not predict. Lastly, the ninth step involves publishing
                           the visualization, the culmination of a thorough and considered ethical
                           research practice. Finally, in the interest of reproducibility and data
                           interrogation, it is vital to publish alongside the visualization its
                           underlying datasets or, in the case of lacking the requisite rights, to
                           provide ample documentation and citation of those datasets.

                     so doing, it presents an accessible, nuanced and compelling account of America’s
                     sordid history of lynching those on the margins. Likewise, by following our
                     process, readers can create similarly critical and self-effacing visualizations
                     that make apparent the argument, assumptions, and inherent flaws that animate
                     their digital humanities projects.
