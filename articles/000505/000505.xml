          <p><emph>The DataScapes Project</emph> is an exploration of how
            Augmented Reality objects can be used as constituents for Landscape
            Architecture. Using Stephen Ramsay’s Screwmeneutics and Harold
            Innis' Oral Tradition as our theoretical points of departure, the
            project integrated the products of Data Art – the visualisation and
            sonification of data – as the constituents for our two works:
            <emph>The Five Senses and Emergence</emph>. <emph>The Five Senses</emph>
            was the product of protein data, while <emph>Emergence</emph> was
            generated using text from the King James version of the Holy Bible.
            In this exploratory treatment, we present the methods used to
            generate and display our two pieces. We further present anecdotal,
            qualitative evidence of viewer feedback, and use that as a basis to
            consider the ethics, challenges and opportunities that a future AR
            Landscape Architecture will present for scholars in the Digital
            Humanities.</p>

        <div><head>Our Aim: A new form of landscape architecture</head>
        <p>There is a singular privilege that accompanies living in this first century
        of digital computation: the opportunity to discern what it means. The task is
        nowhere near complete. We know, or think we know, that computation is having
        a bearing on our capacities to locate pattern, create and replicate pattern,
        and disseminate pattern. There are even some who believe its advent will
        ultimately impinge on the trajectories of natural and human history. Welcome to
        the Noosphere <ptr target="#teilhard1959"/><note>The <term>noosphere</term> is
        a philosophical concept developed and popularized by the <ref
        target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biogeochemistry">biogeochemist</ref> Vladimir
        Vernadsky, and the French philosopher and Jesuit priest Pierre Teilhard
        de Chardin. See: <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noosphere">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noosphere</ref></note>. The ambition of this exercise
        in meaning-making is relatively more modest. We seek to explore how computation
        can be used to support the human penchant to adorn one's surrounds. More
        specifically, our purpose here is to explore how Augmented Reality (AR) Objects
        can be used as constituents for Landscape Architecture. In the aftermath
        of Ivan Sutherland's foundational work in the late 1960s establishing the
        field of computer graphics, the prospect that users might seek to integrate
        computer-generated form with their surrounds became a plausible one, one
        realized in the decades since via the medium of Augmented, and now Mixed,
        Reality <ptr target="#acm1988"/>. In the ensuing decades, AR has emerged as an actual or
        potential support for multiple fields, including education, construction,
        engineering, computer gaming and firefighting. In this contribution, we present
        the efforts of <emph>The DataScapes Project</emph> to explore how AR's capacity
        to situate and register digital content might be leveraged for artistic
        purposes: Augmented Reality content, combined with constituents from Data Art,
        can be leveraged as raw materials for Landscape Architecture.</p>
        </div>
        <div><head>Previous Work</head>
        <p>The first challenge faced by members of the project was the fundamental
        one of determining how to proceed. We were presented with a blank canvass
        and had to select the location and method that, so to speak, would constitute
        our "paint." Choosing a location proved to be the more straightforward
        of the two decisions. We were looking for a readily accessible space at
        one of our two universities, a locale that at once presented a sense of
        grand scale and a sense of enclosure. We were looking for a tract of land
        that would serve as a frame and a complement for our AR artwork. Based
        on that criteria, we selected the traffic circle at Brock University in
        St. Catharines, Ontario Canada. The circle is 140 metres in diameter, is
        centrally located on campus, and until recently was bounded by willow trees.</p>
        <p>Selecting the method and content that would constitute the matter of our
        creation, by contrast, proved more difficult. To be sure, there were multiple
        domains of art that anticipated – in part – what we were seeking to do. The
        fields of Landscape Art, Earthworks, and Digital Art, through their creation of
        anamorph and <emph>trompe l'oeil</emph> artworks, for example, were suggestive
        of what an AR-based Landscape Architecture might accomplish. But the three
        fields also differed significantly in their practice from what we were aiming
        to accomplish. To start, while Landscape Art and Earthworks both make location
        a central constituent of artistic production, artists in both fields sculpt
        material objects – constituents from a local landscape – to generate artistic
        form, not digital content <ptr target="#thompson2014"/> <ptr target="#herrington2017"/>. In the domain of
        Digital Art, artists such as Joe Crossley have sought to conflate the digital
        with the material by transforming static empty spaces – generally building
        surfaces – into multi-media surfaces using projection mapping. The content that
        is disseminated, however, is 2D, not 3D <ptr target="#crossley2017"/>.</p>
        <p>Landscape Architecture, the primary field to which we sought to contribute,
        also did not present an obvious theoretical frame of reference, method or
        aesthetic to assist our efforts. One dimension of the problem here is that
        practitioners still tend to view digital tools and content as instruments
        to support the design of physical landscapes. A second problem is that the
        field's ontology of place is not sufficiently broad to encompass the fusion
        of digital and physical that we sought to construct. Since the Renaissance,
        landscape designers and gardeners, historian John Dixon Hunt argues, have
        typically divided space into three constructs or "natures," with first nature
        referring to wilderness, second nature to cultivated land, and third nature
        to landscapes shaped with aesthetic intent <ptr target="#thompson2014" loc="38"/>. Some designers
        suggest that Landscape Architects should consider adding a fourth nature to
        the list, one encompassing reclaimed landscapes and restored habitats, while we
        in turn wondered if we had stumbled on a fifth: landscapes containing digital
        annotations, objects or complements.</p>
        <p>A third issue centered on the field's self-definition. While Landscape
        Architecture traces its origins to Landscape Gardening, the profession
        has maintained a complicated relationship with the arts over the course
        of the 20th century. Then, many designers, particularly in
        the wake of the profession's <emph>1966 Declaration of Concern</emph>
        <note><ref target="https://www.lafoundation.org/who-we-are/values/declaration-of-concern">https://www.lafoundation.org/who-we-are/values/declaration-of-concern</ref></note>,
        suggested the focus of landscape architects should be on environmental
        conservation, not the translation of artistic or philosophical trends, be it
        transcendentalism or post-modernism, into landscape form. Other practitioners
        have taken the stance that the primary focus of the field should be on
        design, here understood as landscape construction that is optimized for the
        needs of a site's visitors and users. The artistic ambitions of the architect
        are deemed to be a secondary concern, if they are considered at all. On the
        50th anniversary of the 1966 statement, however, the Landscape
        Architecture Foundation published a <emph>New Landscape Declaration</emph>,
        one in which architects called for a renewed emphasis on aesthetics <ptr target="#landscape2017"/>.
        One reason for the call was the realization
        that aesthetic concerns are not a luxury: poor design of buildings and
        cityscapes – here understood as the mindless prioritization of utility over
        beauty or meaning – has had a deleterious social impact. Landscape architects
        have also stressed artistic concerns because of a widespread sense that
        the field has never been a site of aesthetic innovation, and that it has
        missed important opportunities, such as the emergence of avant-garde art in
        the early 20th century
        <ptr target="#corner2017"/>
        <ptr target="#fajardo2017"/>
        <ptr target="#jellicoe1995"/>
        <ptr target="#thompson2014"/>. While the field has not been oblivious to important
        trends such as Modernism and Post-Modernism, "there is surprisingly little
        discussion," Richard Weller writes, "of what contemporary landscape aesthetics
        are and what they might yet become" <ptr target="#weller2017" loc="10"/>.</p>
        <p>Given this lack of definition, our team opted for an exploratory approach
        to inform the design of our project, one akin in the Digital Humanities to
        Stephen Ramsay's Screwmeneutics and Kevin Ferguson's Digital Surrealism. In his
        seminal essay, Ramsay proposes a method of scholarly activity that eschews the
        conduct of what he refers to as the "search." The "search" in this context is
        the practice of identifying a canon – the state-of-the field for a given domain
        of research – and then identifying a gap in that same canon. As scholars, we
        contribute to our respective fields by conducting research to fill that gap.
        But there are times, Ramsay writes, when this formulaic approach does not
        work, particularly when the researcher is attempting something new. How can
        the "search" "help me find what I'm looking for," he writes, "when (a) I don't
        know what's here and (b) I don't know what I'm looking for?" <ptr target="#ramsay2014" loc="115"/>.
        For Ramsay, the answer to this dilemma is to engage in what he refers
        to as "browsing." Drawing on the ideas of Roland Barthes, Ramsay proposes
        that we engage in the construction of the <emph>writerly text</emph>. In
        contrast to the <emph>readerly text</emph>, which involves a passive form of
        reading, engagement with a <emph>writerly text</emph> presupposes a process
        of composition, an immersion of the reader into the flux of existence, and
        initiation of a process of discovery and systematization: the connection by the
        reader of the content from the given text with a context, be it another item
        of content, a person, or a compelling idea. The theory of the <emph>writerly
        text</emph>, Barthes writes, "is a practice (that of the writer), not a
        science, a method, a research ... this theory can produce only theoreticians
        or practitioners, not specialists (critics, researchers, professors,
        students)" <ptr target="#ramsay2014" loc="119"/>.</p>
        <p>Via this process, Ramsay argues, the humanist defines a path through
        culture, thereby providing the Humanist – or, if you will, the Screwmeneuticist
        – with perspective, the platform necessary to support discovery, desire and
        questioning. One useful first step in defining such a pathway was undertaken
        by David Ferguson in his recent visual analysis of Disney animations, where
        he brings his artistic artefact of interest – the film – into relation
        with the concept of complex. Any artefact of interest, he suggests, can be
        dissected and its components re-articulated into new combinations. However,
        while useful, Ferguson's method for applying Screwmeneutics is not appropriate
        for our purposes for two reasons. First, its aim is ultimately analytic,
        not generative. It seeks, like all Structuralist methodologies, to locate
        the intrinsic properties – the hidden archetypal structures – of a given
        art-form. Its purpose is not scenario exploration. It does not seek to conduct
        an exercise exploring the potential ways an art-form <emph>might</emph>
        exist. It seeks instead to define the way a given form <emph>already</emph>
        exists. Second, and by extension, Ferguson's methodology, and structuralist
        methodologies in general, are ones that collapse the dimension of time. They
        presuppose objects of analysis that operate in a synchronic fashion
        <ptr target="#ferguson2017"/>
        <ptr target="#merrell1975"/>. We, by contrast, were seeking to create Augmented
        Reality, multi-media landscape complexes that could incorporate the dimension
        of time, and more specifically would incorporate temporal art forms such as
        music. Our purpose, in the end, was to generate an artwork that would serve, in
        Seymour Papert's words, as an object-to-think-with, and in Barthes' words, as a
        <emph>writerly text</emph> <ptr target="#papert1980"/>. Given that we were aiming to create
        something that was new, we sought to construct an artefact that would provide
        definition, suggest potential, and present questions and connections for future
        artists and humanists to explore.</p>
        </div>
        <div><head>Our Theory: The Oral Tradition of Harold Innis</head>
        <p>For these reasons, we opted to employ a different Screwmeneutic method to
        conceive and develop our landscape complex, namely Harold Innis' concept of
        the Oral Tradition. For those unfamiliar with his work, Harold Innis was a
        media theorist and one of the founders of the Toronto School of Communication.
        Between 1940 and 1952 he produced a set of works, including <emph>Empire
        and Communications</emph> and <emph>The Bias of Communication</emph> that
        were dedicated to exploring the physical, formal and cognitive effects of
        communication media. A political economist by training, Innis turned to the
        study of communications in 1940 because he perceived, not surprisingly, that
        the world was falling apart. How was it possible, he asked in the final decade
        of his life, that the world, after enduring the insanity and carnage of the
        First World War, should so readily plunge itself into a Second? The answer, he
        believed, was to be found in the grand sweep of global history. What factors,
        he wondered, enabled societies to thrive? And what, by contrast, led to their
        dysfunction and eventual collapse? His lived experience, combined with his
        studies of the past, convinced him that human collectives functioned much
        like biological organisms. The vitality, adaptability, indeed the sanity,
        of institutions, nations and empires were dependent on the environmental
        circumstances in which they found themselves. Since the inputs and outputs of
        human-environmental interaction were largely mediated by communication devices,
        Innis set high store on their importance in global history. The political
        and cultural periodization of history, Innis believed, could be correlated
        with the invention or adoption of new communication technologies. So could
        the pathologies that afflicted cultures. There was a price to be paid for
        the unthinking use of technology, and in his writings Innis pointed to two:
        cognitive rigidity and cognitive flux
        <ptr target="#innis1946"/> <ptr target="#bonnett2017"/>. Technology
        historically had produced pathological forms of groupthink in which cultures
        either focused on the wrong thing (due to cognitive rigidity, or bias), or
        no thing at all (due to cognitive flux). With its judgment impaired by one
        of the two pathologies, a given culture would lose its ability to discern
        the opportunities and threats latent in its environment, fail to innovate,
        fail to compete and as a result fall prey to its competitors

        </note>,
        Innis believed it was possible to construct a culture that retained its vitality
        and resilience via an ethic he referred to as the Oral Tradition. The Oral
        Tradition, as Innis conceived it, was not a call to forsake writing and
        adopt pre-literate Greek communication practices that relied on memory
        and voice. Instead, like Barthes, Innis called on his readers to adopt an
        <emph>active stance</emph> toward knowledge, a willingness to alter constructs
        and formalisms to meet the needs and experience of the present. Such a
        stance, Innis argued, had enabled the Greeks to make their innovations in
        theology, philosophy, science, politics and art. The Oral Tradition was also
        distinguished by its reliance on linguistic and aesthetic formalisms that
        were characterized by internal complexity and hierarchy. The power of such
        formalisms lay in their latent potential. They contained multiple constituents
        that could be arranged and re-arranged at will, enabling artists to explore new
        aesthetic constructs, and philosophers new intellectual possibilities, through
        the separation, interpolation and translation of content. In its essence,
        it was a serio-comic method, one that enabled Greece to shift its conception
        of nature from one based on myth to one shaped by science
        <ptr target="#bonnett2013" loc="209–217"/>.<note><ref target="http://podcasts.torontoreviewofbooks.com/2013.02/Bonnet.mp3">http://podcasts.torontoreviewofbooks.com/2013.02/Bonnet.mp3</ref></note></p>
        <p>A third feature of the Oral Tradition, one deriving from its commitment
        to active manipulation of knowledge, was its use of multi-modal forms of
        expression. The reason Innis named his communication ethic the Oral Tradition
        in the first place was due to the influence of linguist Edward Sapir, who
        noted the "formal richness" of ancient communication practices, practices that
        contained "a latent luxuriance of expression that eclipses anything known to
        modern civilization" <ptr target="#innis1950" loc="8–9"/>.
        Such luxuriance of expression, and with
        it enhanced expressive potential, could be purchased in the present by creating
        formalisms that combined written, vocal and visual forms of representation.
        Such forms in principle presented possibilities for information visualization
        – which would assist in the location of significant environmental patterns –
        and information translation – which would enhance viewer understanding of the
        construct's content <ptr target="#bonnett2013" loc="166–181"/> <ptr target="#innis1946"/>.
        Referring to Italian
        artistic practice in the 15th and 16th centuries, for example, Innis noted
        Andrea Alciati's invention of the emblem book, a construct in which poetry,
        "one of the oldest arts, was combined with engraving, one of the newest" [Innis
        2015, 101] The rationale for so doing was provided by Francis Bacon, who argued
        that emblems "reduce intellectual conceptions to sensible images and that which
        is sensible strikes the memory and is more easily imprinted on it than that
        which is intellectual'" <ptr target="#innis2015" loc="101"/> <ptr target="#bacon1654"/>.</p>
        <p>The commitment to multi-modality in turn presented a fourth characteristic
        of the Oral Tradition: a commitment to integrate both spatial and temporal
        forms of representation. Because of its present and historic relationship with
        the art of poetry, Innis argued, the Oral Tradition "implied a concern with
        time and religion. 'The artist represents <emph>coexistence in space</emph>,
        the poet <emph>succession in time</emph>' (Lessing at the University of Berlin,
        1810)" <ptr target="#innis1951" loc="102"/>. In his own economic work, Innis would apply this
        characteristic of the Oral Tradition by interpolating time series of price
        data with maps to track the emergent patterns of North American economic
        history, years before the practice become common via Geographic Information
        Systems <ptr target="#bonnett2013"/>. The Oral Tradition was finally characterized by
        what in modern parlance can be characterized as an open-source ethic, one
        in which content and form was routinely lifted from one work and integrated
        into another. "The great epics," Innis writes, "were probably developed
        out of lays constantly retold and amplified. Old ballads were replaced
        by combinations of a number of episodes into a unity of action. The epic
        was characterized by extreme complexity and unity"
        <ptr target="#innis1950" loc="72"/>.

        <div><head>Our Mode and Matter: Data Art, Protein and Text</head>
        <p>In its essence then, the Innis' Oral Tradition is a method for intellectual
        inquiry and aesthetic innovation that rests on a willingness to explore the
        possibility spaces afforded by complex, spatio-temporal, multi-modal form, and
        to reconstitute that form through the integration of content brought in from
        the outside. To assist our exploration of the possibility space associated
        with digital Landscape Architecture, we opted to use the methods and modes
        associated with Data Art. Also referred to as Information Art, Data Art rests
        on the premise that the world is replete with forms that can be harvested for
        artistic purposes. It chiefly emerged from scientific efforts to use sight and
        sound analogues as a method to locate significant patterns and relationships
        in large data sets. From that effort, multiple intriguing genres of art have
        emerged, particularly in the field of music, such as DNA music <ptr target="#gena1995"/>,
        protein music <ptr target="#dunn1999"/>, microbial and meteorological music
        <ptr target="#larsen2013"/>, and even a music of the spheres, music compositions
        derived from astronomical data <ptr target="#ballora2013"/>. With Data Art, we
        were presented in principle with a method that would enable us to translate a
        given data set at once into visual and sonic form.</p>
        <p>Once we had a mode for our AR landscape, the next, more difficult step was
        determining its matter, the data that would provide the pattern, the source
        of serial distinctions for our artworks. The team's decision-making here
        was determined by the following factors: our decision to produce two works,
        contingent circumstance, and the intellectual interest of project team members.
        The contingent circumstance centered on our need to locate sonification
        software. While Bill Ralph, a mathematician, and Mark Anderson, a computer
        scientist, respectively possessed the skills required to visualize our data,
        we had no one with the requisite ability to translate raw data into musical
        form. After a fairly protracted search (there is not a lot of proprietary or
        open-source software dedicated to supporting the generation of Data Art) we
        were able to locate <emph>MusicWonk</emph>, an application developed by John
        Dunn, a pioneer in computer music and art since the 1970s<emph>.</emph> While
        <emph>MusicWonk</emph> is purportedly able to able to work with any data set,
        the software specializes in supporting the creation of Genetic Music from DNA
        and Protein Data. The application's website provides tutorials and links to
        multiple libraries of genetic sequences, including the one we used: the U.S.
        National Institutes of Health GenBank <ptr target="#algorithmic2015"/>. Based on this
        specialization, we opted to use protein data and to create an artwork called
        <emph>The Five Senses</emph>, a composition of five movements which would
        respectively be constructed from protein data supporting Sight, Smell, Touch,
        Taste and Hearing in humans.</p>
        <p>Our data selection was also prompted by the team's interest in the
        construct of change known as self-organization or emergent change, a ubiquitous
        phenomenon in the natural and social sciences studied by the Science of
        Complexity <ptr target="#waldrop1992"/> <ptr target="#gell1994"/>.
        It was also prompted by the
        observation of scholars such as Werner Jaeger and Harold Innis that different
        domains of human activity – such as science, philosophy and theology – often
        produce constructs of change that are very similar <ptr target="#innis1950" loc="93"/>.
        It was
        finally prompted by the observation of John Bonnett that a number of parallels
        could be found between the core concepts of emergent change – such as positive
        feedback, the governance of formal cause, and the teleological governance of
        system attractors – and the philosophy of history associated with the Christian
        Bible. Economists, for example, often characterize positive feedback as the
        Matthew Effect, given that the process of cumulative change it describes
        matches the dynamic Jesus describes in the Parable of the Talents, where the
        rich became richer and poor poorer <ptr target="#rigney2010"/>. Given these parallels, we
        opted to create a second work simply titled <emph>Emergence</emph> based on
        source text from the Bible. Like <emph>The Five Senses</emph>, we planned a
        composition featuring five movements, with each piece named after a constituent
        concept of self-organization, respectively "Emergence," "Differentiation,"
        "Regulation," "Selection" and "Attractor." Each piece, in turn, would rest
        on data taken from the King James version of the Bible, text that provided
        narrative or mythic analogues to the concepts of positive feedback, formal
        cause, and so on.</p>
        <p>With the terms of composition settled, the team's next step was to
        identify the specific data sets we wanted to use for each composition and then
        begin the process of sonification. The proteins selected for <emph>The Five
        Senses</emph> are shown in <ref target="#figure01">Figure 1</ref>,
        while the biblical texts selected for
        <emph>Emergence</emph> are shown in <ref target="#figure02">Figure 2</ref>. The process of sonification for
        <emph>The Five Senses</emph> began by harvesting the letter data associated
        with each protein record, such as that shown in <ref target="#figure03">Figure 3</ref>. In many ways, NIH
        protein records resemble what any researcher might find in a library catalogue
        for a book listing, with metadata describing authors, key words, versions
        and the like. However, NIH records also feature a sequence of letters where
        one typically would find Library of Congress or equivalent subject headings
        describing a book's contents. Those letters collectively constitute the protein
        described in the given record. In <ref target="#figure03">Figure 3</ref>, the highlighted letter sequence
        refers to the amino acids making Medium Wave sensitive opsin 1 (Homo sapiens),
        a protein contained in green cone photopigment that we used to generate
        the work <emph>Sight</emph>. These letter sequences provided the patterned
        sequences that would be translated into notes for <emph>Sight</emph>. Similar
        letter sequences generated the notation for the four remaining movements of
        <emph>The Five Senses</emph>, while the biblical passages provided the initial
        basis for <emph>Emergence</emph>.</p>

        <div><head>Our Method of Sonification</head>
        <p>The process of sonification for both compositions was initiated in
        <emph>MusicWonk</emph> first by converting every letter from every dataset
        into a counterpart number, with A equaling 1, B equaling 2, Z equaling 26,
        and so on. Once an entire letter set from a given dataset had been translated,
        the software then aligned the numeric series with a specified music scale,
        producing a raw music string, as shown in <ref target="#figure04">Figure 4</ref>. From that point, the
        project's two music composers – Erin MacAfee and Amy Legault – had two methods
        of composition and two modes of operating with their source data open to
        them. The first method of composition – selected by neither – was to use the
        algorithmic method of music composition supported by <emph>MusicWonk</emph>.
        There, the raw music string is transformed by feeding it through a set of
        components that control features such as tempo, chords, instrumentation and the
        like. The process, shown in <ref target="#figure05">Figure 5</ref>, is akin to creating an algorithm using a
        visual programming language, or creating an electronic circuit.</p>
        <figure xml:id="figure04">
          <head>MusicWonk is shown here generating raw music string from protein data</head>
          <graphic url="resources/images/figure04.jpeg"/>
        </figure>
        <figure xml:id="figure05">
          <head>MusicWonk interface for algorithmic composition of protein music</head>
          <graphic url="resources/images/figure05.jpeg"/>
        </figure>
        <p>The second method – selected by both – required the two to export the
        raw music string to a *.midi file, and then open the exported file in
        <emph>Finale</emph>, a music composition software package. The appeal of
        <emph>Finale</emph> for Legault and MacAfee is that it presented methods
        for music notation that were familiar to them, most notably by featuring an
        interface and tools that supported viewing and direct manipulation of music
        string notation. With <emph>Finale</emph>, the two were able to alter note
        duration, inscribe chords of their own devising, and repair aberrations in
        pitch.</p>
        <p><emph>Finale</emph> also enabled each composer to determine how she wanted
        to use the musical sequences inherited from her source data. MacAfee's approach
        in <emph>The Five Senses</emph> was minimalist. While she was willing to alter
        select attributes in her file, such as rhythm, instrumentation and the duration
        of individual notes, she was not inclined to alter the tonal sequence inherited
        from her datasets. Legault's approach, by contrast, was more interventionist.
        Instead of viewing her inherited notation series as a fixed object, she
        opted to view her raw music strings as libraries from which she could splice
        identified musical components. The appropriated sections were – much like the
        lays in Innis' Oral Tradition – placed in new sequences and were integrated
        into established musical genres selected by Legault, such as the fugue.</p>
        </div>
        <div><head>Our Methods for Visualization</head>
        <p>While Legault and MacAfee were generating their respective sonifications,
        team members Bill Ralph, a mathematician, and Mark Anderson, a computer
        scientist, were working on their visual correlates. Ralph is also an
        algorithmic artist, one who describes his work as "an attempt to make a
        visual connection with the enormous complexity and unity that lies within
        the rich mathematical objects that inspire my images" <ptr target="#ralph2018"/>. He is
        particularly interested in mathematical objects that can generate chaotic,
        dynamic systems, and has used them to generate dynamic and static works
        distinguished by their complex topologies and colour. From the standpoint of
        this project, Ralph's approach was ideal because it often relied on source
        data to drive the generation of a given work. For <emph>The Five Senses</emph>,
        he used proprietary algorithms driven by two inputs. The first source of
        pattern was the set of distinctions obtained via a sequential progression
        through the data. The second source was the set of relationships detected by
        the algorithm between different, non-proximate strings contained in the data.
        Both were leveraged to provide a visual focus to our landscape composition.
        For <emph>Emergence</emph>, Mark Anderson used a different approach. Instead
        of deriving his images from the data, he selected Screen Vector Graphic images
        that related conceptually with concepts such as <emph>Differentiation</emph>
        and <emph>Attractor</emph>, and then used project data and the application
        <emph>NodeBox</emph> to animate each image and prompt transformations in
        colour.</p>
        </div>
        <div><head><emph>The DataScapes Project</emph> AR Set</head>
        <p>With the sonification and visualization of our two works complete, two
        further tasks remained, the first being the construction and overlay of a
        digital set to display <emph>The Five Senses</emph> and <emph>Emergence</emph>.
        Given that we conceived our two works as Landscape Architecture, and that the
        Brock Traffic Circle – our selected first venue – was 140 metres in diameter,
        the parameters of our project mandated that the components of our digital set
        be relatively large in size for the visualizations to be observable and for
        them in turn to serve as artistic complements to the surrounding landscape.
        That need was further compounded by the presence of the physical statue, known
        as She-Wolf, situated in the midst of the circle, and the scaffolding and
        the four 4.6 metre-high QR code signs we installed to activate and situate
        our digital works. All three objects are shown in <ref target="#figure06">Figure 6</ref>, and all three
        required effacing by the digital set to prevent their disruption of the
        impact of our AR Landscape works. Accordingly, the set shown in
        <ref target="#figure07">Figure 7</ref> was
        designed by John Bonnett using <emph>SketchUp</emph> to display <emph>The
        Five Senses</emph> and <emph>Emergence</emph>. The set is bounded by eight
        9-metre-high monoliths, with the front of each monolith displaying a graphic
        representing the title of the movement currently under display.
        <ref target="#figure08">Figure 8</ref>, for
        example, shows the graphics for the movement <emph>Touch</emph> on the left and
        <emph>Differentiation</emph> on the right. The centre of the set is composed
        of two components. The cylinder at the base is used to cover the statue,
        scaffold and QR code signs mentioned above. Floating above it is a 9 metre
        object used to display the given movement's visualization. For <emph>The Five
        Senses</emph>, a cube was used to display the artwork, while a sphere was used
        for <emph>Emergence</emph>.</p>
        </div>
        <div><head><emph>The DataScapes Project</emph> Android App</head>
        <p>Our final task was the creation of an Android app to support user
        viewing of the two works via a tablet or phone. Our requirements for the
        <emph>DataScapes</emph> app were straightforward. We wanted to simultaneously
        see and hear the respective visualizations and sonifications associated with
        each movement. We further wanted multiple users to the site to experience
        the performance in sync. If one viewer was viewing and hearing the movement
        <emph>Taste</emph>, we wanted their counterparts to see and hear the same thing
        at the same time. We also wanted user entry into the experience to be simple,
        involving little more than user activation of the app, and direction of his</p>

        <p>or her device camera at the QR signs situated in the middle of the
        traffic circle. The app only worked at a distance of 6 metres or less from
        the QR code signs, to prevent unsafe viewing of the exhibit by, for example,
        drivers circumnavigating the circle. The <emph>DataScapes</emph> application
        was developed using <emph>Vuforia</emph>, an SDK (Software Development
        Kit) designed to facilitate the development of AR applications on mobile
        devices. Leveraging 3D objects, planar surfaces and patterns situated in the
        environment, <emph>Vuforia</emph> is able to determine the user's position and
        camera orientation relative to objects such as the project's QR Code signs,
        and in turn to situate and register computer-generated 3D objects. These
        capabilities enabled team programmers Joe Bolton and Mark Anderson to fulfill
        another requirement for the <emph>DataScapes</emph> app: the capacity to move
        around and within the artwork. <emph>Vuforia</emph>'s capabilities, combined
        with GPS and gyroscopic data, enabled the <emph>DataScapes</emph> app to
        track the movement of viewers, and in response to change the orientation and
        rendering of displayed objects in real-time, to make our digital objects seem
        as if they were integrated and locked into the natural landscape.</p>

        <div><head>Results</head>
        <p>The final results of our efforts are shown in <ref target="#figure09">Figure 9</ref>
        and <ref target="#figure10">Figure 10</ref>, along
        with a video showing the operation of the app in <ref target="#figure11">Figure 11</ref>
        (For an earlier
        treatment of <emph>The DataScapes Project</emph>, see Bonnett et al. 2018).
        The first version of the <emph>DataScapes</emph> app in our estimation was
        a partial success, both technically, and with respect to audience reception.
        With respect to the app's functionality, our initial trials of the two works
        were hindered by two difficulties. The first and perhaps most disappointing
        setback was the inadequate processing power of the two Asus 12" tablets we
        had on hand for viewing the display. The tablets did not have the capacity
        to simultaneously render and register our set while simultaneously displaying
        our data visualizations in dynamic form. Despite our best efforts to find
        work-around solutions on site, we had to settle for the necessary compromise of
        presenting Bill Ralph's and Mark Anderson's respective visualizations in static
        form. A second difficulty centered on the stability of the set. While the first
        version of the app adequately anchored our set to the Brock traffic circle,
        several of its constituents, most notably its monoliths, tended to vibrate or
        jitter in a way that was at once distracting and unpleasant. These deficiencies
        have been partially remedied in the second and third versions of our app. Our
        intention in these two iterations was to develop portable versions that would
        display <emph>The Five Senses</emph> and <emph>Emergence</emph> indoors, while
        remedying some of the performance failures identified in the first. Version
        two, shown in the animation featured in <ref target="#figure12">Figure 12</ref>, was designed to support Mark
        Anderson for an Edge Hill University lecture dedicated to the Art of Computing,
        and presents the project as a wall display. Version three, shown in <ref target="#figure13">Figure 13</ref>,
        transformed the orientation and scale of the project yet again, by adapting
        it for display as a table-top installation. In both, we were able to better
        stabilize the display of our set. And in both, we were able to add some dynamism to
        the display, albeit by introducing movement into the set rather than our
        visualizations. Both iterations required changes to the application, most
        notably by changing the way <emph>Vuforia</emph> searched for targets and
        changing the orientation of the 3D content it displayed in relation to those
        targets. In addition, we also removed the initial application's use of GPS
        tracking code, as that functionality was specifically designed to support
        the geo-location of 3D content on the Brock traffic circle, and further
        designed to hinder the display of content to users not on campus. Finally,
        we reduced the size of QR code displays used with versions 2 and 3 of the
        <emph>DataScapes</emph> app and designed each version to generate displays
        proportional in size to the QR code target. Via this step, the user can print
        a code on a piece of paper and generate a display proportional in size to the
        underlying table.</p>

        <p>As for audience assessment, we report here anecdotal evidence gathered
        during our first trial. Our rationale for this approach as opposed to more
        extensive and expensive methods used in Human Computer Interaction (HCI)
        and elsewhere is due, in part, to concerns regarding the reliability of user
        assessment methods pioneered in cognitive psychology and HCI. These methods
        have been drawn into question due to, on a general level, the replicability
        crisis in the social sciences and, more specifically, widespread criticisms
        of the two fields pointing to errors in statistical method, small sample sizes
        and large confidence intervals
        <ptr target="#lundh2019"/>
        <ptr target="#greenberg1992"/>
        <ptr target="#cairns2007"/>
        <ptr target="#gigerenzer2004"/>
        <ptr target="#cohen1994"/>. Putting the matter simply,
        user assessment via this route seemed to impose a good deal of effort for
        results that did not necessarily convince.</p>
        <p>For the type of exploratory exercise that we were pursuing, it seemed more
        useful to take a craft-based approach to user assessment. In fields such as
        web design, argues Gerd Waloszek, a former interface designer with SAP, the
        metric for success for a given design is not its authentication via an HCI
        analysis of design <emph>consumers</emph>. The real metric rests on whether
        other design <emph>producers</emph> copy the design, making it a convention
        <ptr target="#waloszek2003"/>. In a different design context, Elizabeth Eisenstein and
        Hellmut Lehmann-Haupt note a similar process in the history of the print
        book. Through experimentation and appropriation of designs from competitors,
        printers such as Peter Schoeffer collectively generated the conventions of
        the modern book, such as tables of contents, title pages, running heads and
        footnotes <ptr target="#eisenstein1979"/> <ptr target="#lehmann1950"/>. A craft-based approach,
        then, suggests that the "success" of our effort will depend on whether other
        artists, landscape architects and digital humanists choose to emulate our
        approach to landscape design, because they like it, and because they believe
        it will induce a favorable reaction from their respective audiences. The best
        we can do is report what we learned from our viewers and suggest the questions
        and implications that stem from those observations. We will be "successful"
        if colleagues choose to mimic those efforts and address the questions we have
        raised.</p>
        <p>Based on that framework, we noted two classes of respondents – general
        viewers and artists – and important questions that arose from each. General
        viewers for the most part found our various pieces engaging, reporting an
        intrinsic fascination with the fact that data, particularly protein data,
        could be translated into art forms, particularly music. That feedback raised
        an important question for us, however. Is Data Art intrinsically compelling on
        its own? Is it capable of generating an intellectual or affective response from
        viewers without annotation, or must it be presented with an accompanying spoken
        or written context to maintain viewer interest? This is, of course, not a new
        question in the history of art and Landscape Architecture, where practitioners
        continue to argue whether art should attempt to communicate a concept or
        message – such as the need for environmental sustainability – or instead focus
        on generating an emotional response from viewers <ptr target="#thompson2014"/>. A related
        question is whether artists and Landscape Architects can generate the sensory
        "languages," be it visual, sonic, olfactory or something else, required to
        successfully communicate the artist's message to an audience without textual
        assistance.</p>
        <p>The response of artists was, perhaps not surprisingly, more searching and
        more critical. While most viewers found the project's content and approach
        very interesting, some took exception to our temporary appropriation of
        the Brock traffic circle (we used it for one week), particularly since it
        already contained a physical statue that was surrounded by the project's
        scaffolding and QR codes. One artist deemed the metal framing and the statue's
        digital effacement problematic. Another deemed it a violation. This feedback
        raised fascinating ethical and political questions for us. To be sure, the
        infrastructure we constructed around the physical <emph>She-Wolf</emph> statute
        did hinder proper viewing of the statue. Whether it constituted a violation
        depends on your point of view. Until artists raised the issue with us, the
        construction of the scaffolding and QR codes prompted no concern from project
        participants, nor did it for the university officials who granted us permission
        to use the space. We meant no disrespect. It was not our intention to make a
        comment on the statue, nor to damage it. But some artists did see our temporary
        occupation of the space as an unacceptable abridgement on the statue's
        integrity and the sculptor Ilan Averbuch's rights.</p>
        <p>One response to these concerns would be to note that the scaffolding and
        QR codes will not be a permanent component of AR Land Architecture, or more
        generally, AR-based artforms in future. We used them because current technology
        requires their use to situate and register content. In future, artists will be
        able to use RTK GPS (Real-time Kinematic Geographic Positioning System) data
        to position content with centimetre and even millimetre level accuracy. That
        expedient will resolve the issue of the art form's physical intrusion into a
        given space, but not its digital annotation. Is it ethical for one artist to
        use digital methods to efface, comment upon, add to, mock, or alter the context
        of a physical artwork created by another, even if the digital annotation is
        not visible to the naked eye? To that ethical question we can add a political
        one: who gets to add that annotation? The complexity and sensitivity of this
        question was anticipated in 2017 in New York when the statue <emph>Fearless
        Girl</emph> (sculpted by Kristen Visbal) was placed in proximity to the statue
        <emph>Charging Bull,</emph> a work situated on Broadway and long associated
        with Wall Street and the city's financial district. To many, <emph>Fearless
        Girl</emph> presented an important message of female empowerment.
        <emph>Charging Bull</emph>'s sculptor Arturo Di Modica, however, was outraged,
        arguing that <emph>Fearless Girl</emph>'s proximity and positioning transformed
        the meaning of his statue, from one symbolizing prosperity and strength, to
        that of villain <ptr target="#dobnik2017"/> <ptr target="#mettler2017"/>.
        The controversy raised multiple
        questions, ones that we now face with our project. When an artist makes an
        intrusion into a space, does that space become sacrosanct? Artists have long
        made interventions into spaces that they deem to be playful, even provocative.
        Are those intrusions to be exempted from three-dimensional annotations
        that some will label as legitimate super-positions or rejoinders, others as
        graffiti, and others as outrageous violations? Who gets to decide the issue?
        These issues will become increasingly central as AR becomes a ubiquitous
        communication medium.</p>

        <div><head>Discussion and Conclusion</head>
        <p>In addition to the questions posed above, what other observations and
        questions might we offer to conclude this exercise in Screwmeneutics via the
        Oral Tradition? In our view, the best way to finish would be to explicitly
        address the questions that constitute the heart of this issue of DHQ.</p>
        <div><head>1. What are digital and computational approaches to sound, images
        and time-based media?</head>
        <p>For this project, the answer is simple: data translation. Data translation
        via computation can be used to generate sound (via sonification), images (via
        visualization), and time-based media (music via sonification). Further, this
        project is significant in the context of the digital humanities because of its
        use of approaches typically used for analysis to generate art. In the last 10
        to 15 years, visualization has become an integral component of text analysis,
        while tentative steps are also being taken to leverage sonification
        <ptr target="#sinclair2016"/>
        <ptr target="#graham2016"/>. The project also makes a contribution by
        leveraging text data, typically the grist for DH analysis, as the raw material
        for art. It finally contributes by using a non-traditional DH data source,
        protein, as a constituent for art.</p>
        </div>
        <div><head>2. How do these methods and approaches produce new knowledge and
        shift scholarship in a particular scholarly domain?</head>
        <p>In the domain of Landscape Architecture, as indicated above, digital
        objects have typically been seen as instruments for planning, the basis for
        the physical transformation of a given landscape. This project suggests that
        Landscape Architecture – and, by extension, the Digital Humanities – should
        integrate the digital with the physical when producing new landscape designs,
        and in so doing should generate a new domain of Landscape Architecture. The
        reason for so doing rests on a long-standing ambition of the field: to use
        landscapes as a visual way to say something about the nature of the cosmos in
        which we find ourselves. For example, pioneers such as Frederick Law Olmsted,
        the designer of New York's Central Park, were Transcendentalists. They used
        landscapes to express their sense that there was a latent reality underlying
        nature, that it was suffused with the divine <ptr target="#thompson2014"/>.</p>
        <p>Landscapes populated by latent, invisible without instrument, AR objects
        could be used to extend a similar, but different, message. In this context,
        the construction disseminated would not be <emph>transcendence</emph>, but
        <emph>ubiquitous sentience</emph>. In the past 20 years, biologists have made
        numerous remarkable discoveries that suggest many supposedly human distinctives
        are not unique to our species at all. Trees, for example, form familial and
        friendship networks, and communicate via something akin to a fungal Internet
        <ptr target="#wohlleben2015"/>. Cetaceans have been shown to use artificial languages and
        form cultures while musical biologists suggest birds compose music equal in
        complexity to symphonies <ptr target="#conway2003"/>. Perhaps most surprisingly,
        recent work in molecular biology suggest that cells use molecules in a fashion
        akin to words, that their communication is possibly akin to language, with
        a semantics, syntax and pragmatics, that they communicate in more than one
        "language," and that they vote (biologists refer to it as quorum sensing)
        <ptr target="#ahmed2008"/>
        <ptr target="#bassler2009"/>
        <ptr target="#ben2004"/>
        <ptr target="#ji1999"/>. Landscape
        Architects have long had a commitment to design that reflects an ethic
        of ecological sustainability and highlighting plant life, stone and other
        constituents of their local regions. To our knowledge, those same architects
        have not produced designs that in humanist terminology reflect an <emph>Animal
        Turn</emph>, a commitment to highlighting the agency embedded in environments
        that individuals in modern, European-derived cultures have traditionally
        ignored, largely because they – and we – were ignorant of their existence.
        It would be a worthy challenge for Landscape Architects to derive an AR-based
        visual language to focus viewer attention on our neighbours. DNA, molecular and
        Protein Data – the "words" used by single cell organisms to communicate – would
        be particularly worthy material upon which to build that language.</p>
        <p>For the Digital Humanities, our exercise in Screwmeneutics via the Oral
        Tradition suggests that scholars have the potential to translate their
        traditional focus – text data – into visual and sonic forms of art. They
        also can join their colleagues in the arts and sciences in translating other
        forms of data for the same purpose. The exercise also suggests that so long
        as the intrinsic structure of source data is retained, there is no correct,
        preferred or consistent method for generating Data Art. The source data can
        be divided into its components, and, again, provided the internal structures
        of those components are retained, the appropriated sections can be placed in
        new sequences and contexts. Further, the components of a given data source can
        be situated with whatever form, medium or context that is consistent with the
        needs, aspirations and capabilities of the artist. To be sure, most artists
        in domains such as Protein Music and other forms of Data Music choose to
        retain the sequential structures of their source data in their entirety. But
        the insights of the Oral Tradition and the inherent structure of our protein
        and text source data suggest that this preference need not be so, and our
        experience, combined with the past behavior of some Data Artists, suggests that
        some will do so.</p>
        <p>With respect to the nature of our data, Douglas Hofstadter notes that
        proteins like music are composed of smaller components: "Music is not a mere
        linear sequence of notes. Our minds perceive pieces of music on a level far
        higher than that. We chunk notes into phrases, phrases into melodies, melodies
        into movements, and movements into full pieces. Similarly, proteins only
        make sense when they act as chunked units" <ptr target="#hofstadter1979" loc="525"/>
        Biologist
        Mary Anne Clark similarly notes that "I was struck by the parallels between
        musical structure and the structure of proteins and the genes that encode
        them. Proteins also seemed to be composed of phrases organized into themes. For
        years I was haunted by the image, and tried occasionally to interest musicians
        in making the transformation for me ..." <ptr target="#dunn1999" loc="25"/>.
        Similar
        observations can and have been made about the complex nature of linguistic and
        textual data, not the least, as we saw, by Harold Innis in his descriptions of
        the Oral Tradition.</p>
        <p>Our stance that some Data Artists, particularly digital humanist Data
        Artists, will opt to leverage the "phrases" and "themes" of data for artistic
        purposes, and connect them to the instrumentation, media or objects that suit
        their purpose, is indicated by the choices made by the artists who collaborated
        on <emph>The Five Senses</emph> and <emph>Emergence</emph>. In the first work,
        Erin MacAfee and Bill Ralph chose to work within the sequential confines of
        the data presented to them. In the second, Amy Legault and Mark Anderson did
        not, collectively producing a work that confined the Data Art to the sonic
        level, based on selections of phrases detected by Legault in the source data,
        and the selection by Anderson of non-data images derived from an on-line
        library. In each case, the artists subjectively chose the extent to which
        they would subject themselves to the structures contained in their data, and
        the objects, media and instrumentation they conflated with their data. That
        is no different in principle from what previous Data Musicians have done,
        where they have displayed a remarkable degree of ingenuity and freedom in
        the artistic choices underlying their compositions. In our work, we played
        with complexity, arranging and re-arranging units contained on a single level
        of biological organization. In previous work, sonic composers have played
        with hierarchy, subjectively conflating structure from different levels of
        biological organization – such as DNA data, amino acid data, and protein
        folds – to produce a composition. Our work has been an exercise in juxtaposing
        retrieved structure with selected visualization. Previous work has juxtaposed
        identified structure with selected instrumentation. The key point here is that
        strict adherence to a given method is not necessary for Data Art to retain its
        integrity. So long as some trace of the data's original structure is retained,
        one should expect artists, as they must, to exercise their own judgment on what
        method or array of methods is legitimate to fulfill their purpose.</p>
        </div>
        <div><head>3. What are the Challenges and Possible Futures for AV in
        DH?</head>
        <p>Our combined use of Screwmeneutics, Harold Innis' Oral Tradition and Digital
        Art has explored one potential way that AR-based objects can be leveraged as
        constituents for Landscape Architecture. The Possibility Space for spatial
        AR art, however, is much larger, and its exploration and realization would
        constitute a worthy possible future for the Digital Humanities. One obvious
        way that space could be explored would be to change the digital content that
        is used to populate selected landscapes. Data Art is and will remain a central
        constituent of our future work. Indeed, we intend to further refine our app so
        that future users can incorporate their own visual and sonic constructs from
        data into it. But we also intend to incorporate other forms of art. We find
        ourselves, for example, wondering what the surreal imagination of Salvador
        Dali might have made of AR as a medium. The sky is a constant backdrop in
        his paintings, as witnessed in masterworks such as <emph>Dream Caused by the
        Flight of a Bee</emph>, <emph>Christ of Saint John of the Cross</emph>, and
        <emph>Santiago el Grande</emph>. One only has to survey a few of his works
        before the question arises if other spaces might be filled by AR objects.
        We are used to thinking of Landscape Architectures. Dali's work suggests AV
        digital humanists ought to expand their imagination to consider what a Skyscape
        Architecture or Seascape Architecture might look like.</p>
        <p>Two factors, one old, one new suggest why they might want to consider the
        development of such architectures. To start, it is a commonplace to observe
        that architects and interior designers, since ancient times, have sought
        to shape a visitor's experience of interior space – a given room inside a
        building – by importing select features from exterior space, ranging from
        the physical to the metaphysical. Whether by landscape or <emph>trompe
        l'oeil</emph> paintings, alignment of windows, doors, and ceiling oculi with
        the sun and moon, paintings with celestial motifs, or religious paintings
        such as Michelangelo's <emph>The Creation of Adam</emph>, artists have sought
        to use exterior space to create a sense of interior place. A second factor
        that should influence digital humanists is the imminent availability of smart
        glasses, as well as intelligent glass supported by smart film. Both present
        the possibility for immersive AR that outstrips the constrained field-of-view
        presently afforded by tablets and head-mounted displays. While smart glasses
        – which will be light, easy to wear, and feel like regular glasses – suggest
        the possibility for user access to AR content anywhere at any time, intelligent
        glass and smart film – sheets of glass and film that can alter glass opacity
        and display information – suggest the possibility that digital humanists and
        interior designers will be able to conceive and construct augmented seascapes
        and skyscapes.</p>
        <p>Consider the following storyboard as a possible example of what might
        result from an architect's attempt to construct a Skyscape Architecture using
        intelligent glass. Typically, the night-time sky in a city is a rather dull
        place. Light pollution effaces many if not most of the stars that might be
        observed, plus the Milky Way. An architect, say, of a restaurant might choose
        to exploit this gap by creating an A-Frame structure topped by a roof made
        with glass and smart film. The architect or interior designer, in turn, would
        then be free to fill the evening sky with whatever object, or array of objects
        is wished. Drawing on ceiling celestial paintings as a source of inspiration,
        our architect might opt to create a surreal display conflating the earth and
        moon with the Andromeda Galaxy, as shown in <ref target="#figure14">Figure 14</ref>. The restauranteur taking
        possession of the locale, however, would not be constrained by the initial
        skyscape provided by the architect, and could supplement it with other designs
        displaying other astronomical objects and other styles. The next evening our
        restauranteur might choose to populate the evening sky with an enlarged version
        of Jupiter juxtaposed with part of the Rosette Nebula. The following day,
        patrons would be treated to a surreal display of objects floating in the sky,
        as indicated in <ref target="#figure15">Figure 15</ref>.</p>

        </figure>
        <p>In such a scenario, building architecture would emerge as an interface
        to a new domain of art. And in such a scenario, sea, land and sky would
        emerge as platforms for the very sort of meaning-making that we have
        sought to promote in this study. Nothing is inevitable, but we would be
        very surprised if artists and digital humanists do not avail themselves
        of this opportunity to use digital form to enhance their surrounds.
        Such a step would simply be a continuation of a long history in which
        humans have used built form and modified topography for more than
        functional purposes. "From the most immemorial Hindustan pagodas to the
        Cathedral of Cologne," Victor Hugo writes in <emph>The Hunchback of Notre
        Dame</emph>, "architecture was the great script of the human race." Landscapes and
        buildings have been used by humans to express their yearning for beauty; their
        conception of history; their power over space; and their belief that humans –
        in the end – live in a cosmos with intrinsic purposes that can be understood.
        Now, that conversation, and that quest for meaning, can be continued in
        digital form, in new locales. And now, that conversation – in visual, sonic
        and topographic form – can express in a powerful way that the planet is replete
        with agency, creativity and dignity. We have no idea what our peers and our
        successors will produce. But we expect it will be replete with all the usual
        adjectives that we associate with great art: compelling, interesting, at times
        infuriating, but never boring.</p>
