        <p><emph>The DataScapes Project</emph> is an exploration of how Augmented Reality objects
          can be used as constituents for Landscape Architecture. Using Stephen Ramsay’s
          Screwmeneutics and Harold Innis' Oral Tradition as our theoretical points of departure,
          the project integrated the products of Data Art – the visualisation and sonification of
          data – as the constituents for our two works: <emph>The Five Senses and Emergence</emph>.
            <emph>The Five Senses</emph> was the product of protein data, while
            <emph>Emergence</emph> was generated using text from the King James version of the Holy
          Bible. In this exploratory treatment, we present the methods used to generate and display
          our two pieces. We further present anecdotal, qualitative evidence of viewer feedback, and
          use that as a basis to consider the ethics, challenges and opportunities that a future AR
          Landscape Architecture will present for scholars in the Digital Humanities.</p>

        <head>Our Aim: A new form of landscape architecture</head>
        <p>There is a singular privilege that accompanies living in this first century of digital
          computation: the opportunity to discern what it means. The task is nowhere near complete.
          We know, or think we know, that computation is having a bearing on our capacities to
          locate pattern, create and replicate pattern, and disseminate pattern. There are even some
          who believe its advent will ultimately impinge on the trajectories of natural and human
          history. Welcome to the Noosphere <ptr target="#teilhard1959"
              /><note>The <term>noosphere</term> is a philosophical concept developed and
            popularized by the <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biogeochemistry"
              >biogeochemist</ref> Vladimir Vernadsky, and the French philosopher
            and Jesuit priest Pierre Teilhard de Chardin. See: <ref
              target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noosphere"
              >https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noosphere</ref></note>. The ambition of this exercise
          in meaning-making is relatively more modest. We seek to explore how computation can be
          used to support the human penchant to adorn one's surrounds. More specifically, our
          purpose here is to explore how Augmented Reality (AR) Objects can be used as constituents
          for Landscape Architecture. In the aftermath of Ivan Sutherland's foundational work in the
          late 1960s establishing the field of computer graphics, the prospect that users might seek
          to integrate computer-generated form with their surrounds became a plausible one, one
          realized in the decades since via the medium of Augmented, and now Mixed, Reality <ptr
            target="#acm1988"/>. In the ensuing decades, AR has emerged as an actual or potential
          support for multiple fields, including education, construction, engineering, computer
          gaming and firefighting. In this contribution, we present the efforts of <emph>The
            DataScapes Project</emph> to explore how AR's capacity to situate and register digital
          content might be leveraged for artistic purposes: Augmented Reality content, combined with
          constituents from Data Art, can be leveraged as raw materials for Landscape
          Architecture.</p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <head>Previous Work</head>
        <p>The first challenge faced by members of the project was the fundamental one of
          determining how to proceed. We were presented with a blank canvass and had to select the
          location and method that, so to speak, would constitute our "paint." Choosing a location
          proved to be the more straightforward of the two decisions. We were looking for a readily
          accessible space at one of our two universities, a locale that at once presented a sense
          of grand scale and a sense of enclosure. We were looking for a tract of land that would
          serve as a frame and a complement for our AR artwork. Based on that criteria, we selected
          the traffic circle at Brock University in St. Catharines, Ontario Canada. The circle is
          140 metres in diameter, is centrally located on campus, and until recently was bounded by
          willow trees.</p>
        <p>Selecting the method and content that would constitute the matter of our creation, by
          contrast, proved more difficult. To be sure, there were multiple domains of art that
          anticipated – in part – what we were seeking to do. The fields of Landscape Art,
          Earthworks, and Digital Art, through their creation of anamorph and <emph>trompe
            l'oeil</emph> artworks, for example, were suggestive of what an AR-based Landscape
          Architecture might accomplish. But the three fields also differed significantly in their
          practice from what we were aiming to accomplish. To start, while Landscape Art and
          Earthworks both make location a central constituent of artistic production, artists in
          both fields sculpt material objects – constituents from a local landscape – to generate
          artistic form, not digital content <ptr target="#thompson2014"/>
          <ptr target="#herrington2017"/>. In the domain of Digital Art, artists such as Joe
          Crossley have sought to conflate the digital with the material by transforming static
          empty spaces – generally building surfaces – into multi-media surfaces using projection
          mapping. The content that is disseminated, however, is 2D, not 3D <ptr
            target="#crossley2017"/>.</p>
        <p>Landscape Architecture, the primary field to which we sought to contribute, also did not
          present an obvious theoretical frame of reference, method or aesthetic to assist our
          efforts. One dimension of the problem here is that practitioners still tend to view
          digital tools and content as instruments to support the design of physical landscapes. A
          second problem is that the field's ontology of place is not sufficiently broad to
          encompass the fusion of digital and physical that we sought to construct. Since the
          Renaissance, landscape designers and gardeners, historian John Dixon Hunt argues, have
          typically divided space into three constructs or "natures," with first nature referring to
          wilderness, second nature to cultivated land, and third nature to landscapes shaped with
          aesthetic intent <ptr target="#thompson2014" loc="38"/>. Some designers suggest that
          Landscape Architects should consider adding a fourth nature to the list, one encompassing
          reclaimed landscapes and restored habitats, while we in turn wondered if we had stumbled
          on a fifth: landscapes containing digital annotations, objects or complements.</p>
        <p>A third issue centered on the field's self-definition. While Landscape Architecture
          traces its origins to Landscape Gardening, the profession has maintained a complicated
          relationship with the arts over the course of the 20th century. Then, many designers,
          particularly in the wake of the profession's <emph>1966 Declaration of Concern</emph>
          <note><ref target="https://www.lafoundation.org/who-we-are/values/declaration-of-concern"
              >https://www.lafoundation.org/who-we-are/values/declaration-of-concern</ref></note>,
          suggested the focus of landscape architects should be on environmental conservation, not
          the translation of artistic or philosophical trends, be it transcendentalism or
          post-modernism, into landscape form. Other practitioners have taken the stance that the
          primary focus of the field should be on design, here understood as landscape construction
          that is optimized for the needs of a site's visitors and users. The artistic ambitions of
          the architect are deemed to be a secondary concern, if they are considered at all. On the
          50th anniversary of the 1966 statement, however, the Landscape Architecture Foundation
          published a <emph>New Landscape Declaration</emph>, one in which architects called for a
          renewed emphasis on aesthetics <ptr target="#landscape2017"/>. One reason for the call was
          the realization that aesthetic concerns are not a luxury: poor design of buildings and
          cityscapes – here understood as the mindless prioritization of utility over beauty or
          meaning – has had a deleterious social impact. Landscape architects have also stressed
          artistic concerns because of a widespread sense that the field has never been a site of
          aesthetic innovation, and that it has missed important opportunities, such as the
          emergence of avant-garde art in the early 20th century <ptr target="#corner2017"/>
          <ptr target="#fajardo2017"/>
          <ptr target="#jellicoe1995"/>
          <ptr target="#thompson2014"/>. While the field has not been oblivious to important trends
          such as Modernism and Post-Modernism, "there is surprisingly little discussion," Richard
          Weller writes, "of what contemporary landscape aesthetics are and what they might yet
          become" <ptr target="#weller2017" loc="10"/>.</p>
        <p>Given this lack of definition, our team opted for an exploratory approach to inform the
          design of our project, one akin in the Digital Humanities to Stephen Ramsay's
          Screwmeneutics and Kevin Ferguson's Digital Surrealism. In his seminal essay, Ramsay
          proposes a method of scholarly activity that eschews the conduct of what he refers to as
          the "search." The "search" in this context is the practice of identifying a canon – the
          state-of-the field for a given domain of research – and then identifying a gap in that
          same canon. As scholars, we contribute to our respective fields by conducting research to
          fill that gap. But there are times, Ramsay writes, when this formulaic approach does not
          work, particularly when the researcher is attempting something new. How can the "search"
          "help me find what I'm looking for," he writes, "when (a) I don't know what's here and (b)
          I don't know what I'm looking for?" <ptr target="#ramsay2014" loc="115"/>. For Ramsay, the
          answer to this dilemma is to engage in what he refers to as "browsing." Drawing on the
          ideas of Roland Barthes, Ramsay proposes that we engage in the construction of the
            <emph>writerly text</emph>. In contrast to the <emph>readerly text</emph>, which
          involves a passive form of reading, engagement with a <emph>writerly text</emph>
          presupposes a process of composition, an immersion of the reader into the flux of
          existence, and initiation of a process of discovery and systematization: the connection by
          the reader of the content from the given text with a context, be it another item of
          content, a person, or a compelling idea. The theory of the <emph>writerly text</emph>,
          Barthes writes, "is a practice (that of the writer), not a science, a method, a research
          ... this theory can produce only theoreticians or practitioners, not specialists (critics,
          researchers, professors, students)" <ptr target="#ramsay2014" loc="119"/>.</p>
        <p>Via this process, Ramsay argues, the humanist defines a path through culture, thereby
          providing the Humanist – or, if you will, the Screwmeneuticist – with perspective, the
          platform necessary to support discovery, desire and questioning. One useful first step in
          defining such a pathway was undertaken by David Ferguson in his recent visual analysis of
          Disney animations, where he brings his artistic artefact of interest – the film – into
          relation with the concept of complex. Any artefact of interest, he suggests, can be
          dissected and its components re-articulated into new combinations. However, while useful,
          Ferguson's method for applying Screwmeneutics is not appropriate for our purposes for two
          reasons. First, its aim is ultimately analytic, not generative. It seeks, like all
          Structuralist methodologies, to locate the intrinsic properties – the hidden archetypal
          structures – of a given art-form. Its purpose is not scenario exploration. It does not
          seek to conduct an exercise exploring the potential ways an art-form <emph>might</emph>
          exist. It seeks instead to define the way a given form <emph>already</emph> exists.
          Second, and by extension, Ferguson's methodology, and structuralist methodologies in
          general, are ones that collapse the dimension of time. They presuppose objects of analysis
          that operate in a synchronic fashion <ptr target="#ferguson2017"/>
          <ptr target="#merrell1975"/>. We, by contrast, were seeking to create Augmented Reality,
          multi-media landscape complexes that could incorporate the dimension of time, and more
          specifically would incorporate temporal art forms such as music. Our purpose, in the end,
          was to generate an artwork that would serve, in Seymour Papert's words, as an
          object-to-think-with, and in Barthes' words, as a <emph>writerly text</emph>
          <ptr target="#papert1980"/>. Given that we were aiming to create something that was new,
          we sought to construct an artefact that would provide definition, suggest potential, and
          present questions and connections for future artists and humanists to explore.</p>

      <div>
        <head>Our Theory: The Oral Tradition of Harold Innis</head>
        <p>For these reasons, we opted to employ a different Screwmeneutic method to conceive and
          develop our landscape complex, namely Harold Innis' concept of the Oral Tradition. For
          those unfamiliar with his work, Harold Innis was a media theorist and one of the founders
          of the Toronto School of Communication. Between 1940 and 1952 he produced a set of works,
          including <emph>Empire and Communications</emph> and <emph>The Bias of
            Communication</emph> that were dedicated to exploring the physical, formal and cognitive
          effects of communication media. A political economist by training, Innis turned to the
          study of communications in 1940 because he perceived, not surprisingly, that the world was
          falling apart. How was it possible, he asked in the final decade of his life, that the
          world, after enduring the insanity and carnage of the First World War, should so readily
          plunge itself into a Second? The answer, he believed, was to be found in the grand sweep
          of global history. What factors, he wondered, enabled societies to thrive? And what, by
          contrast, led to their dysfunction and eventual collapse? His lived experience, combined
          with his studies of the past, convinced him that human collectives functioned much like
          biological organisms. The vitality, adaptability, indeed the sanity, of institutions,
          nations and empires were dependent on the environmental circumstances in which they found
          themselves. Since the inputs and outputs of human-environmental interaction were largely
          mediated by communication devices, Innis set high store on their importance in global
          history. The political and cultural periodization of history, Innis believed, could be
          correlated with the invention or adoption of new communication technologies. So could the
          pathologies that afflicted cultures. There was a price to be paid for the unthinking use
          of technology, and in his writings Innis pointed to two: cognitive rigidity and cognitive
          flux <ptr target="#innis1946"/>
          <ptr target="#bonnett2017"/>. Technology historically had produced pathological forms of
          groupthink in which cultures either focused on the wrong thing (due to cognitive rigidity,
          or bias), or no thing at all (due to cognitive flux). With its judgment impaired by one of
          the two pathologies, a given culture would lose its ability to discern the opportunities
          and threats latent in its environment, fail to innovate, fail to compete and as a result
          fall prey to its competitors <ptr target="#bonnett2013" loc="191–198"/>.</p>

          </note>, Innis believed it was possible to construct a culture that retained its vitality
          and resilience via an ethic he referred to as the Oral Tradition. The Oral Tradition, as
          Innis conceived it, was not a call to forsake writing and adopt pre-literate Greek
          communication practices that relied on memory and voice. Instead, like Barthes, Innis
          called on his readers to adopt an <emph>active stance</emph> toward knowledge, a
          willingness to alter constructs and formalisms to meet the needs and experience of the
          present. Such a stance, Innis argued, had enabled the Greeks to make their innovations in
          theology, philosophy, science, politics and art. The Oral Tradition was also distinguished
          by its reliance on linguistic and aesthetic formalisms that were characterized by internal
          complexity and hierarchy. The power of such formalisms lay in their latent potential. They
          contained multiple constituents that could be arranged and re-arranged at will, enabling
          artists to explore new aesthetic constructs, and philosophers new intellectual
          possibilities, through the separation, interpolation and translation of content. In its
          essence, it was a serio-comic method, one that enabled Greece to shift its conception of
          nature from one based on myth to one shaped by science <ptr target="#bonnett2013"
            loc="209–217"/>.<note><ref
              target="http://podcasts.torontoreviewofbooks.com/2013.02/Bonnet.mp3"
              >http://podcasts.torontoreviewofbooks.com/2013.02/Bonnet.mp3</ref></note></p>
        <p>A third feature of the Oral Tradition, one deriving from its commitment to active
          manipulation of knowledge, was its use of multi-modal forms of expression. The reason
          Innis named his communication ethic the Oral Tradition in the first place was due to the
          influence of linguist Edward Sapir, who noted the "formal richness" of ancient
          communication practices, practices that contained "a latent luxuriance of expression that
          eclipses anything known to modern civilization" <ptr target="#innis1950" loc="8–9"/>. Such
          luxuriance of expression, and with it enhanced expressive potential, could be purchased in
          the present by creating formalisms that combined written, vocal and visual forms of
          representation. Such forms in principle presented possibilities for information
          visualization – which would assist in the location of significant environmental patterns –
          and information translation – which would enhance viewer understanding of the construct's
          content <ptr target="#bonnett2013" loc="166–181"/>
          <ptr target="#innis1946"/>. Referring to Italian artistic practice in the 15th and 16th
          centuries, for example, Innis noted Andrea Alciati's invention of the emblem book, a
          construct in which poetry, "one of the oldest arts, was combined with engraving, one of
          the newest" [Innis 2015, 101] The rationale for so doing was provided by Francis Bacon,
          who argued that emblems "reduce intellectual conceptions to sensible images and that which
          is sensible strikes the memory and is more easily imprinted on it than that which is
          intellectual'" <ptr target="#innis2015" loc="101"/>
          <ptr target="#bacon1654"/>.</p>
        <p>The commitment to multi-modality in turn presented a fourth characteristic of the Oral
          Tradition: a commitment to integrate both spatial and temporal forms of representation.
          Because of its present and historic relationship with the art of poetry, Innis argued, the
          Oral Tradition "implied a concern with time and religion. 'The artist represents
            <emph>coexistence in space</emph>, the poet <emph>succession in time</emph>' (Lessing at
          the University of Berlin, 1810)" <ptr target="#innis1951" loc="102"/>. In his own economic
          work, Innis would apply this characteristic of the Oral Tradition by interpolating time
          series of price data with maps to track the emergent patterns of North American economic
          history, years before the practice become common via Geographic Information Systems <ptr
            target="#bonnett2013"/>. The Oral Tradition was finally characterized by what in modern
          parlance can be characterized as an open-source ethic, one in which content and form was
          routinely lifted from one work and integrated into another. "The great epics," Innis
          writes, "were probably developed out of lays constantly retold and amplified. Old ballads
          were replaced by combinations of a number of episodes into a unity of action. The epic was
          characterized by extreme complexity and unity" <ptr target="#innis1950" loc="72"/>. </p>

        <head>Our Mode and Matter: Data Art, Protein and Text</head>
        <p>In its essence then, the Innis' Oral Tradition is a method for intellectual inquiry and
          aesthetic innovation that rests on a willingness to explore the possibility spaces
          afforded by complex, spatio-temporal, multi-modal form, and to reconstitute that form
          through the integration of content brought in from the outside. To assist our exploration
          of the possibility space associated with digital Landscape Architecture, we opted to use
          the methods and modes associated with Data Art. Also referred to as Information Art, Data
          Art rests on the premise that the world is replete with forms that can be harvested for
          artistic purposes. It chiefly emerged from scientific efforts to use sight and sound
          analogues as a method to locate significant patterns and relationships in large data sets.
          From that effort, multiple intriguing genres of art have emerged, particularly in the
          field of music, such as DNA music <ptr target="#gena1995"/>, protein music <ptr
            target="#dunn1999"/>, microbial and meteorological music <ptr target="#larsen2013"/>,
          and even a music of the spheres, music compositions derived from astronomical data <ptr
            target="#ballora2013"/>. With Data Art, we were presented in principle with a method
          that would enable us to translate a given data set at once into visual and sonic form.</p>
        <p>Once we had a mode for our AR landscape, the next, more difficult step was determining
          its matter, the data that would provide the pattern, the source of serial distinctions for
          our artworks. The team's decision-making here was determined by the following factors: our
          decision to produce two works, contingent circumstance, and the intellectual interest of
          project team members. The contingent circumstance centered on our need to locate
          sonification software. While Bill Ralph, a mathematician, and Mark Anderson, a computer
          scientist, respectively possessed the skills required to visualize our data, we had no one
          with the requisite ability to translate raw data into musical form. After a fairly
          protracted search (there is not a lot of proprietary or open-source software dedicated to
          supporting the generation of Data Art) we were able to locate <emph>MusicWonk</emph>, an
          application developed by John Dunn, a pioneer in computer music and art since the
            1970s<emph>.</emph> While <emph>MusicWonk</emph> is purportedly able to able to work
          with any data set, the software specializes in supporting the creation of Genetic Music
          from DNA and Protein Data. The application's website provides tutorials and links to
          multiple libraries of genetic sequences, including the one we used: the U.S. National
          Institutes of Health GenBank <ptr target="#algorithmic2015"/>. Based on this
          specialization, we opted to use protein data and to create an artwork called <emph>The
            Five Senses</emph>, a composition of five movements which would respectively be
          constructed from protein data supporting Sight, Smell, Touch, Taste and Hearing in
          humans.</p>
        <p>Our data selection was also prompted by the team's interest in the construct of change
          known as self-organization or emergent change, a ubiquitous phenomenon in the natural and
          social sciences studied by the Science of Complexity <ptr target="#waldrop1992"/>
          <ptr target="#gell1994"/>. It was also prompted by the observation of scholars such as
          Werner Jaeger and Harold Innis that different domains of human activity – such as science,
          philosophy and theology – often produce constructs of change that are very similar <ptr
            target="#innis1950" loc="93"/>. It was finally prompted by the observation of John
          Bonnett that a number of parallels could be found between the core concepts of emergent
          change – such as positive feedback, the governance of formal cause, and the teleological
          governance of system attractors – and the philosophy of history associated with the
          Christian Bible. Economists, for example, often characterize positive feedback as the
          Matthew Effect, given that the process of cumulative change it describes matches the
          dynamic Jesus describes in the Parable of the Talents, where the rich became richer and
          poor poorer <ptr target="#rigney2010"/>. Given these parallels, we opted to create a
          second work simply titled <emph>Emergence</emph> based on source text from the Bible. Like
            <emph>The Five Senses</emph>, we planned a composition featuring five movements, with
          each piece named after a constituent concept of self-organization, respectively
          "Emergence," "Differentiation," "Regulation," "Selection" and "Attractor." Each piece, in
          turn, would rest on data taken from the King James version of the Bible, text that
          provided narrative or mythic analogues to the concepts of positive feedback, formal cause,
          and so on.</p>
        <p>With the terms of composition settled, the team's next step was to identify the specific
          data sets we wanted to use for each composition and then begin the process of
          sonification. The proteins selected for <emph>The Five Senses</emph> are shown in <ref
            target="#figure01">Figure 1</ref>, while the biblical texts selected for
            <emph>Emergence</emph> are shown in <ref target="#figure02">Figure 2</ref>. The process
          of sonification for <emph>The Five Senses</emph> began by harvesting the letter data
          associated with each protein record, such as that shown in <ref target="#figure03">Figure
            3</ref>. In many ways, NIH protein records resemble what any researcher might find in a
          library catalogue for a book listing, with metadata describing authors, key words,
          versions and the like. However, NIH records also feature a sequence of letters where one
          typically would find Library of Congress or equivalent subject headings describing a
          book's contents. Those letters collectively constitute the protein described in the given
          record. In <ref target="#figure03">Figure 3</ref>, the highlighted letter sequence refers
          to the amino acids making Medium Wave sensitive opsin 1 (Homo sapiens), a protein
          contained in green cone photopigment that we used to generate the work <emph>Sight</emph>.
          These letter sequences provided the patterned sequences that would be translated into
          notes for <emph>Sight</emph>. Similar letter sequences generated the notation for the four
          remaining movements of <emph>The Five Senses</emph>, while the biblical passages provided
          the initial basis for <emph>Emergence</emph>.</p>

        <head>Our Method of Sonification</head>
        <p>The process of sonification for both compositions was initiated in <emph>MusicWonk</emph>
          first by converting every letter from every dataset into a counterpart number, with A
          equaling 1, B equaling 2, Z equaling 26, and so on. Once an entire letter set from a given
          dataset had been translated, the software then aligned the numeric series with a specified
          music scale, producing a raw music string, as shown in <ref target="#figure04">Figure
            4</ref>. From that point, the project's two music composers – Erin MacAfee and Amy
          Legault – had two methods of composition and two modes of operating with their source data
          open to them. The first method of composition – selected by neither – was to use the
          algorithmic method of music composition supported by <emph>MusicWonk</emph>. There, the
          raw music string is transformed by feeding it through a set of components that control
          features such as tempo, chords, instrumentation and the like. The process, shown in <ref
            target="#figure05">Figure 5</ref>, is akin to creating an algorithm using a visual
          programming language, or creating an electronic circuit.</p>
        <figure xml:id="figure04">
          <head>MusicWonk is shown here generating raw music string from protein data</head>

          <graphic url="resources/images/figure05.jpeg" style="height: 300px;"/>
        </figure>
        <p>The second method – selected by both – required the two to export the raw music string to
          a *.midi file, and then open the exported file in <emph>Finale</emph>, a music composition
          software package. The appeal of <emph>Finale</emph> for Legault and MacAfee is that it
          presented methods for music notation that were familiar to them, most notably by featuring
          an interface and tools that supported viewing and direct manipulation of music string
          notation. With <emph>Finale</emph>, the two were able to alter note duration, inscribe
          chords of their own devising, and repair aberrations in pitch.</p>
        <p><emph>Finale</emph> also enabled each composer to determine how she wanted to use the
          musical sequences inherited from her source data. MacAfee's approach in <emph>The Five
            Senses</emph> was minimalist. While she was willing to alter select attributes in her
          file, such as rhythm, instrumentation and the duration of individual notes, she was not
          inclined to alter the tonal sequence inherited from her datasets. Legault's approach, by
          contrast, was more interventionist. Instead of viewing her inherited notation series as a
          fixed object, she opted to view her raw music strings as libraries from which she could
          splice identified musical components. The appropriated sections were – much like the lays
          in Innis' Oral Tradition – placed in new sequences and were integrated into established
          musical genres selected by Legault, such as the fugue.</p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <head>Our Methods for Visualization</head>
        <p>While Legault and MacAfee were generating their respective sonifications, team members
          Bill Ralph, a mathematician, and Mark Anderson, a computer scientist, were working on
          their visual correlates. Ralph is also an algorithmic artist, one who describes his work
          as "an attempt to make a visual connection with the enormous complexity and unity that
          lies within the rich mathematical objects that inspire my images" <ptr target="#ralph2018"
          />. He is particularly interested in mathematical objects that can generate chaotic,
          dynamic systems, and has used them to generate dynamic and static works distinguished by
          their complex topologies and colour. From the standpoint of this project, Ralph's approach
          was ideal because it often relied on source data to drive the generation of a given work.
          For <emph>The Five Senses</emph>, he used proprietary algorithms driven by two inputs. The
          first source of pattern was the set of distinctions obtained via a sequential progression
          through the data. The second source was the set of relationships detected by the algorithm
          between different, non-proximate strings contained in the data. Both were leveraged to
          provide a visual focus to our landscape composition. For <emph>Emergence</emph>, Mark
          Anderson used a different approach. Instead of deriving his images from the data, he
          selected Screen Vector Graphic images that related conceptually with concepts such as
            <emph>Differentiation</emph> and <emph>Attractor</emph>, and then used project data and
          the application <emph>NodeBox</emph> to animate each image and prompt transformations in
          colour.</p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <head><emph>The DataScapes Project</emph> AR Set</head>
        <p>With the sonification and visualization of our two works complete, two further tasks
          remained, the first being the construction and overlay of a digital set to display
            <emph>The Five Senses</emph> and <emph>Emergence</emph>. Given that we conceived our two
          works as Landscape Architecture, and that the Brock Traffic Circle – our selected first
          venue – was 140 metres in diameter, the parameters of our project mandated that the
          components of our digital set be relatively large in size for the visualizations to be
          observable and for them in turn to serve as artistic complements to the surrounding
          landscape. That need was further compounded by the presence of the physical statue, known
          as She-Wolf, situated in the midst of the circle, and the scaffolding and the four 4.6
          metre-high QR code signs we installed to activate and situate our digital works. All three
          objects are shown in <ref target="#figure06">Figure 6</ref>, and all three required
          effacing by the digital set to prevent their disruption of the impact of our AR Landscape
          works. Accordingly, the set shown in <ref target="#figure07">Figure 7</ref> was designed
          by John Bonnett using <emph>SketchUp</emph> to display <emph>The Five Senses</emph> and
            <emph>Emergence</emph>. The set is bounded by eight 9-metre-high monoliths, with the
          front of each monolith displaying a graphic representing the title of the movement
          currently under display. <ref target="#figure08">Figure 8</ref>, for example, shows the
          graphics for the movement <emph>Touch</emph> on the left and <emph>Differentiation</emph>
          on the right. The centre of the set is composed of two components. The cylinder at the
          base is used to cover the statue, scaffold and QR code signs mentioned above. Floating
          above it is a 9 metre object used to display the given movement's visualization. For
            <emph>The Five Senses</emph>, a cube was used to display the artwork, while a sphere was
          used for <emph>Emergence</emph>.</p>

        <head><emph>The DataScapes Project</emph> Android App</head>
        <p>Our final task was the creation of an Android app to support user viewing of the two
          works via a tablet or phone. Our requirements for the <emph>DataScapes</emph> app were
          straightforward. We wanted to simultaneously see and hear the respective visualizations
          and sonifications associated with each movement. We further wanted multiple users to the
          site to experience the performance in sync. If one viewer was viewing and hearing the
          movement <emph>Taste</emph>, we wanted their counterparts to see and hear the same thing
          at the same time. We also wanted user entry into the experience to be simple, involving
          little more than user activation of the app, and direction of his</p>

          app only worked at a distance of 6 metres or less from the QR code signs, to prevent
          unsafe viewing of the exhibit by, for example, drivers circumnavigating the circle. The
            <emph>DataScapes</emph> application was developed using <emph>Vuforia</emph>, an SDK
          (Software Development Kit) designed to facilitate the development of AR applications on
          mobile devices. Leveraging 3D objects, planar surfaces and patterns situated in the
          environment, <emph>Vuforia</emph> is able to determine the user's position and camera
          orientation relative to objects such as the project's QR Code signs, and in turn to
          situate and register computer-generated 3D objects. These capabilities enabled team
          programmers Joe Bolton and Mark Anderson to fulfill another requirement for the
            <emph>DataScapes</emph> app: the capacity to move around and within the artwork.
            <emph>Vuforia</emph>'s capabilities, combined with GPS and gyroscopic data, enabled the
            <emph>DataScapes</emph> app to track the movement of viewers, and in response to change
          the orientation and rendering of displayed objects in real-time, to make our digital
          objects seem as if they were integrated and locked into the natural landscape.</p>

        <head>Results</head>
        <p>The final results of our efforts are shown in <ref target="#figure09">Figure 9</ref> and
            <ref target="#figure10">Figure 10</ref>, along with a video showing the operation of the
          app in <ref target="#figure11">Figure 11</ref> (For an earlier treatment of <emph>The
            DataScapes Project</emph>, see Bonnett et al. 2018). The first version of the
            <emph>DataScapes</emph> app in our estimation was a partial success, both technically,
          and with respect to audience reception. With respect to the app's functionality, our
          initial trials of the two works were hindered by two difficulties. The first and perhaps
          most disappointing setback was the inadequate processing power of the two Asus 12" tablets
          we had on hand for viewing the display. The tablets did not have the capacity to
          simultaneously render and register our set while simultaneously displaying our data
          visualizations in dynamic form. Despite our best efforts to find work-around solutions on
          site, we had to settle for the necessary compromise of presenting Bill Ralph's and Mark
          Anderson's respective visualizations in static form. A second difficulty centered on the
          stability of the set. While the first version of the app adequately anchored our set to
          the Brock traffic circle, several of its constituents, most notably its monoliths, tended
          to vibrate or jitter in a way that was at once distracting and unpleasant. These
          deficiencies have been partially remedied in the second and third versions of our app. Our
          intention in these two iterations was to develop portable versions that would display
            <emph>The Five Senses</emph> and <emph>Emergence</emph> indoors, while remedying some of
          the performance failures identified in the first. Version two, shown in the animation
          featured in <ref target="#figure12">Figure 12</ref>, was designed to support Mark Anderson
          for an Edge Hill University lecture dedicated to the Art of Computing, and presents the
          project as a wall display. Version three, shown in <ref target="#figure13">Figure
          13</ref>, transformed the orientation and scale of the project yet again, by adapting it
          for display as a table-top installation. In both, we were able to better stabilize the
          display of our set. And in both, we were able to add some dynamism to the display, albeit
          by introducing movement into the set rather than our visualizations. Both iterations
          required changes to the application, most notably by changing the way <emph>Vuforia</emph>
          searched for targets and changing the orientation of the 3D content it displayed in
          relation to those targets. In addition, we also removed the initial application's use of
          GPS tracking code, as that functionality was specifically designed to support the
          geo-location of 3D content on the Brock traffic circle, and further designed to hinder the
          display of content to users not on campus. Finally, we reduced the size of QR code
          displays used with versions 2 and 3 of the <emph>DataScapes</emph> app and designed each
          version to generate displays proportional in size to the QR code target. Via this step,
          the user can print a code on a piece of paper and generate a display proportional in size
          to the underlying table.</p>

        <p>As for audience assessment, we report here anecdotal evidence gathered during our first
          trial. Our rationale for this approach as opposed to more extensive and expensive methods
          used in Human Computer Interaction (HCI) and elsewhere is due, in part, to concerns
          regarding the reliability of user assessment methods pioneered in cognitive psychology and
          HCI. These methods have been drawn into question due to, on a general level, the
          replicability crisis in the social sciences and, more specifically, widespread criticisms
          of the two fields pointing to errors in statistical method, small sample sizes and large
          confidence intervals <ptr target="#lundh2019"/>
          <ptr target="#greenberg1992"/>
          <ptr target="#cairns2007"/>
          <ptr target="#gigerenzer2004"/>
          <ptr target="#cohen1994"/>. Putting the matter simply, user assessment via this route
          seemed to impose a good deal of effort for results that did not necessarily convince.</p>
        <p>For the type of exploratory exercise that we were pursuing, it seemed more useful to take
          a craft-based approach to user assessment. In fields such as web design, argues Gerd
          Waloszek, a former interface designer with SAP, the metric for success for a given design
          is not its authentication via an HCI analysis of design <emph>consumers</emph>. The real
          metric rests on whether other design <emph>producers</emph> copy the design, making it a
          convention <ptr target="#waloszek2003"/>. In a different design context, Elizabeth
          Eisenstein and Hellmut Lehmann-Haupt note a similar process in the history of the print
          book. Through experimentation and appropriation of designs from competitors, printers such
          as Peter Schoeffer collectively generated the conventions of the modern book, such as
          tables of contents, title pages, running heads and footnotes <ptr target="#eisenstein1979"/>
          <ptr target="#lehmann1950"/>. A craft-based approach, then, suggests that the "success" of
          our effort will depend on whether other artists, landscape architects and digital
          humanists choose to emulate our approach to landscape design, because they like it, and
          because they believe it will induce a favorable reaction from their respective audiences.
          The best we can do is report what we learned from our viewers and suggest the questions
          and implications that stem from those observations. We will be "successful" if colleagues
          choose to mimic those efforts and address the questions we have raised.</p>
        <p>Based on that framework, we noted two classes of respondents – general viewers and
          artists – and important questions that arose from each. General viewers for the most part
          found our various pieces engaging, reporting an intrinsic fascination with the fact that
          data, particularly protein data, could be translated into art forms, particularly music.
          That feedback raised an important question for us, however. Is Data Art intrinsically
          compelling on its own? Is it capable of generating an intellectual or affective response
          from viewers without annotation, or must it be presented with an accompanying spoken or
          written context to maintain viewer interest? This is, of course, not a new question in the
          history of art and Landscape Architecture, where practitioners continue to argue whether
          art should attempt to communicate a concept or message – such as the need for
          environmental sustainability – or instead focus on generating an emotional response from
          viewers <ptr target="#thompson2014"/>. A related question is whether artists and Landscape
          Architects can generate the sensory "languages," be it visual, sonic, olfactory or
          something else, required to successfully communicate the artist's message to an audience
          without textual assistance.</p>
        <p>The response of artists was, perhaps not surprisingly, more searching and more critical.
          While most viewers found the project's content and approach very interesting, some took
          exception to our temporary appropriation of the Brock traffic circle (we used it for one
          week), particularly since it already contained a physical statue that was surrounded by
          the project's scaffolding and QR codes. One artist deemed the metal framing and the
          statue's digital effacement problematic. Another deemed it a violation. This feedback
          raised fascinating ethical and political questions for us. To be sure, the infrastructure
          we constructed around the physical <emph>She-Wolf</emph> statute did hinder proper viewing
          of the statue. Whether it constituted a violation depends on your point of view. Until
          artists raised the issue with us, the construction of the scaffolding and QR codes
          prompted no concern from project participants, nor did it for the university officials who
          granted us permission to use the space. We meant no disrespect. It was not our intention
          to make a comment on the statue, nor to damage it. But some artists did see our temporary
          occupation of the space as an unacceptable abridgement on the statue's integrity and the
          sculptor Ilan Averbuch's rights.</p>
        <p>One response to these concerns would be to note that the scaffolding and QR codes will
          not be a permanent component of AR Land Architecture, or more generally, AR-based artforms
          in future. We used them because current technology requires their use to situate and
          register content. In future, artists will be able to use RTK GPS (Real-time Kinematic
          Geographic Positioning System) data to position content with centimetre and even
          millimetre level accuracy. That expedient will resolve the issue of the art form's
          physical intrusion into a given space, but not its digital annotation. Is it ethical for
          one artist to use digital methods to efface, comment upon, add to, mock, or alter the
          context of a physical artwork created by another, even if the digital annotation is not
          visible to the naked eye? To that ethical question we can add a political one: who gets to
          add that annotation? The complexity and sensitivity of this question was anticipated in
          2017 in New York when the statue <emph>Fearless Girl</emph> (sculpted by Kristen Visbal)
          was placed in proximity to the statue <emph>Charging Bull,</emph> a work situated on
          Broadway and long associated with Wall Street and the city's financial district. To many,
            <emph>Fearless Girl</emph> presented an important message of female empowerment.
            <emph>Charging Bull</emph>'s sculptor Arturo Di Modica, however, was outraged, arguing
          that <emph>Fearless Girl</emph>'s proximity and positioning transformed the meaning of his
          statue, from one symbolizing prosperity and strength, to that of villain <ptr
            target="#dobnik2017"/>
          <ptr target="#mettler2017"/>. The controversy raised multiple questions, ones that we now
          face with our project. When an artist makes an intrusion into a space, does that space
          become sacrosanct? Artists have long made interventions into spaces that they deem to be
          playful, even provocative. Are those intrusions to be exempted from three-dimensional
          annotations that some will label as legitimate super-positions or rejoinders, others as
          graffiti, and others as outrageous violations? Who gets to decide the issue? These issues
          will become increasingly central as AR becomes a ubiquitous communication medium.</p>

        <head>Discussion and Conclusion</head>
        <p>In addition to the questions posed above, what other observations and questions might we
          offer to conclude this exercise in Screwmeneutics via the Oral Tradition? In our view, the
          best way to finish would be to explicitly address the questions that constitute the heart
          of this issue of DHQ.</p>
        <div>
          <head>1. What are digital and computational approaches to sound, images and time-based
            media?</head>
          <p>For this project, the answer is simple: data translation. Data translation via
            computation can be used to generate sound (via sonification), images (via
            visualization), and time-based media (music via sonification). Further, this project is
            significant in the context of the digital humanities because of its use of approaches
            typically used for analysis to generate art. In the last 10 to 15 years, visualization
            has become an integral component of text analysis, while tentative steps are also being
            taken to leverage sonification <ptr target="#sinclair2016"/>
            <ptr target="#graham2016"/>. The project also makes a contribution by leveraging text
            data, typically the grist for DH analysis, as the raw material for art. It finally
            contributes by using a non-traditional DH data source, protein, as a constituent for
            art.</p>

        <div>
          <head>2. How do these methods and approaches produce new knowledge and shift scholarship
            in a particular scholarly domain?</head>
          <p>In the domain of Landscape Architecture, as indicated above, digital objects have
            typically been seen as instruments for planning, the basis for the physical
            transformation of a given landscape. This project suggests that Landscape Architecture –
            and, by extension, the Digital Humanities – should integrate the digital with the
            physical when producing new landscape designs, and in so doing should generate a new
            domain of Landscape Architecture. The reason for so doing rests on a long-standing
            ambition of the field: to use landscapes as a visual way to say something about the
            nature of the cosmos in which we find ourselves. For example, pioneers such as Frederick
            Law Olmsted, the designer of New York's Central Park, were Transcendentalists. They used
            landscapes to express their sense that there was a latent reality underlying nature,
            that it was suffused with the divine <ptr target="#thompson2014"/>.</p>
          <p>Landscapes populated by latent, invisible without instrument, AR objects could be used
            to extend a similar, but different, message. In this context, the construction
            disseminated would not be <emph>transcendence</emph>, but <emph>ubiquitous
              sentience</emph>. In the past 20 years, biologists have made numerous remarkable
            discoveries that suggest many supposedly human distinctives are not unique to our
            species at all. Trees, for example, form familial and friendship networks, and
            communicate via something akin to a fungal Internet <ptr target="#wohlleben2015"/>.
            Cetaceans have been shown to use artificial languages and form cultures while musical
            biologists suggest birds compose music equal in complexity to symphonies <ptr
              target="#conway2003"/>. Perhaps most surprisingly, recent work in molecular biology
            suggest that cells use molecules in a fashion akin to words, that their communication is
            possibly akin to language, with a semantics, syntax and pragmatics, that they
            communicate in more than one "language," and that they vote (biologists refer to it as
            quorum sensing) <ptr target="#ahmed2008"/>
            <ptr target="#bassler2009"/>
            <ptr target="#ben2004"/>
            <ptr target="#ji1999"/>. Landscape Architects have long had a commitment to design that
            reflects an ethic of ecological sustainability and highlighting plant life, stone and
            other constituents of their local regions. To our knowledge, those same architects have
            not produced designs that in humanist terminology reflect an <emph>Animal Turn</emph>, a
            commitment to highlighting the agency embedded in environments that individuals in
            modern, European-derived cultures have traditionally ignored, largely because they – and
            we – were ignorant of their existence. It would be a worthy challenge for Landscape
            Architects to derive an AR-based visual language to focus viewer attention on our
            neighbours. DNA, molecular and Protein Data – the "words" used by single cell organisms
            to communicate – would be particularly worthy material upon which to build that
            language.</p>
          <p>For the Digital Humanities, our exercise in Screwmeneutics via the Oral Tradition
            suggests that scholars have the potential to translate their traditional focus – text
            data – into visual and sonic forms of art. They also can join their colleagues in the
            arts and sciences in translating other forms of data for the same purpose. The exercise
            also suggests that so long as the intrinsic structure of source data is retained, there
            is no correct, preferred or consistent method for generating Data Art. The source data
            can be divided into its components, and, again, provided the internal structures of
            those components are retained, the appropriated sections can be placed in new sequences
            and contexts. Further, the components of a given data source can be situated with
            whatever form, medium or context that is consistent with the needs, aspirations and
            capabilities of the artist. To be sure, most artists in domains such as Protein Music
            and other forms of Data Music choose to retain the sequential structures of their source
            data in their entirety. But the insights of the Oral Tradition and the inherent
            structure of our protein and text source data suggest that this preference need not be
            so, and our experience, combined with the past behavior of some Data Artists, suggests
            that some will do so.</p>
          <p>With respect to the nature of our data, Douglas Hofstadter notes that proteins like
            music are composed of smaller components: "Music is not a mere linear sequence of notes.
            Our minds perceive pieces of music on a level far higher than that. We chunk notes into
            phrases, phrases into melodies, melodies into movements, and movements into full pieces.
            Similarly, proteins only make sense when they act as chunked units" <ptr
              target="#hofstadter1979" loc="525"/> Biologist Mary Anne Clark similarly notes that "I
            was struck by the parallels between musical structure and the structure of proteins and
            the genes that encode them. Proteins also seemed to be composed of phrases organized
            into themes. For years I was haunted by the image, and tried occasionally to interest
            musicians in making the transformation for me ..." <ptr target="#dunn1999" loc="25"/>.
            Similar observations can and have been made about the complex nature of linguistic and
            textual data, not the least, as we saw, by Harold Innis in his descriptions of the Oral
            Tradition.</p>
          <p>Our stance that some Data Artists, particularly digital humanist Data Artists, will opt
            to leverage the "phrases" and "themes" of data for artistic purposes, and connect them
            to the instrumentation, media or objects that suit their purpose, is indicated by the
            choices made by the artists who collaborated on <emph>The Five Senses</emph> and
              <emph>Emergence</emph>. In the first work, Erin MacAfee and Bill Ralph chose to work
            within the sequential confines of the data presented to them. In the second, Amy Legault
            and Mark Anderson did not, collectively producing a work that confined the Data Art to
            the sonic level, based on selections of phrases detected by Legault in the source data,
            and the selection by Anderson of non-data images derived from an on-line library. In
            each case, the artists subjectively chose the extent to which they would subject
            themselves to the structures contained in their data, and the objects, media and
            instrumentation they conflated with their data. That is no different in principle from
            what previous Data Musicians have done, where they have displayed a remarkable degree of
            ingenuity and freedom in the artistic choices underlying their compositions. In our
            work, we played with complexity, arranging and re-arranging units contained on a single
            level of biological organization. In previous work, sonic composers have played with
            hierarchy, subjectively conflating structure from different levels of biological
            organization – such as DNA data, amino acid data, and protein folds – to produce a
            composition. Our work has been an exercise in juxtaposing retrieved structure with
            selected visualization. Previous work has juxtaposed identified structure with selected
            instrumentation. The key point here is that strict adherence to a given method is not
            necessary for Data Art to retain its integrity. So long as some trace of the data's
            original structure is retained, one should expect artists, as they must, to exercise
            their own judgment on what method or array of methods is legitimate to fulfill their
            purpose.</p>

          <head>3. What are the Challenges and Possible Futures for AV in DH?</head>
          <p>Our combined use of Screwmeneutics, Harold Innis' Oral Tradition and Digital Art has
            explored one potential way that AR-based objects can be leveraged as constituents for
            Landscape Architecture. The Possibility Space for spatial AR art, however, is much
            larger, and its exploration and realization would constitute a worthy possible future
            for the Digital Humanities. One obvious way that space could be explored would be to
            change the digital content that is used to populate selected landscapes. Data Art is and
            will remain a central constituent of our future work. Indeed, we intend to further
            refine our app so that future users can incorporate their own visual and sonic
            constructs from data into it. But we also intend to incorporate other forms of art. We
            find ourselves, for example, wondering what the surreal imagination of Salvador Dali
            might have made of AR as a medium. The sky is a constant backdrop in his paintings, as
            witnessed in masterworks such as <emph>Dream Caused by the Flight of a Bee</emph>,
              <emph>Christ of Saint John of the Cross</emph>, and <emph>Santiago el Grande</emph>.
            One only has to survey a few of his works before the question arises if other spaces
            might be filled by AR objects. We are used to thinking of Landscape Architectures.
            Dali's work suggests AV digital humanists ought to expand their imagination to consider
            what a Skyscape Architecture or Seascape Architecture might look like.</p>
          <p>Two factors, one old, one new suggest why they might want to consider the development
            of such architectures. To start, it is a commonplace to observe that architects and
            interior designers, since ancient times, have sought to shape a visitor's experience of
            interior space – a given room inside a building – by importing select features from
            exterior space, ranging from the physical to the metaphysical. Whether by landscape or
              <emph>trompe l'oeil</emph> paintings, alignment of windows, doors, and ceiling oculi
            with the sun and moon, paintings with celestial motifs, or religious paintings such as
            Michelangelo's <emph>The Creation of Adam</emph>, artists have sought to use exterior
            space to create a sense of interior place. A second factor that should influence digital
            humanists is the imminent availability of smart glasses, as well as intelligent glass
            supported by smart film. Both present the possibility for immersive AR that outstrips
            the constrained field-of-view presently afforded by tablets and head-mounted displays.
            While smart glasses – which will be light, easy to wear, and feel like regular glasses –
            suggest the possibility for user access to AR content anywhere at any time, intelligent
            glass and smart film – sheets of glass and film that can alter glass opacity and display
            information – suggest the possibility that digital humanists and interior designers will
            be able to conceive and construct augmented seascapes and skyscapes.</p>
          <p>Consider the following storyboard as a possible example of what might result from an
            architect's attempt to construct a Skyscape Architecture using intelligent glass.
            Typically, the night-time sky in a city is a rather dull place. Light pollution effaces
            many if not most of the stars that might be observed, plus the Milky Way. An architect,
            say, of a restaurant might choose to exploit this gap by creating an A-Frame structure
            topped by a roof made with glass and smart film. The architect or interior designer, in
            turn, would then be free to fill the evening sky with whatever object, or array of
            objects is wished. Drawing on ceiling celestial paintings as a source of inspiration,
            our architect might opt to create a surreal display conflating the earth and moon with
            the Andromeda Galaxy, as shown in <ref target="#figure14">Figure 14</ref>. The
            restauranteur taking possession of the locale, however, would not be constrained by the
            initial skyscape provided by the architect, and could supplement it with other designs
            displaying other astronomical objects and other styles. The next evening our
            restauranteur might choose to populate the evening sky with an enlarged version of
            Jupiter juxtaposed with part of the Rosette Nebula. The following day, patrons would be
            treated to a surreal display of objects floating in the sky, as indicated in <ref
              target="#figure15">Figure 15</ref>.</p>
          <figure xml:id="figure14">

          </figure>
          <p>In such a scenario, building architecture would emerge as an interface to a new domain
            of art. And in such a scenario, sea, land and sky would emerge as platforms for the very
            sort of meaning-making that we have sought to promote in this study. Nothing is
            inevitable, but we would be very surprised if artists and digital humanists do not avail
            themselves of this opportunity to use digital form to enhance their surrounds. Such a
            step would simply be a continuation of a long history in which humans have used built
            form and modified topography for more than functional purposes. "From the most
            immemorial Hindustan pagodas to the Cathedral of Cologne," Victor Hugo writes in
              <emph>The Hunchback of Notre Dame</emph>, "architecture was the great script of the
            human race." Landscapes and buildings have been used by humans to express their yearning
            for beauty; their conception of history; their power over space; and their belief that
            humans – in the end – live in a cosmos with intrinsic purposes that can be understood.
            Now, that conversation, and that quest for meaning, can be continued in digital form, in
            new locales. And now, that conversation – in visual, sonic and topographic form – can
            express in a powerful way that the planet is replete with agency, creativity and
            dignity. We have no idea what our peers and our successors will produce. But we expect
            it will be replete with all the usual adjectives that we associate with great art:
            compelling, interesting, at times infuriating, but never boring.</p>
