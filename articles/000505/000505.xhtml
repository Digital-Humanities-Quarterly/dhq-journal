                  <p><em class="emph">The DataScapes Project</em> is an exploration of how Augmented Reality objects
                     can be used as constituents for Landscape Architecture. Using Stephen Ramsay’s
                     Screwmeneutics and Harold Innis' Oral Tradition as our theoretical points of departure,
                     the project integrated the products of Data Art – the visualisation and sonification
                     of
                     data – as the constituents for our two works: <em class="emph">The Five Senses and Emergence</em>.
                     <em class="emph">The Five Senses</em> was the product of protein data, while
                     <em class="emph">Emergence</em> was generated using text from the King James version of the Holy
                     Bible. In this exploratory treatment, we present the methods used to generate and
                     display
                     our two pieces. We further present anecdotal, qualitative evidence of viewer feedback,
                     and
                     use that as a basis to consider the ethics, challenges and opportunities that a future
                     AR
                     Landscape Architecture will present for scholars in the Digital Humanities.

                  <div class="ptext" id="p1">There is a singular privilege that accompanies living in this first century of digital
                     computation: the opportunity to discern what it means. The task is nowhere near complete.
                     We know, or think we know, that computation is having a bearing on our capacities
                     to
                     locate pattern, create and replicate pattern, and disseminate pattern. There are even
                     some
                     who believe its advent will ultimately impinge on the trajectories of natural and
                     human
                     history. Welcome to the Noosphere [<a class="ref" href="#teilhard1959">Teilhard de Chardin 1959</a>]<a class="noteRef" href="#d4e326">[1]</a>. The ambition of this exercise
                     in meaning-making is relatively more modest. We seek to explore how computation can
                     be
                     used to support the human penchant to adorn one's surrounds. More specifically, our
                     purpose here is to explore how Augmented Reality (AR) Objects can be used as constituents
                     for Landscape Architecture. In the aftermath of Ivan Sutherland's foundational work
                     in the
                     late 1960s establishing the field of computer graphics, the prospect that users might
                     seek
                     to integrate computer-generated form with their surrounds became a plausible one,
                     one
                     realized in the decades since via the medium of Augmented, and now Mixed, Reality
                     [<a class="ref" href="#acm1988">ACM 1988</a>]. In the ensuing decades, AR has emerged as an actual or potential
                     support for multiple fields, including education, construction, engineering, computer
                     gaming and firefighting. In this contribution, we present the efforts of <em class="emph">The
                        DataScapes Project</em> to explore how AR's capacity to situate and register digital
                     content might be leveraged for artistic purposes: Augmented Reality content, combined
                     with
                     constituents from Data Art, can be leveraged as raw materials for Landscape
                     Architecture.

                  <div class="ptext" id="p2">The first challenge faced by members of the project was the fundamental one of
                     determining how to proceed. We were presented with a blank canvass and had to select
                     the
                     location and method that, so to speak, would constitute our "paint." Choosing a location
                     proved to be the more straightforward of the two decisions. We were looking for a
                     readily
                     accessible space at one of our two universities, a locale that at once presented a
                     sense
                     of grand scale and a sense of enclosure. We were looking for a tract of land that
                     would
                     serve as a frame and a complement for our AR artwork. Based on that criteria, we selected
                     the traffic circle at Brock University in St. Catharines, Ontario Canada. The circle
                     is
                     140 metres in diameter, is centrally located on campus, and until recently was bounded
                     by
                     willow trees.

                  <div class="counter"><a href="#p3">3</a></div>
                  <div class="ptext" id="p3">Selecting the method and content that would constitute the matter of our creation,
                     by
                     contrast, proved more difficult. To be sure, there were multiple domains of art that
                     anticipated – in part – what we were seeking to do. The fields of Landscape Art,
                     Earthworks, and Digital Art, through their creation of anamorph and <em class="emph">trompe
                        l'oeil</em> artworks, for example, were suggestive of what an AR-based Landscape
                     Architecture might accomplish. But the three fields also differed significantly in
                     their
                     practice from what we were aiming to accomplish. To start, while Landscape Art and
                     Earthworks both make location a central constituent of artistic production, artists
                     in
                     both fields sculpt material objects – constituents from a local landscape – to generate
                     artistic form, not digital content [<a class="ref" href="#thompson2014">Thompson 2014</a>]
                     [<a class="ref" href="#herrington2017">Herrington 2017</a>]. In the domain of Digital Art, artists such as Joe
                     Crossley have sought to conflate the digital with the material by transforming static
                     empty spaces – generally building surfaces – into multi-media surfaces using projection
                     mapping. The content that is disseminated, however, is 2D, not 3D [<a class="ref" href="#crossley2017">Crossley 2017</a>].
                  </div>
                  
                  <div class="counter"><a href="#p4">4</a></div>
                  <div class="ptext" id="p4">Landscape Architecture, the primary field to which we sought to contribute, also did
                     not
                     present an obvious theoretical frame of reference, method or aesthetic to assist our
                     efforts. One dimension of the problem here is that practitioners still tend to view
                     digital tools and content as instruments to support the design of physical landscapes.
                     A
                     second problem is that the field's ontology of place is not sufficiently broad to
                     encompass the fusion of digital and physical that we sought to construct. Since the
                     Renaissance, landscape designers and gardeners, historian John Dixon Hunt argues,
                     have
                     typically divided space into three constructs or "natures," with first nature referring
                     to
                     wilderness, second nature to cultivated land, and third nature to landscapes shaped
                     with
                     aesthetic intent [<a class="ref" href="#thompson2014">Thompson 2014</a>, 38]. Some designers suggest that
                     Landscape Architects should consider adding a fourth nature to the list, one encompassing
                     reclaimed landscapes and restored habitats, while we in turn wondered if we had stumbled
                     on a fifth: landscapes containing digital annotations, objects or complements.

                  <div class="ptext" id="p5">A third issue centered on the field's self-definition. While Landscape Architecture
                     traces its origins to Landscape Gardening, the profession has maintained a complicated
                     relationship with the arts over the course of the 20th century. Then, many designers,
                     particularly in the wake of the profession's <em class="emph">1966 Declaration of Concern</em>
                     <a class="noteRef" href="#d4e374">[2]</a>,
                     suggested the focus of landscape architects should be on environmental conservation,
                     not
                     the translation of artistic or philosophical trends, be it transcendentalism or
                     post-modernism, into landscape form. Other practitioners have taken the stance that
                     the
                     primary focus of the field should be on design, here understood as landscape construction
                     that is optimized for the needs of a site's visitors and users. The artistic ambitions
                     of
                     the architect are deemed to be a secondary concern, if they are considered at all.
                     On the
                     50th anniversary of the 1966 statement, however, the Landscape Architecture Foundation
                     published a <em class="emph">New Landscape Declaration</em>, one in which architects called for a
                     renewed emphasis on aesthetics [<a class="ref" href="#landscape2017">Landscape Architecture Foundation 2017</a>]. One reason for the call was
                     the realization that aesthetic concerns are not a luxury: poor design of buildings
                     and
                     cityscapes – here understood as the mindless prioritization of utility over beauty
                     or
                     meaning – has had a deleterious social impact. Landscape architects have also stressed

                     of
                     aesthetic innovation, and that it has missed important opportunities, such as the
                     emergence of avant-garde art in the early 20th century [<a class="ref" href="#corner2017">Corner 2017</a>]

                  <div class="ptext" id="p6">Given this lack of definition, our team opted for an exploratory approach to inform
                     the
                     design of our project, one akin in the Digital Humanities to Stephen Ramsay's
                     Screwmeneutics and Kevin Ferguson's Digital Surrealism. In his seminal essay, Ramsay
                     proposes a method of scholarly activity that eschews the conduct of what he refers
                     to as
                     the "search." The "search" in this context is the practice of identifying a canon
                     – the
                     state-of-the field for a given domain of research – and then identifying a gap in
                     that
                     same canon. As scholars, we contribute to our respective fields by conducting research
                     to
                     fill that gap. But there are times, Ramsay writes, when this formulaic approach does
                     not
                     work, particularly when the researcher is attempting something new. How can the "search"
                     "help me find what I'm looking for," he writes, "when (a) I don't know what's here
                     and (b)
                     I don't know what I'm looking for?" [<a class="ref" href="#ramsay2014">Ramsay 2014</a>, 115]. For Ramsay, the
                     answer to this dilemma is to engage in what he refers to as "browsing." Drawing on
                     the
                     ideas of Roland Barthes, Ramsay proposes that we engage in the construction of the
                     <em class="emph">writerly text</em>. In contrast to the <em class="emph">readerly text</em>, which
                     involves a passive form of reading, engagement with a <em class="emph">writerly text</em>
                     presupposes a process of composition, an immersion of the reader into the flux of
                     existence, and initiation of a process of discovery and systematization: the connection
                     by
                     the reader of the content from the given text with a context, be it another item of
                     content, a person, or a compelling idea. The theory of the <em class="emph">writerly text</em>,
                     Barthes writes, "is a practice (that of the writer), not a science, a method, a research
                     ... this theory can produce only theoreticians or practitioners, not specialists (critics,
                     researchers, professors, students)" [<a class="ref" href="#ramsay2014">Ramsay 2014</a>, 119].

                  <div class="ptext" id="p7">Via this process, Ramsay argues, the humanist defines a path through culture, thereby
                     providing the Humanist – or, if you will, the Screwmeneuticist – with perspective,
                     the
                     platform necessary to support discovery, desire and questioning. One useful first
                     step in
                     defining such a pathway was undertaken by David Ferguson in his recent visual analysis
                     of
                     Disney animations, where he brings his artistic artefact of interest – the film –
                     into
                     relation with the concept of complex. Any artefact of interest, he suggests, can be
                     dissected and its components re-articulated into new combinations. However, while
                     useful,
                     Ferguson's method for applying Screwmeneutics is not appropriate for our purposes
                     for two
                     reasons. First, its aim is ultimately analytic, not generative. It seeks, like all
                     Structuralist methodologies, to locate the intrinsic properties – the hidden archetypal
                     structures – of a given art-form. Its purpose is not scenario exploration. It does
                     not
                     seek to conduct an exercise exploring the potential ways an art-form <em class="emph">might</em>
                     exist. It seeks instead to define the way a given form <em class="emph">already</em> exists.
                     Second, and by extension, Ferguson's methodology, and structuralist methodologies
                     in
                     general, are ones that collapse the dimension of time. They presuppose objects of
                     analysis
                     that operate in a synchronic fashion [<a class="ref" href="#ferguson2017">Ferguson 2017</a>]
                     [<a class="ref" href="#merrell1975">Merrell 1975</a>]. We, by contrast, were seeking to create Augmented Reality,
                     multi-media landscape complexes that could incorporate the dimension of time, and
                     more
                     specifically would incorporate temporal art forms such as music. Our purpose, in the
                     end,
                     was to generate an artwork that would serve, in Seymour Papert's words, as an
                     object-to-think-with, and in Barthes' words, as a <em class="emph">writerly text</em>
                     [<a class="ref" href="#papert1980">Papert 1980</a>]. Given that we were aiming to create something that was new,
                     we sought to construct an artefact that would provide definition, suggest potential,
                     and
                     present questions and connections for future artists and humanists to explore.

                  <div class="ptext" id="p8">For these reasons, we opted to employ a different Screwmeneutic method to conceive
                     and
                     develop our landscape complex, namely Harold Innis' concept of the Oral Tradition.
                     For
                     those unfamiliar with his work, Harold Innis was a media theorist and one of the founders
                     of the Toronto School of Communication. Between 1940 and 1952 he produced a set of
                     works,
                     including <em class="emph">Empire and Communications</em> and <em class="emph">The Bias of
                        Communication</em> that were dedicated to exploring the physical, formal and cognitive
                     effects of communication media. A political economist by training, Innis turned to
                     the
                     study of communications in 1940 because he perceived, not surprisingly, that the world
                     was
                     falling apart. How was it possible, he asked in the final decade of his life, that
                     the
                     world, after enduring the insanity and carnage of the First World War, should so readily
                     plunge itself into a Second? The answer, he believed, was to be found in the grand
                     sweep
                     of global history. What factors, he wondered, enabled societies to thrive? And what,
                     by
                     contrast, led to their dysfunction and eventual collapse? His lived experience, combined
                     with his studies of the past, convinced him that human collectives functioned much
                     like
                     biological organisms. The vitality, adaptability, indeed the sanity, of institutions,
                     nations and empires were dependent on the environmental circumstances in which they
                     found
                     themselves. Since the inputs and outputs of human-environmental interaction were largely
                     mediated by communication devices, Innis set high store on their importance in global
                     history. The political and cultural periodization of history, Innis believed, could
                     be
                     correlated with the invention or adoption of new communication technologies. So could
                     the
                     pathologies that afflicted cultures. There was a price to be paid for the unthinking
                     use
                     of technology, and in his writings Innis pointed to two: cognitive rigidity and cognitive
                     flux [<a class="ref" href="#innis1946">Innis 1946</a>]
                     [<a class="ref" href="#bonnett2017">Bonnett 2017</a>]. Technology historically had produced pathological forms of
                     groupthink in which cultures either focused on the wrong thing (due to cognitive rigidity,
                     or bias), or no thing at all (due to cognitive flux). With its judgment impaired by
                     one of
                     the two pathologies, a given culture would lose its ability to discern the opportunities
                     and threats latent in its environment, fail to innovate, fail to compete and as a
                     result
                     fall prey to its competitors [<a class="ref" href="#bonnett2013">Bonnett 2013</a>, 191–198].

                     regimes
                     inevitably went the way of Nineveh and Tyre <a class="noteRef" href="#d4e458">[3]</a>, Innis believed it was possible to construct a culture that retained its vitality
                     and resilience via an ethic he referred to as the Oral Tradition. The Oral Tradition,
                     as
                     Innis conceived it, was not a call to forsake writing and adopt pre-literate Greek
                     communication practices that relied on memory and voice. Instead, like Barthes, Innis
                     called on his readers to adopt an <em class="emph">active stance</em> toward knowledge, a
                     willingness to alter constructs and formalisms to meet the needs and experience of
                     the
                     present. Such a stance, Innis argued, had enabled the Greeks to make their innovations
                     in
                     theology, philosophy, science, politics and art. The Oral Tradition was also distinguished
                     by its reliance on linguistic and aesthetic formalisms that were characterized by
                     internal
                     complexity and hierarchy. The power of such formalisms lay in their latent potential.
                     They
                     contained multiple constituents that could be arranged and re-arranged at will, enabling
                     artists to explore new aesthetic constructs, and philosophers new intellectual
                     possibilities, through the separation, interpolation and translation of content. In
                     its
                     essence, it was a serio-comic method, one that enabled Greece to shift its conception
                     of
                     nature from one based on myth to one shaped by science [<a class="ref" href="#bonnett2013">Bonnett 2013</a>, 209–217].<a class="noteRef" href="#d4e492">[4]</a></div>

                  <div class="ptext" id="p10">A third feature of the Oral Tradition, one deriving from its commitment to active
                     manipulation of knowledge, was its use of multi-modal forms of expression. The reason
                     Innis named his communication ethic the Oral Tradition in the first place was due
                     to the
                     influence of linguist Edward Sapir, who noted the "formal richness" of ancient
                     communication practices, practices that contained "a latent luxuriance of expression
                     that
                     eclipses anything known to modern civilization" [<a class="ref" href="#innis1950">Innis 1950</a>, 8–9]. Such
                     luxuriance of expression, and with it enhanced expressive potential, could be purchased
                     in
                     the present by creating formalisms that combined written, vocal and visual forms of
                     representation. Such forms in principle presented possibilities for information
                     visualization – which would assist in the location of significant environmental patterns
                     –
                     and information translation – which would enhance viewer understanding of the construct's

                     centuries, for example, Innis noted Andrea Alciati's invention of the emblem book,
                     a
                     construct in which poetry, "one of the oldest arts, was combined with engraving, one
                     of
                     the newest" [Innis 2015, 101] The rationale for so doing was provided by Francis Bacon,
                     who argued that emblems "reduce intellectual conceptions to sensible images and that
                     which
                     is sensible strikes the memory and is more easily imprinted on it than that which
                     is
                     intellectual'" [<a class="ref" href="#innis2015">Innis 2015</a>, 101]

                     Oral
                     Tradition: a commitment to integrate both spatial and temporal forms of representation.
                     Because of its present and historic relationship with the art of poetry, Innis argued,
                     the
                     Oral Tradition "implied a concern with time and religion. 'The artist represents
                     <em class="emph">coexistence in space</em>, the poet <em class="emph">succession in time</em>' (Lessing at
                     the University of Berlin, 1810)" [<a class="ref" href="#innis1951">Innis 1951</a>, 102]. In his own economic
                     work, Innis would apply this characteristic of the Oral Tradition by interpolating
                     time
                     series of price data with maps to track the emergent patterns of North American economic
                     history, years before the practice become common via Geographic Information Systems

                     parlance can be characterized as an open-source ethic, one in which content and form
                     was
                     routinely lifted from one work and integrated into another. "The great epics," Innis
                     writes, "were probably developed out of lays constantly retold and amplified. Old
                     ballads
                     were replaced by combinations of a number of episodes into a unity of action. The
                     epic was
                     characterized by extreme complexity and unity" [<a class="ref" href="#innis1950">Innis 1950</a>, 72].

                     to use
                     the methods and modes associated with Data Art. Also referred to as Information Art,
                     Data
                     Art rests on the premise that the world is replete with forms that can be harvested
                     for
                     artistic purposes. It chiefly emerged from scientific efforts to use sight and sound
                     analogues as a method to locate significant patterns and relationships in large data
                     sets.
                     From that effort, multiple intriguing genres of art have emerged, particularly in
                     the
                     field of music, such as DNA music [<a class="ref" href="#gena1995">Gena and Strom 1995</a>], protein music [<a class="ref" href="#dunn1999">Dunn and Clark 1999</a>], microbial and meteorological music [<a class="ref" href="#larsen2013">Larsen and Gilbert 2013</a>],
                     and even a music of the spheres, music compositions derived from astronomical data
                     [<a class="ref" href="#ballora2013">Ballora and Smoot 2013</a>]. With Data Art, we were presented in principle with a method
                     that would enable us to translate a given data set at once into visual and sonic form.

                  <div class="ptext" id="p13">Once we had a mode for our AR landscape, the next, more difficult step was determining
                     its matter, the data that would provide the pattern, the source of serial distinctions
                     for
                     our artworks. The team's decision-making here was determined by the following factors:
                     our
                     decision to produce two works, contingent circumstance, and the intellectual interest
                     of
                     project team members. The contingent circumstance centered on our need to locate
                     sonification software. While Bill Ralph, a mathematician, and Mark Anderson, a computer
                     scientist, respectively possessed the skills required to visualize our data, we had
                     no one
                     with the requisite ability to translate raw data into musical form. After a fairly
                     protracted search (there is not a lot of proprietary or open-source software dedicated
                     to
                     supporting the generation of Data Art) we were able to locate <em class="emph">MusicWonk</em>, an
                     application developed by John Dunn, a pioneer in computer music and art since the
                     1970s<em class="emph">.</em> While <em class="emph">MusicWonk</em> is purportedly able to able to work
                     with any data set, the software specializes in supporting the creation of Genetic
                     Music
                     from DNA and Protein Data. The application's website provides tutorials and links
                     to
                     multiple libraries of genetic sequences, including the one we used: the U.S. National
                     Institutes of Health GenBank [<a class="ref" href="#algorithmic2015">Algorithmic 2015</a>]. Based on this
                     specialization, we opted to use protein data and to create an artwork called <em class="emph">The
                        Five Senses</em>, a composition of five movements which would respectively be
                     constructed from protein data supporting Sight, Smell, Touch, Taste and Hearing in
                     humans.

                  <div class="ptext" id="p14">Our data selection was also prompted by the team's interest in the construct of change
                     known as self-organization or emergent change, a ubiquitous phenomenon in the natural
                     and
                     social sciences studied by the Science of Complexity [<a class="ref" href="#waldrop1992">Waldrop 1992</a>]
                     [<a class="ref" href="#gell1994">Gell 1994</a>]. It was also prompted by the observation of scholars such as
                     Werner Jaeger and Harold Innis that different domains of human activity – such as
                     science,
                     philosophy and theology – often produce constructs of change that are very similar
                     [<a class="ref" href="#innis1950">Innis 1950</a>, 93]. It was finally prompted by the observation of John
                     Bonnett that a number of parallels could be found between the core concepts of emergent
                     change – such as positive feedback, the governance of formal cause, and the teleological
                     governance of system attractors – and the philosophy of history associated with the
                     Christian Bible. Economists, for example, often characterize positive feedback as
                     the
                     Matthew Effect, given that the process of cumulative change it describes matches the
                     dynamic Jesus describes in the Parable of the Talents, where the rich became richer
                     and
                     poor poorer [<a class="ref" href="#rigney2010">Rigney 2010</a>]. Given these parallels, we opted to create a
                     second work simply titled <em class="emph">Emergence</em> based on source text from the Bible. Like
                     <em class="emph">The Five Senses</em>, we planned a composition featuring five movements, with
                     each piece named after a constituent concept of self-organization, respectively
                     "Emergence," "Differentiation," "Regulation," "Selection" and "Attractor." Each piece,
                     in
                     turn, would rest on data taken from the King James version of the Bible, text that
                     provided narrative or mythic analogues to the concepts of positive feedback, formal
                     cause,
                     and so on.

                  <div class="ptext" id="p15">With the terms of composition settled, the team's next step was to identify the specific
                     data sets we wanted to use for each composition and then begin the process of
                     sonification. The proteins selected for <em class="emph">The Five Senses</em> are shown in <a href="#figure01">Figure 1</a>, while the biblical texts selected for
                     <em class="emph">Emergence</em> are shown in <a href="#figure02">Figure 2</a>. The process
                     of sonification for <em class="emph">The Five Senses</em> began by harvesting the letter data
                     associated with each protein record, such as that shown in <a href="#figure03">Figure
                        3</a>. In many ways, NIH protein records resemble what any researcher might find in a
                     library catalogue for a book listing, with metadata describing authors, key words,
                     versions and the like. However, NIH records also feature a sequence of letters where
                     one
                     typically would find Library of Congress or equivalent subject headings describing
                     a
                     book's contents. Those letters collectively constitute the protein described in the
                     given
                     record. In <a href="#figure03">Figure 3</a>, the highlighted letter sequence refers
                     to the amino acids making Medium Wave sensitive opsin 1 (Homo sapiens), a protein
                     contained in green cone photopigment that we used to generate the work <em class="emph">Sight</em>.
                     These letter sequences provided the patterned sequences that would be translated into
                     notes for <em class="emph">Sight</em>. Similar letter sequences generated the notation for the four
                     remaining movements of <em class="emph">The Five Senses</em>, while the biblical passages provided
                     the initial basis for <em class="emph">Emergence</em>.

                  <div class="ptext" id="p16">The process of sonification for both compositions was initiated in <em class="emph">MusicWonk</em>
                     first by converting every letter from every dataset into a counterpart number, with
                     A
                     equaling 1, B equaling 2, Z equaling 26, and so on. Once an entire letter set from
                     a given
                     dataset had been translated, the software then aligned the numeric series with a specified
                     music scale, producing a raw music string, as shown in <a href="#figure04">Figure
                        4</a>. From that point, the project's two music composers – Erin MacAfee and Amy
                     Legault – had two methods of composition and two modes of operating with their source
                     data
                     open to them. The first method of composition – selected by neither – was to use the
                     algorithmic method of music composition supported by <em class="emph">MusicWonk</em>. There, the
                     raw music string is transformed by feeding it through a set of components that control
                     features such as tempo, chords, instrumentation and the like. The process, shown in
                     <a href="#figure05">Figure 5</a>, is akin to creating an algorithm using a visual
                     programming language, or creating an electronic circuit.

                     software package. The appeal of <em class="emph">Finale</em> for Legault and MacAfee is that it
                     presented methods for music notation that were familiar to them, most notably by featuring
                     an interface and tools that supported viewing and direct manipulation of music string
                     notation. With <em class="emph">Finale</em>, the two were able to alter note duration, inscribe

                        Senses</em> was minimalist. While she was willing to alter select attributes in her
                     file, such as rhythm, instrumentation and the duration of individual notes, she was
                     not
                     inclined to alter the tonal sequence inherited from her datasets. Legault's approach,
                     by
                     contrast, was more interventionist. Instead of viewing her inherited notation series
                     as a
                     fixed object, she opted to view her raw music strings as libraries from which she
                     could
                     splice identified musical components. The appropriated sections were – much like the

                     in Innis' Oral Tradition – placed in new sequences and were integrated into established

                     on
                     their visual correlates. Ralph is also an algorithmic artist, one who describes his
                     work
                     as "an attempt to make a visual connection with the enormous complexity and unity
                     that
                     lies within the rich mathematical objects that inspire my images" [<a class="ref" href="#ralph2018">Ralph 2018</a>]. He is particularly interested in mathematical objects that can generate chaotic,
                     dynamic systems, and has used them to generate dynamic and static works distinguished
                     by
                     their complex topologies and colour. From the standpoint of this project, Ralph's
                     approach
                     was ideal because it often relied on source data to drive the generation of a given
                     work.
                     For <em class="emph">The Five Senses</em>, he used proprietary algorithms driven by two inputs. The
                     first source of pattern was the set of distinctions obtained via a sequential progression
                     through the data. The second source was the set of relationships detected by the algorithm
                     between different, non-proximate strings contained in the data. Both were leveraged
                     to
                     provide a visual focus to our landscape composition. For <em class="emph">Emergence</em>, Mark
                     Anderson used a different approach. Instead of deriving his images from the data,

                  <div class="ptext" id="p20">With the sonification and visualization of our two works complete, two further tasks
                     remained, the first being the construction and overlay of a digital set to display
                     <em class="emph">The Five Senses</em> and <em class="emph">Emergence</em>. Given that we conceived our two
                     works as Landscape Architecture, and that the Brock Traffic Circle – our selected
                     first
                     venue – was 140 metres in diameter, the parameters of our project mandated that the
                     components of our digital set be relatively large in size for the visualizations to
                     be
                     observable and for them in turn to serve as artistic complements to the surrounding
                     landscape. That need was further compounded by the presence of the physical statue,
                     known
                     as She-Wolf, situated in the midst of the circle, and the scaffolding and the four
                     4.6
                     metre-high QR code signs we installed to activate and situate our digital works. All
                     three
                     objects are shown in <a href="#figure06">Figure 6</a>, and all three required
                     effacing by the digital set to prevent their disruption of the impact of our AR Landscape
                     works. Accordingly, the set shown in <a href="#figure07">Figure 7</a> was designed
                     by John Bonnett using <em class="emph">SketchUp</em> to display <em class="emph">The Five Senses</em> and
                     <em class="emph">Emergence</em>. The set is bounded by eight 9-metre-high monoliths, with the
                     front of each monolith displaying a graphic representing the title of the movement
                     currently under display. <a href="#figure08">Figure 8</a>, for example, shows the
                     graphics for the movement <em class="emph">Touch</em> on the left and <em class="emph">Differentiation</em>
                     on the right. The centre of the set is composed of two components. The cylinder at
                     the
                     base is used to cover the statue, scaffold and QR code signs mentioned above. Floating
                     above it is a 9 metre object used to display the given movement's visualization. For
                     <em class="emph">The Five Senses</em>, a cube was used to display the artwork, while a sphere was
                     used for <em class="emph">Emergence</em>.

                     The
                     app only worked at a distance of 6 metres or less from the QR code signs, to prevent
                     unsafe viewing of the exhibit by, for example, drivers circumnavigating the circle.
                     The
                     <em class="emph">DataScapes</em> application was developed using <em class="emph">Vuforia</em>, an SDK
                     (Software Development Kit) designed to facilitate the development of AR applications
                     on
                     mobile devices. Leveraging 3D objects, planar surfaces and patterns situated in the
                     environment, <em class="emph">Vuforia</em> is able to determine the user's position and camera
                     orientation relative to objects such as the project's QR Code signs, and in turn to
                     situate and register computer-generated 3D objects. These capabilities enabled team
                     programmers Joe Bolton and Mark Anderson to fulfill another requirement for the
                     <em class="emph">DataScapes</em> app: the capacity to move around and within the artwork.
                     <em class="emph">Vuforia</em>'s capabilities, combined with GPS and gyroscopic data, enabled the
                     <em class="emph">DataScapes</em> app to track the movement of viewers, and in response to change
                     the orientation and rendering of displayed objects in real-time, to make our digital
                     objects seem as if they were integrated and locked into the natural landscape.

                     app in <a href="#figure11">Figure 11</a> (For an earlier treatment of <em class="emph">The
                        DataScapes Project</em>, see Bonnett et al. 2018). The first version of the
                     <em class="emph">DataScapes</em> app in our estimation was a partial success, both technically,
                     and with respect to audience reception. With respect to the app's functionality, our
                     initial trials of the two works were hindered by two difficulties. The first and perhaps
                     most disappointing setback was the inadequate processing power of the two Asus 12"
                     tablets
                     we had on hand for viewing the display. The tablets did not have the capacity to
                     simultaneously render and register our set while simultaneously displaying our data
                     visualizations in dynamic form. Despite our best efforts to find work-around solutions
                     on
                     site, we had to settle for the necessary compromise of presenting Bill Ralph's and
                     Mark
                     Anderson's respective visualizations in static form. A second difficulty centered
                     on the
                     stability of the set. While the first version of the app adequately anchored our set
                     to
                     the Brock traffic circle, several of its constituents, most notably its monoliths,
                     tended
                     to vibrate or jitter in a way that was at once distracting and unpleasant. These
                     deficiencies have been partially remedied in the second and third versions of our
                     app. Our
                     intention in these two iterations was to develop portable versions that would display
                     <em class="emph">The Five Senses</em> and <em class="emph">Emergence</em> indoors, while remedying some of
                     the performance failures identified in the first. Version two, shown in the animation
                     featured in <a href="#figure12">Figure 12</a>, was designed to support Mark Anderson
                     for an Edge Hill University lecture dedicated to the Art of Computing, and presents
                     the
                     project as a wall display. Version three, shown in <a href="#figure13">Figure
                        13</a>, transformed the orientation and scale of the project yet again, by adapting it
                     for display as a table-top installation. In both, we were able to better stabilize
                     the
                     display of our set. And in both, we were able to add some dynamism to the display,
                     albeit
                     by introducing movement into the set rather than our visualizations. Both iterations
                     required changes to the application, most notably by changing the way <em class="emph">Vuforia</em>
                     searched for targets and changing the orientation of the 3D content it displayed in
                     relation to those targets. In addition, we also removed the initial application's
                     use of
                     GPS tracking code, as that functionality was specifically designed to support the
                     geo-location of 3D content on the Brock traffic circle, and further designed to hinder
                     the
                     display of content to users not on campus. Finally, we reduced the size of QR code
                     displays used with versions 2 and 3 of the <em class="emph">DataScapes</em> app and designed each
                     version to generate displays proportional in size to the QR code target. Via this
                     step,
                     the user can print a code on a piece of paper and generate a display proportional
                     in size
                     to the underlying table.

                     trial. Our rationale for this approach as opposed to more extensive and expensive
                     methods
                     used in Human Computer Interaction (HCI) and elsewhere is due, in part, to concerns

                     to take
                     a craft-based approach to user assessment. In fields such as web design, argues Gerd
                     Waloszek, a former interface designer with SAP, the metric for success for a given
                     design
                     is not its authentication via an HCI analysis of design <em class="emph">consumers</em>. The real
                     metric rests on whether other design <em class="emph">producers</em> copy the design, making it a

                     Eisenstein and Hellmut Lehmann-Haupt note a similar process in the history of the
                     print
                     book. Through experimentation and appropriation of designs from competitors, printers
                     such
                     as Peter Schoeffer collectively generated the conventions of the modern book, such
                     as
                     tables of contents, title pages, running heads and footnotes [<a class="ref" href="#eisenstein1979">Eisenstein 1979</a>]

                     our effort will depend on whether other artists, landscape architects and digital
                     humanists choose to emulate our approach to landscape design, because they like it,
                     and
                     because they believe it will induce a favorable reaction from their respective audiences.
                     The best we can do is report what we learned from our viewers and suggest the questions
                     and implications that stem from those observations. We will be "successful" if colleagues
                     choose to mimic those efforts and address the questions we have raised.

                     artists – and important questions that arose from each. General viewers for the most
                     part
                     found our various pieces engaging, reporting an intrinsic fascination with the fact
                     that
                     data, particularly protein data, could be translated into art forms, particularly
                     music.
                     That feedback raised an important question for us, however. Is Data Art intrinsically
                     compelling on its own? Is it capable of generating an intellectual or affective response
                     from viewers without annotation, or must it be presented with an accompanying spoken
                     or
                     written context to maintain viewer interest? This is, of course, not a new question
                     in the
                     history of art and Landscape Architecture, where practitioners continue to argue whether
                     art should attempt to communicate a concept or message – such as the need for
                     environmental sustainability – or instead focus on generating an emotional response
                     from
                     viewers [<a class="ref" href="#thompson2014">Thompson 2014</a>]. A related question is whether artists and Landscape
                     Architects can generate the sensory "languages," be it visual, sonic, olfactory or
                     something else, required to successfully communicate the artist's message to an audience
                     without textual assistance.

                     While most viewers found the project's content and approach very interesting, some
                     took
                     exception to our temporary appropriation of the Brock traffic circle (we used it for
                     one
                     week), particularly since it already contained a physical statue that was surrounded
                     by
                     the project's scaffolding and QR codes. One artist deemed the metal framing and the
                     statue's digital effacement problematic. Another deemed it a violation. This feedback
                     raised fascinating ethical and political questions for us. To be sure, the infrastructure
                     we constructed around the physical <em class="emph">She-Wolf</em> statute did hinder proper viewing
                     of the statue. Whether it constituted a violation depends on your point of view. Until
                     artists raised the issue with us, the construction of the scaffolding and QR codes
                     prompted no concern from project participants, nor did it for the university officials
                     who
                     granted us permission to use the space. We meant no disrespect. It was not our intention
                     to make a comment on the statue, nor to damage it. But some artists did see our temporary
                     occupation of the space as an unacceptable abridgement on the statue's integrity and
                     the

                     will
                     not be a permanent component of AR Land Architecture, or more generally, AR-based
                     artforms
                     in future. We used them because current technology requires their use to situate and
                     register content. In future, artists will be able to use RTK GPS (Real-time Kinematic
                     Geographic Positioning System) data to position content with centimetre and even
                     millimetre level accuracy. That expedient will resolve the issue of the art form's
                     physical intrusion into a given space, but not its digital annotation. Is it ethical
                     for
                     one artist to use digital methods to efface, comment upon, add to, mock, or alter
                     the
                     context of a physical artwork created by another, even if the digital annotation is
                     not
                     visible to the naked eye? To that ethical question we can add a political one: who
                     gets to
                     add that annotation? The complexity and sensitivity of this question was anticipated
                     in
                     2017 in New York when the statue <em class="emph">Fearless Girl</em> (sculpted by Kristen Visbal)
                     was placed in proximity to the statue <em class="emph">Charging Bull,</em> a work situated on
                     Broadway and long associated with Wall Street and the city's financial district. To
                     many,
                     <em class="emph">Fearless Girl</em> presented an important message of female empowerment.
                     <em class="emph">Charging Bull</em>'s sculptor Arturo Di Modica, however, was outraged, arguing
                     that <em class="emph">Fearless Girl</em>'s proximity and positioning transformed the meaning of his
                     statue, from one symbolizing prosperity and strength, to that of villain [<a class="ref" href="#dobnik2017">Dobnik 2017</a>]
                     [<a class="ref" href="#mettler2017">Mettler 2017</a>]. The controversy raised multiple questions, ones that we now
                     face with our project. When an artist makes an intrusion into a space, does that space
                     become sacrosanct? Artists have long made interventions into spaces that they deem
                     to be
                     playful, even provocative. Are those intrusions to be exempted from three-dimensional
                     annotations that some will label as legitimate super-positions or rejoinders, others
                     as
                     graffiti, and others as outrageous violations? Who gets to decide the issue? These
                     issues
                     will become increasingly central as AR becomes a ubiquitous communication medium.

                        ambition of the field: to use landscapes as a visual way to say something about the
                        nature of the cosmos in which we find ourselves. For example, pioneers such as Frederick

                        data
                        can be divided into its components, and, again, provided the internal structures of
                        those components are retained, the appropriated sections can be placed in new sequences
                        and contexts. Further, the components of a given data source can be situated with
                        whatever form, medium or context that is consistent with the needs, aspirations and
                        capabilities of the artist. To be sure, most artists in domains such as Protein Music
                        and other forms of Data Music choose to retain the sequential structures of their
                        source
                        data in their entirety. But the insights of the Oral Tradition and the inherent
                        structure of our protein and text source data suggest that this preference need not
                        be
                        so, and our experience, combined with the past behavior of some Data Artists, suggests
                        that some will do so.

                     <div class="ptext" id="p34">With respect to the nature of our data, Douglas Hofstadter notes that proteins like
                        music are composed of smaller components: "Music is not a mere linear sequence of
                        notes.
                        Our minds perceive pieces of music on a level far higher than that. We chunk notes
                        into
                        phrases, phrases into melodies, melodies into movements, and movements into full pieces.
                        Similarly, proteins only make sense when they act as chunked units" [<a class="ref" href="#hofstadter1979">Hofstadter 1979</a>, 525] Biologist Mary Anne Clark similarly notes that "I
                        was struck by the parallels between musical structure and the structure of proteins
                        and
                        the genes that encode them. Proteins also seemed to be composed of phrases organized
                        into themes. For years I was haunted by the image, and tried occasionally to interest
                        musicians in making the transformation for me ..." [<a class="ref" href="#dunn1999">Dunn and Clark 1999</a>, 25].
                        Similar observations can and have been made about the complex nature of linguistic
                        and
                        textual data, not the least, as we saw, by Harold Innis in his descriptions of the

                        Tradition.

                     <div class="ptext" id="p35">Our stance that some Data Artists, particularly digital humanist Data Artists, will
                        opt
                        to leverage the "phrases" and "themes" of data for artistic purposes, and connect
                        them
                        to the instrumentation, media or objects that suit their purpose, is indicated by
                        the
                        choices made by the artists who collaborated on <em class="emph">The Five Senses</em> and
                        <em class="emph">Emergence</em>. In the first work, Erin MacAfee and Bill Ralph chose to work
                        within the sequential confines of the data presented to them. In the second, Amy Legault
                        and Mark Anderson did not, collectively producing a work that confined the Data Art
                        to
                        the sonic level, based on selections of phrases detected by Legault in the source
                        data,
                        and the selection by Anderson of non-data images derived from an on-line library.
                        In
                        each case, the artists subjectively chose the extent to which they would subject
                        themselves to the structures contained in their data, and the objects, media and
                        instrumentation they conflated with their data. That is no different in principle
                        from
                        what previous Data Musicians have done, where they have displayed a remarkable degree
                        of
                        ingenuity and freedom in the artistic choices underlying their compositions. In our
                        work, we played with complexity, arranging and re-arranging units contained on a single
                        level of biological organization. In previous work, sonic composers have played with
                        hierarchy, subjectively conflating structure from different levels of biological
                        organization – such as DNA data, amino acid data, and protein folds – to produce a
                        composition. Our work has been an exercise in juxtaposing retrieved structure with
                        selected visualization. Previous work has juxtaposed identified structure with selected
                        instrumentation. The key point here is that strict adherence to a given method is
                        not
                        necessary for Data Art to retain its integrity. So long as some trace of the data's
                        original structure is retained, one should expect artists, as they must, to exercise
                        their own judgment on what method or array of methods is legitimate to fulfill their
                        purpose.

                        explored one potential way that AR-based objects can be leveraged as constituents
                        for
                        Landscape Architecture. The Possibility Space for spatial AR art, however, is much
                        larger, and its exploration and realization would constitute a worthy possible future
                        for the Digital Humanities. One obvious way that space could be explored would be
                        to
                        change the digital content that is used to populate selected landscapes. Data Art
                        is and
                        will remain a central constituent of our future work. Indeed, we intend to further
                        refine our app so that future users can incorporate their own visual and sonic
                        constructs from data into it. But we also intend to incorporate other forms of art.
                        We
                        find ourselves, for example, wondering what the surreal imagination of Salvador Dali
                        might have made of AR as a medium. The sky is a constant backdrop in his paintings,
                        as
                        witnessed in masterworks such as <em class="emph">Dream Caused by the Flight of a Bee</em>,
                        <em class="emph">Christ of Saint John of the Cross</em>, and <em class="emph">Santiago el Grande</em>.
                        One only has to survey a few of his works before the question arises if other spaces
                        might be filled by AR objects. We are used to thinking of Landscape Architectures.
                        Dali's work suggests AV digital humanists ought to expand their imagination to consider
                        what a Skyscape Architecture or Seascape Architecture might look like.

                     <div class="ptext" id="p37">Two factors, one old, one new suggest why they might want to consider the development
                        of such architectures. To start, it is a commonplace to observe that architects and
                        interior designers, since ancient times, have sought to shape a visitor's experience
                        of
                        interior space – a given room inside a building – by importing select features from
                        exterior space, ranging from the physical to the metaphysical. Whether by landscape
                        or
                        <em class="emph">trompe l'oeil</em> paintings, alignment of windows, doors, and ceiling oculi
                        with the sun and moon, paintings with celestial motifs, or religious paintings such
                        as
                        Michelangelo's <em class="emph">The Creation of Adam</em>, artists have sought to use exterior
                        space to create a sense of interior place. A second factor that should influence digital
                        humanists is the imminent availability of smart glasses, as well as intelligent glass
                        supported by smart film. Both present the possibility for immersive AR that outstrips
                        the constrained field-of-view presently afforded by tablets and head-mounted displays.
                        While smart glasses – which will be light, easy to wear, and feel like regular glasses
                        –
                        suggest the possibility for user access to AR content anywhere at any time, intelligent
                        glass and smart film – sheets of glass and film that can alter glass opacity and display
                        information – suggest the possibility that digital humanists and interior designers
                        will
                        be able to conceive and construct augmented seascapes and skyscapes.
                     </div>
                     
                     <div class="counter"><a href="#p38">38</a></div>
                     <div class="ptext" id="p38">Consider the following storyboard as a possible example of what might result from
                        an
                        architect's attempt to construct a Skyscape Architecture using intelligent glass.
                        Typically, the night-time sky in a city is a rather dull place. Light pollution effaces
                        many if not most of the stars that might be observed, plus the Milky Way. An architect,
                        say, of a restaurant might choose to exploit this gap by creating an A-Frame structure
                        topped by a roof made with glass and smart film. The architect or interior designer,
                        in
                        turn, would then be free to fill the evening sky with whatever object, or array of
                        objects is wished. Drawing on ceiling celestial paintings as a source of inspiration,
                        our architect might opt to create a surreal display conflating the earth and moon
                        with
                        the Andromeda Galaxy, as shown in <a href="#figure14">Figure 14</a>. The
                        restauranteur taking possession of the locale, however, would not be constrained by
                        the
                        initial skyscape provided by the architect, and could supplement it with other designs
                        displaying other astronomical objects and other styles. The next evening our
                        restauranteur might choose to populate the evening sky with an enlarged version of
                        Jupiter juxtaposed with part of the Rosette Nebula. The following day, patrons would
                        be
                        treated to a surreal display of objects floating in the sky, as indicated in <a href="#figure15">Figure 15</a>.

                     <div class="ptext" id="p39">In such a scenario, building architecture would emerge as an interface to a new domain
                        of art. And in such a scenario, sea, land and sky would emerge as platforms for the
                        very
                        sort of meaning-making that we have sought to promote in this study. Nothing is
                        inevitable, but we would be very surprised if artists and digital humanists do not
                        avail
                        themselves of this opportunity to use digital form to enhance their surrounds. Such
                        a
                        step would simply be a continuation of a long history in which humans have used built
                        form and modified topography for more than functional purposes. "From the most
                        immemorial Hindustan pagodas to the Cathedral of Cologne," Victor Hugo writes in
                        <em class="emph">The Hunchback of Notre Dame</em>, "architecture was the great script of the
                        human race." Landscapes and buildings have been used by humans to express their yearning
                        for beauty; their conception of history; their power over space; and their belief
                        that
                        humans – in the end – live in a cosmos with intrinsic purposes that can be understood.
                        Now, that conversation, and that quest for meaning, can be continued in digital form,
                        in
                        new locales. And now, that conversation – in visual, sonic and topographic form –
                        can
                        express in a powerful way that the planet is replete with agency, creativity and
                        dignity. We have no idea what our peers and our successors will produce. But we expect
                        it will be replete with all the usual adjectives that we associate with great art:
                        compelling, interesting, at times infuriating, but never boring.

                     the
                     poem is this: <br /><br />
                     <em class="emph">      Far-called, our navies melt away;</em><br /><br />
                     <em class="emph">             On dune and headland sinks the fire:</em><br /><br />
                     <em class="emph">Lo, all our pomp of yesterday</em><br /><br />
                     <em class="emph">Is one with Nineveh and Tyre!</em><br /><br />
                     The entire poem can be found at <a href="https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/46780/recessional" onclick="window.open('https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/46780/recessional'); return false" class="ref">https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/46780/recessional</a>
