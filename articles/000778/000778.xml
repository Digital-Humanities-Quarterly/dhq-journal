         <dhq:abstract>
           <p>This paper examines the ethical implications of public, internet-based history projects that list enslaved people 
              by name. It does so by considering the appropriateness of the ethics statement written by the Principal 
              Investigators at Enslaved: Peoples of the Historical Slave Trade (or 
              <ref target="https://enslaved.org/">Enslaved.org</ref>). Enslaved.org directly addresses the urgent call to 
              document the history of people of African descent more fully. Housed at <name>Michigan State University</name>, the 
              project centers the Black experience globally, with most projects to date focused on <name>North America</name>. 
              Contributors to Enslaved.org tell the stories of named enslaved individuals by extracting what is often fragmentary 
              information (names, ages, skills, injuries, African ethnicities, etc.) from a vast range of primary source 
              documentation and by assembling that data into datasets. The Enslaved.org team makes the datasets available, 
              searchable, and understandable on its open-source platform 
              (<ref target="https://enslaved.org/">https://enslaved.org/</ref>) and through its peer-reviewed journal, 
              <title rend="italic">The Journal of Slavery and Data Preservation</title> 
              (<ref target="https://jsdp.enslaved.org/">https://jsdp.enslaved.org/</ref>). The Principal Investigators are 
              committed to identifying by name as many enslaved people as possible and to representing individual and collective 
              experiences in an international, humane, and ethical frame and to working collaboratively with researchers and 
              descendant communities to continually develop and follow practices that respect the lives of enslaved people. The 
              paper considers the appropriateness of the Enslaved.org ethics statement for datasets focused on slavery in a 
              variety of places and concludes with a call for historians to work closely with descendant communities in compiling 
              and publishing data that names enslaved individuals.

          <head/>
            <p>In March 1870, a committee of the State House of Representatives in <name>Columbus</name>, 
               <name>Ohio</name>, convened to decide the legitimacy of the election of <name>Elijah 
               Glover</name> to the office of Representative from <name>Scioto County</name>. 
               <name>Glover</name> had bested his opponent by twenty-three votes. However, forty-five of 
               those who cast ballots were suspected of being <quote rend="inline">negroes or colored 
               persons</quote> who had been brought to the polls by <name>Glover</name>'s party. Therefore, 
               an elector in <name>Scioto</name> contested the election, which resulted in the forty-five 
               voters being questioned to determine if each had <quote rend="inline">a preponderance of 
               white blood</quote>. If they did not, they did not have the right to cast a ballot. During 
               the hearing, one such voter, <name>Henry Wilson</name>, was asked if he had been qualified 
               to vote. <quote rend="inline">I think I was</quote>, he stated. <quote rend="inline">All 
               the reason I have to know is, I was told my father was a white man, and my mother, I 
               suppose, about half-and-half</quote>. Mustering up the courage to reveal more, he said of 
               his father, <quote rend="inline">I knew him; he was a white man; he was my former 
               master</quote>. He explained that it <quote rend="inline">never was disputed in the 
               neighborhood</quote> that the man was his father <quote rend="inline">but always believed, 
               on account of the resemblance between my father and me</quote>. Asked how the white man 
               responded to talk about his being <name>Wilson</name>'s father, <name>Wilson</name> replied, 
               <quote rend="inline">He did not say anything because they did not say it in his presence</quote> 
               <ptr target="#oga1871"/>.
            </p>
            <p>In testimony after testimony, contested genealogies were central to claims of voting rights 
               in the <name>Scioto</name> election. And every case hinged on pseudoscientific ideas about 
               race, race mixing, and racial purity. Power dynamics meant that the bloodlines of 
               established <quote rend="inline">white</quote> families were not questioned, but those of 
               <quote rend="inline">negroes and coloreds</quote> were. Unsurprisingly, no one who appeared 
               before the committee had documents stating who their parents were. Most said they only had 
               knowledge of their mothers. When asked about fathers, many responded with a variation of 
               <quote rend="inline">I was toldâ€¦</quote>. Of this, <name>Frederick Douglass</name> had 
               written fifteen years earlier, <quote rend="inline">Slavery does away with fathers, as it 
               does away with families</quote>. Like <name>Henry Wilson</name>, <name>Douglass</name> 
               recalled that some <quote rend="inline">whispered that my master was my father</quote>, but 
               whispers were all he had. Later, <name>Douglass</name> wrote in his autobiography, 
               <quote rend="inline">The reader must not expect me to say much of my family. Genealogical 
               trees did not flourish among slaves</quote> <ptr target="#fields2022" loc="605"/>. This is 
               to say that in the <name>United States</name> as elsewhere, dislocation, violence, and the 
               threat of violence set limits on how enslaved people's families were constituted, severing 
               connections to kin and rendering unknowable much of their genealogy.
            </p>
            <p>However, since the 1990s, advances in computer technologies and the internet, along with the 
               widespread availability of genetic testing, have facilitated the reconstruction of some 
               branches of genealogical trees, making knowable now much of what was unknowable or only 
               whispered about in the past. Computer and internet technologies allow for the mining of 
               datasets containing information about hundreds, thousands, millions, and tens of millions of 
               enslaved individuals. Assembled by researchers and corporations, online datasets have become 
               foundational for professional historians undertaking research, and they aid genealogists in the 
               construction of family histories, linking people of African descent to their enslaved and free 
               forebearers.
            </p>
            <p>This paper explores the ethics of creating scholarly, internet-based historical datasets that 
               identify enslaved individuals by name.<note>I define scholarly, internet-based datasets as 
               datasets created by public or private college or university researchers and housed on college 
               or university servers. These datasets are usually open-source, free to anyone with a computer 
               and internet connection. Funding for such projects is usually derived from universities, grants, 
               and donations. I define corporate datasets as datasets created by for-profit or non-profit 
               corporations (excluding private colleges and universities). These datasets are housed on corporate 
               servers, and the funding for such projects is usually derived from subscription fees and advertising. 
               Some corporate sites offer limited access to resources without a subscription fee and with the 
               submission of identifying information.</note> In parts of the world, including the 
               <name>United States</name>, descendants of enslaved people generally welcome the publication of such 
               datasets because they feel empowered to shout names that in the past had been whispered or were lost. 
               Today, many African Americans want to trace the branches, trunks, and roots of their family trees, 
               and online datasets can facilitate this undertaking. Names, after all, are a tangible link to the 
               past and are central to genealogical projects. However, elsewhere in the world, not all descendants 
               of enslaved people want their family histories known. In some places, descendants of enslaved people 
               encourage silences around family history since a family's historical links to slavery carries a 
               stigma. By contrasting the <name>United States</name> and <name>Africa</name>, this paper urges 
               scholars to consider the context-specific ethics of creating websites with historical data about 
               named enslaved individuals. It also examines the role of online data platforms like

               (<ref target="https://enslaved.org/">https://enslaved.org/</ref>), which is also known as

               [<name>MSU</name>]; <name>University of California, Riverside</name>; <name>University 
               of Maryland</name>; the National Endowment for the Humanities; and Mellon Foundation), 
               <title rend="italic">Enslaved.org</title> is a scholarly website housed at Matrix: 
               Center for Digital Humanities &amp; Social Sciences at <name>MSU</name> 
               (<ref target="https://matrix.msu.edu/">https://matrix.msu.edu/</ref>). The platform 
               publishes datasets that contributors construct by extracting data from a great range of 
               primary sources. Each dataset is concerned with identifying people of African descent 
               who were enslaved in any part of the world before state-legislated abolition. Among the 
               sources contributors have consulted are books of marriage and baptism, runaway advertisements, 
               inventories, wills, sales records, arrest records, court cases, and coroners' reports. The 
               intake for the project is an online journal, the <title rend="italic">Journal of Slavery and 
               Data Preservation</title> (<title rend="italic">JSDP</title>; 
               <ref target="https://jsdp.enslaved.org/">https://jsdp.enslaved.org/</ref>). After a peer- or 
               in-house review process and, if requested, revisions, contributors' datasets and data 
               articles (essays that contextualize the data) are published on the open-source platform. 
               They are housed on Matrix servers and copies are also preserved at Dataverse at <name>Harvard 
               University</name> 
               (<ref target="https://dataverse.harvard.edu/">https://dataverse.harvard.edu/</ref>).
            </p>
            <p>Each contributor is expected to submit a dataset (spreadsheet) in which each line has 
               information about a person and each column or field has information about a characteristic, 
               such as name, age, sex, ethnolinguistic indicator, location, children, skills, injuries, 
               and enslaver name. The nature of the primary source(s) shapes the fields that are contained 
               in a dataset. On the <title rend="italic">Enslaved.org</title> platform, a technology called 
               linked open data allows users to search, aggregate, and analyze datasets' contents. Users 
               may also download datasets in a variety of formats to analyze on their computers. Among 
               other things, the project offers a controlled vocabulary and information about 
               best practices for dataset construction 
               (<ref target="https://docs.enslaved.org/">https://docs.enslaved.org/</ref>), as well as an 
               ethics statement 
               (<ref target="https://enslaved.org/statementofEthics/">https://enslaved.org/statementofEthics/</ref>).
            </p>
            <p>The <title rend="italic">Enslaved.org</title> team designed the site with a variety of 
               audiences in mind. University researchers are one audience, and from experiences with 
               <title rend="italic">Slave Biographies</title> 
               (<ref target="http://slavebiographies.org/">http://slavebiographies.org/</ref>), which was 
               the precursor to <title rend="italic">Enslaved.org</title>, the team knew that educators, 
               students, genealogists, descendant communities, and a host of people interested history and the 
               study of slavery would visit the site. They have, and the <title rend="italic">Enslaved.org</title> 
               team constructed and continues to modify its platform to be user friendly for non-scholarly 
               audiences. In addition to datasets, the site features short biographies of enslaved individuals 
               about whom there is considerable information 
               (<ref target="https://enslaved.org/stories/all/">https://enslaved.org/stories/all/</ref>). To date, 
               the site contains information about more than 600,000 named individuals in North and 
               <name>South America</name>.
            </p>
            <p>To be sure, there are many steps necessary to connect a person living today to an enslaved person 
               in a dataset published in <title rend="italic">JSDP</title>. Nonetheless, Black genealogists have 
               made discoveries through <title rend="italic">Enslaved.org</title>. For example, while searching 
               across datasets on the platform, <name>Meghan Wilson</name> of <name>Detroit</name> found information 
               linking her to <name>Hannah Johnson</name>, who was enslaved in <name>Louisiana</name>, and was, 
               <name>Wilson</name> learned, her great-great-great-great grandmother. <quote rend="inline">There 
               is a power in knowing</quote>, <name>Wilson</name> told <name>Krystal Nurse</name>, a reporter 
               for the <title rend="italic">Lansing State Journal</title>. <quote rend="inline">I'm not sure what 
               will come of that, but to know that there is a person that lived on the <name>[John] Johnson 
               Plantation</name> in <name>New Orleans</name> in the 1860s gives me a history and access to 
               history I didn't know before</quote> <ptr target="#nurse2021"/>.
            </p>
            <p>What made <name>Wilson</name>'s discovery possible was the fact that <name>Hannah Johnson</name> 
               is named in an <title rend="italic">Enslaved.org</title> dataset. When it would do no harm, 
               <title rend="italic">Enslaved.org</title> is committed to naming as many enslaved people as
               possible in the datasets that it publishes. Why? Names facilitate discoveries and emphasize the 
               humanity of those who enslavers commodified. With the humanity of the enslaved in mind, 
               <title rend="italic">Enslaved.org</title> seeks submissions from those who recognize that primary 
               source material reflects the biases of its authors; it was shaped by the systems of power â€” by 
               the violence â€” under which enslaved people suffered. In <name>Jessica Marie Johnson</name>'s apt 
               description, a <quote rend="inline">devastating archive</quote> resulted from enslavers' 
               commodification and quantification of Black bodies <ptr target="#johnson2018" loc="58"/>. The 
               challenge, then, is to construct datasets with an eye toward reading against the grain of the 
               racist perspectives of enslavers and presenting enslaved people as individuals about whom something 
               can be known from the primary sources in which shards of information about them were recorded. 
               That is, the challenge is presenting them as more than numbers.
            </p>
            <p><title rend="italic">Enslaved.org</title> addresses this challenge in part by encouraging 
               submissions that allow users of the platform to do more than dwell on numbers. To be sure, studies 
               that have quantified various aspects of the trade in and lives of enslaved people have advanced 
               knowledge about slavery and slave systems. Such studies have revealed, among other things, that 
               approximately one million enslaved people were sold across state lines in the <name>United 
               States</name> from 1801 to 1860. But numbers do not get at the lived experiences of people. Behind 
               every number derived from statistical and quantitative analyses are individuals whose stories are 
               worth exploring because there is a power in knowing. Detailing the lives of the enslaved can honor 
               them and inform us.
            </p>
            <p>This is to say that it is important to know that among the one million traded across state lines 
               in the <name>United States</name> were the twenty-year-old <name>Harriet</name> and her two-year-old 
               daughter, <name>Julia Ann</name>. They were sold in 1831 in <name>Orleans Parish</name>, 
               <name>Louisiana</name>, by Franklin &amp; Armfield, a trading company that had arranged for their 
               shipment from <name>Sumner County Tennessee</name>. Beside the mother and child were 
               <name>Delosia</name>, <name>William</name>, <name>Peter</name>, <name>Washington</name>, and 
               <name>Aaron</name>, along with dozens of others from <name>Sumner</name>, who were scattered among 
               different buyers in and around <name>New Orleans</name>. Fragmentary details, including the names 
               of 1,600 enslaved people sold by Franklin &amp; Armfield in the 1820s and 1830s, are available in 
               the <title rend="italic">JSDP</title> and through <title rend="italic">Enslaved.org</title> in a 
               dataset dataset published by <name>Joshua D. Rothman</name> <ptr target="#rothman2022"/>. The 
               dataset and accompanying data article respond to <name>Johnson</name>'s call for digital humanists 
               <quote rend="inline">to infuse their work with a methodology and praxis that centers the descendants 
               of the enslaved</quote> and that <quote rend="inline">grapples with the uncomfortable, messy, and 
               unquantifiable</quote> <ptr target="#johnson2018" loc="71"/>. That is, the dataset is about more than 
               numbers. It focuses on the lives of named individuals whose stories might otherwise go untold.
            </p>
            <p>With a broad range of users, including descendants of the enslaved, in mind, the 
               <title rend="italic">Enslaved.org</title> team is also committed to ethical and sustainable 
               practices in data stewardship and digital accessibility. That is, to limit barriers to the access of 
               data, the team relies on open-source software and utilizes accessibility tools, so that anyone with 
               a computer and internet connection can access the site and its data. The team stresses that information 
               about people who were bought and sold should not, itself, be commodified. Such information should be 
               available for free to anyone who wants to learn and teach about the lives of enslaved individuals, 
               families, and communities â€” to anyone who wants to dwell on a name.
            </p>
            <p>But is it always appropriate to make available on the internet data that allow people to dwell 
               on names of enslaved people and, possibly, link those names to people living today? That is, 
               do all descendants want knowledge of their genealogies to be facilitated by searches of public 
               websites? If the answer is no, what should digital historians do when their desires to make known 
               previously unknown details about vulnerable populations from the past collide with the desires of 
               descendants in the present?
            </p>
            <p>Some influential scholarly organizations have grappled with related questions. For example, the 
               Association of internet Researchers (AoIR) offers valuable guidance 
               (<ref target="https://aoir.org/reports/ethics2.pdf">https://aoir.org/reports/ethics2.pdf</ref>). 
               Related to the study of enslaved people, the AoIR stresses in the first point of its ethics statement, 
               <quote rend="inline">The greater the vulnerability of the community / author / participant, the 
               greater the obligation of the researcher to protect the community / author / participant</quote>. The 
               statement continues, <quote rend="inline">Because all digital information at some point involves 
               individual persons, consideration of principles related to research on human subjects may be 
               necessary even if it is not immediately apparent how and where persons are involved in the research 
               data</quote> <ptr target="#markham_etal2012"/>. Apropos to the databasing of named enslaved 
               individuals from the past, it may not be immediately apparent to researchers how living descendants 
               of the enslaved are connected to our data, but researchers should consider the implications of their 
               research on broad human populations and particularly on vulnerable populations. A consideration 
               of living human subjects is also part and parcel of the guidelines of the American Anthropological 
               Association (AAA; <ref target="https://ethics.americananthro.org/ethics-statement-1-do-no-harm/">https://ethics.americananthro.org/ethics-statement-1-do-no-harm/</ref>). 
               Listed first in the AAA's statement is that the researcher's primary obligation is to 
               <quote rend="inline">do no harm</quote>, including harm <quote rend="inline">to dignity, and to 
               bodily and material well-being, especially when research is conducted among vulnerable populations</quote>. 
               This obligation, the association's statement emphasizes, <quote rend="inline">can supersede the 
               goal of seeking new knowledge</quote> <ptr target="#aaa2012"/>.
            </p>
            <p>Following the AoIR and AAA, to ensure that we do no harm through the publication of online datasets 
               that detail the lives of named enslaved individuals, digital historians must understand the history 
               of descendant communities and how they are affected by the legacy of slavery today. That is, we must 
               develop an understanding of how and why descendants want their histories told or silenced. To be sure, 
               our tellings of history will not be embraced by everyone. In print and online publications, we can 
               and should spark debate, challenge beliefs, and cause discomfort. We historians build arguments based on 
               evidence and are under no obligation to tell histories as others want them told. But we are obliged to 
               do no harm to vulnerable populations and that obligation supersedes goals to advance new knowledge.
            </p>
            <p>As the 1870 hearings over the <name>Scioto</name> election make clear, power dynamics and violence 
               wrought upon people color meant that before 1865 African Americans both silenced and were denied 
               knowledge of aspects of their family histories. Online datasets that list the names of enslaved 
               people have the potential to make known some of what has long been unspoken or unknown. The 
               questions researchers should answer before they publish such datasets are: Given power dynamics 
               that operate today, does our research place descendants at risk? That is, do our online scholarly 
               datasets have the potential to do harm? If so, are there ways we can structure datasets to ensure 
               that they do not harm? If not, are there ways that we can structure online scholarly datasets so that 
               they serve broad audiences that include descendants?
            </p>
            <p>The remainder of this paper examines how and why descendants of enslaved people in two parts of the world 
               â€” <name>North America</name> and <name>Africa</name> â€” have wanted their family histories made known 
               or silenced. The paper concludes with thoughts about the creation of online historical datasets about 
               enslaved people in both geographic locations.

          <head>Black Genealogists in the <name>United States</name></head>
            <p>Those descended from enslaved people in the <name>United States</name> have long sought and 
               made public information about their forebearers. This desire was expressed in the decades following 
               the adoption of the Thirteenth Amendment to the Constitution in 1865. Then, African Americans were 
               part of what <name>FranÃ§ois Weil</name> describes as a <quote rend="inline">genealogical mania</quote> 
               that swept across the country <ptr target="#weil2013" loc="139â€“140"/>. The motivation of white Americans 
               who participated in this mania was clear. Family trees rooted in <name>Western Europe</name> justified 
               the place of a white family in the racial hierarchy of the <name>United States</name>. This was, after 
               all, a period when racist theories about heredity were foundational to ideas about intelligence. 
               Whiteness also brought with it a variety of rights and opportunities <ptr target="#morgan2021" loc="20â€“51"/>. 
               A family's claims to whiteness and greatness were buttressed by what was often fanciful evidence of 
               bloodlines stretching to important European forebearers and especially those allied with the first 
               Norman king of <name>England</name>, <name>William the Conqueror</name>. Thus, the 1871 genealogy of 
               the <name>Lee</name> family of <name>Virginia</name>, which included <name>Robert E. Lee</name>, stressed, 
               <quote rend="inline">In the eleventh century, we find the name of <name>Laucelot Lee</name>, 
               <name>Loudon</name>, <name>France</name>, as an honored associate of <name>William the Conqueror</name></quote> 
               <ptr target="#mead1871" loc="9"/>. In 1888, <name>Adin Ballou</name> published his family's history, 
               stating, <quote rend="inline">The very strong probability, if not absolute certainty, is that we are 
               the remote descendants of a Norman Chieftain, who, in 1066, came over from <name>France</name> into 
               <name>England</name> with <name>William the Conqueror</name></quote> <ptr target="#ballou1888" loc="v"/>.
            </p>
            <p>The motivations of most African Americans who made public information about their genealogies were 
               different. Before the Civil War ended and for decades after, African Americans spread information 
               in print publications such as the <title rend="italic">Christian Advocate</title> about their parents, 
               grandparents, children, siblings, aunts, uncles, and grandchildren as they searched for relatives who 
               had been traded away under slavery or had dispersed in the chaos of war. Hence, in 1883, 
               <name>Easter Carding</name> posted a note in the <title rend="italic">Advocate</title> asking for 
               information about her relatives: <quote rend="inline">Father was <name>Shearfe</name>, grandmother 
               <name>Gracey</name>, Aunt <name>Cheney</name>, grandmother and father left East <name>Tennessee</name> 
               with the Indians, nearly forty years ago, sold to <name>Jesse Mayfield</name>. Aunt <name>Easter</name> 
               was sold to <name>Austin Ryder</name>, near the same time</quote>. And, in 1894, <name>Robert 
               Brown</name>, who was the son of <name>Harriett Brown</name> of <name>Stafford County</name>, 
               <name>Virginia</name>, sought information about the whereabouts of <quote rend="inline">his grandfather, 
               <name>Elijah Brown</name>; [and] his grand uncle, <name>Edward Brown</name>; his brother <name>Wm. 
               Brown</name></quote>. Each of these relatives had <quote rend="inline">belonged to Mrs. <name>Cornelius 
               Lucas</name></quote>. These and other powerful stories of named formerly enslaved individuals who were 
               seeking loved ones are available on the website <title rend="italic">Last Seen: Finding Family After 
               Slavery</title> <ptr target="#ls_n.d."/>.
            </p>
            <p>Further, after the Civil War, those identified as <q>colored</q> sought rights by making known 
               aspects of their genealogies. This was evident in <name>Scioto</name>, <name>Ohio</name>, where 
               <q>colored</q> men traced what they knew of their genealogies to prove that they had the right 
               to vote. Similar cases sprung up in other states in the late-nineteenth and early-twentieth centuries 
               as <q>coloreds</q> sought rights under a dizzying array of laws about the mixture of blood that made 
               a person white or <q>negro</q> <ptr target="#mangum1940" loc="1â€“17"/>. In 1866, a majority on the 
               Michigan Supreme Court defined white as less than one-quarter Black blood <ptr target="#people1866"/>. 
               Elsewhere, <q>negro</q> was defined as, among other things, <quote rend="inline">mixed blood within 
               three generations</quote>, <quote rend="inline">one-sixteenth or more African blood</quote>, 
               <quote rend="inline">one-eighth or more African blood</quote>, and <quote rend="inline">anyone with 
               any trace of Negro blood</quote>. Proving any of this required a knowledge of genealogy, which was 
               disputed in case after case <ptr target="#harris1993" loc="1738â€“1740"/>. Knowledge of genealogy was 
               also necessary to prove descent from Indigenous Americans, whose rights were different from those of 
               Black Americans. So, when <name>Cyril P. Sunseri</name> sought the annulment of his marriage to 
               <name>Verna Cassagne</name> because he had come to suspect that her deceased great-great grandmother 
               had been Black, the court heard testimony about <name>Verna</name>'s family tree. <name>Verna</name> 
               prevailed by arguing that her great-great grandmother had been a slave, but one of Indigenous descent 
               imported from <name>Santo Domingo</name>. This meant that <name>Verna</name> did not have any trace of 
               <quote rend="inline">negro blood</quote>, so there were no grounds for an annulment 
               <ptr target="#sunseri1938"/>.
            </p>
            <p>Wealthy, established African Americans, particularly in the northeast, had other motivations for 
               exploring their family history. <quote rend="inline">Enamored of royalty and nobility</quote>, 
               <name>Willard B. Gatewood, Jr.</name>, writes, <quote rend="inline">many black aristocrats were 
               experts in genealogy and drew up family trees whose roots and branches included an assortment of 
               African princes, European royalty, Caucasian statesmen, Madagascan noblemen, and Indian 
               chieftains</quote> <ptr target="#gatewood1988" loc="9"/>. Some established Black genealogical 
               societies, such as the Society of New York (1884), the Society of the Daughters of New York (1886), 
               and the Society of the Descendants of Early New England Negroes (1920s). Prominent among this 
               Black elite was <name>Daniel Alexander Payne Murray</name>, the youngest son of enslaved parents 
               who had been freed in <name>Maryland</name>. <name>Murray</name> went on to become a librarian 
               and bibliographer at the <name>Library of Congress</name>. He compiled biographies of influential 
               people of African descent for a planned encyclopedia and researched his own family's genealogy, 
               serving as a model for others who wanted to do the same <ptr target="#cole_n.d."/>. As part of his 
               research for <title rend="quotes">Lives of World-Famous Quadroons and Octoroons</title>, which 
               he never published, he set out to amass <quote rend="inline">as much genealogy as can be 
               obtained</quote>. In so doing, he made assertions about the family trees of some influential 
               <q>white</q> Americans, such as <name>Judah P. Benjamin</name>, a prominent lawyer in 
               <name>New Orleans</name> who defended Southern succession and the trade in enslaved Africans. 
               Through an attorney, <name>Benjamin</name> threatened a lawsuit over <name>Murray</name>'s claim 
               that his family tree included people descended from Africans <ptr target="#benjamin2014" loc="210"/>.
            </p>
            <p>Evidence for Black enthusiasm for genealogy after the emancipation can also be found in the fact 
               that commercially printed family tree templates were marketed to both Black and white consumers 
               in the period. These colorful lithographs contained empty spaces for family member's names and 
               birth, marriage, and death dates. The <name>Library of Congress</name> displays one such lithograph 
               on its website. Dated ca. 1880 and printed by the Krebs Lithographing Company in <name>Cincinnati</name>, 
               <name>Ohio</name>, it depicts three scenes of Black family life, one <quote rend="inline">Before 
               the [Civil] War</quote> and two <quote rend="inline">Since the War</quote>, and contains spaces for 
               purchasers to fill in their family records <ptr target="#krebs1880"/>.
            </p>
            <p>These examples make clear that in the late-nineteenth and early-twentieth centuries African 
               Americans researched and made known their genealogies and histories as an expression of pride 
               in their families' accomplishments and to claim rights, unmask injustices, and reconstitute families.
            </p>
            <p>Historian <name>Carter G. Woodson</name> was no exception. As <name>Pero Gaglo Dagbovie</name> notes, 
               <name>Woodson</name> <quote rend="inline">often instructed black youth during Negro History Week to 
               interview their elders and document the histories of their families and communities</quote> 
               <ptr target="#dagbovie2012" loc="12"/>. <name>Woodson</name> also worked with the Research Department 
               of the Association for the Study of Negro Life and History to compile a historical dataset with 
               information from the period before emancipation. After mining the 1830 U.S. Census for data, 
               <name>Woodson</name> and the Research Department published the dataset, <title rend="quotes">Free 
               Negro Owners of Slaves in the United States in 1830</title>, in 1924. The goal was for names 
               derived from the census to <quote rend="inline">serve as a link between the past and present</quote>. 
               <name>Woodson</name> and his team arranged data into fields or columns, each with a heading â€” 
               name, number of enslaved people owned, total number of people in the household, and the age range of 
               people in the household. The dataset was divided by state and county. In the journal, a short article 
               explains the methodology and importance of the dataset. Further, from names in the dataset, 
               <name>Woodson</name> and his research group developed short biographies, such as that of 
               <name>Samuel Gibson</name>, <quote rend="inline">a Negro of <name>Mississippi</name>, in 1844, when 
               he brought his six slaves to <name>Cincinnati</name>, <name>Ohio</name>, and settled them on free 
               territory</quote> <ptr target="#asnlh2024" loc="60"/> <ptr target="#hawthorne2024" loc="309â€“318"/>.
            </p>
            <p>In his 1924 publication, <name>Woodson</name> and the Research Department foreshadowed an 
               influential methodological approach that involved applying computer-aided analyses to larger 
               and larger datasets in the study of slavery. However, what <name>Woodson</name> did that was different 
               from many who followed was to use datasets as a tool to examine the lives of named individuals. 
               In much dataset-based scholarship of historians and economists in the 1960s, individuals were not 
               present. Indeed, cliometricians of the period stressed quantification and statistical analyses to 
               derive estimates for the size over time of large trades in enslaved people and to draw conclusions 
               about broad populations' origins, productivity, and living conditions. Historical debates among 
               scholars engaged in numbers-driven approaches to the study of slavery have sometimes been dubbed a 
               <quote rend="inline">numbers game</quote> <ptr target="#curtin1969" loc="3"/>. The approach had 
               its critics, including <name>Herbert Gutman</name>, who wrote that it tells <quote rend="inline">us 
               nothing of importance about the beliefs and behavior of enslaved Afro-Americans</quote> since it 
               does not explore the lives of individuals <ptr target="#gutman1975" loc="227"/>. As <name>Gwendolyn 
               Midlo Hall</name> wrote, <quote rend="inline">Historical databases are wonderful, innovative toolsâ€¦. 
               But there are some questions that are simply beyond their capabilities</quote> 
               <ptr target="#hall2010" loc="138"/>.
            </p>
            <p><name>Hall</name>'s cautionary note is particularly important since she, herself, was a pioneer 
               among those taking data-informed approaches to the study of the history of slavery. But 
               <name>Hall</name> forged a path like that of <name>Woodson</name>. In her work, she dwelled on 
               individuals and sought ways to humanize the experience of the enslaved. <name>Hall</name> began 
               work on a dataset in the 1980s, deriving data from archival sources that provided insight into 
               the lives of named enslaved individuals. From books of marriages and baptisms, runaway 
               advertisements, inventories, sales records, arrest records, court cases, and other documents 
               produced in colonial <name>Louisiana</name>, she extracted data and transcribed them into a 
               spreadsheet. Each row represented one person. Each column had standardized information about a 
               characteristic: the enslaved person's name and, when available, their age, sex, marriage partner, 
               children, skills, injuries, illnesses, ethnolinguistic group, monetary value, and more.

            <p>Containing information about more than 100,000 people, most of whom are named, <name>Hall</name>'s 
               dataset had a significant impact on the study of slavery. It was the evidentiary base for, among 
               other books, her <title rend="italic">Africans in Colonial Louisiana: The Development of Afro-Creole 
               Culture in the Eighteenth-Century</title> <ptr target="#hall1992"/>. She also published the dataset 
               as a CD-ROM with the Louisiana State University Press <ptr target="#hall2000"/>, as well as on a 
               website sponsored by the <name>University of North Carolina</name> and I-Biblio under the title

               <ref target="http://www.ibiblio.org/laslave">http://www.ibiblio.org/laslave</ref>. Later, she 
               published a revised and updated version on <title rend="italic">Slave Biographies</title>, a 
               project at <name>Michigan State University</name> that she was co-principal investigator on 
               (<ref target="http://slavebiographies.org">http://slavebiographies.org</ref>). Under a grant 
               from the Mellon Foundation, <name>Hall</name> advised <name>Dean Rehberger</name>, 
               <name>Daryle Williams</name>, and me as we refashioned <title rend="italic">Slave Biographies</title> 
               into <title rend="italic">Enslaved.org</title> and launched it in 2020 with the first issue of 
               <title rend="italic">JSDP</title>, which included her dataset

            <p>To be sure, <name>Hall</name>'s dataset has been of great use to historians exploring slavery in 
               <name>Louisiana</name>. Further, much to her delight, the dataset attracted the attention of African 
               American genealogists writing their family histories, and many made public declarations of their 
               excitement for the fact that <name>Hall</name> listed the names of enslaved people to whom they 
               might trace their ancestry. A transcript from 1999 of the Ancestral Digs Conference Room of an 
               African American genealogical group reveals the enthusiasm in Black genealogical circles for 
               <name>Hall</name>'s work 
               (<ref target="https://www.afrigeneas.com/library/hall091499.html">https://www.afrigeneas.com/library/hall091499.html</ref>). 
               One of the organizers began the meeting by exclaiming, <quote rend="inline"><name>Dr. Hall</name>

               website that her online dataset was used by genealogists because it <quote rend="inline">provided

            <p><name>Hall</name>'s dataset tapped into a groundswell of interest in genealogy in the <name>United 
               States</name>, and particularly in Black genealogy, which has roots stretching to the late-nineteenth 
               century. In the mid- and late-twentieth century, Black genealogists were energized by the Civil 
               Rights Movement and the publication of <name>Alex Haley</name>'s <title rend="italic">Roots</title>, 
               which opened the possibility of tracing African American ancestry to enslaved forebearers and 
               beyond to <name>Africa</name> itself <ptr target="#haley1976"/>. The following year, Black and 
               white Americans were captivated by the <title rend="italic">Roots</title> television miniseries 
               <ptr target="#roots1977"/>. The same year, <name>Charles L. Blockson</name> published 
               <title rend="italic">Black Genealogy</title>, which served as a guide for African Americans 
               wanting knowledge of their families' pasts <ptr target="#blockson1977" loc="2"/>. Black interest 
               in genealogy spiked again in 2006, when Harvard professor and public intellectual <name>Henry 
               Louis Gates, Jr.</name> first aired the <title rend="italic">African American Lives</title> series, 
               which traced the ancestry of influential African Americans. That series later morphed into 
               <title rend="italic">Faces of America</title> and then <title rend="italic">Finding Your Roots</title>, 
               which has aired since 2012 <ptr target="#gates2006"/> <ptr target="#gates2010"/>. Each of 
               these genealogical projects is aimed, at least in part, at identifying named enslaved individuals 
               in the past, which is something scholarly data projects can facilitate.
            </p>
            <p>The power of naming enslaved people in <name>North America</name> is also on display elsewhere. 
               Completed in the early 2000s, the African American Civil War Memorial includes carvings in stone 
               of the names of all known African Americans, most of whom had been enslaved, who fought in the war. 
               Since its opening in 2016, the <name>National Museum of African American History and Culture</name> 
               has had exhibits that identify enslaved people by name. The <name>Whitney Plantation</name>, a 
               museum outside <name>New Orleans</name>, also engages with the public through lists of the names 
               of enslaved people. Their exhibit is comprised of stone panels into which the names of the enslaved 
               who labored on the plantation are carved. Further, the Black Lives Matter movement has emphasized 
               the imperative to <q>speak their names</q>, to honor the humanity and mourn the deaths of those 
               whose lives have been unjustly taken because of the violence of racism. Their names, the movement 
               urges, should be proclaimed loudly.
            </p>
            <p>It is clear from the outpouring of support from the Black genealogical community in the 
               <name>United States</name> that <name>Hall</name>'s online dataset was embraced for detailing 
               the lives of named individuals who suffered under enslavement in <name>Louisiana</name>. To help 
               people find linkages to those made known in her dataset, <name>Hall</name> insisted that her 
               dataset be available online in an open-source format, so anyone with a computer and connection 
               to the internet can access this information. Other scholarly projects have done the same â€” 
               insisting that data on enslaved people be free available for the benefit of professional 
               historians, teachers, genealogists, and anyone who seeks understandings about slavery 
               (see, for example, <ref target="https://enslaved.org/"><title rend="italic">Enslaved.org</title></ref>,

            <p>However, the rise in interest in genealogy has sparked explosive growth in the online commercial 
               market, where for-pay access to genealogical data is the norm. A variety of commercial computer 
               products gave access to ancestral data in the 1980s. In the 1990s, corporations moved their 
               ancestral research products to the internet. There, <title rend="italic">Ancestry.com</title> 
               (https://www.ancestry.com/) controls the lion's share of the market, as it has under a variety 
               of names since its founding. In 2020, the Blackstone Group acquired 
               <title rend="italic">Ancestry.com</title> for $4.7 billion. The company now controls access to 
               30 billion historical records and has data from more than 20 million DNA kits and 125 million 
               customer-produced family trees <ptr target="#robinson-sweet2021"/>. The other large organizations 
               in the online genealogy space are <title rend="italic">FamilySearch</title> 
               (<ref target="https://www.familysearch.org/en/united-states/">https://www.familysearch.org/en/united-states/</ref>), 
               which does not charge a subscription fee for most services, and <title rend="italic">FindMyPast</title> 
               (<ref target="https://www.findmypast.com/">https://www.findmypast.com/</ref>) and 
               <title rend="italic">MyHeritage</title> (<ref target="https://www.myheritage.com/">https://www.myheritage.com/</ref>), 
               which both charge subscription fees. These organizations have generated and are benefitting from 
               an enormous interest in family history. Among other things, commercial genealogical companies 
               offer online access to historical records that have information about millions of named enslaved 
               individuals, and each company markets specifically to African American audiences 
               <ptr target="#thomas_etal2019" loc="145â€“150"/>.
            </p>
            <p>As the <name>Scioto</name> hearings demonstrated in 1870, knowledge of one's ancestors could 
               bestow rights and opportunities in the nineteenth century. And, for some, knowledge of one's 
               genealogy can do the same today. As colleges and universities across the <name>United States</name> 
               have explored how their histories are entangled with slavery, conversations have turned toward atoning 
               for the lasting damage done to the descendants of enslaved people who were bought, sold, and rented by 
               institutions of higher education. Thus, <name>Georgetown University</name> has made descent from an 
               enslaved people who labored for the university a factor in admissions decisions 
               <ptr target="#georgetown_n.d."/>. Further, in 2021, <name>Virginia</name>'s governor signed legislation 
               requiring five colleges in the state to identify and memorialize the enslaved people who labored at 
               the schools and to offer scholarships to their descendants <ptr target="#lis2021"/>. Other 
               universities and state legislatures are also grappling with the question of reparations for slavery. 
               <name>California</name> recently set in motion a plan to require its state agencies to create a new 
               category in employee data records. That category will have demographic data about African Americans 
               who are descendants of enslaved individuals. Data will be included in reports starting in 2025. There 
               is no obligation for Black Californians to undertake genealogical research and submit data to the state; 
               data submission is optional <ptr target="#diaz2022"/>.
            </p>
            <p>African Americans, then, have long sought information about named forebearers, and especially those 
               enslaved in periods before 1865. Their reasons for doing so have included reconstituting families, 
               challenging racism, advancing knowledge about their families' and the nation's past, claiming rights 
               and opportunities, and honoring the humanity and memory of those who suffered because of injustices. 
               Like all Americans, many Black families are also influenced by multi-billion-dollar corporations that 
               advertise the value of undertaking genealogical research. Online scholarly datasets listing the names 
               and a variety of characteristics of people subjected to enslavement have provided an avenue for African 
               Americans to seek details about their family histories. In addition, such datasets have served as the 
               evidentiary foundation for scholarly publications and been part of lesson plans in K-12 and university 
               classrooms. Finally, they have helped scholars reframe debates around the <q>numbers game</q>, giving 
               rise to scholarship focused on biography and the struggles of individuals whose lives can be pieced 
               together from scattered bits of data found in multiple sources.

          <head>Descendants in Parts of <name>Africa</name></head>
            <p>African Americans have often sought information about their families' pasts, but the descendants 
               of enslaved people the world over do not share this enthusiasm for genealogy. In parts of the world, 
               the tracing of family trees that include enslaved people is difficult or impossible since slavery 
               itself obliterated the families of the enslaved. As <name>Martin Klein</name> writes, enslaved 
               individuals in <name>West Africa</name> were <quote rend="inline">people without history</quote> 
               since they <quote rend="inline">could neither bequeath to their children nor control them</quote>. 
               Enslavers could claim the children of those they owned, which kept the families of the enslaved 
               <quote rend="inline">atomized and dependent</quote>. This is to say that the nature of slavery in 
               much of the region meant that enslaved people could not recite a genealogy, and neither can their 
               descendants <ptr target="#klein1989" loc="212â€“213"/>.
            </p>
            <p>In addition, in some parts of the world, including much of <name>West Africa</name>, a family 
               association with slavery still carries a powerful social stigma. In a study of the period since 
               European colonizers abolished the institution of slavery in Francophone <name>West Africa</name>, 
               <name>Ibrahima Thioub</name> explores how the legacy of slavery often relegates 
               <quote rend="inline">descendants of slaves to the margins of society and into specific social 
               roles</quote>. The reasons for this center on cultural prohibitions, which are region specific 
               and <quote rend="inline">built around the ideology of blood purity and differences in skin color</quote> 
               <ptr target="#thioub2012" loc="12"/>. Thioub notes that, in certain places: <quote rend="block">certain 
               ceremonial tasks are reserved exclusively for descendants of slaves: the men have to slaughter, 
               butcher, and distribute the meat of sacrificial animals; the women have to grind the grain, pump the 
               water, prepare and serve the meals, and wash the dishes afterwards. The increasing refusal on the 
               part of descendants of slaves to follow these roles is stigmatized by descendants of masters as 
               harmful and misplaced pridefulness. <ptr target="#thioub2012" loc="12"/></quote> <name>Thioub</name> 
               also observes <quote rend="inline">discrimination in the way death is handled</quote> with descendants 
               <quote rend="inline">of slaves and descendants of masters having separate ceremonies</quote>. Genealogy, 
               he writes, <quote rend="inline">is the main way of proving which social group one belongs in</quote>. 
               Thus, the descendants of enslavers perpetuate genealogical memory while the descendants of the 
               enslaved are interested in silencing that memory so that they can change their social identity, thereby 
               attaining a higher status in society <ptr target="#thioub2012" loc="12"/>.
            </p>
            <p>In a study of <name>The Gambia</name>, <name>Alice Bellagamba</name> draws similar conclusions. Until 
               recently, she writes, <quote rend="inline">descendants of slaves were discriminated against, receiving 
               burial in a segregated section of the cemetery on their decease</quote> <ptr target="#bellagamba2012" loc="36"/>. 
               She explains that after the British declared an end to slavery in <name>The Gambia</name> in 1930, 
               formerly enslaved people, or <term xml:lang="mnk">jong</term>, became a <quote rend="inline">pseudo-caste</quote>. 
               <term xml:lang="mnk">Jong</term> have been associated with stereotypes by the larger society, which 
               regards them as dependent and as beggars. Today, descendants of enslaved people <quote rend="inline">might 
               rudely react to the attempts of others to qualify them as <term xml:lang="mnk">jong</term> without their 
               consent</quote> <ptr target="#bellagamba2012" loc="38"/>. For them, and for others around them, 
               <quote rend="inline">not all should be said</quote> about matters of family history, since some details 
               of a family's genealogy might bring pain and humiliation and therefore cause ruptures in a community. 
               Historical knowledge is powerful; just as it can bestow rights and opportunities on some, it can deny 
               them for others. In <name>Bellagamba</name>'s words, <quote rend="inline">[i]n contemporary 
               <name>Gambia</name>, slave ancestry continues to be a stain on the family pedigree which very few slave 
               descendants are eager to display publicly</quote> <ptr target="#bellagamba2012" loc="46"/>.
            </p>
            <p>Others have also observed how slavery, though long ago abolished, continues to shape social relationships 
               in <name>West Africa</name>. Examining <name>Niger</name> and <name>Benin</name>, <name>Eric Komlavi-Hahonou</name>  
               documents and analyzes the political marginalization that descendants of enslaved people face. When questions 
               are asked about enslaved forebearers, respondents often exclaim something akin to <quote rend="inline">It is 
               not appropriate to talk about this!</quote> because of a collective taboo around the subject 
               <ptr target="#komlavi-hahonou2009" loc="156"/>. Similarly, in a study of <name>Anlo</name>, <name>Ghana</name>, 
               <name>Emmanuel Akyeampong</name> notes that people <quote rend="inline">prefer not to discuss the legacy of 
               slavery</quote> since even <quote rend="inline">successful and enterprising individuals do not easily shake 
               off the social stigma of slave descent</quote>. Silences, <name>Akyeampong</name> argues, allow for the 
               integration of people into a broader national identity <ptr target="#akyeampong2001" loc="1"/>.
            </p>
            <p>In <name>Mali</name>, USAID sponsors programs that offer free legal aid to descendants of enslaved people 
               who today are discriminated against because of known links to long deceased enslaved forebearers. In 2012, a 
               USAID study reports, an estimated 200,000 people in northern <name>Mali</name> were kept under descent-based 
               or hereditary slavery. USAID assists those who champion the cause of those under descent-based slavery systems, 
               trains stakeholders in handling descent-based slavery cases, and advocates for national legislation to end 
               discrimination against and the oppression of those descended from enslaved people. Among the local organizations 
               that assist descendants of enslaved people in <name>Mali</name> is Gambana, which was formed to fight violence 
               and discrimination, mainly among ethnic Soninke. Gambana activists discourage the use of the word 
               <term xml:lang="snk">kome</term>, or <term>slave</term>, to describe descendants of enslaved people, and they 
               assist those who flee regions where they suffer abuse because of their families' links to enslavement. Given 
               this, it is understandable why descendants of enslaved people in <name>Mali</name> seek to suppress their 
               families' histories <ptr target="#usaid2023"/> <ptr target="#camara_etal2022"/>.
            </p>
            <p>In the Indian Ocean world, descendants of enslaved people are similarly discriminated against. For this 
               reason, <name>Pier Larson</name> explains, there is <quote rend="inline">historical amnesia</quote> around 
               the subject of slavery. Families with slave forebearers do not, he argues, foster memories of the trauma of 
               their communities' pasts or commemorate enslavement, which stands in contrast to the commemorations found 
               across the <name>Americas</name> <ptr target="#larson1999"/>. In a study of <name>Madagascar</name>, 
               <name>Luke Freeman</name> observes something similar â€” <quote rend="inline">a systematic avoidance of the 
               topic [of slavery] that is generalized throughout nearly all conversations</quote>. Explaining this, he 
               writes that an avoidance of the topic <quote rend="inline">is not just a symptom of the problem of slavery, 
               an embarrassed silence about a difficult pastâ€¦. [I]t is also a pragmatic response to that problem, loaded 
               with people's strategies and intentions for dealing with it in their daily interactions as co-villagers</quote> 
               <ptr target="#freeman2013" loc="601â€“603"/>.
            </p>
            <p>The same holds true in <name>Somalia</name>, where <name>Catherine Besteman</name> observes that, even long after 
               abolition, descendants of enslaved people have held <quote rend="inline">marked identities which stigmatized 
               them</quote>. She adds that <quote rend="inline">[o]vert signs of inequality, status distinction, and social 
               differentiation were readily apparent to any visitors in the 1980s</quote>, when she did her fieldwork. Where 
               descendants of enslaved Bantu people reside, <quote rend="inline">[v]illagers could not avoid recognizing their 
               heritage of slavery, but they also rarely discussed it among themselves, in public at least</quote> 
               <ptr target="#besteman1999" loc="36â€“37, 136"/>.
            </p>
            <p>Beyond <name>Africa</name>, in <name>Arabia</name>, scholars have noted a similar silencing of family histories 
               tied to slavery. As <name>Matthew Hopper</name> observes, <quote rend="inline">unlike many other branches of the 
               global African diaspora, identification with <name>Africa</name> is not a common feature among the descendants 
               of enslaved Africans in <name>Arabia</name></quote> <ptr target="#hopper2015" loc="212â€“213"/>. The reason for 
               this is clear: Africans were brought to <name>Arabia</name> to be enslaved, and a link to an enslaved past can 
               bring dishonor to a family. Thus, descendants practice what <name>Hopper</name> calls an 
               <quote rend="inline">intentional <quote rend="inline">forgetting</quote></quote> of their histories 
               <ptr target="#hopper2015" loc="216"/>. In making this argument, <name>Hopper</name> draws on conclusions made 
               by <name>Jonathon Glassman</name> about the propensity of people in communities on the island of <name>Zanzibar</name> 
               to link their family history (real or imagined) to Arabs so as to distance themselves from mainland people, many 
               of whom had been brought to <name>Zanzibar</name> as slaves. As on <name>Zanzibar</name>, in <name>Arabia</name>, 
               <name>Hopper</name> concludes, the obfuscation of African lineages is today an <quote rend="inline">effort to 
               disassociate with the <term xml:lang="sw">ushenzi</term> or <q>slavishness</q> of the African interior and the 
               legacy of the slave trade</quote> <ptr target="#hopper2015" loc="219"/> <ptr target="#glassman2011" loc="23â€“64"/> 
               <ptr target="#glassman2014"/>. Publishing data on the internet that could link people in <name>Zanzibari</name> 
               and Arabian communities to an enslaved past would not, then, be celebrated as it has been in <name>North 
               America</name>. It could bring disgrace to individuals, families, and communities, opening conversations that 
               most seek to avoid.

          <head>Conclusion</head>
            <p>To ensure that we do no harm through the publication of online datasets that detail the lives of named enslaved 
               individuals, digital historians must develop an understanding of how and why descendants of enslaved people want 
               their histories told or silenced. We would be naive to think that online scholarly datasets detailing the lives 
               of the enslaved would necessarily result in many discoveries of familial lines to enslaved individuals, and we would 
               be dishonest to proclaim to descendants that documentary evidence from the past can reveal all the branches of family 
               trees. After all, in <name>North America</name>, slavery often did away with fathers, leaving no evidentiary trail. 
               To be sure, scholars and corporations have been extracting data from written documentary evidence that African American 
               genealogists have been making use of, but information housed in archives silences much of the past.
            </p>
            <p>Nonetheless, as the experience of <name>Meghan Wilson</name> with <title rend="italic">Enslaved.org</title> illustrates, 
               scholarly online datasets have the potential to make genealogical connections between enslaved people in the distant past 
               and living people today. This is true in <name>North America</name>, and it is true elsewhere, including in 
               <name>Africa</name>, <name>South America</name>, the <name>Caribbean</name>, and the Indian Ocean world. Given this, 
               researchers compiling and posting online datasets that list names are obliged to understand power dynamics that operate 
               today and ask if their research places descendants of enslaved people at risk. Researchers must avoid doing harm, 
               particularly to vulnerable populations. To ensure that we do no harm, we should come to terms with whether an online 
               dataset that makes it possible to connect people today to enslaved family members in the past would be unwelcome because 
               a family history rooted in slavery continues to carry a stigma, or if such a dataseet would be welcome because descendants 
               desire knowledge of a past that has long been denied them.
            </p>
            <p>Researchers should also avoid reproducing the violence that systems of slavery wrought upon the enslaved. In the 
               construction of datasets, this involves reading against the grain of sources produced by enslavers and creating 
               controlled vocabularies that humanize those held in bondage. It also involves the development of sustainable practices in 
               data stewardship and technologies that limit barriers to access to data through the application of open-source software 
               and accessibility tools, so that anyone with a computer and internet connection can view our sites and data free of charge.
            </p>
            <p>Though we study the dead, we are obliged to consider how the living are connected to them and whether knowledge of 
               those connections could do harm. This is particularly true in the Digital Age, when computer programs facilitate rapid 
               searches of ever-growing online datasets. All the information that we place online is accessible elsewhere. What we do 
               when we create internet-based datasets is speed up accessibility, making public information, which had not previously been 
               widely known, easily knowable with the click of a few buttons. Ease of access to information can be beneficial to societies 
               and individuals, but it can also be destructive. Privacy groups in the <name>United States</name> and <name>Europe</name> 
               have raised questions about the wisdom of making public court records available on the internet because, among other things, 
               ease of access to details about personal lives can cause embarrassment and lead to discrimination. In the same way, we 
               should raise questions about the potential harm <emph>our</emph> data could cause. When we are told, in the words of one 
               of <name>Komlavi-Hahonou</name>'s informants, <quote rend="inline">It is not appropriate to talk about this</quote>, we 
               could anonymize our data â€” structure our datasets so that we do not reveal names. It might be argued that such silencings 
               of the record <emph>are</emph> acts of violence, reproducing the acts of violence that anonymized Black bodies in the 
               past and often denied the enslaved familial connections. But, first and foremost, our obligation is to the living and, 
               particularly, to the vulnerable among us. To be sure, placing data on the internet is not the only â€” and not always an 
               appropriate â€” way to bring dignity to the dead.
