                  <p>This paper examines the ethical implications of public, internet-based history projects
                     that list enslaved people 
                     by name. It does so by considering the appropriateness of the ethics statement written
                     by the Principal 
                     Investigators at Enslaved: Peoples of the Historical Slave Trade (or 
                     <a href="https://enslaved.org/" onclick="window.open('https://enslaved.org/'); return false" class="ref">Enslaved.org</a>). Enslaved.org directly addresses the urgent call to 
                     document the history of people of African descent more fully. Housed at Michigan State University, the 
                     project centers the Black experience globally, with most projects to date focused
                     on North America. 
                     Contributors to Enslaved.org tell the stories of named enslaved individuals by extracting
                     what is often fragmentary 
                     information (names, ages, skills, injuries, African ethnicities, etc.) from a vast
                     range of primary source 
                     documentation and by assembling that data into datasets. The Enslaved.org team makes
                     the datasets available, 
                     searchable, and understandable on its open-source platform 
                     (<a href="https://enslaved.org/" onclick="window.open('https://enslaved.org/'); return false" class="ref">https://enslaved.org/</a>) and through its peer-reviewed journal, 
                     <cite class="title italic">The Journal of Slavery and Data Preservation</cite> 
                     (<a href="https://jsdp.enslaved.org/" onclick="window.open('https://jsdp.enslaved.org/'); return false" class="ref">https://jsdp.enslaved.org/</a>). The Principal Investigators are 
                     committed to identifying by name as many enslaved people as possible and to representing
                     individual and collective 
                     experiences in an international, humane, and ethical frame and to working collaboratively
                     with researchers and 
                     descendant communities to continually develop and follow practices that respect the
                     lives of enslaved people. The 
                     paper considers the appropriateness of the Enslaved.org ethics statement for datasets
                     focused on slavery in a 
                     variety of places and concludes with a call for historians to work closely with descendant
                     communities in compiling 
                     and publishing data that names enslaved individuals.

                  <div class="ptext" id="p1">In March 1870, a committee of the State House of Representatives in Columbus, 
                     Ohio, convened to decide the legitimacy of the election of Elijah 
                     Glover to the office of Representative from Scioto County. 
                     Glover had bested his opponent by twenty-three votes. However, forty-five of 
                     those who cast ballots were suspected of being “negroes or colored 
                     persons” who had been brought to the polls by Glover's party. Therefore, 
                     an elector in Scioto contested the election, which resulted in the forty-five 
                     voters being questioned to determine if each had “a preponderance of 
                     white blood”. If they did not, they did not have the right to cast a ballot. During 
                     the hearing, one such voter, Henry Wilson, was asked if he had been qualified 
                     to vote. “I think I was”, he stated. “All 
                     the reason I have to know is, I was told my father was a white man, and my mother,
                     I 
                     suppose, about half-and-half”. Mustering up the courage to reveal more, he said of 
                     his father, “I knew him; he was a white man; he was my former 
                     master”. He explained that it “never was disputed in the 
                     neighborhood” that the man was his father “but always believed, 
                     on account of the resemblance between my father and me”. Asked how the white man 
                     responded to talk about his being Wilson's father, Wilson replied, 
                     “He did not say anything because they did not say it in his presence”

                  <div class="ptext" id="p2">In testimony after testimony, contested genealogies were central to claims of voting
                     rights 
                     in the Scioto election. And every case hinged on pseudoscientific ideas about 
                     race, race mixing, and racial purity. Power dynamics meant that the bloodlines of
                     
                     established “white” families were not questioned, but those of 
                     “negroes and coloreds” were. Unsurprisingly, no one who appeared 
                     before the committee had documents stating who their parents were. Most said they
                     only had 
                     knowledge of their mothers. When asked about fathers, many responded with a variation
                     of 
                     “I was told…”. Of this, Frederick Douglass had 
                     written fifteen years earlier, “Slavery does away with fathers, as it 
                     does away with families”. Like Henry Wilson, Douglass 
                     recalled that some “whispered that my master was my father”, but 
                     whispers were all he had. Later, Douglass wrote in his autobiography, 
                     “The reader must not expect me to say much of my family. Genealogical 
                     trees did not flourish among slaves” [<a class="ref" href="#fields2022">Fields 2022</a>, 605]. This is 
                     to say that in the United States as elsewhere, dislocation, violence, and the 
                     threat of violence set limits on how enslaved people's families were constituted,
                     severing 
                     connections to kin and rendering unknowable much of their genealogy.

                  <div class="ptext" id="p3">However, since the 1990s, advances in computer technologies and the internet, along
                     with the 
                     widespread availability of genetic testing, have facilitated the reconstruction of
                     some 
                     branches of genealogical trees, making knowable now much of what was unknowable or
                     only 
                     whispered about in the past. Computer and internet technologies allow for the mining
                     of 
                     datasets containing information about hundreds, thousands, millions, and tens of millions
                     of 
                     enslaved individuals. Assembled by researchers and corporations, online datasets have
                     become 
                     foundational for professional historians undertaking research, and they aid genealogists
                     in the 
                     construction of family histories, linking people of African descent to their enslaved
                     and free 
                     forebearers.

                     that 
                     identify enslaved individuals by name.<a class="noteRef" href="#d4e275">[1]</a> In parts of the world, including the 
                     United States, descendants of enslaved people generally welcome the publication of such 
                     datasets because they feel empowered to shout names that in the past had been whispered
                     or were lost. 
                     Today, many African Americans want to trace the branches, trunks, and roots of their
                     family trees, 
                     and online datasets can facilitate this undertaking. Names, after all, are a tangible
                     link to the 
                     past and are central to genealogical projects. However, elsewhere in the world, not
                     all descendants 
                     of enslaved people want their family histories known. In some places, descendants
                     of enslaved people 
                     encourage silences around family history since a family's historical links to slavery
                     carries a 
                     stigma. By contrasting the United States and Africa, this paper urges 
                     scholars to consider the context-specific ethics of creating websites with historical
                     data about 
                     named enslaved individuals. It also examines the role of online data platforms like

                     and the

                     team constructed and continues to modify its platform to be user friendly for non-scholarly
                     
                     audiences. In addition to datasets, the site features short biographies of enslaved
                     individuals 
                     about whom there is considerable information

                     enslaved person

                     made discoveries through <cite class="title italic">Enslaved.org</cite>. For example, while searching 
                     across datasets on the platform, Meghan Wilson of Detroit found information 
                     linking her to Hannah Johnson, who was enslaved in Louisiana, and was, 
                     Wilson learned, her great-great-great-great grandmother. “There 
                     is a power in knowing”, Wilson told Krystal Nurse, a reporter 
                     for the <cite class="title italic">Lansing State Journal</cite>. “I'm not sure what 
                     will come of that, but to know that there is a person that lived on the [John] Johnson
                     
                     Plantation in New Orleans in the 1860s gives me a history and access to

                  <div class="ptext" id="p9">What made Wilson's discovery possible was the fact that Hannah Johnson 
                     is named in an <cite class="title italic">Enslaved.org</cite> dataset. When it would do no harm, 
                     <cite class="title italic">Enslaved.org</cite> is committed to naming as many enslaved people as
                     possible in the datasets that it publishes. Why? Names facilitate discoveries and
                     emphasize the 
                     humanity of those who enslavers commodified. With the humanity of the enslaved in
                     mind, 
                     <cite class="title italic">Enslaved.org</cite> seeks submissions from those who recognize that primary 
                     source material reflects the biases of its authors; it was shaped by the systems of
                     power — by 
                     the violence — under which enslaved people suffered. In Jessica Marie Johnson's apt 
                     description, a “devastating archive” resulted from enslavers' 
                     commodification and quantification of Black bodies [<a class="ref" href="#johnson2018">Johnson 2018</a>, 58]. The 
                     challenge, then, is to construct datasets with an eye toward reading against the grain
                     of the 
                     racist perspectives of enslavers and presenting enslaved people as individuals about
                     whom something 
                     can be known from the primary sources in which shards of information about them were
                     recorded. 
                     That is, the challenge is presenting them as more than numbers.

                     be sure, studies 
                     that have quantified various aspects of the trade in and lives of enslaved people
                     have advanced 
                     knowledge about slavery and slave systems. Such studies have revealed, among other
                     things, that 
                     approximately one million enslaved people were sold across state lines in the United 
                     States from 1801 to 1860. But numbers do not get at the lived experiences of people. Behind
                     
                     every number derived from statistical and quantitative analyses are individuals whose
                     stories are 
                     worth exploring because there is a power in knowing. Detailing the lives of the enslaved
                     can honor 
                     them and inform us.

                     daughter, Julia Ann. They were sold in 1831 in Orleans Parish, 
                     Louisiana, by Franklin &amp; Armfield, a trading company that had arranged for their 
                     shipment from Sumner County Tennessee. Beside the mother and child were 
                     Delosia, William, Peter, Washington, and 
                     Aaron, along with dozens of others from Sumner, who were scattered among 
                     different buyers in and around New Orleans. Fragmentary details, including the names 
                     of 1,600 enslaved people sold by Franklin &amp; Armfield in the 1820s and 1830s, are available

                     of the enslaved” and that “grapples with the uncomfortable, messy, and 
                     unquantifiable” [<a class="ref" href="#johnson2018">Johnson 2018</a>, 71]. That is, the dataset is about more than

                  <div class="ptext" id="p14">Some influential scholarly organizations have grappled with related questions. For
                     example, the 
                     Association of internet Researchers (AoIR) offers valuable guidance 
                     (<a href="https://aoir.org/reports/ethics2.pdf" onclick="window.open('https://aoir.org/reports/ethics2.pdf'); return false" class="ref">https://aoir.org/reports/ethics2.pdf</a>). 
                     Related to the study of enslaved people, the AoIR stresses in the first point of its
                     ethics statement, 
                     “The greater the vulnerability of the community / author / participant, the 
                     greater the obligation of the researcher to protect the community / author / participant”. The 
                     statement continues, “Because all digital information at some point involves 
                     individual persons, consideration of principles related to research on human subjects
                     may be 
                     necessary even if it is not immediately apparent how and where persons are involved
                     in the research 
                     data” [<a class="ref" href="#markham_etal2012">Markham and Buchanan 2012</a>]. Apropos to the databasing of named enslaved 
                     individuals from the past, it may not be immediately apparent to researchers how living
                     descendants 
                     of the enslaved are connected to our data, but researchers should consider the implications
                     of their 
                     research on broad human populations and particularly on vulnerable populations. A
                     consideration 
                     of living human subjects is also part and parcel of the guidelines of the American
                     Anthropological 
                     Association (AAA; <a href="https://ethics.americananthro.org/ethics-statement-1-do-no-harm/" onclick="window.open('https://ethics.americananthro.org/ethics-statement-1-do-no-harm/'); return false" class="ref">https://ethics.americananthro.org/ethics-statement-1-do-no-harm/</a>). 
                     Listed first in the AAA's statement is that the researcher's primary obligation is
                     to 
                     “do no harm”, including harm “to dignity, and to 
                     bodily and material well-being, especially when research is conducted among vulnerable
                     populations”. 
                     This obligation, the association's statement emphasizes, “can supersede the 
                     goal of seeking new knowledge” [<a class="ref" href="#aaa2012">American Anthropology Association 2012</a>].

                     online datasets 
                     that detail the lives of named enslaved individuals, digital historians must understand
                     the history 
                     of descendant communities and how they are affected by the legacy of slavery today.
                     That is, we must 
                     develop an understanding of how and why descendants want their histories told or silenced.
                     To be sure, 
                     our tellings of history will not be embraced by everyone. In print and online publications,
                     we can 
                     and should spark debate, challenge beliefs, and cause discomfort. We historians build
                     arguments based on 
                     evidence and are under no obligation to tell histories as others want them told. But
                     we are obliged to 
                     do no harm to vulnerable populations and that obligation supersedes goals to advance
                     new knowledge.

                     knowledge of aspects of their family histories. Online datasets that list the names
                     of enslaved

                     The 
                     questions researchers should answer before they publish such datasets are: Given power

                     that operate today, does our research place descendants at risk? That is, do our online

                     datasets have the potential to do harm? If so, are there ways we can structure datasets
                     to ensure 
                     that they do not harm? If not, are there ways that we can structure online scholarly
                     datasets so that

                     made public information about their forebearers. This desire was expressed in the
                     decades following 
                     the adoption of the Thirteenth Amendment to the Constitution in 1865. Then, African
                     Americans were 
                     part of what François Weil describes as a “genealogical mania” 
                     that swept across the country [<a class="ref" href="#weil2013">Weil 2013</a>, 139–140]. The motivation of white Americans 
                     who participated in this mania was clear. Family trees rooted in Western Europe justified 
                     the place of a white family in the racial hierarchy of the United States. This was, after 
                     all, a period when racist theories about heredity were foundational to ideas about
                     intelligence. 
                     Whiteness also brought with it a variety of rights and opportunities [<a class="ref" href="#morgan2021">Morgan 2021</a>, 20–51]. 
                     A family's claims to whiteness and greatness were buttressed by what was often fanciful
                     evidence of 
                     bloodlines stretching to important European forebearers and especially those allied
                     with the first 
                     Norman king of England, William the Conqueror. Thus, the 1871 genealogy of 
                     the Lee family of Virginia, which included Robert E. Lee, stressed, 
                     “In the eleventh century, we find the name of Laucelot Lee,

                     genealogies were 
                     different. Before the Civil War ended and for decades after, African Americans spread
                     information 
                     in print publications such as the <cite class="title italic">Christian Advocate</cite> about their parents, 
                     grandparents, children, siblings, aunts, uncles, and grandchildren as they searched
                     for relatives who 
                     had been traded away under slavery or had dispersed in the chaos of war. Hence, in
                     1883, 
                     Easter Carding posted a note in the <cite class="title italic">Advocate</cite> asking for 
                     information about her relatives: “Father was Shearfe, grandmother 
                     Gracey, Aunt Cheney, grandmother and father left East Tennessee 
                     with the Indians, nearly forty years ago, sold to Jesse Mayfield. Aunt Easter 
                     was sold to Austin Ryder, near the same time”. And, in 1894, Robert 
                     Brown, who was the son of Harriett Brown of Stafford County, 
                     Virginia, sought information about the whereabouts of “his grandfather, 
                     Elijah Brown; [and] his grand uncle, Edward Brown; his brother Wm. 
                     Brown”. Each of these relatives had “belonged to Mrs. Cornelius 
                     Lucas”. These and other powerful stories of named formerly enslaved individuals who were
                     
                     seeking loved ones are available on the website <cite class="title italic">Last Seen: Finding Family After

                  <div class="ptext" id="p20">Further, after the Civil War, those identified as “colored” sought rights by making known 
                     aspects of their genealogies. This was evident in Scioto, Ohio, where 
                     “colored” men traced what they knew of their genealogies to prove that they had the right 
                     to vote. Similar cases sprung up in other states in the late-nineteenth and early-twentieth
                     centuries 
                     as “coloreds” sought rights under a dizzying array of laws about the mixture of blood that made
                     
                     a person white or “negro” [<a class="ref" href="#mangum1940">Mangum 1940</a>, 1–17]. In 1866, a majority on the 
                     Michigan Supreme Court defined white as less than one-quarter Black blood [<a class="ref" href="#people1866">People v. Dean 1866</a>]. 
                     Elsewhere, “negro” was defined as, among other things, “mixed blood within 
                     three generations”, “one-sixteenth or more African blood”, 
                     “one-eighth or more African blood”, and “anyone with 
                     any trace of Negro blood”. Proving any of this required a knowledge of genealogy, which was 
                     disputed in case after case [<a class="ref" href="#harris1993">Harris 1993</a>, 1738–1740]. Knowledge of genealogy was 
                     also necessary to prove descent from Indigenous Americans, whose rights were different
                     from those of 
                     Black Americans. So, when Cyril P. Sunseri sought the annulment of his marriage to 
                     Verna Cassagne because he had come to suspect that her deceased great-great grandmother 
                     had been Black, the court heard testimony about Verna's family tree. Verna 
                     prevailed by arguing that her great-great grandmother had been a slave, but one of
                     Indigenous descent 
                     imported from Santo Domingo. This meant that Verna did not have any trace of 
                     “negro blood”, so there were no grounds for an annulment 
                     [<a class="ref" href="#sunseri1938">Sunseri v. Cassagne 1938</a>].

                     for 
                     exploring their family history. “Enamored of royalty and nobility”, 
                     Willard B. Gatewood, Jr., writes, “many black aristocrats were 
                     experts in genealogy and drew up family trees whose roots and branches included an
                     assortment of 
                     African princes, European royalty, Caucasian statesmen, Madagascan noblemen, and Indian
                     
                     chieftains” [<a class="ref" href="#gatewood1988">Gatewood 1988</a>, 9]. Some established Black genealogical 
                     societies, such as the Society of New York (1884), the Society of the Daughters of
                     New York (1886), 
                     and the Society of the Descendants of Early New England Negroes (1920s). Prominent
                     among this 
                     Black elite was Daniel Alexander Payne Murray, the youngest son of enslaved parents 
                     who had been freed in Maryland. Murray went on to become a librarian 
                     and bibliographer at the Library of Congress. He compiled biographies of influential 
                     people of African descent for a planned encyclopedia and researched his own family's
                     genealogy, 
                     serving as a model for others who wanted to do the same [<a class="ref" href="#cole_n.d.">Cole n.d.</a>]. As part of his 
                     research for “Lives of World-Famous Quadroons and Octoroons”, which 
                     he never published, he set out to amass “as much genealogy as can be 
                     obtained”. In so doing, he made assertions about the family trees of some influential 
                     “white” Americans, such as Judah P. Benjamin, a prominent lawyer in 
                     New Orleans who defended Southern succession and the trade in enslaved Africans. 
                     Through an attorney, Benjamin threatened a lawsuit over Murray's claim 
                     that his family tree included people descended from Africans [<a class="ref" href="#benjamin2014">Benjamin 2014</a>, 210].

                     in the fact 
                     that commercially printed family tree templates were marketed to both Black and white
                     consumers 
                     in the period. These colorful lithographs contained empty spaces for family member's
                     names and 
                     birth, marriage, and death dates. The Library of Congress displays one such lithograph 
                     on its website. Dated ca. 1880 and printed by the Krebs Lithographing Company in Cincinnati, 
                     Ohio, it depicts three scenes of Black family life, one “Before 
                     the [Civil] War” and two “Since the War”, and contains spaces for

                  <div class="ptext" id="p24">Historian Carter G. Woodson was no exception. As Pero Gaglo Dagbovie notes, 
                     Woodson “often instructed black youth during Negro History Week to 
                     interview their elders and document the histories of their families and communities” 
                     [<a class="ref" href="#dagbovie2012">Dagbovie 2012</a>, 12]. Woodson also worked with the Research Department 
                     of the Association for the Study of Negro Life and History to compile a historical
                     dataset with 
                     information from the period before emancipation. After mining the 1830 U.S. Census
                     for data, 
                     Woodson and the Research Department published the dataset, “Free 
                     Negro Owners of Slaves in the United States in 1830”, in 1924. The goal was for names 
                     derived from the census to “serve as a link between the past and present”. 
                     Woodson and his team arranged data into fields or columns, each with a heading — 
                     name, number of enslaved people owned, total number of people in the household, and
                     the age range of 
                     people in the household. The dataset was divided by state and county. In the journal,
                     a short article 
                     explains the methodology and importance of the dataset. Further, from names in the
                     dataset, 
                     Woodson and his research group developed short biographies, such as that of 
                     Samuel Gibson, “a Negro of Mississippi, in 1844, when 
                     he brought his six slaves to Cincinnati, Ohio, and settled them on free 
                     territory” [<a class="ref" href="#asnlh2024">Research Department of the ASNLH</a>, 60] [<a class="ref" href="#hawthorne2024">Hawthorne 2024</a>, 309–318].

                  <div class="ptext" id="p25">In his 1924 publication, Woodson and the Research Department foreshadowed an 
                     influential methodological approach that involved applying computer-aided analyses
                     to larger 
                     and larger datasets in the study of slavery. However, what Woodson did that was different 
                     from many who followed was to use datasets as a tool to examine the lives of named
                     individuals. 
                     In much dataset-based scholarship of historians and economists in the 1960s, individuals
                     were not 
                     present. Indeed, cliometricians of the period stressed quantification and statistical
                     analyses to 
                     derive estimates for the size over time of large trades in enslaved people and to
                     draw conclusions 
                     about broad populations' origins, productivity, and living conditions. Historical
                     debates among 
                     scholars engaged in numbers-driven approaches to the study of slavery have sometimes
                     been dubbed a 
                     “numbers game” [<a class="ref" href="#curtin1969">Curtin 1969</a>, 3]. The approach had 
                     its critics, including Herbert Gutman, who wrote that it tells “us 
                     nothing of importance about the beliefs and behavior of enslaved Afro-Americans” since it 
                     does not explore the lives of individuals [<a class="ref" href="#gutman1975">Gutman 1975</a>, 227]. As Gwendolyn 
                     Midlo Hall wrote, “Historical databases are wonderful, innovative tools…. 
                     But there are some questions that are simply beyond their capabilities”

                     But 
                     Hall forged a path like that of Woodson. In her work, she dwelled on 
                     individuals and sought ways to humanize the experience of the enslaved. Hall began 
                     work on a dataset in the 1980s, deriving data from archival sources that provided
                     insight into 
                     the lives of named enslaved individuals. From books of marriages and baptisms, runaway
                     
                     advertisements, inventories, sales records, arrest records, court cases, and other
                     documents 
                     produced in colonial Louisiana, she extracted data and transcribed them into a 
                     spreadsheet. Each row represented one person. Each column had standardized information
                     about a 
                     characteristic: the enslaved person's name and, when available, their age, sex, marriage
                     partner, 
                     children, skills, injuries, illnesses, ethnolinguistic group, monetary value, and

                     One of the organizers began the meeting by exclaiming, “Dr. Hall 
                     has a brand new CD of Louisiana slaves coming out with almost 100,000 names of slaves!
                     
                     ... The CD will be of inestimable value to researchers” [<a class="ref" href="#afrigeneas1999">Afrigeneas 1999</a>]. And, 
                     in 2018, the Kongo SQ West Kinship Society wrote of Hall on Facebook:

                     website that her online dataset was used by genealogists because it “provided 
                     unprecedented access to the identities of individuals of African descent who lived
                     in the

                  <div class="ptext" id="p29">Hall's dataset tapped into a groundswell of interest in genealogy in the United 
                     States, and particularly in Black genealogy, which has roots stretching to the late-nineteenth
                     
                     century. In the mid- and late-twentieth century, Black genealogists were energized
                     by the Civil 
                     Rights Movement and the publication of Alex Haley's <cite class="title italic">Roots</cite>, 
                     which opened the possibility of tracing African American ancestry to enslaved forebearers
                     and 
                     beyond to Africa itself [<a class="ref" href="#haley1976">Haley 1976</a>]. The following year, Black and 
                     white Americans were captivated by the <cite class="title italic">Roots</cite> television miniseries 
                     [<a class="ref" href="#roots1977">Roots 1977</a>]. The same year, Charles L. Blockson published 
                     <cite class="title italic">Black Genealogy</cite>, which served as a guide for African Americans 
                     wanting knowledge of their families' pasts [<a class="ref" href="#blockson1977">Blockson 1977</a>, 2]. Black interest 
                     in genealogy spiked again in 2006, when Harvard professor and public intellectual
                     Henry 
                     Louis Gates, Jr. first aired the <cite class="title italic">African American Lives</cite> series, 
                     which traced the ancestry of influential African Americans. That series later morphed
                     into 
                     <cite class="title italic">Faces of America</cite> and then <cite class="title italic">Finding Your Roots</cite>, 
                     which has aired since 2012 [<a class="ref" href="#gates2006">Gates 2006</a>] [<a class="ref" href="#gates2010">Gates 2010</a>]. Each of 
                     these genealogical projects is aimed, at least in part, at identifying named enslaved
                     individuals 
                     in the past, which is something scholarly data projects can facilitate.

                     Completed in the early 2000s, the African American Civil War Memorial includes carvings
                     in stone 
                     of the names of all known African Americans, most of whom had been enslaved, who fought
                     in the war. 
                     Since its opening in 2016, the National Museum of African American History and Culture 
                     has had exhibits that identify enslaved people by name. The Whitney Plantation, a 
                     museum outside New Orleans, also engages with the public through lists of the names 
                     of enslaved people. Their exhibit is comprised of stone panels into which the names
                     of the enslaved 
                     who labored on the plantation are carved. Further, the Black Lives Matter movement
                     has emphasized 
                     the imperative to “speak their names”, to honor the humanity and mourn the deaths of those 
                     whose lives have been unjustly taken because of the violence of racism. Their names,
                     the movement 
                     urges, should be proclaimed loudly.

                     commercial 
                     market, where for-pay access to genealogical data is the norm. A variety of commercial
                     computer 
                     products gave access to ancestral data in the 1980s. In the 1990s, corporations moved
                     their 
                     ancestral research products to the internet. There, <cite class="title italic">Ancestry.com</cite>

                     a variety 
                     of names since its founding. In 2020, the Blackstone Group acquired 
                     <cite class="title italic">Ancestry.com</cite> for $4.7 billion. The company now controls access to 
                     30 billion historical records and has data from more than 20 million DNA kits and

                     bestow rights and opportunities in the nineteenth century. And, for some, knowledge
                     of one's 
                     genealogy can do the same today. As colleges and universities across the United States 
                     have explored how their histories are entangled with slavery, conversations have turned
                     toward atoning 
                     for the lasting damage done to the descendants of enslaved people who were bought,
                     sold, and rented by 
                     institutions of higher education. Thus, Georgetown University has made descent from an 
                     enslaved people who labored for the university a factor in admissions decisions 
                     [<a class="ref" href="#georgetown_n.d.">Georgetown University n.d.</a>]. Further, in 2021, Virginia's governor signed legislation

                     for slavery. 
                     California recently set in motion a plan to require its state agencies to create a new

                     African Americans 
                     who are descendants of enslaved individuals. Data will be included in reports starting
                     in 2025. There 
                     is no obligation for Black Californians to undertake genealogical research and submit
                     data to the state;

                     especially those 
                     enslaved in periods before 1865. Their reasons for doing so have included reconstituting
                     families, 
                     challenging racism, advancing knowledge about their families' and the nation's past,

                     and opportunities, and honoring the humanity and memory of those who suffered because
                     of injustices. 
                     Like all Americans, many Black families are also influenced by multi-billion-dollar
                     corporations that 
                     advertise the value of undertaking genealogical research. Online scholarly datasets
                     listing the names 
                     and a variety of characteristics of people subjected to enslavement have provided
                     an avenue for African 
                     Americans to seek details about their family histories. In addition, such datasets

                     K-12 and university 
                     classrooms. Finally, they have helped scholars reframe debates around the “numbers game”, giving 
                     rise to scholarship focused on biography and the struggles of individuals whose lives
                     can be pieced

                     descendants 
                     of enslaved people the world over do not share this enthusiasm for genealogy. In parts
                     of the world, 
                     the tracing of family trees that include enslaved people is difficult or impossible
                     since slavery 
                     itself obliterated the families of the enslaved. As Martin Klein writes, enslaved 
                     individuals in West Africa were “people without history” 
                     since they “could neither bequeath to their children nor control them”. 
                     Enslavers could claim the children of those they owned, which kept the families of
                     the enslaved 
                     “atomized and dependent”. This is to say that the nature of slavery in 
                     much of the region meant that enslaved people could not recite a genealogy, and neither
                     can their 
                     descendants [<a class="ref" href="#klein1989">Klein 1989</a>, 212–213].

                     association with slavery still carries a powerful social stigma. In a study of the
                     period since 
                     European colonizers abolished the institution of slavery in Francophone West Africa, 
                     Ibrahima Thioub explores how the legacy of slavery often relegates 
                     “descendants of slaves to the margins of society and into specific social 
                     roles”. The reasons for this center on cultural prohibitions, which are region specific
                     
                     and “built around the ideology of blood purity and differences in skin color”. 
                     Thioub notes that, in certain places:

                        <p>certain ceremonial tasks are reserved 
                           exclusively for descendants of slaves: the men have to slaughter, butcher, and distribute
                           the meat

                           to follow these roles is stigmatized by descendants of masters as harmful and misplaced

                     </blockquote> Thioub also observes 
                     “discrimination in the way death is handled” with descendants 
                     “of slaves and descendants of masters having separate ceremonies”. Genealogy, 
                     he writes, “is the main way of proving which social group one belongs in”. 
                     Thus, the descendants of enslavers perpetuate genealogical memory while the descendants
                     of the 
                     enslaved are interested in silencing that memory so that they can change their social
                     identity, thereby 
                     attaining a higher status in society [<a class="ref" href="#thioub2012">Thioub 2012</a>, 12].

                  <div class="ptext" id="p37">In a study of The Gambia, Alice Bellagamba draws similar conclusions. Until recently,
                     she writes, “descendants of slaves were discriminated against, receiving burial in
                     a segregated section of the cemetery on their decease” [<span class="error"><a href="#Bellagamba2012">2012</a></span>, p. 36]. She explains that after the British declared an end to slavery in The Gambia
                     in 1930, former slaves or <span class="hi italic">jong </span>became a “pseudo-caste” upon which society associated stereotypes such as dependent
                     and beggar. Today, descendants of slaves “might rudely react to the attempts of others
                     to qualify them as <span class="hi italic">jong </span>without their consent” [<span class="error"><a href="#Bellagamba2012">2012</a></span>, p. 38]. For them, and for others around them, “not all should be said” about matters
                     of family history, since some details of a family's genealogy might bring pain and
                     humiliation and might cause ruptures in a community. Historical knowledge is powerful;
                     just as it can bestow rights and opportunities on some, it can deny them for others.
                     In Bellagamba's words, “In contemporary Gambia, slave ancestry continues to be a stain
                     on the family pedigree which very few slave descendants are eager to display publicly”

                     social relationships in West Africa. Examining Niger and Benin, Eric Komlavi-Hahonou
                     documents/analyzes the political marginalization that descendants of enslaved people
                     face. When questions are asked about enslaved forebearers, respondents often exclaim
                     something akin to “It is not appropriate to talk about this!” because of a collective
                     taboo around the subject [<span class="error"><a href="#KomlaviHahonou2009">2009</a></span>, p. 156]. Similarly, in a study of Anlo, Ghana, Emmanuel Akyeampong notes that people
                     “prefer not to discuss the legacy of slavery” since even “successful and enterprising
                     individuals do not easily shake off the social stigma of slave descent.” Silences,
                     Akyeampong argues, allow for the integration of people into a broader national identity

                     people who today are discriminated against because of known links to long deceased
                     enslaved forebearers. In 2012, a USAID study reports, an estimated 200,000 people
                     in northern Mali were kept under descent-based or hereditary slavery. USAID assists
                     those who champion the cause of those under descent-based slavery systems, trains
                     stakeholders in handling descent-based slavery cases, and advocates for national legislation
                     to end discrimination against and the oppression of those descended from enslaved
                     people. Among the local organizations that assist descendants of enslaved people in
                     Mali is Gambana, which was formed to fight violence and discrimination mainly among
                     ethnic Soninke. Gambana activists discourage the use of the word <span class="hi italic">kome</span> or slave to describe descendants of enslaved people and assist those who flee regions
                     where they suffer abuse because of their families' links to enslavement. Given this,
                     it is understandable why descendants of enslaved people in Mali seek to suppress their
                     families' histories [<span class="error"><a href="#USAID2023">USAID 2023</a></span>; <span class="error"><a href="#Camara2022">Camara et al 2022</a></span>].</div>

                     against. For this reason, Pier Larson explains, there is “historical amnesia” around
                     the subject of slavery. Families with slave forebearers do not, he argues, foster
                     memories of the trauma of their communities' pasts or commemorate enslavement, which
                     stands in contrast to the commemorations found across the Americas [<span class="error"><a href="#Larson1999">1999</a></span>]. In a study of Madagascar, Luke Freeman observed something similar — “a systematic
                     avoidance of the topic [of slavery] that is generalized throughout nearly all conversations.”
                     Explaining this, he writes that an avoidance of the topic “is not just a symptom of
                     the problem of slavery, an embarrassed silence about a difficult past…. [I]t is also
                     a pragmatic response to that problem, loaded with people's strategies and intentions
                     for dealing with it in their daily interactions as co-villagers” [<span class="error"><a href="#Freeman2013">2013</a></span>, pp. 601-603].</div>

                     abolition descendants of enslaved people have held “marked identities which stigmatized
                     them.” “Overt signs of inequality, status distinction, and social differentiation
                     were readily apparent to any visitors in the 1980s,” when she did her fieldwork. Where
                     descendants of enslaved Bantu people reside, “Villagers could not avoid recognizing
                     their heritage of slavery, but they also rarely discussed it among themselves, in
                     public at least” [<span class="error"><a href="#Besteman1999">Besteman 1999</a></span>, pp. 36-37, 136].</div>

                  <div class="ptext" id="p42">Beyond Africa, in Arabia, scholars have noted a similar silencing of family histories
                     tied to slavery. As Matthew Hopper observes, “unlike many other branches of the global
                     African diaspora, identification with Africa is not a common feature among the descendants
                     of enslaved Africans in Arabia” [<span class="error"><a href="#Hopper2015">2015</a></span>, pp. 212-213]. The reason for this is clear: Africans were brought to Arabia as slaves
                     and a link to a slave past can bring dishonor to a family. Thus, descendants practice
                     what Hopper calls an “intentional ‘forgetting'” of their histories [<span class="error"><a href="#Hopper2015">2015</a></span>, p. 216]. In making this argument, Hopper draws on conclusions made by Jonathon Glassman
                     about the propensity of people in communities on the island of Zanzibar to link their
                     family history (real or imagined) to Arabs so as to distance themselves from mainland
                     people, many of whom had been brought to Zanzibar as slaves. As on Zanzibar, in Arabia,
                     Hopper concludes, the obfuscation of African lineages is today an “effort to disassociate
                     with the <span class="hi italic">ushenzi</span> or ‘slavishness' of the African interior and the legacy of the slave trade” [<span class="error"><a href="#Hopper2015">2015</a></span>, p. 219; <span class="error"><a href="#Glassman2011">Glassman 2011</a></span>, pp. 23-64; <span class="error"><a href="#Glassman2014">Glassman 2014</a></span>). Publishing data on the internet that could link people in Zanzibari and Arabian
                     communities to a slave past would not, then, be celebrated as it has been in North
                     America. It could bring disgrace to individuals, families, and communities, opening
                     conversations that most seek to avoid. </div>

                     of how and why descendants of enslaved people want their histories told or silenced.
                     We would be naive were we to think that online scholarly datasets detailing the lives
                     of the enslaved will result in many discoveries of familial lines to enslaved individuals,
                     and we would be dishonest were we to proclaim to descendants that documentary evidence
                     from the past can reveal all the branches of family trees. Afterall, in North America,
                     slavery often did away with fathers, leaving no evidentiary trail. To be sure, scholars
                     and corporations have been extracting data from written documentary evidence that
                     African American genealogists have been making use of, but information housed in archives

                     online datasets have the potential to make genealogical connections between enslaved
                     people in the distant past and living people today. This is true in North America,
                     and it is true elsewhere, including in Africa, South America, the Caribbean, and the
                     Indian Ocean world. Given this, researchers compiling and posting online datasets
                     that list names are obliged to understand power dynamics that operate today and to
                     ask if their research places descendants of enslaved people at risk. Researchers must
                     avoid doing harm, and particularly to vulnerable populations. To ensure that we do
                     no harm, we should come to terms with whether an online dataset that makes it possible
                     to connect people today to enslaved family members in the past would be unwelcome
                     because a family history rooted in slavery continues to carry a stigma or would be
                     welcome because descendants desire knowledge of a past that has long been denied them.

                     humanize those held in bondage. It also involves the development of sustainable practices
                     in data stewardship and of technologies that limit barriers to access to data through
                     the application of opensource software and accessibility tools, so that anyone with

                     to them and whether knowledge of those connections could do harm. This is particularly
                     true in the Digital Age when computer programs facilitate rapid searches of ever-growing
                     online datasets. All the information that we place online is accessible elsewhere.
                     What we do when we create internet-based datasets is speed accessibility, making public
                     information, which had not previously been widely known, easily knowable with the
                     click of a few buttons. Ease of access to information can be beneficial to societies
                     and individuals, but it can also be destructive. Just as privacy groups in the United
                     States and Europe have raised questions about the wisdom of making public court records
                     available on the internet because, among other things, ease of access to details about
                     personal lives can cause embarrassment and lead to discrimination, we should raise
                     questions about the potential harm our data could cause. When we are told, in the
                     words of one of Komlavi-Hahonou's informants, “It is not appropriate to talk about
                     this,” we could anonymize our data — structure our datasets so that we do not reveal
                     names. It might be argued that such silencings of the record are acts of violence,
                     reproducing the acts of violence that anonymized Black bodies in the past and often
                     denied the enslaved familial connections. But first and foremost, our obligation is
                     to the living and, particularly, to the vulnerable among us. To be sure, placing data
                     on the internet is not the only — and not always an appropriate — way to bring dignity
