            <p>In Auschwitz-Birkenau men and women were detained separately; anecdotal evidence
               suggests that they behaved differently. However, producing evidence based insights
               into victims' behavior is challenging. Perpetrators frequently destroyed camp
               documentations; victims' perspective remains dispersed in thousands of oral history
               interviews with survivors. Listening to, watching, or reading these thousands of
               interviews is not viable, and there is no established computational approach to
               gather systematic evidence from a large number of interviews. In this study, by
               applying methods and concepts of molecular physics, we developed a conceptual
               framework and computational approach to study thousands of human stories and we
               investigated 6628 interviews by survivors of the Auschwitz-Birkenau death camp. We
               applied the concept of state space and the Markov State Model to model the ensemble
               of 6628 testimonies. The Markov State Model along with the Transition Path Theory
               allowed us to compare the way women and men remember their time in the camp. We found
               that acts of solidarity and social bonds are the most important topics in their
               testimonies. However, we found that women are much more likely to address these
               topics. We provide systematic evidence that not only were women more likely to recall
               solidarity and social relations in their belated testimonies but they were also more
               likely to perform acts of solidarity and form social bonds in Auschwitz-Birkenau.
               Oral history interviews with Holocaust survivors constitute an important digital
               cultural heritage that documents one of the darkest moments in human history;
               generally, oral history collections are ubiquitous sources of modern history and
               significant assets of libraries and archives. We anticipate that our conceptual and
               computational framework will contribute not only to the understanding of gender
               behavior but also to the exploration of oral history as a cultural heritage, as well
               as to the computational study of narratives. This paper presents novel synergies
               between history, computer science, and physics, and it aims to stimulate further
               collaborations between these fields. </p>

         <head>1. General background</head>
         <p>The Auschwitz Concentration Camp Complex was liberated seventy-seven years ago on the
            27th January 1945. Since then the camp where an estimated 1.1 million people were
            murdered has became the symbol of the Holocaust. Despite the large number of studies and
            memoirs by survivors, the question to what extent solidarity and social bonds existed
            among victims is still open <ptr target="#pingel2010"/> <ptr target="#piper2009"/>. While some survivors claimed
            that friendships, mutual support, and solidarity among victims thrived, others have
            vehemently denied it.<note> The following account by a German Jewish survivor of
               Auschwitz illustrates the sharp contrast between the two opinions: <quote rend="inline">And I should
               preface this by saying, in general, you know, I've read a lot — a lot of claims about
               the solidarity of prisoners under those conditions. And I must tell you I've never
               seen it. I've heard about solidarity in the block occupied by Russian officers, Red
               Army officers. But I'm pretty sure that was the only — if — if at all, that was the
               only group that showed any solidarity whatsoever. The atmosphere in the camp was such
               that everybody was out for their own survival. And if it was a question of — of
               listening in to what your neighbors in the bed said, it would immediately be handed
               on so that — for personal profit. You couldn't trust anybody. And nobody trusted
               anybody.</quote> <ptr target="#chrambach1996" loc="Tape 3,00:26:51"/>. See a very different view in the memoir
               of the Polish sociologist <ptr target="#pawełczyńska1973" loc="115–116"/>.</note> It has been
            recently argued that solidarity and social bonds were key to survive Nazi concentration
            camps; no one could survive without the help of others and mutual aid was a form of
            opposition among victims <ptr target="#swiebocki2000"/> <ptr target="#bacon2017"/>. Nevertheless, it has been also
            noted, <quote rend="inline">conditions varied greatly across the vast Auschwitz complex</quote> <ptr target="#wachsmann2015" loc="342"/>. Some victims were therefore more likely to experience solidarity and form social
            bonds than others. Based on the close-reading of some victims’ accounts, some
            researchers have for instance suggested that group cohesion and solidarity were stronger
            among women, who were detained separately, than among men in Nazi death camps; however,
            in the lack of evidence, others have rejected this hypothesis <ptr target="#pingel2010"/> <ptr target="#schwarz1998"/>.</p>
         <p>Even though a
            comparative study of how men and women behaved could enhance our understanding of the
            Holocaust from the victims’ perspective, producing evidence based insights into the
            world of Nazi concentration camps is challenging. Perpetrators destroyed camp
            documentation and victims’ perspective of the past is dispersed in tens of thousands of
            oral history interviews they gave. By watching a handful
            of interviews, we can gather only anecdotal evidence. At the moment, there is no
            reliable methodology to gather systematic evidence from a large number of oral history
            interviews. Traditional methods of corpus and computational linguistics cannot alone
            address this challenge. To produce systematic evidence from thousands of oral history
            interviews, it is important to account not only what is discussed but also how it is
            discussed. In other words, it is necessary to analyze how the narratives in thousands of
            oral history interviews unfold. We therefore developed a novel conceptual and
            computational approach adopted from the study of molecular processes. This novel method
            enabled us to study how narratives unfold in 2500 hours of oral history interviews with
            Auschwitz survivors. Even more importantly, it provided us with systematic evidence that
            among women solidarity and social bonds were stronger in Auschwitz.</p>
         <p>Before presenting the results of our study, we introduce the dataset we worked with, the
            challenges it raises, and the way we tackled these challenges conceptually and
            computationally.</p></div>

         <head>2. Our dataset and its historical context</head>
         <p>In this study we analyzed testimonies given by 6628 Jewish victims (2033 men and 4595
            women) born in 13 different countries. The 6628 victims we worked with all stayed in the
            Birkenau sub-camp of the Auschwitz complex.<note> The Auschwitz complex came to
               existence in the Spring of 1940 in Southern Poland (that time part of Nazi Germany)
               about 70 km from Cracow. Over the subsequent years, the complex continued to grow
               incorporating various sub-camps.</note> In the Auschwitz camp system, Birkenau was
            the largest and the most lethal sub-camp where most Jewish victims were housed and
               perished.<note> The construction of Auschwitz-Birkenau (renamed Auschwitz II in
               November, 1943) began in the Autumn of 1941 and started to receive deportees from the
               Spring of 1942. In addition to an extremely large Jewish population, Birkenau also
               housed Polish and Roma victims. It was both a killing center, equipped with gas
               chambers and crematoria, and a work camp where victims were forced to slave labour.
               Victims were transported by trains to Birkenau from various European
               countries.</note> After arriving at the camp, the SS [<title rend="italic">Die
               Schutzstaffel</title>], the Nazi paramilitary organization in charge of running death
            camps, selected those men and women who were able to work. Those who did not pass the
            arrival selection were murdered with Cyclon-B gas and cremated. Those few people who
            passed the arrival selection were deprived of their belongings, disinfected, registered
            (often tattooed) and forced to live in harsh conditions; men and women were housed in
            different sections of Birkenau. Victims often died due to starvation, various diseases,
            physical violence, and the extreme cold. During their stay in Birkenau, most victims had
            to work <ptr target="#hayes2000"/>. Sometimes the SS could, however, not keep pace with the influx of
            new deportees, and victims were waiting to get some work. There was also a large group
            of victims in Birkenau who never worked. Auschwitz-Birkenau was also a transit camp from
            where victims were sent to other camps. During the time (which could be quite long) that
            victims were waiting for transfer, they were, in fact, not given any work; they just
            hung around in the camp. </p>
         <p>Our study is based on a data set that consists of oral history
            interviews with Holocaust victims. The USC Shoah Foundation provided us with this data
            set from its collection of approximately 50.000 Holocaust video testimonies recorded
            between 1981 and 2019. These video testimonies are preserved in the Visual History
            Archive of the Foundation at the University of Southern California in Los Angeles.<note>
               For more details see the website of Shoah Foundation,<ref
                  target="https://sfi.usc.edu/">https://sfi.usc.edu/</ref>.</note> Precisely, the Foundation gave us access
            to all of its interviews with Auschwitz survivors, which is a collection of 12200
            Interviews in 26 different languages recorded in 47 different countries. We were also
            provided with basic biodata (gender and place of birth) about each survivor whose
            testimony is included. Given that we limited our investigation to Jewish victims who
            stayed in the Birkenau subcamp of the Auschwitz complex, we worked with 6829 interviews
            from the original data pool. These interviews were conducted in 26 different languages
            in 43 different countries. </p>
         <p>Until today, only a small portion of USC Shoah Foundation’s testimonies
            have been transcribed and published <ptr target="#toth2021"/>. In this study we could not therefore
            work with interview transcripts. We worked with the topical annotation of testimonies by
            the Foundation. In the last three decades, the professional staff of the Shoah
            Foundation indexed the minute based segments of each testimony with topic words from a
            designated thesaurus or controlled vocabularies. This thesaurus, a very large formally
            defined set of topic words, has been developed by the Foundation in the 1990s; the goal
            of the thesaurus is to cover all possible aspects of genocide experiences, including
            acts of solidarity and memories of social bonds <ptr target="#gustman1998"/>. Professional annotators
            (or indexers as the Foundation calls them) watched testimony videos and indexed their
            content with the help of topic words from the thesaurus in a purpose-built testimony
            database; visual and audio features of testimonies were not indexed. </p> 
         <p>For the purposes of this research the Foundation provided us access to the raw data
            underlying their testimony database.<note> Upon registration, the dataset we worked on
               is accessible through the purpose built webinterface of the Visual History Archive,
               see <ref target="https://vhaonline.usc.edu">https://vhaonline.usc.edu</ref>.</note> The Foundation has reproduced, specifically for
            our study, all testimony segments, understood as a set of topic words (see a more
            technical description in the Implementation section), in which Auschwitz survivors
            discuss their stay in the camp. In our study, we relied exclusively on the
            English language topic words. Hence a limitation of our study is given by the fact that
            we were unable to study how topics related to solidarity and social bonds are discussed
            across testimonies in different languages. Another limitation of our study is that we
            were unable to work with the visual and audio aspects of the testimonies (see further
            discussion of these limitations in the Conclusion section).</p></div>

         <head>3. Two Computational Challenges Related to Survivor Testimonies</head>
         <p>Since the late 1970s archives and museums have been recording oral history interviews
            with Holocaust victims <ptr target="#ecker2007"/>. The large-scale study of these interviews could
            offer a unique insight into victims’ experience <ptr target="#greenspan2012"/>. Nevertheless, oral
            history testimonies raise two key computational and conceptual challenges.</p>
         <p>Researchers would need to account for not only which topics are present in individual
            testimonies but also how these topics are discussed across thousands of testimonies. On
            the one hand, survivors’ oral history interviews consist of questions and answers. On
            the other hand, a survivor testimony is a sequence of topics that together form a
            narrative about the past. Survivor testimonies can be thus seen as an ensemble of
            individual narrative processes. Given that interviews unfold over time, the ensemble of
            narrative processes has an underlying dynamic. The first computational challenge that
            survivor testimonies raise can be summarized in the following two questions:</p>
               
         <list type="ordered"><item>How can we model the ensemble of narrative processes understood as sequences of
            topics unfolding over time?</item>
         <item>How can we measure the probability and the importance of topics in the ensemble of
            narrative processes?</item>
</list>               
         <p>The second challenge relates to the latter question. Survivor testimonies are mediated.
            Survivors gave testimonies decades after their liberation; their testimonies may have
            been shaped by post-Holocaust culture, including films and novels. Furthermore,
            survivors recall deeply traumatic memories, which are characterized by flashbacks and
            the suppression of certain particularly painful themes <ptr target="#langer1993"/>. Some survivors
            might overemphasize the significance of certain topics such as solidarity and social
            bonds, while others might underestimate it. Finally, the existing oral history
            testimonies are only the tip of the iceberg. The overwhelming majority of victims never
            had the chance to speak. For all these reasons, we needed a computational model that can
            take the mediated nature of survivor testimonies into account when measuring the
            probability and the importance of topics in narrative processes. </p></div>
         </div>
         <div>
         <head>II. Methodology</head>
            <div>
         <head>1. Our Conceptual Framework</head>
         <p>We developed a conceptual framework to tackle the problems above that is centered around
            three aspects: narrative system, narrative flux, and narrative pathway.</p>
         <p>We define the narrative system as the ensemble of all possible topics that survivors
            address, including transitions between these topics. We represent the narrative system
            as a state space with topics as discrete states <ptr target="#alpay2006"/>. Each
            interview, which is viewed as a sequence of consecutive topics, is a <q>walking</q> over the
            state space. In other words, each interview is a possible realization of the narrative
            system. Once all possible realizations were learned (see below), we could estimate the
            probability of each topic in the ensemble of all interviews. This approach also allowed
            us to compare testimonies of men and women. We viewed the interviews of each gender
            group as different instances of the same narrative system; we could thus compare the
            probabilities of topics that different instances yield (see the Implementation
            section).</p>
         <p>To get insights into dynamics underlying narratives of survivors, we drew on the
            concepts of narrative pathway and narrative flux. In our conceptual framework, the
            narrative pathway describes a given sequence of states (i.e., topics) connecting two
            topics. The narrative flux quantifies the relative amount (percentage) of traffic going
            through a given narrative pathway. Consider the following example. </p>
         <p>Two key topics in testimonies are arrival at a death camp (arrival) and discussion of
            social relations (<emph>social bonds</emph>). Testimonies can get from the topic arrival to the topic
            social bonds in many different ways. For instance, after discussing arrival, they can
            discuss the topic selection, and then social bonds. This corresponds to the narrative
            pathway <emph>arrival → selections → </emph>social bonds. The narrative flux
            considers all possible pathways between <emph>arrival</emph> and social bonds
            in the ensemble of all interviews (or interviews of women and interviews of men); then
            it tells us what fraction percentage goes through <emph>selections</emph>. In
            short, through the notion of narrative pathway and narrative flux, we can get insight
            into how narrative processes are likely to unfold in the ensemble of many
            testimonies.</p></div>
         
         <div>
         <head>2. Our Computational Model</head>
         <p>From molecular physics we adopt the Markov State Model (MSM) and we perform a
            computational analysis of the ensemble of all interviews as a narrative system <ptr target="#chodera2014"/> <ptr target="#husic2018"/>. Specifically, we use the Transition Path Theory
            (TPT) framework to model the dynamics of a narrative system <ptr target="#vanden2006"/>.</p>
         <p>In the context of our research, we interpret the ensemble of interviews as realizations
            of a Markovian dynamic system; this is defined over a state space consisting of all
            topics that survivors address. By drawing on the Markov State Model we obtain the
            stationary probability (also known as equilibrium state or stable probability) of each
            topic. In simple terms, this describes the overall probability of hearing a survivor
            mentioning a topic if we keep listening to interviews for a reasonably long time (see
            the Implementation section for technical details on and definition of overall
            probability). </p>
         <p>We uncovered narrative pathways and quantified narrative flux by using the TPT, a
            quantitative framework based on MSMs <ptr target="#metzner2009"/>. In the context of studying
            narrations with MSMs, TPT is used as a means to organize and summarize large numbers of
            individual narrations (i.e. sequences of consecutive topics or narrative pathways as
            realized in thousands of interviews) and to make them accessible to our interpretation.
            In practice, TPT associates a number value (called the flux) to any possible narration
            (or any possible sequence of topics). This number tells us how prevalent a given
            narrative pathway is in the underlying corpus of interviews, i.e., it summarizes how
            likely it is that an interviewee reported about topics in a certain order. We can
            therefore use TPT to sort narrations by their prevalence, which also allows us to
            identify the most common narrations from the data. </p>
         <p>This method was borrowed from dynamic systems modelling of molecular processes where TPT
            studies ensembles of reactive trajectories, i.e., trajectories that make transitions
            between defined starting state A and end state B. </p>
         <p>In our work, we considered interviews as such trajectories. TPT therefore analyses
            narrations from a starting to an ending topic. We have chosen topics associated with
            camp detention as the starting and topics associated with liberation as the ending
            points. The narrations are therefore handled consistently and our results show prevalent
            narrations that are aligned to the Auschwitz-Birkenau experiences.</p>
         <p>We used the technique of pathway decomposition, elaborated as part of TPT, to uncover
            the most important sequences of states (narrative pathways in our research) and to
            quantify the amount of traffic (or flux) that goes through a certain sequence of states.
            As a whole, we used the TPT to decompose the ensemble of all possible narrative pathways
            by ranking each of the pathways by their flux. This enabled us to identify the <q>busiest</q>
            narrative pathways that men and women used between a pair of topics. </p>
         <p>Finally, based on our TPT analysis, we also model the narrative system as a directed
            graph. In this graph each topic (or a state in the state space model described above) is
            a node; the move of interviews from topic A to topic B is represented as an edge, which
            is weighted in terms of the probability of moving to topic B after topic A. To measure
            the importance and influence of each topic within the narrative system represented as a
            directed graph, we apply two different metrics. First, we measure the PageRank value of
            each topic as a node in the directed graph. The PageRank value is often used to measure
            the influence of humans in social networks, as well as the importance of webpages in
            Google search algorithms. By the same token as the PageRank value gives insight into the
            importance of webpages by modelling internet users movements from webpage to webpage, it
            reveals the importance of topics in survivor testimonies by modelling how these topics
            follow each other in testimonies. Actually, the PageRank values of nodes in a directed
            graph are closely related to the stationary probabilities described above; if a weighted
            directed graph represents a Markovian dynamic system, the PageRank values of nodes in
            the graph are the dumped stationary probabilities of states in the corresponding
            Markovian system <ptr target="#page1999"/>. The major advantage of the PageRank value is that
            it takes into consideration inbound and outbound links to a given node (topic in the
            context of our research), as well as the importance of connected nodes; hence the
            PageRank value expresses how embedded a given node is in the entire network <ptr target="#lee2013"/>. Second, we calculate the normalized closeness centrality of each node. This
            evaluates importance by summing the shortest paths from a given node; in other words, it
            expresses how connected a given node (or topic in the context of our research) is
            <ptr target="#freeman1978"/>.</p></div>

         <head>1. Understanding the significance of topics related to solidarity and social bonds in
            survivor narratives</head> 
         <p>The 6628 Birkenau survivors we worked with discuss hundreds of topics when recalling
            their stay in the death camp; these topics cover many different aspects of camp life
            ranging from sanitary conditions to everyday interactions. As explained above, in the
            last three decades the Shoah Foundations’ indexer team watched these testimonies and
            annotated each testimony segment by means of topic words from the Foundation’s topical
            thesaurus. In total, there are 727 different topic words attached to interview segments
            related to Birkenau. However, many of these topics occur only in a few interviews. As a
            first step, a human agent with domain knowledge analyzed the 727 topic words and reduced
            them to 101 higher level topics (see Methodology). Next, we estimated the stationary
            probability of each higher level topic (when using probability we always mean the
            stationary probability of a topic). We specifically focused on two higher level topics:
            social bonds and aid giving. The former includes topics discussing social relations
            (friendships, camaraderie, non-intimate social relations etc.) in the camp; the latter
            relates to various acts of solidarity (food sharing, clothing provision, sustenance
            provision, etc.) We also calculated their closeness centrality and PageRank Value.</p>
         <p>In the following, we ranked the topics according to stationary probability in descending
            order. This allowed us to identify the most probable topics in survivor narratives (see
            Figure 1). </p>

                  <head>Wordcloud featuring the most probable topics in testimonies of
                     Auschwitz-Birkenau survivors identified with a Markov State Model. The font size of
                     topics is adjusted according to their stationary probability. The wordcloud demonstrates
                     that two key topics related to solidarity and social bonds (aid giving and social bonds
                     in red) are among the most probable topics. The word cloud also demonstrates that they
                     are as probable as tattoo and more probable than clothing (in red).</head>
                  <graphic url="resources/images/100002010000048000000480B51348C940EA26FD.png"/>
                  <figDesc>Image of a wordcloud</figDesc>
               </figure>
         
               
         <p>Not surprisingly, one of the most probable topics that survivors discuss is <emph>selections</emph>. This is the third most common topic after living
            conditions and camp procedures. Selection was a wanton and highly feared practice in
            Nazi death camps. All victims arriving at camps first underwent a selection procedure.
            Selection was also a daily routine in Nazi concentration camps; the SS kept eliminating
            the unfit and sending them to gas chambers. Since selection was a highly probable event,
            we used it as a reference point to assess the probability of topics describing
            solidarity and social relations. Compared to <emph>social bonds</emph>, the
            probability of <emph>selections</emph> is 3.4 times higher. Compared to <emph>aid giving</emph>, the probability of <emph>selection</emph>s
            is 2.28 times higher. <emph>Aid giving</emph> and <emph>social
               bonds</emph> are not as probable as <emph>selections</emph>. But they are
            still very probable if we take into consideration that on average <emph
               >selections</emph> is 92 times more probable than any other topic. The overall
            importance of <emph>social relations</emph> and <emph>aid
               giving</emph> are also demonstrated by the fact that they are part of the upper
            quantile in the ranking of all topics in terms of their stationary probabilities. <emph>Aid giving </emph>is the 14th most probable topic and <emph
               >social bonds </emph>is the 18th most probable topic. The ranking of topics by PageRank
            value resulted in similar results.</p>
         <p>We also measured the normalized closeness centrality of <emph>social
               bonds</emph> and <emph>aid giving </emph>in the directed graph representing
            the narrative system. We found that the topic <emph>aid giving </emph>is the
            4th most important element of survivor narratives and <emph>social
               bonds</emph> is the 20th most important element in survivor narratives. They are both
            part of the upper quantile.</p>
         <p>Due to the limitations of the Markovian framework (see Implementation section), we could
            not harness specific forms of social bonds and acts of solidarity. Our approach was
            restricted to broader topics. In the next section, as part of a comparative analysis of
            narratives by women and men, we will combine the Markovian framework with inferential
            statistics, which will give insights into details of social relations and acts of
            solidarity.</p>
         <p>Our findings highlight that survivors discuss a great deal of social activity and
            solidarity when recalling memories of Birkenau. It is important to underline that
            survivors were not asked by interviewers to address solidarity and social bonds in the
            camp. It was the survivors' own decision to address these topics. In light of this, we
            think that what is recalled in the following testimony excerpt cannot be viewed as an
            anecdotal or nostalgic memory but in fact describes a relatively common experience:</p>
         <cit><quote rend="block">We became friends with everybody — anybody and everybody. We — we — we really cared for
            each other. We did everything possible to try and encourage each other. If somebody
            wanted to hang themselves because they couldn't take it any more; we somehow talked 'em
            out of it. If somebody, for instance, said, I'm giving up, I can't do it any more, we
            somehow talked them out of it. We maybe shared a little piece of bread. The bread was
            mostly made out of sawdust, but somehow we put a little piece of bread in his mouth. We
            did all kinds of those kinds of things.</quote> <ptr target="#gross1996" loc="Tape 2, 00:28:34"/></cit> </div>

         <head>2. Comparative analysis of solidarity and social relations in narratives of men and
            women</head>
         <p>Men and women were detained and housed in different sections of Birkenau. We therefore
            examined and compared the probability of topics related to acts of solidarity and social
            bonds in narratives of women and men (see the Methodology section). To prove that
            differences were not due to either chance or sample bias, we used the method of
            bootstrapping (see below and the Methodology section) <ptr target="#efron2004"/>. Again, we compared the importance of topics related to acts of
            solidarity and social bonds in narratives of men and women by drawing on normalized
            closeness centrality and the PageRank value. We also used the Fisher’s exact test to
            assess whether the difference is statistically significant (p value 0.05) <ptr target="#fisher1922"/>. Finally, we measured the strength of association between gender and each topic
            with odds ratio analysis (Morris and Gardner, 1988). This enabled us to focus on
            specific forms of social bonds and acts of solidarity (see Figure 2).</p>

                     strengths of association &gt;1 or &lt;1, respectively; dot line shows a degree of

                     strengths of association &gt;1 or &lt;1, respectively; dot line shows a degree of

               </figure>
         
         
       
         <p>We found that the topic <emph>social bonds </emph>is much more probable in
            testimonies of women; in their testimonies we are significantly more likely to hear
            about discussions of social relations in the camp. Our findings through bootstrapping is
            particularly revealing (see Figure 3). In short, over thousands of times we randomly
            sampled testimonies of women and men; each time we trained two Markov State Models over
            the same state space and measured the stationary probability of every topic. We observed
            that even if we randomly select testimonies of men and women, in the testimonies of
            women <emph>social bonds</emph> will always be more probable. The measurement
            of strength of association also confirmed this finding. <emph>Social
               bonds</emph> is positively correlated with women and negatively correlated with men.
            Finally, the normalized closeness centrality and the PagreRank value are also higher
            when testimonies of men and women are modeled as directed graphs. </p>
         <p>In the case of the topic <emph>aid giving</emph> the difference between men
            and women is less strong. The probability of this topic is only by 7 percent higher in
            testimonies of women, even though the difference between men and women is statistically
            significant and remains consistent through the randomized sampling (see Figure 3).
            Similarly, the normalized closeness centrality and the PageRank value are higher for
            women.</p>

                     model. On the other hand, it shows that if we randomly sample interviews by men and
                     women over thousands of times, the stationary probability of topics above will always be
                     higher in the women sample. In other words, the difference between men and women is
                     consistent and not due to sample bias.</head>

                     women over thousands of times, the stationary probability of topics above will always be
                     higher in the women sample. In other words, the difference between men and women is
                     consistent and not due to sample bias.</head>

               <p>With the help of statistical significance testing and odds ratio analysis, we also examined specific forms of solidarity and social bonds (see Figure 2 and 3). The Shoah Foundation’s keyword
            thesaurus has various terms to describe different types of solidarity. For instance, the
            topic word <emph>food sharing </emph>describes moments when a survivor recalls
            an episode of food sharing in the camp. We found that in testimonies of women we are
            much more likely to hear about episodes of food sharing. Similarly, women are more
            likely to discuss memories about another person providing them with clothes (the topic
            of <emph>clothing provision</emph>). Other topics related to solidarity, such
            as for instance <emph>medical care provision </emph>and <emph
               >sustenance provision,</emph> are also positively correlated with women, though they
            lack statistical significance. As a whole, we were unable to find any topic related to
            solidarity, which is positively correlated with men.</p>
         <p>The Shoah Foundation’s keyword thesaurus is less rich in terms of details about social
            bonds. Its keywords <emph>friends </emph>and <emph>friendships
            </emph>describe moments when survivors discuss intimate bonds in the camp. Again, we found
            a very strong and statistically significant positive correlation with women and a
            negative correlation with men. Similarly, women are more likely to recall less intimate
            social bonds from the camp. Other topics related to sociability and solidarity feature a
            similar difference. For instance, topics describing cultural activity, or rumors are all
            positively correlated with women (see Figure 2) and feature statistical significance.
            Women are also more likely to discuss suicide attempts in the camp.</p>
         <p>At the same time, we also found interesting commonalities between men and women. It is a
            leitmotif in testimonies that victims warned each other. We did not find a significant
            difference in terms of the probability of hearing about this topic (see Figure 7).
            Another commonality is stealing (see Figure 6); victims often discuss memories about
            other victims stealing from them; men and women are equally likely to recall this
            experience. Finally, preferential treatment by camp functionaries is also equally likely
            to be recalled by both men and women (see Figure 8).</p>

         <p>We also looked at those topics that dominate men's recalling of Auschwitz-Birkenau (see
            Figure 3). We found that men are more likely to recall topics related to physical
            violence (killings, beatings, executions, etc). Furthermore, we found that topics
            related to various clandestine activities (bribery, resistance, covert activities) are
            also more correlated with men than with women.</p>
         <p>Furthermore, we examined whether the difference between women and men can be also
            observed if we compare men and women of the same nationalities. We found that the
            probability of topics related to social bonds and solidarity are either higher for women
            or there is no difference. We were unable to find any nationality where the probability
            of topics related to solidarity and social bonds would be higher for men. </p>
         <p>By further partitioning the data, we also surveyed women and men who did not work while
            they were in Birkenau. We observed the same trend as above. In narratives of women who
            did not report any forced labour activity, topics related to solidarity and social bonds
            are more probable.</p>
         <p>Finally, we also studied the testimonies of those women and men who had to work. Given
            that the forced labour type and its difficulty varied a lot in Nazi death camps, we
            first divided the forced labour activities into three groups based on physical effort
            demands: easy work (secretarial work, science/research-related forced labor, translation
            etc), medium hard work (tattooing, factory work, gas chamber cleaning, etc), very hard
            physical work (mining, road and rail construction, etc). In our dataset, percentages of
            women and men who did the same type of work are quite similar. The majority of men
            (16.5% of all men survivors) and women survivors (14.5% of all women survivors) reported
            medium hard work. Even when comparing the working population of Birkenau, we could
            observe the trend that in narratives of women, topics related to social relations,
            friendships, and food sharing are more probable. However, there was no difference in the
            probability of the topic <emph>aid giving</emph>. This is equally probable in
            narratives of men and women who worked while they stayed in Birkenau.</p></div>

         <head>3. Narrative pathways leading to and from topics of solidarity and social bonds</head>
         <p>Using TPT, we found that both men and women discuss solidarity in the context of the
            everyday living environment (i.e., camp barrack) and forced labour activity, which is an
            interesting commonality. However, when we examined the narrative flux that goes through
            the most important narrative pathways leading to acts of solidarity in narratives of
            women and men, we found an important difference: women are more likely than men to
            discuss acts of solidarity in the context of camp barracks (see Figure 10 and Figure
            12).</p>

         <p>We examined all possible pathways leading from the topic <emph>arrival</emph>
            to the topic <emph>aid giving</emph> in narratives of men and women. In
            narratives of women, more traffic is found going through the pathways in which <emph>aid giving</emph> is preceded by the topic <emph>living
               conditions.</emph> For instance, the following narrative pathway is present in both men
            and women testimonies, but again, in testimonies of women the narrative flux (7.8%) is
            higher than in testimonies of men (5.2%):</p>

               >intake procedures </emph>→ <emph>living conditions </emph>→ <emph>aid giving</emph>
         </p>
         <p>The investigation of narrative pathways connecting the topic <emph>living
               conditions</emph> with the topic <emph>aid giving</emph> also confirmed that
            women are more likely to connect solidarity with the world of their barracks.</p>
         <p>We also found that in testimonies of women the discussion of social relations is more
            likely to be preceded by the discussion of living environments. The following narrative
            pathway is present in testimonies of both men and women. However, in testimonies of
            women the amount of narrative flux is much higher (14.12%) than in testimonies of men

         <p>Even though both men and women often discuss social relations and solidarity following

               </emph>→<emph>social relations</emph>
         </p>
         <p>To sum up, the way men and women discuss social relations and solidarity feature notable
            similarities. They both tend to discuss them following topics related to living and
            housing conditions and forced labor. Nevertheless, we also found that women are more
            likely to discuss social activity and acts of solidarity in the context of the everyday
            living environment; by contrast men tend to discuss solidarity and social relations in
            the context of forced labour. All this suggests that women mainly socialized in their
            barracks, whereas men experienced solidarity and social interactions in the working
            environment.</p></div>

         <p>The availability of large survivor testimony datasets is now making it possible to
            accomplish evidence based studies of victims’ experience during the Holocaust. A key
            problem has been how best to study thousands of testimonies together and produce
            systematic evidence. We modeled the testimonies of 6628 Auschwitz-Birkenau survivors
            with MSM, which 'summarized' the narratives underlying these testimonies. This gave us
            an unprecedented insight into victims’ experience.</p>
         <p>We found that acts of solidarity and social ties among victims were not at all uncommon
            in Auschwitz-Birkenau. The significance of this finding can be understood in light of
            what researchers and survivors often described as dehumanization. The following words by
            a Hungarian survivor, demonstrate what dehumanization meant in Auschwitz-Birkenau:</p>

            one was run onto the wire and got killed. Fine, she's. She's lucky. I'm not lucky.
            Because I haven't got the guts to do it. So that is the mentality. You know, that's how
            you live. You're not a human. You're dehumanized. You don't think. You follow
            instructions like an animal, not even — an animal wouldn't listen to it. So you become a
            piece of robot really, which if you don't where emotions and hunger meets or takes over.</quote> <ptr target="#neumann1996" loc="Tape 4, 00:21:00"/>
            </cit> 
         <p>By reducing victims into a dehumanized state, the SS deliberately thwarted victims’
            otherwise natural effort to take care of each other. Furthermore, the SS deliberately
            undermined social bonds between victims by frequently transferring them between forced
            labour squads, camps, and barracks. As the historian, Gideon Greif, has put it, <quote rend="inline">the
            Nazi camp system aimed to break down all solidarity human relations as well as the
            belief in the possibility of self-determined actions</quote> <ptr target="#greif1999" loc="242"/>. The 
            question whether some form of solidarity and sociability could still exist in
            Auschwitz-Birkenau therefore translates into the question of how successful the SS was
            in its effort to destroy the human nature of victims. Accounts such as the one above or
            the testimony excerpt cited at the beginning of this paper have often convinced
            researchers that solidarity and deeper human ties were actually anomalies in Auschwitz.
            For instance, the sociologist, Wolfgang Sofsky, has recently described the Nazi death
            camp as a place where victims lived in <quote rend="inline">a social state of nature in which the person who
               prevailed was the one who was stronger</quote> <ptr target="#sofsky2013" loc="162"/>. This view is in
            contrast with the accounts of many survivors and with the findings of some historians.
            Again, as one survivor cited above said, <quote rend="inline">we did everything possible to try and
            encourage each other.</quote> The hypothesis that solidarity and social bonds among victims
            were just anomalies in Auschwitz is also in contrast with our findings. </p>
         <p>In fact, the 6628 survivors in our dataset do speak about a great deal of solidarity and
            social interactions. Acts of solidarity and memories of social life are highly important
            elements of their memories. Their importance and high probability within the narrative
            system indicates that they were also significant and relatively frequent elements of
            camp life. Even if statistical frequencies and probabilities of topics measured by
            modelling thousands of narratives cannot be equated with the broader and non-statistical
            concept of importance, they can still be treated as reliable indicators giving
            information about the world that these narratives recall. As a matter of fact, we will
            never know how victims lived in Nazi death camps. But by analyzing thousands of survivor
            narratives, we can attempt to construct estimates about basic aspects of life in Nazi
            death camps. </p>
         <p>Our computational approach also allowed us to compare the narratives of women and men
            and to shed light on a key difference: in testimonies of women solidarity and social
            relations are more probable and more important topics than in testimonies of men. Based
            on the close reading of a handful of testimonies, this gender difference has been
            already noticed but lacked the backing of wide-scale quantitative evidence. In this
            study, we provide systematic evidence that in narratives of women survivors of
            Auschwitz-Birkenau solidarity and social relations are much more important topics. </p>
         <p>Nevertheless, this finding leads to a key problem that any study of belated memories
            about a past event involves. Memory sometimes alters the way humans see their past;
            therefore, we need to ask how can we produce evidence about the past by drawing on
            belated memories? Taking this question into the context of this study, to what extent
            does the fact that in belated memories of women solidarity and social bonds are more
            probable, indicate that they were also more prevalent in the women sections of Birkenau?
            We tackled this problem with the help of bootstrapping, i.e., with the help of
            randomized trials. It is possible that some women overestimate the importance of
            solidarity and social relations in the past and some men underestimate their
            significance; it is possible that memory and post-Holocaust experience (including
            watching specific films and reading Holocaust novels) have "sweetened" the experiences
            made in the past for some women and triggered bitterness in some men. Nevertheless, with
            the help of randomized samples we pointed out that the difference between men and women
            is consistent. If our initial finding that solidarity and social relations are more
            probable in narratives of women would have been due to the sweetening effect of
            nostalgic memory or due to sampling bias, the difference between men and women would
            have faded over thousands of randomized trials.</p>
         <p>Our findings suggest that women generally tend to show more solidarity in extreme
            circumstances such as detainment. However, it is important to highlight a historical
            factor as a result of which social adaptation for Jewish men in Birkenau must have been
            particularly difficult. By the time that mass deportations of European Jewry to
            Auschwitz-Birkenau began, many of the young and middle aged Jewish men had already been
            in forced labour service <ptr target="#gruner2006"/>. Most of the men who were deported to
            Auschwitz-Birkenau were older men; they had therefore very slim chances to survive the
            selection process at the arrival. As a result, most probably there were more women of
            the same nationalities than men of the same nationalities. Being surrounded by women of
            the same nationality, a woman could find solidarity and friends much easier than a man.
            To corroborate this explanation, we would however need to know more about whom women
            formed friendships with and who offered solidarity and help to them.<note>For instance,
               the mass deportations of the Hungarian Jewry began in the Spring of 1944. Hungarian
               Jewish men had been taken to forced labour from 1941. The vast majority of younger
               Hungarian Jewish men were not deported to Auschwitz <ptr target="#braham1977"/> <ptr target="#michelbacher2020"/>.</note>

               <div>
         <head>2. Limitations of our methodology</head>
         <p>This points out the limitation of this study. We could study only those topics that the
            Shoah Foundation’s index system covers. Unfortunately, the index system does not offer
            any information about whom victims were friends with. Neither does it contain keywords
            that signal conflicts between victims. We could not therefore study whether men or women
            are more likely to recall animosity. Similarly, the use of generalized keywords to
            describe human behavior has its own limitations since they cannot describe the richness
            and subtleties of human behavior. For instance, friendship and aid giving are complex
            concepts and behavioral patterns with many different possible meanings and nuances that
            a general keyword cannot describe. This limitation can in part explain the difference
            between men and women. When discussing social relations in the camp, women and men might
            express their ideas and memories very differently. Where women use friendship, men might
            for instance use other words that suggest less intimate social bonds. Unfortunately, the
            unified keyword system cannot account for such differences and the close-listening of
            2500 hours of survivor testimonies is not viable. </p>
         <p>Another limitation of our study is that we could not work with
            interview transcripts in the original languages. Interviewees of different languages
            might have expressed similar experiences in different ways, which in turn might have
            produced unevenness in the topical annotation. For instance, victims of different
            linguistic backgrounds may use very different linguistic strategies to account
            experiences of social bonds and aid giving. </p>
         <p>Finally, topical annotation cannot address a key feature of traumatic narration. This is
            silence. Traumatic memories often remain suppressed and speakers lack the linguistic
            ability to articulate them. Hence, the bulk of traumatic memory can hardly be described
            with unified topic words. </p></div>
               <div>
         <head>3. Implications for future research</head>
         <p>Despite these limitations, the use of the Markov State Model has helped to tackle an old
            problem that among others, the Italian survivor of Auschwitz and the author of many
            Holocaust novels, Primo Levi (1917 - 1987), has pinpointed. This is the fallacy of the
            individual memory of a survivor. As Levi said, the human memory is a marvelous
            instrument but it makes mistakes <ptr target="#levi1986" loc="14"/>. The fallacy of individual memories
            can be counterbalanced with the study of the memory of many survivors. But the study of
            many individual memories poses its own challenges: testimonies are mediated and
            unbalanced in terms of gender for instance; they miss the voice of those who did not
            survive or did not give a testimony. To face these challenges, in this paper we applied
            the Markov State Model combined with the Transition Path Theory. This enabled us to
            approach thousands of individual testimonies as expressions of the collective
            experience. Most importantly, it enabled us to compare narratives of women and men.
            Future work can use the methods we present in this paper to study victims’ experience in
            other Nazi death camps. </p>
         <p>Future work can also rely on our methodological and conceptual approach to study a great
            variety of big data involving sequences of states in the humanities. Such datasets are
            ubiquitous in history and in other humanities fields. Datasets of national biographies,
            for instance the Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, could be studied by
            representing historical actors’ life trajectories as sequences of states. Similarly, the
            circulation of artistic objects among different owners (so-called <q>object biographies</q>)
            can be represented as sequences of states. The concept of state space and the Markov
            State Model can be applied to model and analyze these sequences of states. Most
            importantly, a methodology and conceptual framework applied to understand processes both
            in nature and in human civilizations can offer new bridges between science and
            humanities in the future.</p>

         <p>In this paper we discuss our
            methodology and its implementation in two different sections. The Methodology section
            above aimed to offer a general overview of our methodology. Here we describe
            step-by-step how we implemented our methodology. In addition to the step-by-step
            description, Figure 15 and 16 also help understand the key steps in the implementation
            process. At the same time, for a complete understanding of the implementation, readers
            might need some background in probabilistic modeling, which we cannot provide here. </p>

                     <head>Methodological Overview 1: From individual interviews to the
                        modelling of 6628 interviews as a Markovian dynamic system. A, a single interview is
                        processed into 1 minute segments that are assigned to topic terms each (color-coded).
                        Interviews are therefore represented as sequences of consecutive topics (or narrative
                        pathways). B The whole interview corpus consists of 6628 interviews that are converted
                        into 6628 series of topic terms. B, Transition matrix that summarises the probabilities
                        of hearing about a given topic following another topic as learned from all available
                        interviews. The transition matrix can also be represented as a directed graph; nodes are
                        the topics and the edge weights are the probabilities that an interviewee move from one
                        topic to another, it therefore stores all possible narrative trajectories that a
                        recalling of Auschwitz can follow in the corpus of all interviews. D. The “busiest” (or
                        the most prevalent) narrative pathways obtained by means of Transition path theory
                        (TPT). TPT extracts prevalent narrations from the MSM transition matrix; a narration is
                        here depicted as a (possibly non-linear) sequence of topics that goes from left to
                        right. Please note that this figure is a conceptual overview and does not represent real

         <head>2. Preprocessing</head>
         <p>In this research project we worked with the topic words that the trained expert human
            annotators of the Shoah Foundation had assigned to minute based segments of interviews
            in our data set. As a first step, we applied a feature engineering procedure; we grouped
            topic words and formed higher level topics. In total, we identified 101 higher level
            topics. Our feature selection procedure followed the keyword thesaurus of the Shoah
            Foundation. In this thesaurus each topic is clearly defined and formally not
            overlapping.</p>
         <p>The interview dataset we worked with is a set of matrices. Each matrix represents an
            interview; the rows correspond to minute-based interview segments and the columns
            represent the topic words associated (higher level topics as described above) with
            segments as a “one-hot-encoding”. This segment-topic word matrix is similar to
            document-term matrices used in bag-of-words models of document collections in text
            mining. We can also view each segment-topic word matrix as a sequence of topics that
            form a discrete narrative pathway; hence we first represented the interviews as sets of
            consecutive topics.</p>
         <p>Interview_1 = {topic 3, topic 1, topic 2 ………. topic n}</p>
         <p>Interview_2 = {topic 4, topic 3, topic 2 ………. topic n}</p>
         <p>Sometimes an interview segment can feature multiple topics. Consider the following
            example:</p>
         <p>Interview_3 = {topic 3 -&gt; topic 1, topic 4 -&gt; topic 2}</p>
         <p>Given that multiple topics may be assigned to certain segments, there is a fuzziness in
            the interview topic assignment. We address this fuzziness by randomly sampling from the
            topics of multi-topic segments. For instance, in case two topics are assigned to a
            segment, we treat it such that they could have occurred with either topic.</p>
         <p>Interview_3_A = {topic 3 -&gt; topic 1-&gt; topic 2}</p>
         <p>Interview_3_B = {topic 3 -&gt; topic 4-&gt; topic 2}</p>
         <p>As we do not alter the sequence of topics, the dynamics is conserved. In other words, we
            interpret an interview as a set of pathways that are compressed into a single pathway
            with multi-topic segments, and therefore disentangle it into single pathways.</p></div>
               <div>
         <head>3. The construction of a state space and its Markov modelling</head>
         <p>Next, we construct a state space from the sets of discrete narrative pathways. Each
            topic term is assigned a state number to allow further numerical processing; the topics
            are interpreted as discrete states of the state space. We treat each narrative pathway
            (i.e., interview) as walking over a state space that is spanned by the topic terms. The
            transition probabilities between discrete states are stored in a transition
            (probability) matrix. This is an n-by-n square matrix with n corresponding to the number
            of discrete states. The <emph>ij-</emph>th element of our transition matrix
            describes the probability that an interview discusses topic <emph>i</emph>
            after having addressed topic <emph>j</emph>. In molecular kinetics, this is
            called a conditional probability <ptr target="#prinz2011"/>. In the context of our research,
            the transition (probability) matrix models the narrative system consisting of discrete
            states that are the topic terms; it also represents the way interviews are likely to
            move from one topic to another topic. We also use the transition matrix as an adjacency
            matrix; from this we construct the directed graph representing the narrative network of
            topics.</p>
         <p>The transition matrix is the central object of the MSM. However, as the transition
            matrix describes the probability of hearing topic <emph>i </emph>in the
               future<emph>, conditioned on topic j in the present, </emph>it does not
            tell the (unconditional) probability of topic <emph>i</emph> irrespectively of
            the previous topic. We can however estimate the unconditional probability, also referred
            to as stationary and equilibrium state probability earlier, by noting that it is the
            stable state that the system converges to in the limit of infinite time. It is often
            denoted by π and follows from applying the dynamics n → ∞ times, i.e. π = lim n → ∞ p0.
            It can be computed either by calculating the limit explicitly, or as the left
            eigenvector of the transition matrix that corresponds to eigenvalue 1. We applied this
            latter technique, also known as spectral decomposition of the transition matrix <ptr target="#prinz2011"/>; specifically, we used the pyemma software package <ptr target="#scherer2015"/>.
            The resulting MSM stationary distribution can be approached as an estimator of the
            unconditional probability of a dynamic system in equilibrium. In the context of our
            research, the unconditional probability of a topic gives the overall probability that we
            will hear about this topic irrespectively of the preceding topic. </p></div>
               <div>
         <head>4. Application of TPT for the study of narrative pathways</head>
         <p>To shed light upon the full network of narrations, we compute the TPT flux network
            between start topic A and end topic B <ptr target="#scherer2015"/>. In brief, TPT defines the
            committor <emph>q</emph>+ as the probability that on a pathway from A to B, at
            a given intermediate step of that pathway, we reach B before going back to A. In the
            context of this manuscript, the committor thus describes the probability that during a
            specific narration (defined by its starting topic A and ending topic B), the narrator
            speaking about an intermediate topic first reaches the end topic B before talking about
            the start topic A again. The backward committor analogously describes the probability to
            go back to A before visiting B. From these two definitions, the current (usually
            referred to as the reactive flux) between two topics <emph>i </emph>and <emph>j</emph> can be computed by multiplying the backward committor of <emph>i</emph> with the stationary probability of that topic and with the transition probability to change from that topic <emph>i</emph> to another topic <emph>j</emph>, multiplied by the
            committor of <emph>j</emph>.</p>
         <p>To span the full flux network, this expression is evaluated between all topic terms for
            a given narration. In order to simplify the presented networks, we choose a cutoff of
            0.25 below which we do not display a given link. The graph layout is conducted using a
            few-step general graph-layout algorithm (Fruchtermann-Reingold) started from points
            distributed according to their committor probability on the x-axis <ptr target="#fruchterman1991"/>.</p></div>

         <head>5. Comparative analysis of narratives by women and men</head>
         <p>To assess different kinds of sub-samples (e.g. women or men), the initial sets of
            narrative pathways are split according to biographical information known about the
            interviewee. Independent MSM estimates are established for each of these data sets. We
            compare unconditional probabilities per topic between different datasets by computing
            the ratio between them. This is possible as the full state spaces of the compared MSMs
            are spanned by the same set of topics. Furthermore, converged MSM estimates of
            unconditional probabilities do not depend on sample size. The estimates are thus not
            biased by different sample sizes as long as they are converged. Topics that are not in
            the active set of either MSM are not used for comparison. We estimate the error of
            probability estimates by bootstrapping of trajectories, i.e., we have re-evaluated the
            investigated models by drawing the same number of interviews from our database at random
            (with replacement). This is repeated 1000 times to estimate a posterior distribution of
            the MSM stationary probabilities. </p></div>

                  <p>To validate our findings, on the one hand we use the implied timescales test <ptr target="#wehmeyer2019"/> <ptr target="#bowman2014"/>. This tests for the convergence of the model with
            the chosen lag time, which is a necessary condition for the data’s Markovianity. On the
            other hand, to validate our results with a different method, we also drew on the direct
            counting of how many times a given topic occurs in testimonies of men and women. We
            compared the proportion of women who mention a given topic to the proportion of men who
            also mention that topic. We divided the data sample into men and women on the one hand,
            to those that mention and do not mention a topic on the other. For each topic this
            produced a 2x2 contingency table: number of women mentioning a topic, number of women
            not mentioning a topic; number of men mentioning a topic, number of men not mentioning a
            topic. To assess whether the difference between men and women is significant, we applied
            the Fisher exact test on the contingency tables representing each topic (p-value 0.05).
            This revealed whether the difference between men and women is due to chance
            (null-hypothesis) or whether there is a correlation between gender and the fact that a
            topic word is mentioned. Finally, we measured the strength of correlation between gender
            and a topic word with the help of odds ratio analysis <ptr target="#morris1988"/>.</p>
