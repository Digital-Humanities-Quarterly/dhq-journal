                  <h2>Abstract</h2>
                  
                  
                  <p>In Auschwitz-Birkenau men and women were detained separately; anecdotal evidence
                     suggests that they behaved differently. However, producing evidence based insights
                     into victims' behavior is challenging. Perpetrators frequently destroyed camp
                     documentations; victims' perspective remains dispersed in thousands of oral history
                     interviews with survivors. Listening to, watching, or reading these thousands of
                     interviews is not viable, and there is no established computational approach to
                     gather systematic evidence from a large number of interviews. In this study, by
                     applying methods and concepts of molecular physics, we developed a conceptual
                     framework and computational approach to study thousands of human stories and we
                     investigated 6628 interviews by survivors of the Auschwitz-Birkenau death camp. We
                     applied the concept of state space and the Markov State Model to model the ensemble
                     of 6628 testimonies. The Markov State Model along with the Transition Path Theory
                     allowed us to compare the way women and men remember their time in the camp. We found
                     that acts of solidarity and social bonds are the most important topics in their
                     testimonies. However, we found that women are much more likely to address these
                     topics. We provide systematic evidence that not only were women more likely to recall
                     solidarity and social relations in their belated testimonies but they were also more
                     likely to perform acts of solidarity and form social bonds in Auschwitz-Birkenau.
                     Oral history interviews with Holocaust survivors constitute an important digital
                     cultural heritage that documents one of the darkest moments in human history;
                     generally, oral history collections are ubiquitous sources of modern history and
                     significant assets of libraries and archives. We anticipate that our conceptual and
                     computational framework will contribute not only to the understanding of gender
                     behavior but also to the exploration of oral history as a cultural heritage, as well
                     as to the computational study of narratives. This paper presents novel synergies
                     between history, computer science, and physics, and it aims to stimulate further
                     collaborations between these fields. </p>

                     <div class="ptext" id="p1">The Auschwitz Concentration Camp Complex was liberated seventy-seven years ago on
                        the
                        27th January 1945. Since then the camp where an estimated 1.1 million people were
                        murdered has became the symbol of the Holocaust. Despite the largenumber of studies
                        and
                        memoirs by survivors, the question to what extent solidarity and social bonds existed
                        among victims is still open [<a class="ref" href="#pingel2010">Pingel 2010</a>] [<a class="ref" href="#piper2009">Piper 2009</a>]. While some survivors claimed
                        that friendships, mutual support, and solidarity among victims thrived, others have
                        vehemently denied it.<a class="noteRef" href="#d4e252">[1]</a> It has been
                        recently argued that solidarity and social bonds were key to survive Nazi concentration
                        camps; no one could survive without the help of others and mutual aid was a form of
                        opposition among victims <span class="error"><a class="ref" href="#swiebocki2000">#swiebocki2000</a></span> [<a class="ref" href="#bacon2017">Bacon 2017</a>]. Nevertheless, it has been also
                        noted, “conditions varied greatly across the vast Auschwitz complex” <span class="error"><a class="ref" href="#wachsmann2015">#wachsmann2015</a></span>. Some victims were therefore more likely to experience solidarity and form social
                        bonds than others. Based on the close-reading of some victims’ accounts, some
                        researchers have for instance suggested that group cohesion and solidarity were stronger
                        among women, who were detained separately, than among men in Nazi death camps; however,
                        in the lack of evidence, others have rejected this hypothesis [<a class="ref" href="#pingel2010">Pingel 2010</a>] [<a class="ref" href="#schwarz1998">Schwarz 1998</a>].</div>

                     <div class="ptext" id="p2">Even though a
                        comparative study of how men and women behaved could enhance our understanding of
                        the
                        Holocaust from the victims’ perspective, producing evidence based insights into the
                        world of Nazi concentration camps is challenging. Perpetrators destroyed camp
                        documentation and victims’ perspective of the past is dispersed in tens of thousands
                        of
                        oral history interviews they gave. By watching a handful
                        of interviews, we can gather only anecdotal evidence. At the moment, there is no
                        reliable methodology to gather systematic evidence from a large number of oral history
                        interviews. Traditional methods of corpus and computational linguistics cannot alone
                        address this challenge. To produce systematic evidence from thousands of oral history
                        interviews, it is important to account not only what is discussed but also how it
                        is
                        discussed. In other words, it is necessary to analyze how the narratives in thousands
                        of
                        oral history interviews unfold. We therefore developed a novel conceptual and
                        computational approach adopted from the study of molecular processes. This novel method
                        enabled us to study how narratives unfold in 2500 hours of oral history interviews
                        with
                        Auschwitz survivors. Even more importantly, it provided us with systematic evidence
                        that
                        among women solidarity and social bonds were stronger in Auschwitz.</div>

                     <div class="ptext" id="p4">In this study we analyzed testimonies given by 6628 Jewish victims (2033 men and 4595
                        women) born in 13 different countries. The 6628 victims we worked with all stayed
                        in the
                        Birkenau sub-camp of the Auschwitz complex.<a class="noteRef" href="#d4e289">[2]</a> In the Auschwitz camp system, Birkenau was
                        the largest and the most lethal sub-camp where most Jewish victims were housed and
                        perished.<a class="noteRef" href="#d4e291">[3]</a> After arriving at the camp, the SS [<cite class="title italic">Die
                           Schutzstaffel</cite>], the Nazi paramilitary organization in charge of running death
                        camps, selected those men and women who were able to work. Those who did not pass
                        the
                        arrival selection were murdered with Cyclon-B gas and cremated. Those few people who
                        passed the arrival selection were deprived of their belongings, disinfected, registered
                        (often tattooed) and forced to live in harsh conditions; men and women were housed
                        in
                        different sections of Birkenau. Victims often died due to starvation, various diseases,
                        physical violence, and the extreme cold. During their stay in Birkenau, most victims
                        had
                        to work [<a class="ref" href="#hayes2000">Hayes 2000</a>]. Sometimes the SS could, however, not keep pace with the influx of
                        new deportees, and victims were waiting to get some work. There was also a large group
                        of victims in Birkenau who never worked. Auschwitz-Birkenau was also a transit camp
                        from
                        where victims were sent to other camps. During the time (which could be quite long)
                        that
                        victims were waiting for transfer, they were, in fact, not given any work; they just
                        hung around in the camp. </div>

                        interviews with Holocaust victims. The USC Shoah Foundation provided us with this
                        data
                        set from its collection of approximately 50.000 Holocaust video testimonies recorded
                        between 1981 and 2019. These video testimonies are preserved in the Visual History
                        Archive of the Foundation at the University of Southern California in Los Angeles.<a class="noteRef" href="#d4e301">[4]</a> Precisely, the Foundation gave us access
                        to all of its interviews with Auschwitz survivors, which is a collection of 12200
                        Interviews in 26 different languages recorded in 47 different countries. We were also
                        provided with basic biodata (gender and place of birth) about each survivor whose
                        testimony is included. Given that we limited our investigation to Jewish victims who
                        stayed in the Birkenau subcamp of the Auschwitz complex, we worked with 6829 interviews
                        from the original data pool. These interviews were conducted in 26 different languages

                        work with interview transcripts. We worked with the topical annotation of testimonies
                        by
                        the Foundation. In the last three decades, the professional staff of the Shoah

                        a

                        defined set of topic words, has been developed by the Foundation in the 1990s; the
                        goal
                        of the thesaurus is to cover all possible aspects of genocide experiences, including
                        acts of solidarity and memories of social bonds [<a class="ref" href="#gustman1998">Gustman 1998</a>]. Professional annotators
                        (or indexers as the Foundation calls them) watched testimony videos and indexed their
                        content with the help of topic words from the thesaurus in a purpose-built testimony

                        were unable to work with the visual and audio aspects of the testimonies (see further

                     <div class="ptext" id="p8">Since the late 1970s archives and museums have been recording oral history interviews
                        with Holocaust victims [<a class="ref" href="#ecker2007">Ecker 2007</a>]. The large-scale study of these interviews could
                        offer a unique insight into victims’ experience [<a class="ref" href="#greenspan2012">Greenspan 2012</a>]. Nevertheless, oral
                        history testimonies raise two key computational and conceptual challenges.</div>

                     <div class="ptext" id="p9">Researchers would need to account for not only which topics are present in individual
                        testimonies but also how these topics are discussed across thousands of testimonies.
                        On
                        the one hand, survivors’ oral history interviews consist of questions and answers.
                        On
                        the other hand, a survivor testimony is a sequence of topics that together form a
                        narrative about the past. Survivor testimonies can be thus seen as an ensemble of
                        individual narrative processes. Given that interviews unfold over time, the ensemble
                        of
                        narrative processes has an underlying dynamic. The first computational challenge that
                        survivor testimonies raise can be summarized in the following two questions:</div>
                     
                     
                     <div class="ptext">

                              topics unfolding over time?</li>
                           <li class="item">How can we measure the probability and the importance of topics in the ensemble of

                     <div class="ptext" id="p10">The second challenge relates to the latter question. Survivor testimonies are mediated.
                        Survivors gave testimonies decades after their liberation; their testimonies may have
                        been shaped by post-Holocaust culture, including films and novels. Furthermore,
                        survivors recall deeply traumatic memories, which are characterized by flashbacks
                        and
                        the suppression of certain particularly painful themes [<a class="ref" href="#langer1993">Langer 1993</a>]. Some survivors
                        might overemphasize the significance of certain topics such as solidarity and social
                        bonds, while others might underestimate it. Finally, the existing oral history
                        testimonies are only the tip of the iceberg. The overwhelming majority of victims
                        never
                        had the chance to speak. For all these reasons, we needed a computational model that
                        can
                        take the mediated nature of survivor testimonies into account when measuring the
                        probability and the importance of topics in narrative processes. </div>

                        address, including transitions between these topics. We represent the narrative system
                        as a state space with topics as discrete states [<a class="ref" href="#alpay2006">Alpay and Gohberg 2006</a>]. Each
                        interview, which is viewed as a sequence of consecutive topics, is a “walking” over the
                        state space. In other words, each interview is a possible realization of the narrative
                        system. Once all possible realizations were learned (see below), we could estimate
                        the
                        probability of each topic in the ensemble of all interviews. This approach also allowed
                        us to compare testimonies of men and women. We viewed the interviews of each gender
                        group as different instances of the same narrative system; we could thus compare the
                        probabilities of topics that different instances yield (see the Implementation

                     <div class="ptext" id="p13">To get insights into dynamics underlying narratives of survivors, we drew on the
                        concepts of narrative pathway and narrative flux. In our conceptual framework, the
                        narrative pathway describes a given sequence of states (i.e., topics) connecting two
                        topics. The narrative flux quantifies the relative amount (percentage) of traffic
                        going
                        through a given narrative pathway. Consider the following example. </div>

                     <div class="ptext" id="p14">Two key topics in testimonies are arrival at a death camp (arrival) and discussion
                        of
                        social relations (social bonds). Testimonies can get from the topic arrival to the
                        topic
                        social bonds in many different ways. For instance, after discussing arrival, they
                        can
                        discuss the topic selection, and then social bonds. This corresponds to the narrative
                        pathway <em class="emph">arrival → selections → </em>social bonds. The narrative flux
                        considers all possible pathways between <em class="emph">arrival</em> and social bonds
                        in the ensemble of all interviews (or interviews of women and interviews of men);
                        then
                        it tells us what fraction percentage goes through <em class="emph">selections</em>. In
                        short, through the notion of narrative pathway and narrative flux, we can get insight

                        narrations with MSMs, TPT is used as a means to organize and summarize large numbers

                        In practice, TPT associates a number value (called the flux) to any possible narration
                        (or any possible sequence of topics). This number tells us how prevalent a given
                        narrative pathway is in the underlying corpus of interviews, i.e., it summarizes how
                        likely it is that an interviewee reported about topics in a certain order. We can

                        graph. In this graph each topic (or a state in the state space model described above)
                        is
                        a node; the move of interviews from topic A to topic B is represented as an edge,
                        which
                        is weighted in terms of the probability of moving to topic B after topic A. To measure
                        the importance and influence of each topic within the narrative system represented
                        as a
                        directed graph, we apply two different metrics. First, we measure the PageRank value
                        of
                        each topic as a node in the directed graph. The PageRank value is often used to measure
                        the influence of humans in social networks, as well as the importance of webpages
                        in
                        Google search algorithms. By the same token as the PageRank value gives insight into
                        the
                        importance of webpages by modelling internet users movements from webpage to webpage,
                        it
                        reveals the importance of topics in survivor testimonies by modelling how these topics
                        follow each other in testimonies. Actually, the PageRank values of nodes in a directed
                        graph are closely related to the stationary probabilities described above; if a weighted
                        directed graph represents a Markovian dynamic system, the PageRank values of nodes
                        in
                        the graph are the dumped stationary probabilities of states in the corresponding
                        Markovian system [<a class="ref" href="#page1999">Page et al. 1999</a>]. The major advantage of the PageRank value is that
                        it takes into consideration inbound and outbound links to a given node (topic in the
                        context of our research), as well as the importance of connected nodes; hence the
                        PageRank value expresses how embedded a given node is in the entire network [<a class="ref" href="#lee2013">Lee et al. 2013</a>]. Second, we calculate the normalized closeness centrality of each node. This
                        evaluates importance by summing the shortest paths from a given node; in other words,
                        it
                        expresses how connected a given node (or topic in the context of our research) is

                        probability of each higher level topic (when using probability we always mean the
                        stationary probability of a topic). We specifically focused on two higher level topics:
                        social bonds and aid giving. The former includes topics discussing social relations
                        (friendships, camaraderie, non-intimate social relations etc.) in the camp; the latter
                        relates to various acts of solidarity (food sharing, clothing provision, sustenance
                        provision, etc.) We also calculated their closeness centrality and PageRank Value.</div>

                        conditions and camp procedures. Selection was a wanton and highly feared practice
                        in
                        Nazi death camps. All victims arriving at camps first underwent a selection procedure.
                        Selection was also a daily routine in Nazi concentration camps; the SS kept eliminating
                        the unfit and sending them to gas chambers. Since selection was a highly probable
                        event,
                        we used it as a reference point to assess the probability of topics describing
                        solidarity and social relations. Compared to <em class="emph">social bonds</em>, the
                        probability of <em class="emph">selections</em> is 3.4 times higher. Compared to <em class="emph">aid giving</em>, the probability of <em class="emph">selection</em>s
                        is 2.28 times higher. <em class="emph">Aid giving</em> and <em class="emph">social

                        still very probable if we take into consideration that on average <em class="emph">selections</em> is 92 times more probable than any other topic. The overall
                        importance of <em class="emph">social relations</em> and <em class="emph">aid
                           giving</em> are also demonstrated by the fact that they are part of the upper
                        quantile in the ranking of all topics in terms of their stationary probabilities.
                        <em class="emph">Aid giving </em>is the 14th most probable topic and <em class="emph">social bonds </em>is the 18th most probable topic. The ranking of topics by PageRank

                        solidarity when recalling memories of Birkenau. It is important to underline that
                        survivors were not asked by interviewers to address solidarity and social bonds in
                        the
                        camp. It was the survivors' own decision to address these topics. In light of this,
                        we
                        think that what is recalled in the following testimony excerpt cannot be viewed as
                        an
                        anecdotal or nostalgic memory but in fact describes a relatively common experience:</div>
                     We became friends with everybody — anybody and everybody. We — we — we really cared
                     for
                     each other. We did everything possible to try and encourage each other. If somebody
                     wanted to hang themselves because they couldn't take it any more; we somehow talked
                     'em
                     out of it. If somebody, for instance, said, I'm giving up, I can't do it any more,
                     we
                     somehow talked them out of it. We maybe shared a little piece of bread. The bread
                     was
                     mostly made out of sawdust, but somehow we put a little piece of bread in his mouth. We
                     did all kinds of those kinds of things.  [<a class="ref" href="#gross1996">Gross 1996</a>, Tape 2, 00:28:34] </div>

                        social
                        bonds in narratives of women and men (see the Methodology section). To prove that
                        differences were not due to either chance or sample bias, we used the method of
                        bootstrapping (see below and the Methodology section) [<a class="ref" href="#efron2004">Efron et al. 2004</a>]. Again, we compared the importance of topics related to acts of
                        solidarity and social bonds in narratives of men and women by drawing on normalized
                        closeness centrality and the PageRank value. We also used the Fisher’s exact test
                        to
                        assess whether the difference is statistically significant (p value 0.05) [<a class="ref" href="#fisher1922">Fisher 1922</a>]. Finally, we measured the strength of association between gender and each topic
                        with odds ratio analysis (Morris and Gardner, 1988). This enabled us to focus on

                        thesaurus has various terms to describe different types of solidarity. For instance,
                        the
                        topic word <em class="emph">food sharing </em>describes moments when a survivor recalls
                        an episode of food sharing in the camp. We found that in testimonies of women we are
                        much more likely to hear about episodes of food sharing. Similarly, women are more
                        likely to discuss memories about another person providing them with clothes (the topic
                        of <em class="emph">clothing provision</em>). Other topics related to solidarity, such
                        as for instance <em class="emph">medical care provision </em>and <em class="emph">sustenance provision,</em> are also positively correlated with women, though they
                        lack statistical significance. As a whole, we were unable to find any topic related

                        a
                        similar difference. For instance, topics describing cultural activity, or rumors are

                        is a

                        Another commonality is stealing (see Figure 4 A); victims often discuss memories about

                        first divided the forced labour activities into three groups based on physical effort
                        demands: easy work (secretarial work, science/research-related forced labor, translation
                        etc), medium hard work (tattooing, factory work, gas chamber cleaning, etc), very

                        Nazi camp system aimed to break down all solidarity human relations as well as the
                        belief in the possibility of self-determined actions” [<a class="ref" href="#greif1999">Greif 1999</a>, 242]. The 
                        question whether some form of solidarity and sociability could still exist in
                        Auschwitz-Birkenau therefore translates into the question of how successful the SS
                        was
                        in its effort to destroy the human nature of victims. Accounts such as the one above
                        or
                        the testimony excerpt cited at the beginning of this paper have often convinced
                        researchers that solidarity and deeper human ties were actually anomalies in Auschwitz.
                        For instance, the sociologist, Wolfgang Sofsky, has recently described the Nazi death
                        camp as a place where victims lived in “a social state of nature in which the person who
                        prevailed was the one who was stronger” [<a class="ref" href="#sofsky2013">Sofsky 2013</a>, 162]. This view is in
                        contrast with the accounts of many survivors and with the findings of some historians.
                        Again, as one survivor cited above said, “we did everything possible to try and
                        encourage each other.” The hypothesis that solidarity and social bonds among victims
                        were just anomalies in Auschwitz is also in contrast with our findings. </div>

                     <div class="ptext" id="p53">In fact, the 6628 survivors in our dataset do speak about a great deal of solidarity
                        and
                        social interactions. Acts of solidarity and memories of social life are highly important
                        elements of their memories. Their importance and high probability within the narrative
                        system indicates that they were also significant and relatively frequent elements
                        of
                        camp life. Even if statistical frequencies and probabilities of topics measured by
                        modelling thousands of narratives cannot be equated with the broader and non-statistical
                        concept of importance, they can still be treated as reliable indicators giving
                        information about the world that these narratives recall. As a matter of fact, we
                        will
                        never know how victims lived in Nazi death camps. But by analyzing thousands of survivor
                        narratives, we can attempt to construct estimates about basic aspects of life in Nazi
                        death camps. </div>

                     <div class="ptext" id="p54">Our computational approach also allowed us to compare the narratives of women and
                        men
                        and to shed light on a key difference: in testimonies of women solidarity and social
                        relations are more probable and more important topics than in testimonies of men.
                        Based
                        on the close reading of a handful of testimonies, this gender difference has been
                        already noticed but lacked the backing of wide-scale quantitative evidence. In this
                        study, we provide systematic evidence that in narratives of women survivors of
                        Auschwitz-Birkenau solidarity and social relations are much more important topics.

                     <div class="ptext" id="p55">Nevertheless, this finding leads to a key problem that any study of belated memories
                        about a past event involves. Memory sometimes alters the way humans see their past;
                        therefore, we need to ask how can we produce evidence about the past by drawing on
                        belated memories? Taking this question into the context of this study, to what extent
                        does the fact that in belated memories of women solidarity and social bonds are more
                        probable, indicate that they were also more prevalent in the women sections of Birkenau?
                        We tackled this problem with the help of bootstrapping, i.e., with the help of
                        randomized trials. It is possible that some women overestimate the importance of
                        solidarity and social relations in the past and some men underestimate their
                        significance; it is possible that memory and post-Holocaust experience (including
                        watching specific films and reading Holocaust novels) have "sweetened" the experiences
                        made in the past for some women and triggered bitterness in some men. Nevertheless,
                        with
                        the help of randomized samples we pointed out that the difference between men and
                        women
                        is consistent. If our initial finding that solidarity and social relations are more
                        probable in narratives of women would have been due to the sweetening effect of
                        nostalgic memory or due to sampling bias, the difference between men and women would
                        have faded over thousands of randomized trials.</div>

                     <div class="ptext" id="p56">Our findings suggest that women generally tend to show more solidarity in extreme
                        circumstances such as detainment. However, it is important to highlight a historical
                        factor as a result of which social adaptation for Jewish men in Birkenau must have
                        been
                        particularly difficult. By the time that mass deportations of EuropeanJewry to
                        Auschwitz-Birkenau began, many of the young and middle aged Jewish men had already
                        been
                        in forced labour service [<a class="ref" href="#gruner2006">Gruner 2006</a>]. Most of the men who were deported to
                        Auschwitz-Birkenau were older men; they had therefore very slim chances to survive
                        the
                        selection process at the arrival. As a result, most probably there were more women
                        of
                        the same nationalities than men of the same nationalities. Being surrounded by women
                        of
                        the same nationality, a woman could find solidarity and friends much easier than a
                        man.
                        To corroborate this explanation, we would however need to know more about whom women
                        formed friendships with and who offered solidarity and help to them.<a class="noteRef" href="#d4e838">[6]</a>

                     <div class="ptext" id="p57">This points out the limitation of this study. We could study only those topics that
                        the
                        Shoah Foundation’s index system covers. Unfortunately, the index system does not offer
                        any information about whom victims were friends with. Neither does it contain keywords
                        that signal conflicts between victims. We could not therefore study whether men or
                        women
                        are more likely to recall animosity. Similarly, the use of generalized keywords to
                        describe human behavior has its own limitations since they cannot describe the richness
                        and subtleties of human behavior. For instance, friendship and aid giving are complex
                        concepts and behavioral patterns with many different possible meanings and nuances
                        that
                        a general keyword cannot describe. This limitation can in part explain the difference
                        between men and women. When discussing social relations in the camp, women and men
                        might
                        express their ideas and memories very differently. Where women use friendship, men
                        might
                        for instance use other words that suggest less intimate social bonds. Unfortunately,
                        the
                        unified keyword system cannot account for such differences and the close-listening
                        of
                        2500 hours of survivor testimonies is not viable. </div>

                        produced unevenness in the topical annotation. For instance, victims of different
                        linguistic backgrounds may use very different linguistic strategies to account
                        experiences of social bonds and aid giving. </div>

                        an old
                        problem that among others, the Italian survivor of Auschwitz and the author of many
                        Holocaust novels, Primo Levi (1917 - 1987), has pinpointed. This is the fallacy of
                        the
                        individual memory of a survivor. As Levi said, the human memory is a marvelous
                        instrument but it makes mistakes [<a class="ref" href="#levi1986">Levi 1986</a>, 14]. The fallacy of individual memories
                        can be counterbalanced with the study of the memory of many survivors. But the study
                        of
                        many individual memories poses its own challenges: testimonies are mediated and
                        unbalanced in terms of gender for instance; they miss the voice of those who did not
                        survive or did not give a testimony. To face these challenges, in this paper we applied
                        the Markov State Model combined with the Transition Path Theory. This enabled us to
                        approach thousands of individual testimonies as expressions of the collective
                        experience. Most importantly, it enabled us to compare narratives of women and men.

                        ubiquitous in history and in other humanities fields. Datasets of national biographies,

                        topics. Our feature selection procedure followed the keyword thesaurus of the Shoah

                        topic term is assigned a state number to allow further numerical processing; the topics
                        are interpreted as discrete states of the state space. We treat each narrative pathway
                        (i.e., interview) as walking over a state space that is spanned by the topic terms.
                        The
                        transition probabilities between discrete states are stored in a transition
                        (probability) matrix. This is an n-by-n square matrix with n corresponding to the
                        number
                        of discrete states. The <em class="emph">ij-</em>th element of our transition matrix
                        describes the probability that an interview discusses topic <em class="emph">i</em>
                        after having addressed topic <em class="emph">j</em>. In molecular kinetics, this is
                        called a conditional probability [<a class="ref" href="#prinz2011">Prinz et al. 2011</a>]. In the context of our research,
                        the transition (probability) matrix models the narrative system consisting of discrete
                        states that are the topic terms; it also represents the way interviews are likely
                        to
                        move from one topic to another topic. We also use the transition matrix as an adjacency
                        matrix; from this we construct the directed graph representing the narrative network

                        to as stationary and equilibrium state probability earlier, by noting that it is the
                        stable state that the system converges to in the limit of infinite time. It is often
                        denoted by π and follows from applying the dynamics n → ∞ times, i.e. π = lim n →
                        ∞ p0.
                        It can be computed either by calculating the limit explicitly, or as the left
                        eigenvector of the transition matrix that corresponds to eigenvalue 1. We applied
                        this

                        The resulting MSM stationary distribution can be approached as an estimator of the

                        research, the unconditional probability of a topic gives the overall probability that

                        committor <em class="emph">q</em>+ as the probability that on a pathway from A to B, at
                        a given intermediate step of that pathway, we reach B before going back to A. In the
                        context of this manuscript, the committor thus describes the probability that during
                        a
                        specific narration (defined by its starting topic A and ending topic B), the narrator

                     Auschwitz illustrates the sharp contrast between the two opinions: “And I should
                     preface this by saying, in general, you know, I've read a lot — a lot of claims about
                     the solidarity of prisoners under those conditions. And I must tell you I've never
                     seen it. I've heard about solidarity in the block occupied by Russian officers, Red
                     Army officers. But I'm pretty sure that was the only — if — if at all, that was the
                     only group that showed any solidarity whatsoever. The atmosphere in the camp was such
                     that everybody was out for their own survival. And if it was a question of — of
                     listening in to what your neighbors in the bed said, it would immediately be handed
                     on so that — for personal profit. You couldn't trust anybody. And nobody trusted
                     anybody.” [<a class="ref" href="#chrambach1996">Chrambach 1996</a>, Tape 3,00:26:51]. See a very different view in the memoir

                     the
                     Spring of 1942. In addition to an extremely large Jewish population, Birkenau also
                     housed Polish and Roma victims. It was both a killing center, equipped with gas
                     chambers and crematoria, and a work camp where victims were forced to slave labour.
                     Victims were transported by trains to Birkenau from various European
