                     the sources of different versions of historical texts on the basis text of Psalm 6

                     overview of the manuals of prayer examined, describes methods of cluster analysis
                     used within the present work, and shows how cluster analysis can enrich and guide
                     traditional philological knowledge.</p>

                  <div class="ptext" id="p1">The purpose of this contribution is to trace textual affinities between psalm versions
                     contained in several manuals of devotion<a class="noteRef" href="#d3e193">[1]</a> when they first started to be printed in English in the 1530s. The rapidly growing
                     popularity of this publication type in the era when new English translations of the
                     Psalms were beginning to emerge additionally invites the question concerning the sources
                     of the psalm versions selected by the publishers of the manuals, while the changing
                     religious views of the three successive Tudor monarchs makes the investigation of
                     the issue within their reigns especially interesting. As an average manual contained
                     about 50 psalms, while new manuals were brought out with increasing frequency and
                     so were new translations of the Bible, it seems that a thorough investigation of the
                     issue would benefit from methods available within digital humanities, which are designed
                     to process algorithmically large amounts of textual data.<a class="noteRef" href="#d3e205">[2]</a> The technique I will use in this contribution is that of cluster analysis, which
                     is a relatively novel approach to tracking textual affinities and identifying the
                     sources of different versions of historical texts.<a class="noteRef" href="#d3e207">[3]</a> To the best of my knowledge, cluster analysis has not been used in the analysis of
                     textual dependencies between different versions of English biblical texts.<a class="noteRef" href="#d3e212">[4]</a> To assess the applicability of this method I applied it to the prose translations
                     of Psalm 6 as found in twenty publications printed between 1530 and 1557. The choice
                     of Psalm 6 as the subject of the present analysis was dictated by the fact that it
                     is one of the so-called Seven Penitential Psalms, which form an invariable part of
                     many manuals of devotion, guaranteeing the availability of its text for comparison.
                     The approach used within the present work proved to independently produce results
                     which agree with philological knowledge and historical facts, and to be able to detect
                     textual affinities that have so far remained unnoticed. </div>

                  <div class="counter"><a href="#p2">2</a></div>
                  <div class="ptext" id="p2">The tradition of religious manuals of devotion for laypeople can be traced back to
                     the mid-13th century ([<a class="ref" href="#dehamel1998">de Hamel 1998</a>]; [<a class="ref" href="#erler1999">Erler 1999 (2008)</a>]; [<a class="ref" href="#duffy1992">Duffy 1992 (2002)</a>]; [<a class="ref" href="#duffy2011">Duffy 2011</a>]; [<a class="ref" href="#kennedy2014">Kennedy 2014</a>]), when books which were intended to guide their daily devotions and provide help
                     in participating in the services of the Church, first started to appear.<a class="noteRef" href="#d3e236">[5]</a> Initially, these manuals – Books of Hours – contained only Latin material but around
                     the second half of the 14th century exclusively English manuals started to emerge,
                     where both the scriptural material and prayers were offered in translation ([<a class="ref" href="#butterworth1953">Butterworth 1953</a>]; [<a class="ref" href="#hargreaves1956">Hargreaves 1956</a>]; [<a class="ref" href="#harris-matthews1980">Harris-Matthews 1980</a>]; [<a class="ref" href="#kennedy2014">Kennedy 2014</a>]; [<a class="ref" href="#sutherland2015">Sutherland 2015</a>]; [<a class="ref" href="#sutherland2017">Sutherland 2017</a>]; [<a class="ref" href="#charzynska-wojcik2023">Charzyńska-Wójcik and Wójcik forthcoming</a>]).<a class="noteRef" href="#d3e256">[6]</a> As observed by Eamon Duffy, psalms always constituted an important part of these
                     prayer books, reflecting their special place in Christian devotional life and spirituality
                     [<a class="ref" href="#duffy1992">Duffy 1992 (2002)</a>, 156]. It needs to be stressed, however, that manuals of prayer contained only a selection
                     of most popular psalms. Among these were the so-called Seven Penitential Psalms, the
                     gradual Psalms<a class="noteRef" href="#d3e267">[7]</a> and a slightly varying selection of other psalms. An average Book of Hours contained
                     about 50 different psalms (cf. [<a class="ref" href="#dehamel1998">de Hamel 1998</a>, 138]; [<a class="ref" href="#morey2000">Morey 2000</a>, 182]). As noted by numerous scholars ([<a class="ref" href="#dehamel1998">de Hamel 1998</a>]; [<a class="ref" href="#erler1999">Erler 1999 (2008)</a>]; [<a class="ref" href="#duffy1992">Duffy 1992 (2002)</a>]; [<a class="ref" href="#kennedy2014">Kennedy 2014</a>]), Books of Hours were the most popular book of the Middle Ages. </div>
                  
                  <div class="counter"><a href="#p3">3</a></div>
                  <div class="ptext" id="p3">The appearance of print in the second half of the 15th century, which made possible
                     the mass-production of books, turned printed Books of Hours into the best-seller of
                     the late medieval and early modern book trade. “Books of Hours were among the first books to be efficiently mass-produced” [<a class="ref" href="#duffy1992">Duffy 1992 (2002)</a>, 211]. Charles Butterworth notes that up to 1523, printed primers were exclusively in Latin,
                     but soon started to show first non-scriptural vernacular material, and as of 1529
                     also the psalms in English [<a class="ref" href="#butterworth1953">Butterworth 1953</a>, 5]. This is by no means surprising, since new English translations of Biblical texts
                     associated with such figures as William Tyndale (the author of a new translation of
                     the New Testament printed in Worms in 1526) or George Joye<a class="noteRef" href="#d3e292">[8]</a> (the author of the first printed English Psalter which appeared in 1530 in Antwerp)
                     marked just a beginning of a long succession of English biblical translations, which
                     appeared throughout the 16th century (and afterwards), shaping the history of English
                     Reformation and culminating in the King James Bible of 1611. The sheer number of the
                     16th-century manuals of devotion and new Psalter translations makes it interesting
                     to try and analyse which Psalter versions were used as sources of psalms appearing
                     in printed manuals of devotion.</div>
                  
                  <div class="counter"><a href="#p4">4</a></div>
                  <div class="ptext" id="p4">The analysis offered here concentrates on Psalm 6 appearing in thirteen manuals printed
                     between 1530 and 1557, i.e. during the reign of Henry VIII (1509-1547), who severed
                     ties with Rome, Edward VI (1547-1553), who transformed the Church of England into
                     an openly Protestant body, and Mary I (1553-1558), who re-introduced Rome-based Catholicism,
                     at least at the level of prescribed practices. The publications selected for analysis
                     include seven manuals printed during Henry VIII’s rule, i.e. <cite class="title italic">Ortulus anime</cite> from 1530<a class="noteRef" href="#d3e315">[9]</a> (STC 13828.4), Marshall’s primer from 1534 (STC 15986), Godfray’s primer from 1535
                     (STC 15988a), Rouen primer from 1536 (STC 15993), Redman’s primer from 1537 (STC 15997)<a class="noteRef" href="#d3e324">[10]</a>, <cite class="title italic">Manual of prayers</cite> from 1539 (STC 16009), and Henry VIII’s primer from 1545 (STC 16034). Three manuals
                     come from the time of Edward VI’s rule, i.e. the <cite class="title italic">Book of Common Prayer</cite> from 1549<a class="noteRef" href="#d3e333">[11]</a> (STC 16270a), Primer from 1552 (STC 16057), and <cite class="title italic">Book of Common</cite> Prayer from 1552 (STC16288). Finally, there are three primers printed during Mary
                     I’s reign, i.e. Caly’s Primer from 1555 (STC 16062), Wayland’s Primers from 1555 (STC
                     16063), and 1557 (STC 16080). </div>

                  <div class="ptext" id="p5">The text of Psalm 6 contained in these thirteen manuals was compared with the text
                     of this psalm appearing in seven prose<a class="noteRef" href="#d3e345">[12]</a> translations of the Psalter which were in circulation at the time when the manuals
                     were published either as new translations of the Psalter or as part of complete translations
                     of the Bible. These seven prose translations of the Psalms used in the examination
                     were: George Joye’s English Psalter translated from the Latin text of Martin Bucer
                     first published in 1530 (STC 2370), George Joye’s English Psalter translated from
                     the Latin text of Huldrych Zwingli first published in 1534 (STC 2372), Psalms from
                     Coverdale’s first complete Bible issued in 1535 (STC 2063), Psalms from Coverdale’s
                     second complete Bible (the Great Bible) first issued in 1539 (STC 2068), Psalms from
                     Richard Taverner’s Bible issued in 1539 (STC 2067), 1539 edition of Coverdale’s Psalter

                     and often involve distance measures [<a class="ref" href="#han2012">Han et al. 2012</a>, 443]. As observed by Hermann Moisl, “[t]he fundamental intuition underlying cluster analysis is that data distributions
                     contain clusters when the data objects can be partitioned into groups on the basis
                     of their relative similarity such that the objects in any group are more similar to
                     one another than they are to objects in other groups, given some definition of similarity” [<a class="ref" href="#moisl2015">Moisl 2015</a>, 155].</div>

                  <div class="ptext" id="p8">The literature typically divides clustering methods (algorithms) into two major categories,
                     non-hierarchical (partitioning) and hierarchical, depending on the kind of output
                     a given method generates [<a class="ref" href="#moisl2015">Moisl 2015</a>, 156].<a class="noteRef" href="#d3e443">[14]</a> Han et al. give the following formalisation of a non-hierarchical (partitioning)
                     method: “given a set of <em class="term">n</em> objects, a partitioning method constructs <em class="term">k</em> partitions of the data, where each partition represents a cluster and <em class="term">k ≤ n</em>. That is, it divides the data into <em class="term">k</em> groups such that each group must contain at least one object” [<a class="ref" href="#han2012">Han et al. 2012</a>, 448]. An important feature of partitioning methods is that the number of partitions <em class="term">k</em> is a parameter that has to be pre-specified by the user. This method of clustering
                     is non-hierarchical as it performs a one-level partitioning on data sets.</div>

                  <div class="ptext" id="p9">In contrast, hierarchical clustering methods perform a grouping of data objects into
                     a hierarchy of clusters. Two major types of hierarchical clustering are distinguished
                     in the literature, i.e. agglomerative hierarchical clustering and divisive hierarchical
                     clustering [<a class="ref" href="#han2012">Han et al. 2012</a>, 459]. An agglomerative hierarchical clustering method uses a bottom-up strategy and starts
                     by considering each object a cluster of its own and iteratively merges clusters into
                     larger clusters, until all the objects are in a single cluster. A divisive hierarchical
                     clustering method employs a top-down strategy. It starts by placing all objects in
                     one cluster and then divides this initial cluster into several smaller subclusters,
                     and recursively partitions those clusters into smaller ones. The partitioning process
                     continues until each cluster at the lowest level either contains only one object,
                     or the objects within a cluster are sufficiently similar to each other. The result
                     of employing hierarchical clustering algorithms is a tree-based hierarchical representation
                     of the objects, known as a <em class="term">dendrogram</em> [<a class="ref" href="#kassambara2017">Kassambara 2017</a>, 67]. Agglomerative hierarchical clustering is more commonly used than divisive clustering
                     since it is more tractable computationally and it is often the only method available
                     in clustering software packages [<a class="ref" href="#moisl2015">Moisl 2015</a>, 213].</div>

                     well as other fields ranging from document classification through data mining or speech
                     processing to quantitative stylometry or author attribution [<a class="ref" href="#moisl2015">Moisl 2015</a>, 279]. For example, hierarchical clustering and accompanying dendrograms demonstrated their
                     usefulness in detecting relationships between Old English poems [<a class="ref" href="#drout2011">Drout et al. 2011</a>] or, when applied to biblical texts, in examining linguistic variation within Biblical
                     Hebrew [<a class="ref" href="#vanderschans2020">van der Schans et al. 2020</a>]. It should be observed, however, that hierarchical cluster analysis has certain inherent

                     here contains 154 words (texts 14, 16), the longest has 264 words (text 12), with
                     an average word count of the twenty text analysed being 174,6 words.<a class="noteRef" href="#d3e489">[15]</a> While it is true that applying standard clustering techniques to group short text
                     data creates issues especially with text representation for the purpose of measuring
                     distance [<a class="ref" href="#majid2022">Majid et al. 2022</a>], it has to be stressed that the data analysed here are not a random collection of
                     any short texts. It is known in advance that all the analysed texts of Psalm 6 are
                     quite similar to one another as they ultimately come from the same biblical source
                     text, albeit via different routes. Some of these texts represent translations into
                     English of (different) Latin renditions directly from the Hebrew original, while others
                     are translations of the Latin Vulgate, itself being a translation from Hebrew via
                     a Greek intermediary. By using clustering techniques, we want to find out whether
                     these relatively small textual differences will allow us to indentify the sources
                     of psalm texts as they appear in the 16th-century manuals of devotion. An additional
                     advantage of using clustering on the texts of psalms is that it has a potential of
                     overcoming problems of using an inherently subjective and imprecise language used
                     in the literature to describe textual dependencies and mutual relationship of these
                     psalm texts in terms of “revisions”, “deep revisions”, or calling them “practically new translations”. As observed by Charzyńska-Wójcik and Wójcik [<a class="ref" href="#charzynska-wojcik2022">Charzyńska-Wójcik and Wójcik 2022</a>, 213], this inevitably introduces confusion and does not contribute to propelling our knowledge

                  <div class="ptext" id="p13">Before applying hierarchical clustering algorithms to the texts of Psalm 6, it is
                     also important to note certain complexities that are inherent to analysing any English
                     text produced before spelling standardisation.<a class="noteRef" href="#d3e520">[17]</a> As noted above, the application of a clustering algorithm requires the use of a certain
                     measure of similarity between the classified objects (i.e. different texts of Psalm
                     6). In the analysis presented in this paper I will employ the cosine similarity<a class="noteRef" href="#d3e531">[18]</a> to measure the level of similarity between the compared texts of Psalm 6. Cosine
                     similarity measures the cosine of an angle between vectors, which represent compared
                     texts [<a class="ref" href="#han2012">Han et al. 2012</a>, 77–78]. A cosine value of 0 means that the two vectors (each representing a text) are at
                     90 degrees to each other and have no match (the texts are completely different, i.e.
                     they do not share a single item). The closer the cosine value to 1, the smaller the
                     angle and the greater the match (similarity) between vectors (texts). The cosine similarity
                     of 1 means that the compared texts are identical. What transpires from the above is
                     that the compared texts have to be represented as vectors. This is done within a bag
                     of words model [<a class="ref" href="#welbers2017">Welbers et al. 2017</a>, 246], where words are assumed to appear independently and the order of words is not taken
                     into account. Each word corresponds to a dimension in the resulting data space and
                     each document then becomes a vector consisting of non-negative values on each dimension
                     [<a class="ref" href="#huang2008">Huang 2008</a>, 50]. This results in the so-called document term matrix (DTM), in which rows are documents
                     (texts), columns are terms (words), and cells indicate how often each word occurs
                     in each text. The advantage of this representation is that it allows the data to be
                     analysed with vector and matrix algebra, effectively moving from text to numbers [<a class="ref" href="#welbers2017">Welbers et al. 2017</a>, 252].</div>

                     produced before standardisation is the need for normalising spelling before any meaningful
                     analysis can be performed. As mentioned above, the early Modern English texts analysed
                     in this paper were produced before the standardisation of orthography. This means
                     that, for example, the Modern English <em class="emph">anguish</em> can be found spelled in the following three ways <em class="emph">anguisshe</em>, <em class="emph">anguyshe</em>, or <em class="emph">anguysshe</em>, while <em class="emph">avoid</em> shows as many as six different spellings <em class="emph">auoid</em>, <em class="emph">auoide</em>, <em class="emph">auoyd</em>, <em class="emph">auoyde</em>, <em class="emph">avoide</em>, <em class="emph">avoyde</em>. It is quite clear that this sort of variation has to be disregarded if meaningful
                     results of similarity measurements are to be obtained. Consequently, in the process
                     of preparing the texts for analysis different spellings of the same word or morpheme
                     were normalised by adopting one consistent spelling across all analysed texts. Moreover,
                     all punctuation was removed and all words spelled with a capital letter were turned
                     to lower case, as these likewise show lack of any consistency in the early Modern
                     period. Normalisation was performed with the use of software called VARD. VARD – from

                     the higher the level at which the vertical line connecting the groupings is found.
                     In the diagram above, for example, text 12 is represented as most unlike all the texts.
                     For one thing, text 12 does not cluster with any other texts and, what is more, it

                  <div class="ptext" id="p20">The inspection of the data represented in the hierarchical dendrogram above reveals
                     the existence of clear groupings and dependencies between the texts of Psalm 6 found
                     in the manuals of prayer on the existing English translations of the Psalms as well
                     as their mutual affinities. Quite clearly, there are three groups of texts visible
                     forming clusters in the dendrogram. The first cluster contains texts 01, 02, 04, and
                     05. The earliest among the texts in this group is Joye’s Psalter from 1530 (02), which
                     appeared in January of 1530 a few months before <cite class="title italic">Ortulus anime</cite> (01) [<a class="ref" href="#butterworth1953">Butterworth 1953</a>, 23]. As mentioned earlier, Joye’s Psalter from 1530 was the first ever printed Psalter
                     in English, where psalms were translated from the Latin text of Martin Bucer. Later
                     in the same year, Joye published a revised edition of his now lost Primer under the
                     title <cite class="title italic">Ortulus anime</cite> (01) [<a class="ref" href="#juhasz2014">Juhász 2014</a>, 21]. Two other texts which cluster with 01 and 02 are Marshall’s primer from 1534 (04)
                     (the first book printed in England which contained the English text of Psalms [<a class="ref" href="#butterworth1953">Butterworth 1953</a>, 50] and Godfray’s primer from 1535 (05). The dendrogram clearly identifies the text of
                     Psalm 6 from manuals 01, 04, and 05 as being derived directly from Joye’s 1530 translation
                     of the Psalter.</div>

                  <div class="ptext" id="p21">The second group visible in the dendrogram consists of texts 13, 17, 10, 15, 06, and
                     11. Among these, there are two editions of the <cite class="title italic">Book of Common Prayer</cite> from 1549 and 1552, three versions of the Bible (10, 06, and 11), and Coverdale’s
                     Psalter from 1540 (number 13). Within this group, two editions of the <cite class="title italic">Book of Common Prayer</cite> from 1549 and 1552 contain the text of Psalm 6, which is identical to that found
                     in the Psalms from Coverdale’s Great Bible from 1539 (10). This correctly represents
                     a well-known historical fact: all scriptural material printed in the <cite class="title italic">Book of Common Prayer</cite> was taken from the Coverdale’s 1539 Bible ([<a class="ref" href="#daniell2003">Daniell 2003</a>]; [<a class="ref" href="#charzynska-wojcik2021">Charzyńska-Wójcik 2021</a>]).<a class="noteRef" href="#d3e1411">[22]</a> What is more, Psalms from Coverdale’s first complete Bible from 1535 (06) are clearly
                     the source of Psalms in Taverner’s Bible from 1539 (11), as the grouping in the dendrogram
                     shows their close affinity. This accurately captures what we know about these texts
                     (cf. [<a class="ref" href="#daniell2003">Daniell 2003</a>, 193]; [<a class="ref" href="#charzynska-wojcik2022">Charzyńska-Wójcik and Wójcik 2022</a>]) since Taverner’s 1539 Bible is a revision of Matthews Bible of 1537, which in turn
                     relied on Coverdale’s first Bible from 1535 for the Psalms. In contrast, Psalm 6 in
                     Coverdale’s 1535 Bible (06) shows more differences with respect to his 1539 Bible
                     (11), also a fact reported in the literature of the topic. Jacobs [<a class="ref" href="#jacobs2013">Jacobs 2013</a>], Norton [<a class="ref" href="#norton2000">Norton 2000</a>], and Ferguson [<a class="ref" href="#ferguson2011">Ferguson 2011</a>] call Coverdale’s 1539 Bible a (slight) revision of his 1535 Bible. The final text
                     in this group is number 13, i.e. Coverdale’s Psalter translated from the Vulgate in
                     1540, which is least like the other texts in the group, indicating the relations obtaining
                     between the different versions of Coverdale’s translations of the Psalms from 1535,
                     1539, and 1540. As is well-known, Coverdale’s 1535 Bible was in Coverdale’s own words:
                     “faithfully and truly translated out of Douche [i.e. German] and Latyn [i.e. the Vulgate]”. On the other hand, Coverdale’s 1540 Psalter was translated “out of the common texte in Latyne”, i.e. the Vulgate. The higher level at which the text of Covedale’s 1540 Psalm 6
                     attaches to the rest of this cluster reflects the differences of the source texts
                     used by Coverdale for the two translations. </div>

                     which three further subgroupings can be discerned. The first subgroup contains the

                     and (09) <cite class="title italic">Manual of prayers</cite> from 1539. These are quite similar to the next three primers forming a second subgroup,
                     i.e. texts (18) Caly’s Primer from 1555, (19) Wayland’s Primer from 1555, and (20)
                     Wayland’s Primer from 1557, all of which seem to continue the same textual line as
                     the first subgroup. Next comes the third subgroup, comprising (14) Henry VIII’s primer
                     from 1545 and (16) a Primer from 1552. Clearly the Primer from 1552 is based on Henry
                     VIII’s 1545 primer and both show a relatively high level of reliance on Primers from
                     1536 and 1537 (07, 08) and a <cite class="title italic">Manual of prayers</cite> from 1539 (09). The final text within the third cluster is (03) Joye’s Psalter from
                     1534, which forms a branch of its own within this cluster and only attaches to the
                     remaining groupings at a relatively high level. What is interesting in this context
                     is that the text of Joye’s Psalter from 1534 (03) is the only translation of the whole
                     Psalter which is found within this cluster comprising the nine texts (in chronological
                     order 03, 07, 08, 09, 14, 16, 18, 19, and 20) and as such is a natural candidate for
                     the source text behind all the text versions found in this cluster. At the same time,
                     the high level at which it attaches in the dendrogram is quite different from what
                     we observed in the case of other clusters, when the source translations (Joye’s 1530
                     translation, or Psalms from Coverdale’s Great Bible) showed a high degree of affinity
                     with the texts of psalms from the manuals. This suggests a relation of a different
                     nature between Joye’s Psalter from 1534 to the text of Psalm 6 within this cluster.
                     In this context it is interesting to note that Butterworth [<a class="ref" href="#butterworth1953">Butterworth 1953</a>, 134] claims that the Rouen Primer from 1536 (chronologically the earliest primer in this
                     cluster) introduced a new translation of the Psalms and “cut loose” [<a class="ref" href="#butterworth1953">Butterworth 1953</a>, 134] from the earlier tradition and based its version on the accompanying Latin Vulgate
                     text in the margin. The dendrogram read in the light of Butterworth’s observation
                     indicates that the eight manuals grouped in this cluster all represent the same translation
                     based on the Vulgate. At the same time, the presence of the text of Joye’s 1534 translation
                     naturally implies some relationship, albeit not a direct one, of this translation
                     to the text of the Vulgate. This implication, however, stands in stark contrast to
                     what is known about the source of Joye’s 1534 translation of the Psalms, which is
                     based on Huldrych Zwingli’s new Latin translation ([<a class="ref" href="#butterworth1962">Butterworth and Chester 1962</a>, 129]; [<a class="ref" href="#juhasz2014">Juhász 2014</a>, 23]). This contradiction needs to be accounted for as it seems that the clustering algorithm
                     incorrectly grouped the text of Joye’s 1534 translation with the texts based on the
                     Vulgate. It turns out, however, that the observed contradiction is only apparent,
                     as transpires from a comparison of the two Latin sources, i.e. the Vulgate and Zwingli’s
                     Latin texts of Psalm 6. While these two Latin texts are clearly different they do
                     show some striking similarities as illustrated by the first and last verses of Psalm
                     6 from these two Latin texts presented in (3).</div>

                     dissimilarity to the remaining texts. This is by no means surprising, as the literature
                     refers to the text of this translation as a paraphrase [<a class="ref" href="#ferguson2011">Ferguson 2011</a>, 154] so it does not resemble any of the remaining Psalter translations nor does it constitute

                  <div class="ptext" id="p26">The study of Psalm 6 contained in the examined publications has shown that cluster
                     analysis can be successfully applied to interpreting textual affinities. First of
                     all, it turned out that the hierarchical clustering algorithm employed here resulted
                     in the groupings which are consistent with historical facts and with the relationships
                     between the analysed texts presented in the specialist literature on this subject.
                     This demonstrates the accuracy of the method relying on strict mathematical criteria
                     for the analysis of textual data. Secondly, the method’s inherently objective nature
                     has the capacity to overcome preconceptions in approaching textual analyses and pinpointing
                     unexpected similarities, as demonstrated by the text of Psalm 6 in Joye’s 1534 Psalter.
                     As we have seen above, the grouping of Joye’s 1534 Psalter with the texts based on
                     the Vulgate has revealed a hitherto unknown affinity of Zwingli’s Latin to the Vulgate.<a class="noteRef" href="#d3e1502">[24]</a> It needs to be emphasised, however, that the results obtained here express textual
                     affinities exclusively with respect to Psalm 6 with no claim for generalisations.
                     To determine textual relations with respect to the other psalms printed in the manuals
                     further research along these lines is needed. Thirdly, the applied method offers reliable
                     results in the form of dendrograms which present relations between texts in a straightforward
                     way providing a wealth of information. Finally, cluster analysis, although performed
                     here on just twenty texts, can be applied to a potentially unlimited number of objects,
                     taking advantage of the developing body of textual data available in the digital format.
                     What transpires from the above is that cluster analysis can assist traditional philological
                     examinations by objectively processing large amounts of data and, in effect, drawing
                     scholarly attention to textual affinities which have so far remained unnoticed.</div>

                     material found in these manuals. Observe, however, that the clustering method employed
                     here could just as well be used for analysing textual affinities between prose and

                     based on the Vulgate and Zwingli’s Latin, which resulted in Joye’s 1534 Psalter being
                     associated with renditions form the Vulgate in the dendrogram, may simply follow from
                     the fact that both are vernacular translations of two Latin versions of the same text.
                     Observe, however, that the same can be stated about other translations from Latin
                     analysed here. Recall, for example, that Joye’s 1530 Psalter (02) is a translation
                     from Martin Bucer’s Latin text, while Coverdale’s 1539 Great Bible (10) is based on
                     the Vulgate and German. Nevertheless, these texts formed separate clusters together
                     with the manuals based on them. In this light, the fact that Joye’s 1534 Psalter is
                     grouped with translations based on the Vulgate does reveal an unexpected fact about
                     this translation as regards the text of Psalm 6.       </span></div>
