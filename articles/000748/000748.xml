            <p><name>Parisa Vaziri</name>'s <title rend="italic">Racial Blackness and Indian Ocean Slavery: Iran's Cinematic Archive</title> (2023) 
               begins with a sentence from one of <name>Marc Nichanian</name>'s books, <title rend="italic">The Historiographic Perversion</title> 
               (2009).<note><name>Marc Nichanian</name> was a Professor of Armenian Studies at <name>Columbia University</name> from 1996 to 2007. He is 
               currently a Visiting Professor at <name>Sabanci University</name>, <name>Instanbul</name>, in the Department of Cultural Studies.</note> 
               It reads: <quote rend="inline">Historical objectivity regarding facts, the quiet assurance of established history, is no more than 
               a luxury of those who can enjoy truth without conflict</quote> <ptr target="#vaziri_2023" loc="1"/>. <name>Nichanian</name>'s concept 
               of <quote rend="inline">historiographic perversion</quote> foreshadows a book deeply entrenched in the critical examination of historical 
               objectivity. By opening her book with this sentence, <name>Vaziri</name> shows readers that her work will scrutinize the very foundation 
               of what is commonly accepted as historical truth, questioning the neutrality and assurance of established history. Readers can expect 
               <name>Vaziri</name>'s book to offer a profound inquiry into the writing of history, exploring the influence of power, ideology, and 
               conflict on the construction of historical narratives. 
            </p>
            <p><title rend="italic">Racial Blackness and Indian Ocean Slavery: Iran's Cinematic Archive</title> (2023) is indeed a profound exploration 
               of representations of Blackness and historical undercurrents of slavery within Iranian cinema. <name>Vaziri</name>, a scholar of 
               comparative literature, delves into the complex layers of <term>Fīlmfārsī</term> from the 1950s and 1970s<note><term>Fīlmfārsī</term> is 
               a term used in pre-revolutionary Iranian cinema criticisim that was coined by Iranian film critic <name>Hushang Kavusi</name>. The 
               term is used to describe what was perceived as low-quality films, mostly copied from Bollywood cinema, with poor plots and arranged with 
               dance and singing.</note>, the Indigenous theatrical tradition of <term xml:lang="fa">siyāh bāzī</term>, or the Persian Black play, and 
               the portrayal of the <term xml:lang="fa">zār</term> ritual, offering a nuanced reading of how those films reflect and obscure the ties to 
               African enslavement.
            </p>
            <p>The origins of this book can be traced back to <name>Vaziri</name>'s PhD dissertation, which was written during a time of social upheaval 
               in <name>Iran</name>. The 2022 protests over <name>Mahsa Amini</name>'s tragic death provided a poignant backdrop, influencing 
               <name>Vaziri</name>'s approach to gender representation in Iranian cinema. That personal connection adds a layer of urgency and 
               authenticity to her work. Furthermore, while it is very tricky to translate words specific to Iranian culture into English, 
               <name>Vaziri</name> manages it well, particularly with words like <quote rend="inline">ungendered Blackness</quote> and 
               <quote rend="inline">eunuchism</quote>. Her translation of Persian words such as <term xml:lang="fa">naqqali</term> and 
               <term xml:lang="fa">pardahdari</term> (literally, <q>screen holding</q>) into English is more than a linguistic exercise; it is a 
               cultural bridge that enriches the reader's understanding of Iranian cinematic and social fabric. Persian terms, theoretical concepts, and 
               ideas are indicated with italics in this book.

          <head>Why Cinema?</head>
            <p><name>Vaziri</name> presents a compelling argument against the contemporary extractive nature of content production. She posits cinema 
               not merely as a form of entertainment but as a powerful medium for reflection and intellectual engagement. Her perspective resonates with 
               the thoughts of philosopher <name>Bernard Stiegler</name>, who eloquently remarked that <quote rend="inline">a process of global 
               unification has taken place through cinema</quote> <ptr target="#vaziri_2023" loc="10"/>. <name>Vaziri</name>'s book underscores the 
               unifying power of film to transcend cultural and temporal boundaries, offering a shared space for global narratives and dialogues.

          <head>Indian Ocean Slavery and the Lack of Archival Resources</head>
            <p><name>Vaziri</name>'s examination is particularly striking in its critique of the historiographical neglect of <name>Indian Ocean</name> 
               slavery, which starkly contrasts with the attention given to Atlantic and trans-Saharan slavery. That lacuna in historical discourse, 
               compounded by the scarcity of archival sources, is a silent testimony to the marginalized narratives of the enslaved. Related scholarship 
               shows both African migrations across the <name>Indian Ocean</name>, and the differences between three slave trade routes: trans-Saharan, 
              <name> Atlantic Ocean</name>, and <name>Indian Ocean</name>.
            </p>
            <p>In her exemplary work, the author articulates a significant challenge in the study of slavery: the scarcity of archival materials. She 
               notes that the narrative of <name>Indian Ocean</name> slavery, as in other regions, is often pieced together from material evidence that 
               was not created by the enslaved themselves, but rather from records shaped by bureaucratic narratives or formalized correspondence. Such 
               indirect documentation creates a barrier to fully understanding the enslaved perspective.
            </p>
            <p>Further, the author highlights the critical role of digital media in preserving cinematic history. She reflects on how a multitude of 
               films, pivotal to her research, would have been lost if not for the digital age. Those pre-revolutionary works, previously at the mercy of 
               inadequate storage solutions, faced further jeopardy from the deliberate destruction during the 1979 Iranian Revolution, resulting in the 
               demolition of a significant portion of <name>Iran</name>'s cinematic infrastructure as well as the loss of countless historical film 
               records. The transition to digital platforms has not only resurrected those films from potential obscurity but allowed for the 
               conservation and continued examination of <name>Iran</name>'s rich cinematic legacy.

        <div>
          <head>Significance of Oil and Sugar Cane</head>
            <p><name>Vaziri</name> also delves deeply into the profound impact of oil on the socio-economic fabric of <name>Iran</name>, underscoring 
               the role of oil since the early 20th century. As the nation's premier industry, oil reshaped <name>Iran</name>'s economy as well as its 
               cultural and social landscapes. The author explores how the legacy of the slave trade is intertwined with oil's narrative, noting that 
               the descendants of enslaved Africans, often traded in Persian Gulf ports, still live predominantly along the coastal regions. In this 
               way, the south of Iran becomes a dual symbol: a bastion of petroleum wealth and a silent witness to the legacy of slavery.
            </p>
            <p>Vaziri goes beyond oil, illuminating how the region's history is rich with other forms of commerce such as date cultivation, pearling, 
               and, notably, sugarcane farming in <name>Khuzistan</name> — historically known as the <q>land of sugar</q>. Those industries, sustained 
               in part by slave labor, predate oil's dominance and hint at a broader spectrum of economic activities that have shaped <q>Iran</q>'s 
               history.
            </p>
            <p>Moreover, the book suggests that oil and the slave labor that once bolstered the pearling industry form a subconscious thread in the 
               tapestry of Iranian cinema. That underlying theme is presented as a metaphorical undercurrent that has, perhaps inadvertently, influenced 
               the narratives and stories told through Iranian films. <name>Vaziri</name>'s insightful analysis aims to bring to light these submerged 
               connections, suggesting that the history of slavery and the development of the Iranian film industry are not just parallel stories but 
               are profoundly connected. As <name>Vaziri</name> writes, <quote rend="inline">Oil is <q>the key element</q>, the unconscious of the 
               Iranian film industry. But it is also the case that pearling — and the slave labor that fueled it — is the unconscious of oil</quote> 
               <ptr target="#vaziri_2023" loc="136"/>. She includes here a frame from the opening of <name>Bahram Beyzai</name>'s 
               <title rend="italic">Bashu, The Little Stranger</title> (1989), which depicts the titular child peering through an abyss of sugar cane. 
               The connection between slave labor and sugar cultivation dips into an undatable chasm that echoes through this scene in the ambiguity of 
               stalk identification.

          <head><term xml:lang="fa">Siyāh Bbāzī</term></head>
            <p><title rend="italic">Racial Blackness and Indian Ocean Slavery: Iran's Cinematic Archive</title> explores how the traditional Persian 
               performance art of <term xml:lang="fa">siyāh bāzī</term>, or <q>black play</q>, which often involves a character in blackface, was 
               woven into Iranian cinema before the revolution. The art form, which features a character known as the <term xml:lang="fa">siyāh</term> 
               who often annoys or mocks authority figures, has not been thoroughly examined by film experts, especially regarding its transition to 
               film and its historical links to actual slavery.
            </p>
            <p>The author points out that when <term xml:lang="fa">siyāh bāzī</term> moved from the stage to the screen, the art form lost some of its 
               original meaning due to the way that films were edited and the complex symbols used in them. While such films might remind us of  
               <name>Iran</name>'s past with African slavery, they often reduce the <term xml:lang="fa">siyāh</term> character to a simple stereotype, 
               stripping away the historical context. Thus, there remains substantial debate about whether <term xml:lang="fa">siyāh bāzī</term> in 
               films really represents the same thing as the racist practice of blackface, which is recognized globally.
            </p>
            <p>In the first chapter, the author argues that the way <term xml:lang="fa">siyāh bāzī</term> is shown in films highlights the problems with 
               how we think about this tradition. Films from before the Iranian revolution show the <term xml:lang="fa">siyāh</term> character as less 
               complex and more disconnected from its roots in African slavery. This contrasts with the tendency today, both in academic and popular 
               discussions, to try to ignore or deny the <term xml:lang="fa">siyah</term>'s connections to slavery. However, <name>Vaziri</name> 
               suggests that the reality of slavery disrupts these comfortable views, showing that the context through which we understand the 
               <term xml:lang="fa">siyāh</term> character in films is not as solid or trustworthy as we might think.
            </p>
            <p>In <name>Farukh Ghafārī</name>'s classic black-and-white film, <title rend="italic">Shab-e Qoozi</title> (<title rend="italic">Night of 
               the Hunchback</title>; 1964), there is a scene that encapsulates the complex layers of social commentary surrounding the 
               <term xml:lang="fa">siyāh bāzī</term> that <name>Vaziri</name> examines. The scene features a white actor in blackface making an 
               entrance, inquiring in broken Persian whether his master has enjoyed the music. As his indifferent master leisurely inhales from his 
               hookah, the character calls out, <quote rend="inline">With your permission, may this house-born slave [<term xml:lang="fa">ghulām-i 
               khānahzād</term>] provide entertainment? Musicians, play!</quote> The character, referred to as a <quote rend="inline">house-born 
               slave</quote>, performs a subservient act, gracefully pouring liquid from a pitcher on a mantel into a diminutive cup before balancing it 
               atop his head. He then commences to dance with a backward bend so low that the master can effortlessly take the cup

        <div>
           <head><term xml:lang="fa">Zār</term></head>
            <p>The author dedicates Chapter 2 to the ritual of <term xml:lang="fa">zār</term>, which, in the context of Iranian modernity marked by the 
               oil boom and the official end of slavery under <name>Reza Shah</name> in 1928<note><name>Reza Shah Pahlavi</name> (1878-1944) was an 
               Iranian military officer and the founder of the Pahlavi dynasty, which was the last Iranian royal dynasty, ruling for almost 54 years 
               between 1925 and 1979.</note>, represents a paradoxical call for the resurgence of the Black slave as a symbol of healing. This 
               juxtaposition suggests that the legacy of slavery remains unresolved and continues to require healing, a theme that resonates in Iranian 
               cinema of the 1960s, especially in narratives set in the south of <name>Iran</name> where Black characters often embody the role of 
               healers.
            </p>
            <p><term xml:lang="fa">Zār</term>, as a practice, is prevalent across various regions, from Southwest <name>Asia</name> to the <name>Persian 
               Gulf</name> and from North <name>Africa</name> to parts of South <name>Asia</name> and East <name>Africa</name>. It is characterized by 
               cathartic processes involving movement, rhythm, and secrecy, leading to a loss of consciousness and serving as a form of communal therapy 
               rather than a descent into despair. The author points out that <term xml:lang="fa">zār</term> operates on the principle of equality; 
               despite its more frequent practice in impoverished Black communities, <term xml:lang="fa">zār</term> affects individuals universally. This 
               egalitarian aspect of <term xml:lang="fa">zār</term> is also echoed in Ethiopian belief systems, where it is said that everyone possesses 
               a <term xml:lang="fa">zār</term>.
            </p>
            <p>From the film <title rend="italic">Bashu, the Little Stranger</title> (1984), directed by <name>Baharm Beyzai</name>, <name>Vaziri</name> 
               highlights a poignant moment where <name>Na'i</name>, the mother figure, is desperately seeking a cure for her son, <name>Bashu</name>. The 
               local doctor's discriminatory assertion that his treatments are not meant for <quote rend="inline">people of that color</quote> starkly 
               contrasts with the ethos of <term xml:lang="fa">zār</term>, which does not discriminate. The incident is meticulously captured by 
               <name>Beyzai</name>, underscoring <term xml:lang="fa">zār</term> as a force that sees no color, a stark reminder of the egalitarianism 
               deeply rooted in this cultural practice. From <term xml:lang="fa">zār</term>, we glean the profound lesson of inherent equality among all 
               people.

               commentary on the representation of Blackness in the film <title rend="italic">Bashu, The Little Stranger</title> is particularly 
               revealing. She discusses the character's otherness and the societal reactions to his skin color, reflecting the broader societal issues 
               regarding race and identity. In the film a boy from the south of <name>Iran</name> is lost after fleeing home for his life; his family has 
               been killed during the <name>Iran</name>-<name>Iraq</name> war. He is saved and trained by a middle-aged woman (<name>Na'i</name>) in the 
               north of <name>Iran</name>.
            </p>
            <p>The film's dialog choices represent the mindsets of local people. At the start of the film, <name>Bashu</name>'s mother finds him in the 
               paddy field and expresses repulsion for <name>Bashu</name>'s dark skin color, wondering aloud if he has escaped from a coal mine. Town 
               dwellers find <name>Bashu</name>'s Blackness a subject of derision and comedy. For example, the village shopkeeper insultingly 
               <name>Na'i</name> an extra bar of soap as a means of insulting the Blackness of <name>Bashu</name>'s skin. Throughout the film, across 
               numerous scenes, a group of young boys encircles and bullies <name>Bashu</name> upon seeing him.
            </p>
            <p>When <name>Na'i</name>'s relatives come to visit her, non of them see <name>Bashu</name> as a child of <name>Iran</name>, a recognizable 
               brother or son, and they can't resist remarking upon <name>Bashu</name>'s <quote rend="inline">charcoal</quote> color. They gather on a 
               carpet, palaver, and pass around tea, reprimanding <name>Na'i</name> for her reckless decision to host the supposed foreigner, while 
               various family members physically assess Bashu. An aunt gropes <name>Bashu</name>'s head in search of lice; an uncle demands dental 
               inspection. A small girl <name>Bashu</name> had earlier glimpsed from the window with intrigued curiosity crawls toward him on the carpet 
               and swabs his face with her finger, which she examines, disappointed. <name>Bashu</name> lowers his head in shame. In another famous scene, 
               <name>Na'i</name> bathes her own children in the river and then tricks <name>Bashu</name> into the water, furiously scrubbing away at his 
               dark skin and nearly drowning him, hoping to remove his color as if removing a stain: <quote rend="inline" xml:lang="fa">Sefid nibeh ke 
               nibeh</quote> (<quote rend="inline">No, he won’t become white</quote>).

        <div>
          <head>Renaming Slaves</head>
            <p>The book then delves into the historical practice of renaming slaves, highlighting how such acts were used to strip individuals of their 
               identity, a brutal facet of dehumanization. In Southwest <name>Asia</name> as elsewhere, renaming individuals with non-human names was one 
               means by which slaveholders asserted control over the identities of the people they enslaved. In her insightful commentary on the character 
               <name>Bashu</name>, <name>Vaziri</name> unpacks the lasting psychological effects of slavery. In the film's opening scene, for example, 
               <name>Na'i</name> confronts <name>Bashu</name>, reducing him to a nameless, inferior status by denigrating his color and intelligence, thus 
               negating his humanity: <quote rend="inline">You are black, you are dumb, you have no name</quote>. Every human being has a name. 
            </p>
            <p><name>Vaziri</name> further explores the paradox of <name>Bashu</name>'s Blackness within the film, which is presented as neither Persian 
               nor Arab, leaving him without a cultural anchor. The character's name, <name>Bashu</name>, is revealed by the director, 
               <name>Beyzai</name>, to be a creative amalgamation derived from the Persian verbs <q>to be</q> [<term xml:lang="fa">budan</term>] and 
               <q>to reside</q> [<term xml:lang="fa">bashidan</term>]. Thus, his name lends Bashu an existence and a place albeit through a constructed 
               identity. This intricate detail underscores the complex layers of identity and belonging, particularly for those marked by the legacy of 
               slavery.

          <head><title rend="italic">The Runner</title></head>
            <p>In the second part of Chapter 4, <name>Vaziri</name> turns to another film, <name>Amir Naderi</name>'s <title rend="italic">The 
               Runner</title> (1984), which is also about a young boy (<name>Amiro</name>) in the south of <name>Iran</name>. While <name>Amiro</name> is 
               not marked as Black like <name>Bashu</name> is, his character mirrors societal attitudes towards race and humanity, suggesting a more 
               innocent and unprejudiced perspective that could be the key to overcoming racial biases.
            </p>
            <p><name>Vaziri</name> discusses an important scene in this film in which physical power, like labor, is racialized through the juxtaposition 
               of the white American and European foreigners who come to the port to get their shoes shined with the figure of <name>Amiro</name> bent at 
               their feet, revealing his imprisonment within labor. As <name>Vaziri</name> writes, <name>Amiro</name> intermittently 
               <quote rend="inline">stares out into the ocean and fantasizes about being taken away by one of the large white ships: 
               <quote rend="inline">How white…how beautiful</quote></quote> <ptr target="#vaziri_2023" loc="197–198"/>.
            </p>
            <p>In another poignant sequence from <title rend="italic">The Runner</title>, we witness young children valiantly attempting to scale rock 
               mounds. The camera captures their endeavors from a high angle, tracking the children's ascent only to follow their subsequent and 
               inevitable descent each time they falter. This visual narrative eloquently conveys the Sisyphean nature of <name>Amiro</name>'s existence, 
               underscoring the futility and servitude that mark his life's toil. The director employs this vantage point not merely as a cinematic 
               technique but as a storytelling device, inviting viewers to empathize with <name>Amiro</name>'s relentless yet unrewarding struggle.

          <head><name>Haji Firuz</name></head>
            <p>Finally, <name>Vaziri</name> addresses the cultural and nationalistic forces that shape the discourse on race in <name>Iran</name>. She 
               critiques the persistent mythologizing of <name>Iran</name>'s Aryan past, which has influenced modern perceptions and discussions about 
               race and identity. 
            </p>
            <p><name>Haji Firuz</name> is a fictional character in Iranian folklore who appears in the streets by the beginning of Nowruz (Iranian New 
               Year). His face is covered in soot and he is clad in bright red clothes and a felt hat. He dances through the streets while singing and 
               playing the tambourine. <name>Vaziri</name>'s examination of cultural figures like <name>Haji Firuz</name> and the influence of Aryanism 
               provides a critical look at how nationalism and historical narratives have been constructed and the impact they have on contemporary 
               society.<note>In the traditional songs of <name>Iran</name>, <name>Haji Firuz</name> introduces himself as a sef trying to cheer people 
               whom he refers to as his lords.</note>
            </p>
            <p><name>Haji Firuz</name> symbolizes <name>Iran</name>'s complex history with slavery as a figure whose performances evoke images of 
               servitude. Contemporary Iranian culture often seeks to trace its roots to the pre-Islamic era and 
               Zoroastrianism<note><term>Zoroastrianism</term>, also known as <term>Mazdayasna</term> and <term>Behdin</term>, is an Iranian religion 
               and one of the world's oldest organized faiths. It is based on the teachings of the Iranian-speaking prophet <name>Zoroaster</name>.</note>, 
               driven by nationalist sentiments and a desire to validate cultural practices. This nationalistic drive stems from historical figures like 
               <name>Reza Shah</name>, who promoted the idea of an Aryan Persian identity and the belief that the Persian king <name>Cyrus the 
               Great</name> (590-529 BC) abolished slavery in <name>Iran</name>. <name>Vaziri</name>'s work challenges such misconceptions by highlighting 
               <name>Iran</name>'s history of slavery, particularly in the context of films produced after 1953, which reflect the nationalistic 
               ideologies of early 20th-century Iran. Aryanism, a significant nationalist ideology, continues to shape <name>Iran</name>'s identity 
               debates, influencing Iran's self-perception as white, racially distinct, and separate from its regional neighbors in the <name>Middle 
               East</name>.
            </p>
            <p>The concluding chapter brings us to the <name>Collective for Black Iranians</name>, a group that emerged in the wake of the 
               <name>Black Lives Matter</name> movement, which serves as a contemporary challenge to traditional historiography. The collective's digital 
               aesthetics and the narratives they spawn push back against the denial of racial legacies in the history of <name>Indian Ocean</name> 
               slavery. The book posits that such digital communities are crafting counternarratives that protest the prevailing state of unacknowledged 
               anti-Blackness in Southwest <name>Asia</name> and North <name>Africa</name>.
            </p>
            <p><name>Vaziri</name>'s work is a crucial contribution to media studies, offering insightful critiques and celebrating cinema's potential to 
               generate intellectual discussion. This book is highly recommended for those interested in the intersection of film, culture, and history, 
               as well as anyone seeking to understand the profound ways in which our global stories are woven together in the frames of cinema.

          <head>Addendum</head>
            <p>In delving into <name>Parisa Vaziri</name>'s book, it is fascinating to note the resurgence of an old Iranian song in a modern Bollywood 
               film, sparking renewed interest and appreciation. <title rend="italic" xml:lang="fa">Jamal Jamaloo Kudu</title>, a song that first 
               resonated with audiences in the 1950s when performed by the <name>Kharazmi Girls High School</name>'s Shirazi Choir, has found its way back 
               into popular culture. The song, which has been a traditional favorite at weddings, was reimagined in <name>Sandeep Reddy Vanga</name>'s 
               film <title rend="italic">Animal</title>, released on December 1, 2023, with <name>Bobby Deol</name>'s character making a memorable 
               entrance to its catchy tune.
            </p>
            <p>This song, with roots tracing back to a poem by the esteemed Iranian poet <name>Bijan Samandar</name>, is a charming duet between a white 
               Iranian woman and a Black man from southern <name>Iran</name>, whose ancestry is linked to <name>Zanzibar</name>. The lyrics convey a 
               tender narrative where the woman expresses her deep affection, while the man responds with lighthearted invitations to dance, admiring her 
               beauty in a playful exchange. The juxtaposition of their distinct heritages within the song's lyrics and the mutual admiration they express 
               stands in poignant contrast to historical racial tensions.
            </p>
            <p>The enduring popularity of <title rend="quotes" xml:lang="fa">Jamal Jamaloo Kudu</title> serves as a cultural bridge, illustrating the 
               seamless assimilation of African influences into Iranian culture. It defies the divisive views often associated with historical 
               intercultural interactions, championing the idea of unity in diversity. This song remains a vibrant celebration of cultural harmony and a 
               poignant reminder of the significance of inclusivity in our global society.
