                  <p>This article explores how the podcast medium as a form of audio technology has
                     facilitated the reimagining of academic publication and feminist praxis. In this case
                     study, we situate the podcast <cite class="title italic">Books Aren’t Dead (BAD)</cite>, an
                     affiliate of the Fembot Collective, within a broader context of digital humanities
                     scholarship and the field's potential to utilize audio technology to realize feminist
                     approaches. <cite class="title italic">BAD</cite>, as a podcast, serves as an open-access
                     medium that brings authors and reviewers together in a collaborative context. Audiobook
                     reviews allow for a conversation between author and interviewer, whereby the author
                     can
                     place the work in a broader scholastic and contemporary context for listeners as well
                     as
                     actively engage with constructive critique and questions. The result is a dynamic
                     scholarly communication rather than the static textual product of a book review. We
                     discuss the unique role of audio technology within the knowledge production process
                     from a
                     performance studies and archival point of view. Additionally, in the spirit of the
                     project
                     <cite class="title italic">BAD</cite>, we also provide an addendum to our textual discussion
                     by including a podcast where we discuss these themes as co-producers, graduate students,
                     and young academics, exploring how audio technology can break down barriers to publication
                     and authorship.

                     mutable form of a podcast may be situated in the historical context of radio broadcasting

                     [<a class="ref" href="#menduni2007">Menduni 2007</a>], a podcast is distinctively different from the radio
                     broadcast medium in modes of delivery, archiving, and function. Podcasting is a more
                     accessible audio format that has increasingly enabled a broad public to record
                     conversations, interviews, and fictional narratives as well as disseminate audio
                     recordings on various digital platforms rather than commercial airwaves. This article
                     explores the podcast medium as a form of audio technology within the dynamic field
                     of
                     digital humanities (DH). We argue that the podcast as an audio format has the potential
                     to
                     facilitate the reimagining of an academic publication as feminist praxis. As co-producers

                     offer <cite class="title italic">BAD</cite> as a case study to discuss how the podcast embodies

                     feminist audio archive and foregrounding audio interviews as alternatives to written
                     book

                     what
                     counts as scholarship in DH, this article begins by examining the <cite class="title italic">BAD</cite> podcast in the context of feminist DH and the archival preservation of
                     feminist scholarship. We outline how podcasting as a medium and genre allows for the
                     expression and centralization of feminist values and forms of knowledge production.
                     We
                     then recount how podcasting permits the preservation of feminist voices and the curation
                     of an archive of feminist knowledge evidenced by two recent <cite class="title italic">BAD</cite> interviews. We discuss the significance of performance and mediation
                     between producer, listener, and interviewee in the podcast format. Next, we contextualize
                     how <cite class="title italic">BAD</cite> subverts and problematizes existing hierarchies in
                     academic publishing and models a feminist praxis. We conclude with encouragement for
                     other
                     DH practitioners interested in utilizing this audio format through small-scale feminist

                     broader trend of the new “datafied” ways of reading, analyzing, and
                     deconstructing texts. These trends privilege a “big data” approach to

                     [<a class="ref" href="#van2017">van Es and Schäfer 2017</a>]. This “big data” turn marginalizes feminist

                     scholarship, and we draw attention to how <cite class="title italic">BAD</cite> actualizes what
                     we view as the main goal of feminist DH work, to “...expand our
                     notions of text and context, archive and canon, and code and program”
                     [<a class="ref" href="#wernimont2018">Wernimont and Losh 2018</a>, xii]. Our intervention in this project of expansion is
                     the reimagining of the academic book review as a podcast, which falls within a longer
                     trajectory of feminist scholarship in DH. As Alexis Lothian and Amanda Phillips have
                     noted, “archives may be the most legible form of digital humanities
                     production”
                     [<a class="ref" href="#lothian2013">Lothian and Phillips 2013</a>, 6]. Our DH project produces the necessary historical
                     archives of feminist scholarship, but also expands upon the use and content of an
                     archive
                     in the podcast format [<a class="ref" href="#wernimont2013">Wernimont 2013</a>]. We take a broader view of archives,
                     moving away from the primacy of written texts and draw particular attention to how
                     audio
                     recordings serve as living archives. Therefore, in addition to the technology of the
                     feminist archive, <cite class="title italic">BAD</cite> also draws upon the affordances of
                     audio technology to expand the definition of text, thereby embracing feminist forms
                     of
                     knowledge production that characterize a feminist DH approach.

                     interaction between the reviewer and the author. Furthermore, book reviews are often
                     pay-walled and thus inaccessible to a broader public [<a class="ref" href="#brienza2012">Brienza 2012</a>]
                     [<a class="ref" href="#logan2017">Logan 2017</a>]. Increasingly, academics at smaller institutions and
                     independent scholars struggle to pay for institutional or individual access to expensive
                     journal subscriptions [<a class="ref" href="#logan2017">Logan 2017</a>]
                     [<a class="ref" href="#sample2012">Sample 2012</a>]. As a result, both the production and consumption of book
                     reviews alienates the reviewer, author, and audience from one another. As Alexis Lothian
                     and Amanda Phillips note, the <cite class="title italic">Fembot Collective</cite> — through its
                     commitment to collaborative, open peer review and an open-access platform — has “expanded [the] notion of what ‘article’ means” and more
                     broadly serves as an “innovator in scholarly communicative
                     possibilities” within the field of DH [<a class="ref" href="#lothian2013">Lothian and Phillips 2013</a>, 19].
                     Podcasting, therefore, offers an exciting approach that addresses critiques of DH
                     and
                     models how the field can challenge structures and hierarchies of power in the academy.

                     the content of the text but the authors' experience in producing the text. We particularly
                     want to emphasize the fluidity of a podcast performance that facilitates feminist
                     forms of
                     communicative engagement. The audience, while listening rather than reading, experiences
                     a
                     form of affective connection that allows for identification with the voices and the
                     centralization of feminist themes. The audience's experience of listening is now included
                     in the creation of knowledge. Each individualized listeners' decoding allows for and
                     encourages different places of entry and departure within the podcast.

                  <div class="ptext" id="p18">Just as the listener has the opportunity to engage with the podcast, the author or
                     interviewee has the potential to perform the self as an authoritative voice via
                     co-scriptive interactions and discussions. Typically, the accessibility of an academic
                     publication creates the scholarly authority, specifically if it is behind a paywall
                     and
                     situated within a vocabulary only understood by other academics. However, we contend
                     that
                     this type of scholarly authority is determined by institutional methods that are arbitrary
                     and prohibitive to a broader public. In <cite class="title italic">BAD</cite>, the interviewer
                     and the interviewee are not just performing scholarly inquiry but also engaging in
                     dynamic
                     communication throughout the interview that redefines scholarly authority. The interviewer
                     prepares written questions, but the conversation may change as she switches her line
                     of
                     inquiry to the author. Additionally, the author can lead the conversation in various
                     directions as part of an ongoing dialogue. Stacy Copeland emphasizes that in podcasts,
                     the
                     changing emotional tone of voice and other background audio allows for the podcast
                     to
                     become a form of affective media. Copeland states that in podcasts, “the material voice becomes a sticky surface to be stuck with multiple decodings,
                     re-workings and affect”
                     [<a class="ref" href="#copeland2018">Copeland 2018</a>, 220]. An interview between two people can become
                     “sticky” in the sense that emotional changes in voice, laughter, and
                     unexpected moments can produce the possibility for multiple points of engagement.
                     Stickiness, then, produces surplus affect and creates the conditions for greater dynamic,
                     dialogic engagement, thus providing a facet of connection that goes beyond the formulaic
                     structure of a book review.

                     the
                     reviewer comments on and critiques a text from afar. The ability to ask questions
                     of

                     in

                     DH
                     praxis. To be included within feminist DH praxis, the podcast ought to produce a unique
                     space for dialogue and engagement that was previously limited in the current state
                     of
                     academic publishing. We situate <cite class="title italic">BAD</cite> to serve as an aural
                     space for feminist scholarly engagement in the field of DH that is, at times, exclusionary
                     to feminist concerns, projects, and critiques [<a class="ref" href="#wernimont2018">Wernimont and Losh 2018</a>]. Another way
                     in which podcasting as performance establishes feminist DH praxis is that podcasts
                     ultimately represent active possibilities. These possibilities include performance,
                     affective connection, staging, learning, and the extension of the professional
                     relationship beyond the interview. Podcasts have the potential to directly archive
                     emotions and experiences, and therefore feminist ways of knowing, thus serving as
                     both
                     affective as well as physical archives. Affective archives preserve performances,
                     experiences, emotions, and interactions. Thus, the performance of podcasting is crucial
                     to
                     subverting academic hierarchies by creating archives beyond the physical and written

                     for
                     feminist DH practitioners. In our professionalization, we have been informed that
                     in the
                     hierarchy of publishing, books reviews may be lower in prestige and often serve as
                     a way
                     for graduate students to ease into publishing. Therefore, the individuals that do
                     engage
                     with book reviews may find their labor delegitimized and seen as “knowing their
                     place” and “doing their time.” However, we see engaging
                     with the labor of other people's work as incredibly important to elevate and legitimize
                     one another's research, especially for marginalized authors in academia. This is important
                     since the work of individuals who identify as Black scholars, indigenous scholars,
                     scholars of color, and female-identified and non-binary scholars, is underrepresented
                     in

                     reviewer's CV to supporting the author in the interview space and amplifying feminist
                     scholarship.

                     of the
                     idea of voice, both literally and figuratively. Like many women, we were socialized
                     into
                     thinking our voices were not authoritative both in content and delivery. Just as
                     marginalized scholars confront an academic publishing apparatus that is biased towards
                     white, male forms of authorship and knowledge production [<a class="ref" href="#mirza2015">Mirza 2015</a>]

                     [<a class="ref" href="#souto2007">Souto and Ray 2007</a>], feminine voices are audibly policed. This can manifest in the
                     characterization of “vocal fry” as unprofessional and unattractive [<a class="ref" href="#anderson2014">Anderson et al. 2014</a>], or a preference among men to listen to higher-pitched
                     femininized voices over average pitched tones [<a class="ref" href="#feinberg2008">Feinberg et al. 2008</a>]. However, we
                     maintain that a podcast's performative authorship breaks down barriers to knowledge
                     such
                     as paywalls, and also creates spaces for diverse voices to emerge and claim authority.
                     Podcasts become a way to intervene in the politics of sound.

                     behind steep paywalls, listeners can access and download podcasts with financial and

                     while
                     increasing access and discovery of, in our case, feminist scholarship.

                     useful to other scholars,” publishing “project overviews
                     written by project directors alongside peer reviews written by members of digital

                     [<a class="ref" href="#guiliano2020">Guiliano and Risam 2020</a>]. This project takes the form of incorporating previous
                     academic standards by existing as a peer-reviewed journal but expands upon the idea
                     of
                     what is considered eligible and credible to academic archives. Guiliano and Risam's
                     initiative demonstrates how creators of DH projects can still be legitimized by their
                     peers through rigorous reviews and evaluation, but with DH projects and publications
                     considered on their own terms, rather than trying to fit into the very evaluative
                     structure of academic journal publishing that DH practitioners are trying to subvert.
