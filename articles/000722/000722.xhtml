                  <h2>Abstract</h2>
                  
                  <p>With the burgeoning use of digital technologies in safeguarding intangible and living
                     heritage, memory institutions have produced a significant body 
                     of material yet to be made accessible for public transmission. The quest for new ways
                     to unlock these massive collections has intensified, 
                     especially in the case of embodied knowledge embedded in complex formats, such as
                     audiovisual and motion capture data.
                     </p>
                  
                  <p>This study examines a computational workflow that combines posture recognition and
                     movement computing to bridge the gap in accessing digital 
                     archives that capture living knowledge and embodied experiences. By reflecting on
                     how embodied knowledge is sustained and potentially 
                     valorised through human interaction, we devise a series of methods utilising vision-based
                     feature extraction, pose estimation, movement analysis, 
                     and machine learning. The goal is to augment the archival experience with new modes
                     of exploration, representation, and embodiment.
                     </p>
                  
                  <p>This article reports the computational procedures and algorithmic tools inspected
                     through two use cases. In the first example, we visualise the 
                     archives of the Prix de Lausanne, a collection of 50 years of video recordings of dance performances, for archival
                     exploration through 
                     the dancers' poses. In another experiment, movement encoding is employed to allow
                     multimodal data search via embodied cues in the 
                     Hong Kong Martial Arts Living Archive, a comprehensive documentation of the living heritage of martial arts that is chiefly
                     comprised 
                     of motion-captured performances by masters.
                     </p>
                  
                  <p>Though holding different application purposes, both projects operate on the proposed
                     framework and extract archive-specific features to create a 
                     meaningful representation of human bodies, which reveals the versatile applications
                     that computational capacities can achieve for embodied knowledge 
                     archives. The practices also represent a model of interdisciplinary involvement where
                     the archivists, computists, artists, and knowledge holders 
                     join hands to renew strategies for archival exploration and heritage interpretation
                     in a new light.

                     diversity of human creativity and collective heritage, as defined by UNESCO. The preservation and exploration of living heritage 
                     has been of paramount importance in understanding and celebrating the cultural fabric
                     of our society. To further enhance our engagement with this 
                     heritage, advancements in digital technologies have opened new possibilities for capturing

                  <div class="ptext" id="p2">In recent years, there has been a growing trend in the digital capturing of living
                     heritage and embodied knowledge 
                     [<a class="ref" href="#hou_et_al_2022">Hou et al. 2022</a>]. These endeavours aim to document and preserve not only physical artefacts but also
                     the intangible aspects of 
                     culture, such as rituals, performances, and traditional practices. However, GLAM sectors,
                     encompassing galleries, libraries, archives, and 
                     museums, face significant challenges in effectively managing and providing access
                     to these vast digital repositories

                  <div class="ptext" id="p3">One of the key challenges faced by GLAM sectors is the sheer scale of digitised collections.
                     As more and more heritage materials are digitised, 
                     the volume of data grows exponentially, making it increasingly difficult to navigate
                     and explore these archives manually and essentially turning 
                     these collections into “dark archives” inaccessible to the public. Giovanna Fossati et al. further highlight how 
                     non-expert audiences are in need of more intuitive modes of access to discover these
                     collections [<a class="ref" href="#fossati_et_al_2012">Fossati et al. 2012</a>]. To address 
                     this challenge, recent research has embarked on applying computational analysis, artificial
                     intelligence (AI) in particular, to unlock various 
                     new modes of archival experience. Leveraging the transformative potential of AI<a class="noteRef" href="#d4e253">[1]</a>, we

                     gap between data science and GLAM sectors, highlighted

                  <div class="ptext" id="p4">To tackle these challenges, we propose a computational framework that augments the
                     archival experience of embodied knowledge. Our approach 
                     intends to extract human movements in the form of skeleton data and process it, showing
                     its versatility through multiple use cases. By 
                     revalorizing and visualising knowledge, memory, and experience, we strive to enhance
                     the cognitive reception and engagement of users, ultimately 
                     improving the overall archival user experience. Our experiments are conducted on two
                     exemplar collections: the archives of the 
                     Prix de Lausanne, comprising an audiovisual dataset of dance performances, and the Hong Kong Martial Arts Living Archive 
                     (HKMALA), which contains both videos and motion capture recordings of Hong Kong martial arts performers. This work might be of 
                     interest to professionals of cultural heritage institutions wishing to explore new
                     methods of access to their collections, as well as researchers 
                     of computational humanities with a focus on embodied knowledge archives.

                        heritage (ICH) is inherently living and manifests 
                        through bodily expressions, individual practices, and social enactment — on the multiple
                        layers of embodiment. Recent research has revealed a

                        transforming intangible practices into tangible 
                        choreographic objects. For instance, the i-Treasures project (2013-2017) works to
                        digitize the living heritage of folk dances, folk singing, 
                        craftsmanship, and contemporary music composition in an attempt to sustain traditional
                        know-how via creative presentation

                        Terpsichore project (2016 to 2020) integrates computational models, such as semantic
                        web technologies and machine learning, with storytelling

                        extensive collections such as William 
                        Forsythe's Performative Archive, recently acquired by the ZKM Center for Art and Media Karlsruhe. While its focus differs 
                        from the performing arts, the Hong Kong Martial Arts Living Archive (HKMALA) project (2012-present) forges a multimodal digital 
                        archiving paradigm by motion-capturing martial art sequence performances of renowned
                        masters. The motion-captured (MoCap) records are 
                        situated within a digital collation capturing different facets of Hong Kong's martial arts traditions, encompassing rituals, 
                        histories, re-enactments, and stories of practitioners [<a class="ref" href="#chao_et_al_2018">Chao et al. 2018</a>].

                        documents the active dimension of mankind's creativity over time. Hence, as Tim Ingold's delineates, instead of targeting solely 
                        result-driven examinations, the ideal usage of such data should facilitate a new mode

                        named “cultural analytics” [<a class="ref" href="#manovich_2020">Manovich 2020</a>]. Other researchers, such as Leonardo Impett, have focused

                        new modes of experiencing them. This method applies to both moving image and MoCap
                        archives, with the main difference in the first step: 
                        extracting human poses. Indeed, when working with videos, human pose estimation models
                        such as OpenPose [<a class="ref" href="#cao_et_al_2019">Cao et al. 2019</a>] 
                        are required to extract human postures in the form of a “skeleton”, or a list of keypoint edge pairs, as defined in the COCO dataset 
                        [<a class="ref" href="#lin_et_al_2014">Lin et al. 2014</a>]. Depending on the model, these can be in two or three dimensions and handle single
                        or multiple persons at the 
                        same time. Furthermore, we stress that these models can sometimes fail to accurately
                        detect full bodies, especially in situations where part 
                        of the body is occluded. The number of keypoints detected can also impact how much
                        these models are able to capture features specific to a 
                        certain discipline. While MoCap data generally comes with skeleton information, post-processing,
                        normalisation, and format conversion are 
                        often necessary to produce clean and operable skeleton datasets.

                        the wrists and ankles. Although the algorithm was not specifically trained on dance
                        recordings, we believe these additional features help to 
                        better capture specific poses of dance performances, where even the positions of the
                        hands and feet are crucial. Videos were processed to 
                        extract one pose every five seconds, a cautious design decision to avoid over-collecting
                        similar poses merely due to temporal closeness. We do 
                        note however this is potentially not the best solution to ensure a full coverage of
                        the diversity of poses, and future research in this 
                        direction could improve the results presented even further. It is worth noting that
                        not all frames necessarily had a detected pose, since in 
                        some cases the dancer was too far away from the camera, or because some videos were
                        not properly cut to the exact dance performance and thus 
                        had irrelevant frames at the beginning and/or the end. We measured the rate of detection
                        by taking the mean of the ratio of poses detected 
                        over the number of frames per video, obtaining a mean detection rate of 76.80% across
                        all the videos. The pose extraction process resulted in 
                        a total of 27,672 poses.

                     <div class="ptext" id="p18">Once these poses had been extracted, we normalised them following a two-step procedure.
                        We first subtracted the pose centre, defined as the 
                        mean point between the left and right hips. We then scaled the pose by its size, defined
                        as the maximum between the torso size and the maximum 
                        distance between the pose centre and any keypoint, where the torso size was computed
                        as the distance between the centre of the shoulders and 
                        the pose centre (the centre of the hips). The procedure ensures meaningful comparison
                        between the poses by normalising them. An intuitive 
                        sample of normalised poses with their corresponding frames is provided in Figure 1.

                     <div class="ptext" id="p20">One of the fundamental applications unlocked by computational archives is the possibility
                        to visualise whole collections. To this end, we 
                        apply dimensionality reduction (DR) algorithms to embed the high-dimensional feature
                        spaces in two or three dimensions, in order to create a 
                        novel way of visualising and navigating the whole archive. We tested both standard
                        DR methods, such as Principal Component Analysis (PCA), 
                        and t-distributed Stochastic Neighbour Embedding (tSNE), as well as a more recent
                        approach, Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection 
                        (UMAP). We leveraged scikit-learn implementations for the two first algorithms and
                        the official UMAP Python implementation for the latter 
                        [<a class="ref" href="#pedregosa_et_al_2011">Pedregosa et al. 2011</a>] [<a class="ref" href="#halko_martinsson_tropp_2011">Halko, Martinsson, and Tropp 2011</a>] [<a class="ref" href="#martinsson_rokhlin_tvgert_2011">Martinsson, Rokhlin, and Tvgert 2011</a>]

                        metrics as the distance measure to compute the projection. We therefore tested five
                        options on 27,672 poses, with both sets of feature 
                        vectors. Figure 2 shows the resulting embeddings in two dimensions.

                     <div class="ptext" id="p21">We can immediately observe that PCA performs poorly on this dataset, as expected due
                        to its linear nature that cannot preserve much variance 
                        with just two dimensions (only 49% with the flattened vectors of keypoints and 45%
                        with the custom features). Both tSNE and UMAP, however, 
                        give much more interesting results, where structures in the dataset can be observed.
                        Since we did not observe meaningful differences between 
                        the two sets of feature vectors used, we pursued further examinations with the flattened
                        vectors of keypoints to exploit the heuristic 
                        quality of the algorithms independent of the choice of features. Therefore, we set
                        out to investigate tSNE and UMAP behaviours in more depth 
                        by studying the effects of their hyperparameters. For tSNE, we observed how the embedding
                        in two dimensions behaves for different 
                        perplexities (\(ϵ\)), the main parameter for this algorithm, related to the number of 
                        neighbours considered for any given point during the computation. For UMAP, we investigated
                        the number of nearest neighbours 
                        (\(𝑛\)), controlling how UMAP balances local versus global structure in the data, as well
                        as 
                        the minimum distance (\(𝑑_{min}\)) the algorithm is allowed to pack points together in the 
                        low-dimensional space. We used the Euclidean distance as it seemed to produce slightly
                        clearer results. Figure 3 shows how tSNE behaves for 
                        different values of \(ϵ\), while Figure 4 displays the results of UMAP with varying 
                        \(𝑛\) and \(𝑑_{min}\) values.

                     in two dimensions because we can draw these skeletons, using

                        knowledge descriptors derived from audiovisual and multimodal materials. Utilising
                        computer vision models, we extract and transform human 
                        poses and skeleton features into meaningful data features, which potentially foster
                        a range of usage scenarios. At the archival level, 
                        curators can operationalise their collections as “data sources” [<a class="ref" href="#kenderdine_mason_hibberd_2021">Kenderdine, Mason, and Hibberd 2021</a>], 
                        envisioning new ways for querying, annotating, and analysing whole datasets to forge
                        novel narrative paradigms. In parallel, the enriched 
                        metadata improves data accessibility while the diversified query channels improve
                        data findability, augmenting the archives' compliance with 
                        FAIR (findability, accessibility, interoperability, and reusability) data principles,
                        regardless of variations in language, topic, and data 
                        format. Furthermore, our approach demonstrates the potential for interpreting data
                        traits within and across cultural contexts. This not only 
                        contributes to the reusability of archival content but also resonates with the findings
                        of Colavizza et al., which highlight the growing role 
                        of AI in archival practices, particularly in the “automation of recordkeeping processes” and the improvement of 
                        procedures for “organising and accessing archives” [<a class="ref" href="#colavizza_et_al_2021">Colavizza et al. 2021</a>]. Our experimentation, as 
                        exemplified through two distinctive heritage archives, represents an innovative step
                        forward with a focus on embodied knowledge, allowing 
                        queries through more perceptive than quantitative channels, which we believe is more
                        natural and humanistic.

                        in “augmented archives”, provides a vast array of data 
                        that can further be processed in order to create new modes of access adapted for general
                        audiences. Following the principles of 
                        “generous interfaces” [<a class="ref" href="#whitelaw_2015">Whitelaw 2015</a>], our method supports explorative behaviours, encouraging a 
                        new paradigm of “seeking the unknown” [<a class="ref" href="#winters_prescott_2019">Winters and Prescott 2019</a>]. By laying out the full archive 
                        through the lens of easily understood concepts, such as dancers' postures, users can
                        more readily comprehend the archive without specific 
                        knowledge about the topic. Users do not need to have a specific goal in mind or be
                        looking for something in particular. Instead, they can 
                        wander around, browsing like an “information flaneur” and enjoying the Prix de Lausanne archive in a 
                        way that traditional modes of access, based on querying metadata or skimming grids
                        and lists of information, could not 
                        offer [<a class="ref" href="#dork_carpendale_williamson_2011">Dörk, Carpendale, and Williamson 2011</a>]. Furthermore, each pose links to a timestamp in a dance performance, grouping together
                        
                        similar poses in the low-dimensional space to create serendipitous discoveries. Indeed,
                        this mode of access rewards users for simply browsing 
                        the collection and stumbling upon new performances as they move from pose to pose
                        on the map. Figure 8 explicates this process by showcasing 
                        poses similar to an input pose with the corresponding video frames.

                     <div class="ptext" id="p35">This new mode of access is enhanced by dimensionality reduction algorithms. However,
                        one must take care in deciding which algorithm to employ 
                        and with what parameters. In this work, we have analysed Principal Component Analysis
                        (PCA), t-distributed Stochastic Neighbour Embedding 
                        (tSNE), and Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP). PCA is a well-established
                        dimensionality reduction technique, but, due to 
                        its linear nature, it often fails to properly capture a real-life dataset with only
                        a handful of dimensions. This is clearly confirmed in 
                        Figure 2, where all embeddings generated with tSNE and UMAP show much more interesting
                        structures without creating a large clump of points 
                        like PCA does. Regarding the choice of feature vectors used, as mentioned, we did
                        not observe noticeable differences between the flattened 
                        vectors of keypoints and the custom features computed. We hypothesise that the custom
                        features (reported in Table 1) are not more 
                        discriminative than the base keypoints. Although in subsequent analyses we decided
                        to use the flattened vectors of keypoints, we believe 
                        this offers us an opportunity for more collaboration, since involving dance experts
                        could help us craft a more precise and adequate set of 
                        features, based on Labanotation, for instance [<a class="ref" href="#guest_1977">Guest 1977</a>]. To gain a deeper understanding of these algorithms, we have 
                        investigated the effect of parameters on tSNE and UMAP.

                     <div class="ptext" id="p36">Figure 3 shows that increasing the perplexity yields very different layouts, with
                        lower values displaying numerous small groupings of items 
                        while higher values reveal more large-scale structures. This is in accordance with
                        expectations, since with higher perplexities tSNE considers 
                        more points when computing the vicinity of each item, thus better capturing global
                        structures. Surprisingly, in Figure 4, when increasing the 
                        number of neighbours (\(𝑛\)) considered with UMAP, the outputs appear to be much more stable, 
                        with global structures already visible with \(𝑛\) = 50. It is in this case that the second 
                        parameter, \(𝑑_{min}\), affects more the results, yielding more sprayed-out mappings the 
                        higher it is (since the minimum distance directly controls how packed the points can
                        be in the low dimensional space). These results indicate 
                        that when creating archive visualisations, Like the map of poses in Figure 5, for
                        instance, higher 
                        \(𝑑_{min}\) might be more suitable to avoid overlaps between similar poses. However, if one 
                        were to apply clustering algorithms on these embeddings to group together similar
                        poses, the more fine-grained and packed structures obtained 
                        with lower \(𝑑_{min}\) would potentially yield better results. Therefore, we argue that it is 
                        not a matter of which embedding is better overall but rather which embedding is better
                        adapted to the specific narrative or mode of access 
                        sought.

                        can be incorrectly estimated or missed due to the influence 
                        of occlusion, monotonous colour patterns, or camera angles, to name a few. Indeed,
                        through our “naive” approach to the Prix de 
                        Lausanne archive, we only achieved a detection rate of 76.80%.<a class="noteRef" href="#d4e1028">[7]</a> Furthermore, by checking a sample 
                        of skeletons extracted with the corresponding frames, as in Figure 8, we noticed that
                        keypoints were not always correctly extracted. One 
                        possible reason is that pose estimation was done systematically every five seconds
                        without a measure of quality or significance. Nevertheless, 
                        our approach proves sufficient for the use case described, as it still produces enough
                        data to map the whole archive properly. Further 
                        developments could yield more interesting and precise results, for instance, by extracting
                        skeleton data on a finer temporal granularity and 
                        then filtering only to keep the “better” poses.<a class="noteRef" href="#d4e1035">[8]</a>

                        measurements able to better capture and compare human bodies during dance performances.
                        Nonetheless, our results demonstrate that even naive 
                        methods can produce new modes of access to embodied knowledge archives. Thus, we are

                        directions will be pursued. First, based on the fundamental 
                        concept of placing visitors “inside” the archive [<a class="ref" href="#shen_et_al_2019">Shen et al. 2019</a>], rather than looking at it on a 
                        plain screen, immersive environments (IEs) will be employed to create situated experiences
                        in which users can navigate the whole archive. In 
                        practice, dimensionality reduction techniques will be employed to compute a mapping
                        in two- or three-dimensions in order to generate a virtual 
                        world in which each point or glyph represents a pose (and its corresponding frame
                        or clip). This virtual cloud of human bodies will then be 
                        displayed in large IEs, allowing visitors to freely navigate and discover the archive.
                        Applying immersive technologies to the mediation of 
                        cultural heritage already has some interesting applications, particularly in the context
                        of archaeological enquiry

                     contain important aspects of our cultures. Yet, it is still 
                     difficult to explore embodied knowledge archives, especially for more casual audiences
                     that lack specific knowledge on the topic of the 
                     collection. To answer this challenge, we have proposed in this work a computational
                     framework that leverages motion extraction AI to augment these 
                     datasets with a wealth of rich data, enabling new modes of analysis and access.

                  <div class="ptext" id="p44">The proposed method was applied to two embodied knowledge archives, containing dance
                     and martial arts performances, respectively, which showcases 
                     its application to multimedia content and diverse access scenarios. In the former
                     example, we devised a method to visualise a whole collection in 
                     two dimensions through the human poses embedded in the archival materials, revealing
                     their structure and fostering serendipitous discoveries. In 
                     the latter, we extended our method to motion encoding from static poses and devised
                     a motion-based query system, offering a new way to search an 
                     embodied knowledge archive. These scenarios showcase how our computational framework
                     can operationalise this type of collection and unlock a 
                     variety of new modes of access suitable for non-expert audiences.
