                  <p>With the burgeoning use of digital technologies in safeguarding intangible and living
                     heritage, memory institutions have produced a significant body 
                     of material yet to be made accessible for public transmission. The quest for new ways
                     to unlock these massive collections has intensified, 
                     especially in the case of embodied knowledge embedded in complex formats, such as
                     audiovisual and motion capture data.
                     </p>
                  
                  <p>Aiming to address the gap between living heritage archives and embodied knowledge
                     experience, this work inspects a computational framework 
                     incorporating machine intelligence, archival science, and digital museology. By reflecting
                     on how embodied knowledge is sustained and potentially 
                     valorised through human interaction, we devise a series of methods utilising vision-based
                     feature extraction, pose estimation, movement analysis, 
                     and machine learning. The goal is to augment the archival experience with new modes
                     of exploration, representation, and embodiment.
                     </p>
                  
                  <p>This article reports the computational procedures and algorithmic tools inspected
                     through two use cases. In the first example, we visualise the 
                     archives of the Prix de Lausanne, a collection of 50 years of video recordings of dance performances, for archival
                     exploration through 
                     the dancers' poses. In another experiment, movement encoding is employed to allow
                     multimodal data search via embodied cues in the 
                     Hong Kong Martial Arts Living Archive, a comprehensive documentation of the living heritage of martial arts that is chiefly
                     comprised 
                     of motion-captured performances by masters.
                     </p>
                  
                  <p>Though holding different application purposes, both projects operate on the proposed
                     framework and extract archive-specific features to create a 
                     meaningful representation of human bodies, which reveals the versatile applications
                     that computational capacities can achieve for embodied knowledge 
                     archives. The practices also represent a model of interdisciplinary involvement where
                     the archivists, computists, artists, and knowledge holders 
                     join hands to renew strategies for archival exploration and heritage interpretation
                     in a new light.

                     diversity of human creativity and collective heritage, as defined by UNESCO. The preservation and exploration of living heritage 
                     has been of paramount importance in understanding and celebrating the cultural fabric
                     of our society. To further enhance our engagement with this 
                     heritage, advancements in digital technologies have opened new possibilities for capturing

                  <div class="ptext" id="p2">In recent years, there has been a growing trend in the digital capturing of living
                     heritage and embodied knowledge 
                     [<a class="ref" href="#hou_et_al_2022">Hou et al. 2022</a>]. These endeavours aim to document and preserve not only physical artefacts but also
                     the intangible aspects of 
                     culture, such as rituals, performances, and traditional practices. However, GLAM sectors,
                     encompassing galleries, libraries, archives, and 
                     museums, face significant challenges in effectively managing and providing access
                     to these vast digital repositories

                  <div class="ptext" id="p3">One of the key challenges faced by GLAM sectors is the sheer scale of digitised collections.
                     As more and more heritage materials are digitised, 
                     the volume of data grows exponentially, making it increasingly difficult to navigate
                     and explore these archives manually and essentially turning 
                     these collections into “dark archives” inaccessible to the public. Giovanna Fossati et al. further highlight how 
                     non-expert audiences are in need of more intuitive modes of access to discover these
                     collections [<a class="ref" href="#fossati_et_al_2012">Fossati et al. 2012</a>]. To address 
                     this challenge, recent research has embarked on applying computational analysis, artificial
                     intelligence (AI) in particular, to unlock various 
                     new modes of archival experience. Leveraging the transformative potential of AI<a class="noteRef" href="#d4e244">[1]</a>, we

                     data science and GLAM sectors, highlighted through 
                     various uses cases on the implementation of AI strategies in Swedish heritage organizations

                     archival experience of embodied knowledge. Our approach 
                     intends to extract human movements in the form of skeleton data and process it, showing
                     its versatility through multiple use cases. By 
                     revalorizing and visualising knowledge, memory, and experience, we strive to enhance
                     the cognitive reception and engagement of users, ultimately 
                     improving the overall archival user experience. Our experiments are conducted on two
                     exemplar collections: the archives of the 
                     Prix de Lausanne, comprising an audiovisual dataset of dance performances, and the Hong Kong Martial Arts Living Archive 
                     (HKMALA), which contains both videos and motion capture recordings of Hong Kong martial arts performers. This work might be of 
                     interest to professionals of cultural heritage institutions wishing to explore new
                     methods of access to their collections, as well as researchers

                        heritage (ICH) is inherently living and manifests 
                        through bodily expressions, individual practices, and social enactment — on the multiple
                        layers of embodiment. Recent research has revealed a

                        transforming intangible practices into tangible 
                        choreographic objects. For instance, the i-Treasures project (2013-2017) works to
                        digitize the living heritage of folk dances, folk singing, 
                        craftsmanship, and contemporary music composition in an attempt to sustain traditional
                        know-how via creative presentation

                        Terpsichore project (2016 to 2020) integrates computational models, such as semantic
                        web technologies and machine learning, with storytelling

                        Forsythe's Performative Archive, recently acquired by the ZKM Center for Art and Media Karlsruhe. While its focus differs 
                        from the performing arts, the Hong Kong Martial Arts Living Archive (HKMALA) project (2012-present) forges a multimodal digital 
                        archiving paradigm by motion-capturing martial art sequence performances of renowned
                        masters. The motion-captured (MoCap) records are 
                        situated within a digital collation capturing different facets of Hong Kong's martial arts traditions, encompassing rituals, 
                        histories, re-enactments, and stories of practitioners [<a class="ref" href="#chao_et_al_2018">Chao et al. 2018</a>].

                        result-driven examinations, the ideal usage of such data should facilitate a new mode

                        archives, with the main difference in the first step: 
                        extracting human poses. Indeed, when working with videos, human pose estimation models
                        such as OpenPose [<a class="ref" href="#cao_et_al_2019">Cao et al. 2019</a>] 
                        are required to extract human postures in the form of a “skeleton”, or a list of keypoint edge pairs, as defined in the COCO dataset 
                        [<a class="ref" href="#lin_et_al_2014">Lin et al. 2014</a>]. Depending on the model, these can be in two or three dimensions and handle single
                        or multiple persons at the 
                        same time. Furthermore, we stress that these models can sometimes fail to accurately
                        detect full bodies, especially in situations where part 
                        of the body is occluded. The number of key points detected can also impact how much
                        these models are able to capture features specific to a 
                        certain discipline. While MoCap data generally comes with skeleton information, post-processing,
                        normalisation, and format conversion are 
                        often necessary to produce clean and operable skeleton datasets.

                        believe these additional features help to better capture 
                        specific poses of dance performances, where even the positions of the hands and feet
                        are crucial. Videos were processed to extract one pose 
                        every five seconds, a cautious design decision to avoid over-collecting similar poses
                        merely due to temporal closeness. We do note however 
                        this is potentially not the best solution to ensure a full coverage of the diversity
                        of poses, and future research in this direction could 
                        improve the results presented even further. It is worth noting that not all frames
                        necessarily had a detected pose, since in some cases the 
                        dancer was too far away from the camera, or because some videos were not properly
                        cut to the exact dance performance and thus had irrelevant 
                        frames at the beginning and/or the end. We measured the rate of detection by taking
                        the mean of the ratio of poses detected over the number of 
                        frames per video, obtaining a mean detection rate of 76.80% across all the videos.
                        The pose extraction process resulted in a total of 27,672 
                        poses.

                     <div class="ptext" id="p18">Once these poses had been extracted, we normalised them following a two-step procedure.
                        We first subtracted the pose centre, defined as the 
                        mean point between the left and right hips. We then scaled the pose by its size, defined
                        as the maximum between the torso size and the maximum 
                        distance between the pose centre and any key point, where the torso size was computed
                        as the distance between the centre of the shoulders and 
                        the pose centre (the centre of the hips). The procedure ensures meaningful comparison
                        between the poses by normalising them. An intuitive 
                        sample of normalised poses with their corresponding frames is provided in Figure 1.

                     <div class="ptext" id="p20">One of the fundamental applications unlocked by computational archives is the possibility
                        to visualise whole collections. To this end, we 
                        apply dimensionality reduction (DR) algorithms to embed the high-dimensional feature
                        spaces in two or three dimensions, in order to create a 
                        novel way of visualising and navigating the whole archive. We tested both standard
                        DR methods, such as Principal Component Analysis (PCA), 
                        and t-distributed Stochastic Neighbour Embedding (tSNE), as well as a more recent
                        approach, Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection 
                        (UMAP). We leveraged scikit-learn implementations for the two first algorithms and
                        the official UMAP Python implementation for the latter 
                        [<a class="ref" href="#pedregosa_et_al_2011">Pedregosa et al. 2011</a>] [<a class="ref" href="#halko_martinsson_tropp_2011">Halko, Martinsson, and Tropp 2011</a>] [<a class="ref" href="#martinsson_rokhlin_tvgert_2011">Martinsson, Rokhlin, and Tvgert 2011</a>]

                        metrics as the distance measure to compute the projection. We therefore tested five
                        options on 27,672 poses, with both sets of feature 
                        vectors. Figure 2 shows the resulting embeddings in two dimensions.

                     <div class="ptext" id="p21">We can immediately observe that PCA performs poorly on this dataset, as expected due
                        to its linear nature that cannot preserve much variance 
                        with just two dimensions (only 49% with the flattened vectors of key points and 45%
                        with the custom features). Both tSNE and UMAP, however, 
                        give much more interesting results, where structures in the dataset can be observed.
                        Since we did not observe meaningful differences between 
                        the two sets of feature vectors used, we pursued further examinations with the flattened
                        vectors of keypoints to exploit the heuristic 
                        quality of the algorithms independent of the choice of features. Therefore, we set
                        out to investigate tSNE and UMAP behaviours in more depth 
                        by studying the effects of their hyperparameters. For tSNE, we observed how the embedding
                        in two dimensions behaves for different 
                        perplexities (\(ϵ\)), the main parameter for this algorithm, related to the number of 
                        neighbours considered for any given point during the computation. For UMAP, we investigated
                        the number of nearest neighbours 
                        (\(𝑛\)), controlling how UMAP balances local versus global structure in the data, as well
                        as 
                        the minimum distance (\(𝑑_{min}\)) the algorithm is allowed to pack points together in the 
                        low-dimensional space. We used the Euclidean distance as it seemed to produce slightly
                        clearer results. Figure 3 shows how tSNE behaves for 
                        different values of \(ϵ\), while Figure 4 displays the results of UMAP with varying 
                        \(𝑛\) and \(𝑑_{min}\) values.

                     thus operating on individual frames of the moving image recordings. For the purpose
                     of visualising the whole archive in two dimensions, this is suitable as we can draw
                     these skeletons, using them as glyphs representing frames in the collection, to create
                     compelling images as in Figure 5     . However, one might argue that embodied knowledge
                     archives are not only about human postures but also (if not more) about human motions.
                     This second use case thus investigates such an approach, proposing an innovative motion-based
                     retrieval mode. In the context of the Hong Kong Martial Arts Living Archive (HKMALA)

                        (or known as or <span class="hi italic">taolu</span>). Since its origination in 2012, HKMALA has built a 4D motion archive spanning over

                        codified movement sequences to practise fundamental techniques and technique combinations.
                        While less known, yet equally important, is the stress on combative tactics that involve
                        a mindful operation of whole-body movement. Thus, training is imparted through a combination
                        of freeform combats and integration into <span class="hi italic">taolu</span> practices (Ma, 2003). Given that assessment methods in Chinese martial arts typically
                        consider visually discernible characteristics and mechanical parameters, we apply
                        the same configurations to model martial arts movement. Designed in compatibility

                        is common to expect metadata organisation in an archive-specific curatorial structure
                        with topical domain-language descriptions about the archival items. For instance,
                        both the Prix de Lausanne and HKMALA collections warrant a series of textual tags
                        indicating the content of dance and martial art performances and additional descriptions
                        providing knowledge about the performers. Such documentation, although resourceful,
                        entails a mode of interpretation and access rather limited to expert users. One needs
                        to know what dance performances <span class="hi italic">The Giselle </span>or <span class="hi italic">Nutcracker </span>are to look for them in the archive, or understand how martial arts are grounded on
                        a series of <span class="hi italic">taolu</span>. Furthermore, visual and embodied features are difficult to capture verbally. Even
                        though models like Labanotation have been developed to describe movement components,
                        especially in performing arts, they require a reasonably deep understanding of the
                        knowledge in order to encode and decode. Hence, it is arguably very hard, if not impossible,
                        to capture embodied knowledge features into literal formats or in an easily accessible
                        way. Therefore, this kind of metadata, although necessary and useful in many domains,
                        is not suitable for access to the general public. It does not support “casual modes
                        of access”, fundamentals for museum-goers and general audiences (Whitelaw et al.,
                        2015).</div>

                        derived from audiovisual and multimodal materials.      Utilising computer vision

                        data extractions, which potentially foster a range of usage scenarios     . At the
                        archival level, curators can operationalise      their collections as ‘’data sources’’
                        (Kenderdine et al., 2021),      envisioning new ways for querying, annotating and
                        analysing whole datasets to forge novel narrative paradigms.     . In parallel, the
                        enriched metadata improves data accessibility and diversified query channels improve
                        data findability, augmenting the archives' compliance with FAIR (findability, accessibility,
                        interoperability, and reusability) data principles, regardless of variations in language,
                        topics, and data formats. Furthermore, our approach demonstrates the potential for

                        on embodied knowledge, allowing queries through more perceptive than quantitative

                        in order to create new modes of access adapted for general audiences. Following the
                        principles of “generous interfaces” (Whitelaw et al., 2015), our method supports explorative
                        behaviours, encouraging a new paradigm of “seeking the unknown” and avoiding the tendency
                        of only searching for what is known (Winters and Prescott, 2019). By laying out the
                        full archive through the lens of humanly understandable concepts such as postures
                        taken by the dancers, users can more easily comprehend the archive, without needing
                        specific knowledge about this topic. They do not need to have a specific goal in mind
                        or to be looking for something in particular. They can wander around, browsing like
                        an “information flaneur” (Dörk et al., 2011), enjoying the Prix de Lausanne archive
                        in a way that traditional modes of access, based on querying through the metadata
                        information or on grid-like and lists visualisations, could not offer. Furthermore,
                        each pose links to a timestamp in a dance performance, and thus by grouping together
                        similar poses in the low-dimensional space, the dimensionality reduction also creates
                        serendipitous discoveries. Indeed, this mode of access rewards users for simply browsing
                        the collection and stumbling upon new performances as they move from a pose to their
                        neighbours on the map. Figure 8 explicates this process by showcasing poses similar
                        to an input pose with the corresponding video frames.</div>

                        Neighbour Embedding and Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection. PCA is a well-established
                        dimensionality reduction technique, but, due to its linear nature, it often fails
                        to properly capture a real-life dataset with only a handful of dimensions. This is
                        clearly confirmed in Figure 2, where all embeddings generated with tSNE and UMAP show
                        much more interesting structures without creating a large clump of points like PCA.
                        Regarding the choice of feature vectors used, as mentioned, we fail to observe noticeable
                        differences between the flattened vectors of keypoints and the custom features computed.
                        We hypothesise the custom features (reported in Table 1) are not more discriminative
                        than the base keypoints. In subsequent analysis, we decided to use the flattened vectors
                        of keypoints, but we believe this offers us an opportunity for more collaboration,
                        since involving dance experts could help in crafting a more precise and adequate set
                        of features, based on Labanotation for instance (Guest, 1977). To gain a deeper understanding
                        of these algorithms, we have investigated the effect of parameters on tSNE and UMAP.</div>
                     
                     <div class="counter"><a href="#p36">36</a></div>
                     <div class="ptext" id="p36">Figure 3 shows that increasing the perplexity yields very different layouts, with
                        lower values displaying numerous small groupings of items while higher values reveal
                        more large-scale structures. This is in accordance with expectations, since with higher
                        perplexities tSNE considers more points when computing the vicinity of each item,
                        thus better capturing global structures. Surprisingly, when increasing the number
                        of neighbours <span class="hi italic">𝑛</span> considered with UMAP in Figure 4, the outputs appear to be much more stable, with
                        global structures already visible with <span class="hi italic">𝑛</span> = 50. It is in this case the second parameter, <span class="hi italic">𝑑</span>𝑚𝑖𝑛, that affects more the results, yielding more sprayed-out mappings the higher
                        it is (since the minimum distance directly controls how packed the points can be in
                        the low dimensional space). These results indicate that when creating archive visualisation
                        like the map of poses in Figure 5, for instance, higher <span class="hi italic">𝑑</span>𝑚𝑖𝑛 might be more suitable to avoid overlaps between similar poses. However, if one
                        were to apply clustering algorithms on these embeddings to group together similar
                        poses, the more fine-grained and packed structures obtained with lower <span class="hi italic">𝑑</span>𝑚𝑖𝑛 would potentially yield better results. Therefore, we argue it is not a matter
                        of which embedding is better but rather which embedding is more adapted to the specific
                        narrative or mode of access sought.</div>

                     <div class="ptext" id="p37">Although we believe our computational framework to be well thought out, there are
                        still some limitations we would like to highlight, to hopefully later address them.</div>

                     <div class="ptext" id="p38">First, human pose extraction from monocular videos is never perfect. Human bodies
                        can be wrongfully estimated or missed due to the influence of occlusion, monotonous
                        colour patterns, and camera angles, to name a few. Indeed, through our “naive” approach
                        to the Prix de Lausanne Archive, we only achieve a detection rate of 76.80%.<a class="noteRef" href="#d4e883">[6]</a> Furthermore, by checking a sample of skeletons extracted with the corresponding frames
                        as in Figure 8, we noticed that sometimes keypoints were not correctly extracted.
                        One possible reason is that the pose estimation is done systematically every five
                        seconds without a measure of their quality or significance. Nevertheless, our approach
                        proves sufficient for the use case described, as it still produces enough data to
                        map the whole archive properly. Further developments could yield more interesting
                        and precise results, for instance, by extracting skeleton data on a finer temporal
                        granularity and then filtering only to keep the “better” poses.<a class="noteRef" href="#d4e885">[7]</a></div>

                     <div class="ptext" id="p39">Second, the feature vectors computed for the Prix de Lausanne are somewhat naive.
                        Taking the lesson from the HKMALA feature computing, collaboration with dance experts
                        could facilitate the design of more relevant dance-specific features with precise
                        measurements able to better capture and compare human bodies during dance performances.
                        Nonetheless, our results demonstrate that even naive methods can produce new modes
                        of access to embodied knowledge archives. Thus, we are confident our method generalises
                        well to other archives and diverse embodied disciplines.</div>

                        to evaluating the distribution and quality of embeddings, supplemented with an ad-hoc
                        expert review of small sampling sets. Future improvement is suggested to integrate
                        expert review dynamically along with the model training process, such as by intaking
                        expert judgement as a score and feeding it back to the model, so as to enable a human-in-the-loop

                     <div class="ptext" id="p41">The research presented in this paper has been conducted within the larger context
                        of “computational museology” (Kenderdine et al., 2021), a discipline whose goal is
                        to develop new modes of access to cultural heritage through computational approaches,
                        specifically designed for situated experiences in museum settings. To this end, further
                        work will rely on leveraging the findings highlighted in this paper to create interactive
                        installations to access these embodied knowledge archives. We contend the implementation
                        presented in this paper establishes a robust foundation for developing interactive
                        modes of access tailored to meet the requirements of casual users within situated
                        experiences.  In particular, two main directions will be pursued.     On one hand,
                        based on the fundamental concept of placing visitors “inside” the archive (Shen et
                        al., 2019) rather than looking at it on a plain screen, immersive environments (IEs)
                        will be employed to create situated experiences in which users can navigate the whole
                        archive. In practice, dimensionality reduction techniques will be employed to compute
                        a mapping in two or three dimensions in order to generate a virtual world in which
                        each point, or glyph, represents a pose (and its corresponding frame, or clip). This
                        virtual cloud of human bodies will then be displayed in large IEs, allowing visitors
                        to freely navigate and discover the archive. Applying immersive technologies to the
                        mediation of cultural heritage already has some interesting applications, in particular
                        in the context of archeological enquiry (Sciuto et al., 2023), and we believe such
                        technologies can also serve a purpose for Embodied Knowledge archives.</div>

                     <div class="ptext" id="p42">On the other hand, an interactive retrieval system can be developed, either based
                        on pose or motion similarity. Users could strike a pose or perform a certain movement,
                        detected in real-time with motion-tracking solutions, and the system would retrieve
                        relevant clips from the collection. Such an experience would yield an interesting
                        performative aspect that sees the visitor as a co-creator with the machine, essentially
                        transforming them into a variable of the generative system, and other people around
                        as an audience, witnessing the exchange in a “third-person’s perspective” (Mul and

                     for more casual audiences that lack specific knowledge on the topic of the collection.
                     To answer this challenge, we have proposed in this work a computational framework
                     that leverages motion extraction AI to augment these datasets with a wealth of rich

                     its structure and fostering serendipitous discoveries. On the latter, we extend to
                     motion encoding from static poses and devise a motion-based query system, offering
                     a new way to search an embodied knowledge archive. These scenarios showcase how our
