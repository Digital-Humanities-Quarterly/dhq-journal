                  <p>This paper argues that digital humanities pedagogy can provide unique forms of
                     attention and engagement for students at the outset of their college and
                     university careers. It reports on courses taught at NC State University and
                     elsewhere which use digital humanities pedagogy under the aegis of studying
                     transformations in “reading.” With attention to the mediation of attention
                     itself, these courses can cultivate habits of self-reflection to aid students in
                     any disciplinary pathway. Furthermore, digital humanities pedagogy can offer a
                     transferable project-based model of instruction, helping students to develop
                     metacognitive skills as well as to acculturate to different environments across
                     campus. Ultimately, this essay underscores the need to articulate strategies of
                     educational transfer in digital pedagogy.

               <div class="ptext" id="p1">Look around the penumbra of digital humanities pedagogy and you’ll find abundant
                  attention to reading. Courses in book futurism, text technologies, and mediated
                  reading practices show up frequently in what many digital humanists, however
                  identified, are teaching. Consider just a few recent examples: Kari Kraus, “Book 2.0: The History of the Book and the Future of
                  Reading” (University of Maryland, 2012), Mark Sample, “History and Future of the Book” (Davidson College, 2014),
                  Ryan Cordell, “Technologies of Text” (Northeastern
                  University, 2014), Rita Raley, “Distracted Reading”
                  (UCLA, 2015), Andrew Logemann, “The Future of Reading”
                  (Gordon College, 2016), not to mention, beyond individual courses, the numerous
                  assignments and instructional resources that support such interests.<a class="noteRef" href="#d4e210">[1]</a> Many of these courses
                  express their instructors’ disciplinary backgrounds in writing and rhetoric, library
                  science, book history, or media studies, but their reach is even broader. As Rachel
                  Buurma suggests with her entry on “Reading” in the volume
                  <cite class="title italic">Digital Humanities Pedagogy</cite>, changes prompted by
                  digital technologies raise “a new
                  pedagogical challenge for teachers whose fundamental charge is to teach students
                  ‘how to read’,” compassing teachers and courses
                  across an educational spectrum [<a class="ref" href="#buurma2015">Buurma 2015</a>].
               </div>
               
               <div class="counter"><a href="#p2">2</a></div>
               <div class="ptext" id="p2">Questions about technologies and how we read also aim at the looming problem of
                  attention itself. Numerous scholarly and popular commentators have described how
                  modes of attention are changing, for better and worse, in the digital age. In her
                  book <cite class="title italic">How We Think</cite>, N. Katherine Hayles glosses an
                  extensive literature on distraction and cognition and, in response, proposes that
                  we
                  take multiple configurations of “reading” as inspiration for designing new
                  courses, curricula, and collaborative research opportunities. Hayles urges teachers
                  to approach human attention “both as a
                  design strategy and as a conceptual framework,” or as both form and
                  content [<a class="ref" href="#hayles2012">Hayles 2012</a>, 12]. Among Hayles’s specific
                  recommendations include a comparative media studies approach, project-based
                  instruction, and classrooms that connect to multiple collaborative spaces offline
                  and on. Courses on reading have developed all of these opportunities in the service
                  of digital humanities pedagogy.

               <div class="ptext" id="p3">Such courses might help orient students to a university education more broadly. This
                  work often falls to first-year experience (FYE) courses, common reading programs,
                  or
                  learning communities which transition students to the diverse community and habits
                  of mind of the college experience [<a class="ref" href="#ferguson2006">Ferguson 2006</a>]
                  [<a class="ref" href="#lang2007">Lang 2007</a>]. These experiences often attempt to nurture students’
                  curiosity, interdisciplinary thinking, and participation in a community in “which they are not likely to have
                  imagined themselves as members”
                   [<a class="ref" href="#moser2010">Moser 2010</a>, 92] (see also [<a class="ref" href="#colarulli1990">Colarulli and McDaniel 1990</a>]). Courses on “reading” can meet
                  many of these same goals with their disciplinary openness, emphasis on collaborative
                  praxis, and student reflections on the very conditions of their learning. A digital
                  humanities pedagogy might do even better, turning attention not only to the evolving
                  platforms for reading, but to the institutional spaces in which entering college
                  students can find support and even inspiration for their own work beyond the course.
                  In this essay, I want to show how these courses can bridge disciplines and connect
                  different learning spaces on campus. Such an approach extends the work of knowledge
                  creation beyond the classroom community to other spaces and professionals,
                  especially in the library, and thereby enriches students’ sense of the distributed
                  facilities and extra-disciplinary partnerships which might contribute to their
                  academic and social goals during their college career.

               <div class="ptext" id="p4">Ultimately, I want to emphasize the potential for <em class="emph">transfer</em> in digital
                  humanities pedagogy. Transfer is commonly defined as learners’ ability to recognize
                  when and how their skills, store of knowledge, or critical thinking strategies might
                  apply in different domains [<a class="ref" href="#perkins1988">Perkins and Salomon 1988</a>, 22–23]. For example,
                  when a composition student uses principles of reasoned argument in their writing for
                  another course. Yet transfer is a complex phenomenon. Recently, scholars of transfer
                  have emphasized such properties as adaptation, enculturation, repurposing, and
                  transformation [<a class="ref" href="#wardle2013">Wardle 2013</a>]
                  [<a class="ref" href="#moore2017">Moore 2017</a>]
                  [<a class="ref" href="#anson2017">Anson and Moore 2017</a>]. Transfer is the subject of extensive research in
                  education, cognitive psychology, and composition studies, yet it rarely appears, or
                  shows up in other guises, in discussions of digital humanities pedagogy, <em class="emph">even
                     though transfer may be one of DH’s most powerful claims as an educational
                     experience</em>. As Anne B. McGrail suggests: “Transfer happens best in the context
                  of integrative learning. Understanding is developed across disciplinary
                  boundaries and likely to be retained across contexts. Because DH is
                  collaborative and cross-disciplinary, engaging multiple knowledges at once,
                  it is more likely to create knowledge transfer”
                   [<a class="ref" href="#mcgrail2016">McGrail 2016</a>, 20]. Rebecca Frost Davis agrees that “digital projects, networks,
                  communities, and resources provide ample opportunities for students to
                  transfer their learning”
                   [<a class="ref" href="#davis2017">Davis 2017</a>, 36]. Courses on reading may sharpen the focus on knowledge transfer in DH, in
                  part by helping students “become acquainted with the problem of
                  transfer in itself”
                   [<a class="ref" href="#perkins1988">Perkins and Salomon 1988</a>, 30]. In other words, attention to mediated attention (“reading”) asks
                  students to reflect upon their own processes of learning and, better still, to
                  access and design new parameters for their own education, whether within a
                  discipline, across domains, or in concert with new spaces, persons, and
                  partnerships. If courses about reading are timely in the context of digital
                  transformations, they also offer early-career students a timely exploration of their
                  own learning ecology, helping them to realize and tactically access the knowledge
                  work beyond their curricular strictures.

                  <div class="ptext" id="p5">For the past several years at NC State University, I have experimented with
                     courses about reading as a first-year seminar experience for our university’s
                     honors program. A seminar is required of all first-year students in the program,
                     intended to engage students in “discovery, inquiry, and creativity” across a variety of disciplines
                     [<a class="ref" href="#seminars2014">"Seminars" 2014</a>]. As an FYE, it helps cultivate community by
                     bringing students from all sorts of different academic tracks. My own courses
                     have included large proportions of students from engineering and the sciences,
                     with only a few from the humanities and social sciences and precisely none from
                     my home department of English. That mixed disciplinary enrollment comes by
                     design, intended to enculturate students into new academic communities, broaden
                     their sense of research possibilities, and, more implicitly, to help them
                     cultivate strategies for transfer, or what the program calls “the integration and appreciation
                     of knowledge across disciplines”

                     students — and especially engineering students — to an interdisciplinary context

                     which these courses hope to foster (e.g. between design and biology).
                     Furthermore, as Ryan Cordell has persuasively argued, “digital humanities”
                     as such does not capture the undergraduate imagination, and ought instead to be
                     integrated into undergraduate programs it can positively impact [<a class="ref" href="#cordell2016">Cordell 2016</a>]. Cordell refashioned his Intro to DH course into an
                     upper-level experience in the English major. I kept the introductory framework
                     to serve first years while opening the subject to questions of “Reading in the Digital Age” — the course’s initial
                     title. Like many of the courses this essay mentions at the outset, mine explores
                     how historical and contemporary mediums reshape meaning, how modes of attention
                     change alongside, and how we might creatively and critically design our own
                     interventions in this landscape. We sample from ongoing academic research and
                     try creative activities that span book history, media studies, digital
                     humanities, electronic literature, and critical making. But those areas are not
                     the course’s avowed topic. Rather, they allow for multiple disciplinary pathways
                     and the hands-on, project-based, integrative learning that undergirds knowledge
                     transfer [<a class="ref" href="#mcgrail2016">McGrail 2016</a>, 20].

                     inspired by Stephen Ramsay’s eponymous book, by the appeal to the mechanisms or
                     materiality of media in Kirschenbaum’s work, and by the name’s potential appeal
                     to students coming to NC State for STEM [<a class="ref" href="#ramsay2011">Ramsay 2011</a>]

                     might more properly be called “comparative textual media (CTM)” as proposed by Hayles and Jessica
                     Pressman [<a class="ref" href="#hayles2013">Hayles 2013</a>, vii]. It endeavors to pursue the
                     “productive tension and
                     interplay” among analysis, critique, and “an ethic of making” that Hayles and Pressman
                     identify as CTM’s distinctive paradigm and that, I will argue, also encourages
                     transfer [<a class="ref" href="#hayles2013">Hayles 2013</a>, xv]. In what follows, I will explain
                     how the course works and, by extension, how digital humanities pedagogy can
                     stimulate transfer at multiple levels.

                  <div class="ptext" id="p8">Few students enter the class knowing what its title means or what kind of class
                     they’re in for. Few have any experience in critical media analysis. Many of
                     these high-achieving students worry about uncertain expectations or their lack
                     of skills. This challenge is endemic to any intro to digital humanities course.
                     To get students involved, much less to establish the conditions for transfer,
                     depends on something like what Nancy Sommers and Laura Saltz have identified
                     about first-year writing. When do students start thinking <em class="emph">with</em>
                     writing, rather than just completing a writing assignment? In what circumstances
                     do they continue to use what they’ve learned, as opposed to clearing a course
                     requirement and moving on? According to Sommers and Saltz, this transformation
                     occurs when students are encouraged “to see themselves as novices” including “an open attitude to instruction
                     and feedback, [and] a willingness to experiment”
                      [<a class="ref" href="#sommers2004">Sommers and Saltz 2004</a>, 134]. Comparative textual media requires an almost continuous apprenticeship
                     to new and old contexts — for students as well as the instructor. Indeed,
                     digital humanities pedagogy often puts the instructor and students on the same
                     playing field, experimenting together on questions or methods for which neither
                     definitive answers nor expertise may exist.<a class="noteRef" href="#d4e401">[2]</a> Sommers and Saltz also found that writing mattered more to
                     students when they felt like they were “entering a live debate” which honored their own
                     perspectives, approaches, and projects as contributions to the discussion [<a class="ref" href="#sommers2004">Sommers and Saltz 2004</a>, 137]. Certainly debates about reading and media
                     are both current and lively, connecting students’ experiences to the evolving
                     questions of pundits, journalists, and scholars across different domains. Both
                     frameworks — the novice and the interlocutor — take work to develop, and depend
                     significantly on establishing trust and mutual respect.

                  <div class="ptext" id="p9">A course about reading, or about forms of attention, does not aim for expert
                     knowledge. Instead, it makes students reflect, turning their own experiences
                     into the subject matter of the course. In Hayles’s terms, it makes human
                     attention the design strategy as well as conceptual framework of the course [<a class="ref" href="#hayles2012">Hayles 2012</a>, 12]. In terms of the conceptual framework, many
                     of the exercises in “Reading Machines” simply aim to
                     get students to notice and explain “the critical insight of media
                     studies[:] that we should not separate medium from meaning”
                      [<a class="ref" href="#hayles2013">Hayles 2013</a>, 201]. As Hayles suggests, this is best accomplished by blending instructional
                     styles: students analyze texts, experiment with hands-on practice, and explore
                     different collaborative spaces. Students should also be encouraged to reflect,
                     in informal as well as structured ways, about all of these course experiences.
                     Reflection underscores time and again the self-critical awareness at the heart
                     of comparative textual analysis. David Levy has described similar
                     “mindfulness” techniques for assessing and making
                     strategic changes to one’s uses of personal technology. Levy’s exercises
                     encourage attention to lived experiences of technology beyond the false binary
                     of whether or not Google is making us stupid [<a class="ref" href="#levy2016">Levy 2016</a>, 12].
                     Students must attend both to “task
                     focus” and to “self
                     observation,” developing habits of critical reflection as well as
                     metacognitive monitoring [<a class="ref" href="#levy2016">Levy 2016</a>, 4].

                  <div class="ptext" id="p10">What this looks like in the classroom varies according to instructor and
                     institution. In our course, we undertake several weeks of comparing platforms
                     for reading. We sample a single text in different formats including paperback,
                     on the Kindle, through the speed-reading browser plugin Spritz, and using a
                     web-based social reading and annotation platform. Along the way, students are
                     asked to read recent critical discussion about changes to reading, as well as to
                     respond to reflection prompts in their course journal. They also try assignments
                     that use other modalities, such as capturing data about and then visualizing
                     their own media diet, as well as hands-on exercises in craft. Bringing craft
                     into the classroom can really amplify attention to attention. Levy — who himself
                     took a two-year break from the tech world to study calligraphy — claims that
                     craft demands its own mode of attention to the “interaction between body, materials,
                     and […] emerging forms”
                      [<a class="ref" href="#levy2016">Levy 2016</a>, x]. Pairing analysis with craft, theory with practice, can powerfully aid
                     the teaching of media analysis. For example, when we read about the fate of
                     handwriting in schools or a scholarly article about the different cognitive
                     circuits that handwriting might operate, we also try an exercise writing with
                     feather quills and ink on rag paper, sometimes with a guest visit from a
                     colleague who speaks about paleography. Inspired by assignments like Cordell’s
                     lab “Simulating the Scriptorium” and Jeffrey Makala’s
                     “Reading by Candlelight,” this exercise slightly
                     differs in asking students to compose “artisanal tweets” that
                     they subsequently post somewhere on campus. Afterwards, students reflect in
                     their journal on the materiality and experience of writing, as well as what they
                     learn from the distortions of simulating new media with old. When the class
                     listens to a portion of an audiobook, they also produce their own 1-2 minute
                     recorded snippet of our course text. Beforehand, we discuss the requirements of
                     a good performance, tuning the body as a speaking instrument with attention to
                     speed, cadence, facial expression, and posture. The experience of listening to
                     audiobooks usually encourages students to reflect on attention and distraction.
                     The attempt to actually craft a recording — with the option of sharing it with
                     the class — shifts their focus to the labor of voice actors, the ambient noises
                     of their own environments, and how their vocal embodiment might affect a
                     listeners’ experience or even trigger their prejudices.

                  <div class="ptext" id="p11">Exploring the book as a physical object can also deepen students’ attention to
                     things, interfaces, and uses of mediums. Like other classes, including Joanna
                     Swafford’s at SUNY New Paltz, we have scoured our library stacks for marginalia
                     to submit to the BookTraces project [<a class="ref" href="#swafford2014">Swafford 2014</a>]. The exercise
                     also offers the class an opportunity to hear from a librarian about the
                     collection itself: how did these books even get to the stacks, how has that
                     collection changed, and why? Thinking about the contingent circumstances not
                     only of marginal writing, but of the books themselves, deepens in a subsequent
                     visit to NC State’s Hunt Library, where practically the entire print collection
                     (1.5 million volumes) has been transferred to high, gleaming rows of aluminum
                     storage boxes, fetched by industrial robots (aka the bookBot). The rest of the
                     library comprises numerous spaces for casual and collaborative use. Now these
                     very spaces become the focus of our attention, as we walk through with the
                     library’s user experience director, discussing how its architects and experience
                     planners designed spaces for different kinds of interaction. Then students
                     reflect on their own uses of spaces to study and speculate on what they might do
                     differently going forward. These exercises double as an orientation to the
                     campus libraries, but because they are scaffolded by our concerns for acts of
                     reading, mediation, and attention, they invite students to realize the
                     significance of those spaces for their own pursuits.

                     freely available online as well as the generosity of NCSU Libraries’
                     preservation librarians, students learned a few bookbinding techniques and then

                     thread needles, stitch signatures, and help each other through what is, to all

                     who don’t self-identify as critical readers. As Sommers and Saltz suggest,
                     students appreciate the simple fact of having produced something tangible, a
                     form of knowledge creation that inheres in the craftwork, collaborative
                     experience, and resulting object as much as from our critical insights [<a class="ref" href="#sommers2004">Sommers and Saltz 2004</a>, 129].

                     expand the dimensions of analysis. For this, “Reading
                     Machines” adapts Brian Croxall’s wonderful exercise of the life cycle
                     of digitization and text analysis [<a class="ref" href="#croxall2015">Croxall 2015</a>]. This begins with
                     another visit to the preservation lab where the instructor sacrifices his
                     paperback copy of our long-form reading (most recently <cite class="title italic">Mr
                        Penumbra’s 24 Hour Bookstore</cite>) to the book guillotine. Biblioclasm is
                     a surprisingly affecting experience for students; several feel too squeamish
                     even to hold the sliced spine of a cheap paperback. Disbound pages in hand, we
                     meet a media production librarian in the Digital Media Lab who takes the class
                     quickly through a workshop on document scanning and OCR. Given sequential chunks
                     of the novel, students work in pairs to scan, OCR, correct against original
                     pages, and upload their e-text to a shared folder, which the instructor collects
                     and normalizes into a single file. I invite a colleague who talks from a
                     computer science perspective about how computers do and do not read, building up
                     in pseudocode and Perl a set of simple queries. Following Croxall’s model, the

                  <div class="ptext" id="p14">As I hope these examples suggest, teaching comparative textual media can usefully
                     blend critique with hands-on experimentation, opening a course to multiple modes
                     of attention, to students of different skill sets, and to varied spaces for
                     collaborative work across campus. It affords an experience of apprenticeship
                     which may open students’ dispositions to become “knowledge creators” in new domains [<a class="ref" href="#seminars2014">"Seminars" 2014</a>]. Yet the next step for digital pedagogy, according
                     to Rebecca Frost Davis, is “to transfer
                     the methodologies that have been developed for recognizing and studying
                     writing transfer” into course design and student activity [<a class="ref" href="#davis2017">Davis 2017</a>, 36]. For transfer to occur, students must also
                     recognize and apply their abilities in new situations. To this point in the
                     essay, I have described exercises that operate as “low road”
                     transfer, in which students might apply their existing abilities or insights
                     within a fairly familiar context. For instance, a student who already knows how
                     to sew readily sees its application in the unfamiliar domain of book binding.
                     More needs to happen for “high road” transfer, or the ability
                     to abstract, transform, and apply concepts or methods between unfamiliar domains
                     [<a class="ref" href="#perkins1988">Perkins and Salomon 1988</a>, 25]. High road transfer depends on greater
                     self awareness, a critical vocabulary which persists across domains, and
                     structured training in how and when to use transferable problem solving [<a class="ref" href="#halpern1998">Halpern 1998</a>, 451–54]. There are extensive discussions about
                     teaching for transfer which instructors in digital humanities could incorporate,
                     bolstering the more implicit claims for transfer as DH bridges disciplines,
                     academic professions, and public humanities work.

                  <div class="ptext" id="p15">Courses which emphasize reflection and mindfulness go some way toward
                     establishing the base conditions for transfer. The next step may be to
                     foreground the subject of transfer itself. What skills, vocabulary, mindsets, or
                     processes might students use in other classes or professional situations? How
                     can they carry not only habits of self awareness but a plan for dealing with
                     challenges in other domains? Among the ways of addressing these questions, our
                     course used a structure called TH!NK currently in place at NC State University
                     as part of its quality enhancement program. The TH!NK program models a process
                     cycle for creative and critical thinking. This cycle moves through discrete
                     stages: a) assess the task, b) evaluate needs, strengths, and weaknesses, c)
                     make a project plan, d) set milestones and monitor performance, e) reflect and
                     make adjustments, and f) effectively communicate the results [<a class="ref" href="#ambrose2010">Ambrose et al. 2010</a>, 193]
                     [<a class="ref" href="#carson2015">Carson 2015</a>]. This cycle means to be generalizable to any
                     problem-based or project scenario, in whatever discipline. Furthermore, it
                     builds upon a model of metacognition. Metacognition moves beyond student
                     reflections on a course topic to students’ awareness of their own thinking
                     process. Levy makes a similar distinction about mindfulness: attention on a task
                     compared to attention on one’s self. The advantage of metacognitive (or
                     mindfulness) training is how it helps students monitor and control their own
                     performance, which is especially vital for students new to higher ed. As Ambrose
                     et al. argue, “one of the major
                     intellectual challenges students face upon entering college is managing
                     their own learning”
                     [<a class="ref" href="#ambrose2010">Ambrose et al. 2010</a>, 191]. Thus, teaching students to think about
                     thinking — at which courses on reading or comparative textual media can excel —
                     can profoundly impact their educational career.

                     cycle also goes by other names, including the drafts, peer review, revision, and
                     reflection of writing essays, or the design process cycle. In fact, several of
                     my students recognized the metacognitive model as similar to an engineering and
                     design process cycle they learned in other classes. As Sheridan et al. explain, “Design processes are usually
                     conceptualized in terms of an iterative sequence of ideation, or finding
                     a problem, drafting ideas, creating a product, reflecting, and
                     revising”

                     elements of this sequence. But its commonalities all support metacognitive
                     awareness. My goals in this course have been to foreground that cycle, get
                     students repeatedly to practice through different project-based assignments, and
                     emphasize its transferability to other disciplines.

                     kindred courses on reading offer some great approaches for turning comparative
                     textual media into project-based learning. For instance, I adapted a
                     “design fiction” inspired by Mark Sample and Owen Mundy:
                     students had to imagine and propose a new app for the iOS App Store — on the
                     condition that it broke Apple’s terms of service in an illuminating way. While,
                     unlike Mundy’s computer art class, we stopped short of creating any software,
                     this assignment provoked creative ideas for digital applications and required
                     their explanation in critical context. Yet asking students to submit a creative
                     project, or anything for which you cannot show them existing examples, can cause
                     unease about grading and assessment. What are the expectations? Foregrounding
                     the metacognitive process cycle helps here, too. Rather than grade the creative
                     substance of students’ ideas, instructors can weigh the sequential submissions
                     of the project cycle. For my assignment, students had to submit each of these on
                     the way to their finished project: a needs assessment, a plan, peer feedback,
                     responses to that feedback, and a process paper. Requiring these incremental
                     submissions also helps formalize discrete moments within that process cycle.

                  <div class="ptext" id="p18">“Reading Machines” culminated in a more elaborate
                     project, one that required students not only to consider their own process cycle
                     but the role of extracurricular spaces and collaborations within it. This
                     assignment was largely inspired by the “reflective design” projects of Kari Kraus’s
                     students, described in their collaborative article “Bibliocircuitry and the Alien Everyday,” as well as by the
                     pedagogical opportunities of NCSU Libraries’ recently opened Makerspace.
                     Students were asked to read the “Bibliocircuitry”
                     article and, by following their design process cycle over several weeks, create
                     a “reflective design” prototype
                     of a reading machine, loosely construed [<a class="ref" href="#hancock2013">Hancock et al. 2013</a>, 75].
                     Their prototype did not have to function so much as become an object to think
                     with, something that, like the examples from Kraus’s class, provocatively
                     altered our relations with a medium’s protocols, materials, or uses. The
                     prototype would be supported with a written rationale and a demonstration
                     session in which groups gave Pecha Kucha-style lightning talks. I also required
                     and collected project plans, self-generated milestones, and reflections from
                     individuals about the merits or shortcomings of their process. Librarians at the
                     Makerspace offered a safety orientation session, backgrounds on critical making,
                     and support for student groups as they developed their projects over multiple
                     weeks.

                     which, in much published criticism, can seem limited to what happens in
                     learners’ heads. Cognition is also an unfolding, embodied relation. The authors
                     of a recent study on makerspaces and learning use the concept of
                     “constructionism” to emphasize the “centrality of developing an idea
                     and then designing and creating an external representation … which

                      [<a class="ref" href="#sheridan2014">Sheridan et al. 2014</a>, 507]. Design-based pedagogy like Kraus’s shows constructionism at work,
                     binding the metacognitive process to the material insights of creating an
                     object. In fact, Kraus’s “Bibliocircuitry” experiment
                     is the first entry under the keyword for “Praxis” in <cite class="title italic">Digital Pedagogy in the Humanities</cite>. That entry celebrates an ethos
                     of making within praxis, “the process through which ideas
                     become objects in space or actions in time”
                      [<a class="ref" href="#nowviskie2015">Nowviskie et al. 2015</a>]. As another way of bridging these domains, Jentery Sayers proposes “transduction literacy,”
                     cultivating in students the “knowledge
                     of how this material becomes that material” which involves “strategic repurposing,”
                     “trial and error,”
                     “collaboration,”
                     “process documentation” and “self-reflexive building”
                      [<a class="ref" href="#sayers2013">Sayers 2013</a>]. It would take only a few tweaks to turn Sayers’s model into a

                     low and high road transfer. Students were encouraged to build upon the strengths
                     they might already possess, or to pursue whatever new techniques (from 3D
                     printing to sewing to laser cutting to physical computing) or course concepts
                     most interested them. Faced with a very unfamiliar assignment, some students
                     gravitated to domains in which they already felt comfortable. For example, two
                     computer science students decided to mash up components of the Raspberry Pi
                     microcomputing system with our course paperback — that semester, <cite class="title italic">The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes</cite>. They attached a
                     motion-sensing camera to peek over the top edge of the book, with the Raspberry
                     Pi taped to its back cover. The camera snapped a picture anytime it sensed
                     movement: capturing images of the reader as well as the book's movement in
                     space. Along the way, we discussed where their project was headed, what kinds of
                     “alterity relations” it
                     could expose, and how it connected to our course experiences [<a class="ref" href="#hancock2013">Hancock et al. 2013</a>, 74]. The students referred back to our
                     marginalia hunt and explained how their camera tried to answer the difficult
                     problem of the history of reading, or learning about a book’s physical passage
                     through the world. The project also transformed the paperback into a
                     surveillance machine. Much to these students’ surprise, when they shared their
                     working prototype with friends on their residence hall, their peers were far
                     more suspicious of the augmented paperback than the smart phones they owned —
                     machines far more capable of harvesting personal data. This led the students to
                     reflect upon smart phone design and users’ situational (sometimes paradoxical)
                     responses to technology.

                     thinking, making, and reflection has a better chance of getting used in other
                     domains. Critical making projects encourage the metacognitive mindset and
                     process cycle which can lead to high road transfer. Recall that low road
                     transfer occurs at a relatively superficial level: see a physical computing kit,
                     remember that you already know a bit about hardware and programming. Higher road
                     transfer “depends on deliberate mindful

                     another”
                      [<a class="ref" href="#perkins1988">Perkins and Salomon 1988</a>, 25]. That is harder to accomplish; some scholars are skeptical that local,
                     context-specific knowledge can easily transfer at all [<a class="ref" href="#anson2016">Anson 2016</a>]. But student responses from these courses do suggest that many students
                     recognized metacognition and the process cycle as transferrable outcomes of the
                     course.<a class="noteRef" href="#d4e714">[4]</a> A student from meteorology concluded that “the most important result of this class
                     was … how we can apply similar creative and reflective strategies outside of
                     the context of this class, in our own fields.” Another student
                     directly linked the course projects with transfer: “I was given the liberty to do unique, non-conventional
                     projects and connect various aspects of my learning even from other classes
                     back to this class.” That included disciplinary crossover, according
                     to a student initially skeptical of the humanities: “[the course] challenged a lot of my views of the
                     humanities as being ‘boring.’ It’s a great class for both
                     STEM and humanities students.” Naturally, others resisted, unhappy
                     with the lack of clear expectations for finished projects, and recalling those
                     students Sommers and Saltz identified as skeptical of the paradigm of creative
                     novicehood [<a class="ref" href="#sommers2004">Sommers and Saltz 2004</a>, 137]. Yet, even among these
                     students, at least one of my skeptics conceded that, while the course content
                     seemed irrelevant, the structure still worked: “The course objectives are very unclear, and it is
                     often difficult to understand what the ‘point’ of the
                     course is. That being said, I really enjoyed the project-based learning
                     style upon which this class focuses. I also found that the required project
                     planning was a transferable skill that I utilized in other

                     disposition and one that DH instruction may uniquely help to engender. I
                     recently ran into a former student pursuing a degree in fashion and textile
                     design. Based on her early exposure in our class, she had successfully applied
                     for a position in the NCSU Libraries Makerspace. Notably, her final project for
                     our class utilized fabrics and paper to adapt the involution of <cite class="title italic">Alice in Wonderland</cite>, delving into the relations of
                     text, textiles, and design. The Makerspace librarians were delighted by her
                     application for the job, expanding the space’s purview beyond the 3D printing
                     projects and white-male demography which initially dominated it.<a class="noteRef" href="#d4e758">[6]</a> This student’s return to the Makerspace as an expert,
                     employed to guide her peers in all of its technologies, suggests another aspect
                     of transfer which digital humanities instruction might facilitate. That is, the
                     awareness of multiple spaces for knowledge creation on campus, and the
                     enculturation to the different kinds of work and professionals who inhabit them.

                     and communities. We mitigate students’ orientation overload by making these
                     different domains into sites of interaction. Put more directly: “You perceive the world largely
                     through what you can do with it”
                      [<a class="ref" href="#mccullough2013">McCullough 2013</a>, 27]. Digital humanities celebrates the active connections it makes across
                     disciplines, to extra-disciplinary partners, to other spaces of praxis on campus
                     and online. Digital humanities pedagogy, then, can be a kind of interaction
                     design for the distributed landscape of higher education, helping students to
                     realize what they can activate at different times in their career. According to
                     Malcolm McCullough, we now exist in an “ambient commons” where attention does not
                     necessarily have to mean constant focus. Rather than emphasizing individual
                     mindfulness, McCullough highlights the thoughtful design of interactions,
                     including how to manage all the things in our cognitive periphery: “everything you were aware of
                     that didn’t consume your attention, and that could be brought to the
                     center of focus if necessary”
                      [<a class="ref" href="#mccullough2013">McCullough 2013</a>, 15]. In a sense, digital humanities pedagogy is a layered strategy for the
                     ambient commons of the university, in which multiple disciplinary pursuits,
                     activities, and resource infrastructures (like the library) may be available to
                     students but often remain peripheral to a focused academic trajectory.
                     McCullough implicitly offers a model of transfer more nuanced than “just a domain problem.” He
                     emphasizes embodiment, situational awareness, and extended cognition which uses “the environment as an active
                     resource”

                     socially sophisticated phenomenon: “Adaptation and success require
                     continued situated practice and gradual enculturation”
                      [<a class="ref" href="#anson2016">Anson 2016</a>, 541]. Digital humanities instruction might offer just such a set of
                     activity-based, situated practices in which students acculturate to the
                     different environments of their learning.

                  <div class="ptext" id="p24">For our course, pedagogy aimed at situated practice not simply with hands-on
                     exercises involving our bodies, but in collaborating with different knowledge
                     professionals in their own environments.<a class="noteRef" href="#d4e814">[7]</a> According to Nowviskie, Boggs, and
                     Lundblad, such praxis helps students begin “to move with confidence across disciplinary and
                     professional boundaries” and acculturate to those different
                     environments [<a class="ref" href="#nowviskie2015">Nowviskie et al. 2015</a>]. As transfer researcher Mary
                     Goldschmidt argues, “when the
                     individual can see himself or herself as a member of the new community of
                     practice,” they are far more likely to make consequential transitions
                     across disciplines [<a class="ref" href="#goldschmidt2017">Goldschmidt 2017</a>, 127]. An intro to
                     digital humanities framework can open many such opportunities for membership.
                     While it does limit the depth of students’ discourse knowledge in any one
                     environment, it at least cultivates students’ ambient awareness of resources,
                     spaces, and skills they might at other times engage.<a class="noteRef" href="#d4e830">[8]</a> It also extends the course community to members beyond the
                     enrolled students. We bring this community together at the very end of term,
                     inviting everyone who supported the course to students’ presentations. That
                     session raises the stakes for students’ projects, asks them to communicate to a
                     broader community of practice than simply their instructor, and ennobles their
                     work as of broadly interdisciplinary interest. Selected student projects are
                     later exhibited at the entrance to the Makerspace, each with an explanatory card
                     and credits, visible to all passersby for the next academic semester.

                  <div class="ptext" id="p25">The substance of these projects gets to the interests of comparative textual
                     media, critical making, and studies of reading. While I have some biases, those
                     topics could improve any student’s critical attention to attention. This paper
                     has suggested that project-based, situated pedagogies for teaching those topics
                     may be more vital to developing the transferrable skills in critical and
                     creative thinking that so many FYE programs would promote. Digital humanities
                     instruction may offer a unique context for that pedagogy, particularly as it
                     encourages and honors collaborative praxis across disciplinary and professional
                     settings. But as McGrail points out, “the real work is
                     pedagogical”
                      [<a class="ref" href="#mcgrail2016">McGrail 2016</a>, 18]. And that includes, perhaps, more explicit attention within digital
                     humanities pedagogy to metacognition and transfer.
