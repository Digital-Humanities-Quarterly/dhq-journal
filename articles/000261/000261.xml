                <!-- Include a brief abstract of the article -->
                <p>This introduction addresses two facets of the communication of Digital Humanities
                    (DH) that have framed this special edition of <title rend="italic">DHQ</title>.
                    I begin by discussing a number of articles about DH that have relatively
                    recently appeared in mainstream newspapers. I then observe that a number of
                    these articles not only show an impoverished understanding of the field’s frame
                    of reference but also misrepresent various aspects of it, for example, its
                    interrelationship with the Humanities. Given that many academic publications on
                    the question <q>what is DH?</q> have appeared in recent years, yet DH is,
                    nonetheless, misrepresented in this way, I propose that the field must look
                    again at the communication of its activities <q>in the round.</q> Now that DH is
                    arguably moving from the margins to the mainstream I propose that the time has
                    come to address what we might call the <q>Public Communication of DH</q> so that
                    we can better communicate to the general public and academics working in other
                    disciplines what it is that we do. As the nature of DH’s relationship to the
                    Humanities is one that is frequently misrepresented in the mainstream media I
                    propose that this would be an important area for endeavours in the <q>Public
                        Communication of DH</q> to address and explore as early as possible. The
                    articles included in this special edition enrich and expand ongoing
                    conversations about the nature of this relationship. In doing so they make
                    available a wealth of case studies, arguments and insights that can, in due
                    course, be drawn on to further the <q>Public Communication of DH.</q></p>

                <head>The problem of DH in the mainstream media</head>
                <p>Criticism of Digital Humanities (DH) is nothing new. This was often alluded to by
                    those who participated in the oral history interviews that were carried out as
                    part of the <title rend="quotes">Hidden Histories of computing in the Humanities
                        project, 1949-present</title>
                    <ptr target="#nyhan2015"/>. For example, Rockwell reflected on the various types
                    of opposition his work met with at an earlier stage of his career. He recalled
                    being asked: <quote rend="inline" source="#rockwell2012">Why are [you] running
                        computing classes? This is like Pencils in the Humanities.</quote> ... [I
                    also heard] <quote rend="inline" source="#rockwell2012">you guys are
                        intellectually lightweight</quote> [and encountered] <quote rend="inline"
                        source="#rockwell2012">blatant sarcasm and ignorance</quote>
                    <ptr target="#rockwell2012"/>. Indeed, numerous references to such opposition
                    can be found in the literature of the field. The newsletter of the <title
                        rend="italic">Association for Computers and the Humanities</title> (ACH) is
                    particularly intriguing in this regard. For example, Mary Dee Harris (then
                    President of ACH) wrote: <cit>
                        <quote rend="block" source="#harris1984"> In 1970 I was accused of trying to
                                <q>destroy literature</q> and now the 1984 MLA Convention Program
                            lists 10 meetings devoted to Computer Assisted Instruction and
                            Research... It is an indication of the changing times...the profession
                            has largely accepted computers as a part of the discipline...even though
                            not everyone is involved in using computers, they are no longer viewed
                            as threatening.</quote>
                        <ptr target="#harris1984"/>
                    </cit></p>
                <p>Hopeful as Harris was, it is clear that DH is once again viewed as
                        <q>threatening.</q> This is evidenced by a flurry of essays and opinion
                    pieces that have appeared over the last few years in publications with far
                    greater reach than the typical academic journal. Kirsch, writing in the <title
                        rend="italic">New Republic,</title> portrays DH as a disorganised and
                    ineffectual amalgam that is as unable to define itself as convincingly
                    demonstrate that it can create new knowledge. Such ineptitude notwithstanding,
                    Kirsch goes on to argue that DH poses an existential threat to the Humanities.
                    The revolutionary rhetoric that often accompanies DH has an <cit>
                        <quote rend="inline" source="#kirsch2014">undertone of menace, the threat of
                            historical illegitimacy and obsolescence</quote>
                        <ptr target="#kirsch2014"/>
                    </cit>. So too he depicts the (implicitly) distinctive and expansive modus
                    operandi of DH — where building and tool-making tend to be viewed on par with
                    thinking and writing, and where images can be used to communicate, critique or
                    collaborate with words — as chillingly unpropitious: <cit>
                        <quote rend="inline" source="#kirsch2014">In this vision, the very idea of
                            language as the basis of a humane education — even of human identity —
                            seems to give way to a post- or pre-verbal discourse of pictures and
                            objects. Digital humanities becomes another name for the obsequies of
                            humanism</quote>
                        <ptr target="#kirsch2014"/>
                    </cit>. The instrumentalist and results-orientated nature that is supposed of DH
                    is reiterated once more in the closing line as Humanists are warned to guard
                    against the decoy that is DH because <cit>
                        <quote rend="inline" source="#kirsch2014">[t]he danger is that they will
                            wake up one morning to find that they have sold their birth right for a
                            mess of apps</quote>
                        <ptr target="#kirsch2014"/>
                    </cit>. </p>
                <p>The allegedly reductionist and anti-Humanities nature of DH is invoked in
                    articles in various other mainstream publications too. O’Connell, writing in the
                        <title rend="italic">The New Yorker</title> remarks: <quote rend="block"
                        source="#oconnell2014">As far as I could tell, there was a general
                        skepticism about the digital humanities, combined with a certain measure of
                        unease — arising, perhaps, from the vague aura of utility, even of outright
                        science, emanating from the discipline, and the sense that this aura was
                        attracting funding that might otherwise have gone to more low-tech
                        humanities projects. <ptr target="#oconnell2014"/></quote></p>
                <p>Writing in <title rend="italic">The Los Angeles Review of Books</title> in 2012,
                    Marche castigated DH as part of the creeping, and seemingly inexorable,
                    computerisation of all aspects of our lives, when he argued that <cit><quote
                        rend="inline" source="#marche2012">literature is not data</quote>
                    <ptr target="#marche2012"/></cit>. This is a thread that was again taken up in an
                    article in <title rend="italic">The New York Times</title> that, ostensibly at
                    least, positioned itself as a supporter of DH. Chillingly, we here find that its
                    promise is characterised as <cit>
                        <quote rend="inline" source="#leroi2015">the transformation of the
                            humanities into science. By <q>science</q> I mean using numbers to test
                            hypotheses</quote>
                        <ptr target="#leroi2015"/>
                    </cit>. Not only does the article reduce DH to a discipline that is exclusively
                    concerned with quantitative methods but, in contrast with the Humanities, it is
                    depicted as one that deploys such methods in a completely neutral and
                    non-hermeneutic way: <quote rend="block" source="#leroi2015">It’s easy to see
                        how it will go. A traditional, analog, scholar will make some claim about
                        the origin, fate or significance of some word, image, trope or theme in some
                        Great Work. He’ll support it with apt quotations, and fillet the canon for
                        more of the same. His evidence will be the sort that natural scientists call
                            <q>anecdotal</q> — but that won’t worry him since he’s not doing
                        science. ... But then a code-capable graduate student will download the
                        texts — not just the canon, but a thousand more — run the algorithms,
                        produce the graphs, estimate the p values, and show the claim to be false,
                        if false it indeed is. There will be no rejoinder; the analog scholar won’t
                        even know how to read the results. Quantification has triumphed in field
                        after field of the natural and social sciences. It will here, too. <ptr
                            target="#leroi2015"/></quote>
                </p>
                <p>I could enumerate various other examples of such articles; however, my point is,
                    I hope, beginning to emerge. In the mainstream media DH is frequently depicted
                    as a threat to the Humanities and as an instrumentalist and theoretically-naïve
                    endeavour. Furthermore, it is also frequently depicted in a way that few of
                    those who work in DH are likely to be able to relate to. This was often
                    reflected in the social media conversations that followed the publication of
                    such pieces
                    <!-- (see, for example <ptr target="#cordell2014"/>)
                     need citation -->and
                    Twitter discussions that took place after the publication of some of the
                    articles discussed above. In response to <ptr target="#leroi2015"/>, Barker
                    tweeted <quote rend="inline" source="#undocumented">This article would be better
                        entitled <q>misunderstanding the digital humanities</q></quote> (Feb 18). </p>
                <p>In the main, the replies from within the DH community have tended to focus on the
                    respective articles’ shortcomings. For example, Schnapp et al’s response to
                    Kirsch emphasizes the logical flaws, oversights and factual errors that the
                    article contains. They argue that he has an impoverished understanding of the
                    scholarship of the history of the book, that he accords New Criticism a vim that
                    has long departed it and they briefly touch on his misrepresentation of the aims
                    and practices of DH <ptr target="#schnapp2014"/>. Such responses are important
                    and necessary. However, they do not go far enough or recognize the more
                    fundamental issue that I believe to be at stake, namely the discipline’s current
                    shortcomings in the context of what we might think of as the <q>Public
                        Communication of DH</q> and the necessity of approaching this in a more
                    systematic and expert way, as I will now argue. </p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <head>Reflecting on Popular Depictions of DH</head>
                <p>By my lights, the most telling aspects of the articles discussed above are that
                    they (i) do not accurately describe the aims or scholarship of DH (ii) are
                    written by people who are not experts in DH and (iii) appear in mainstream media
                    with large readerships. That the second and third points are true should be a
                    matter for concern because they emphasize that DH does not currently have a
                    place at the table of mainstream media communication. In short, the
                    communication of what our discipline does, has done and aims to do is being left
                    to others who are not necessarily expert in it.</p>
                <p>That the first point should be true is immensely puzzling when one considers the
                    very many contributions that have been written on the topic <q>What is DH?</q>
                    (see, for example, <ptr target="#terras2013"/> and less formal explorations such
                    as the <title rend="quotes">Day of Digital Humanities</title>
                    <ptr target="#rockwell2012b"/>. </p>
                <p>Of course, one might counter that authors such as Kirsch are referencing wider
                    discourses about neoliberalisation and, far from misunderstanding DH, they are
                    intentionally misrepresenting it as a handmaiden of those who seek to
                    commercialise higher education. I’ll return to this point later. For now, I want
                    to counter it by recalling the many references that one can find to how poorly
                    DH is understood outside of expert circles, for example, <cit>
                        <quote rend="inline" source="#schuman2014">As such, digital humanities is
                            the consummate academic hot-button topic: Everyone has vehement
                            opinions, but few actually know what they’re talking about</quote>
                        <ptr target="#schuman2014"/>
                    </cit>. For me, a sense of cognitive dissonance is created by, on the one side,
                    the wealth of literature that exists on the topic <q>What is DH?</q> and, on the
                    other side, the limited understanding of answers to that question given in the
                    articles discussed above (and that appears to exist outside of the field more
                    generally).</p>
                <p>For the most part DH has not, so far, managed to communicate its values and aims
                    in a way that can easily be understood by many scholars from other disciplines,
                    journalists, non-fiction writers and the general public. Neither has DH managed
                    to adequately communicate (if alone in the sense that this is a much discussed
                    question within the field) the complex nature of its interrelationship with the
                    Humanities to this wider audience. In pointing this out my aim is not to
                    criticise extant <q>What is DH literature?</q> on the grounds that it has not
                    managed to communicate its message to wider audiences: on the whole, academic
                    literature does not tend to be written for non-specialist audiences. Rather, my
                    aim is to point out that the increasing institutionalisation and
                    professionalization of DH requires us to think about and plan for our discipline
                    in ways that have not really been necessary up to now. I believe that criticism
                    such as that contained in the media articles discussed above is potentially very
                    valuable because it alerts us to the ways that DH is being (mis)understood by
                    those who do not work in the field and it alerts us to the necessity of
                    responding in a more systematic way than we have up to now.</p>

            <div>
                <head>On the Public Communication of DH</head>
                <p>McCarty’s Busa lecture <ptr target="#mccarty2014"/> evoked the virtues of
                    periodically looking up from the day-to-day research that so thoroughly absorbs
                    and enthralls us in order to ponder the longer-term research agenda of DH. To
                    his ruminations on the research trajectory of the field I wish to add a proposal
                    in the context of what might be seen as the strategy and foresight of the field,
                    namely the necessity of appointing chairs in the <q>Public Communication of
                        DH.</q> Perhaps pipeline issues will make the appointment of chairs
                    difficult in the short term. Yet, at the very least, I believe that our
                    scholarly associations should support initiatives that could foster the
                    development of such expertise in the longer term while advocating to those who
                    control the purse strings about the importance of such appointments. As I will
                    now outline, I believe that a new field in the <q>Public Communication of DH</q>
                    could draw on (and further complement) the expertise already present in the
                    field of the <q>Public Communication of Science</q>. I suggest this not only
                    because of the field’s demonstrable expertise in the communication of scholarly
                    research but also because of the various affinities that seem to exist between
                    it and DH. For example, the current DH situation seems to me rather similar to
                    one description of the motivations that lay behind activities in the area of the
                    public communication of science in the 1970s: <cit>

                <p>An awareness of the necessity of communicating to the general public about
                    science, and advocating for its benefits (and, sometimes, limitations), preceded

                    <ptr target="#aas"/></cit> was founded. Notwithstanding its relative longevity, today
                    the issue as to whether Science Communication is a separate and fully fledged
                    field or a subdiscipline of fields such as the Sociology of Science, Science and
                    Technology Studies or Media Studies etc., remains contentious. In any case,
                    structures that are often taken as hallmarks of disciplinarity (dedicated peer
                    reviewed conferences, journals and scholarly associations) have existed in it
                    since the 1970s <ptr target="#gascoigne2010" loc="2"/>. The following is a
                    useful overview of the field’s frame of reference: <quote rend="block"
                        source="#gascoigne2010">Science communicators think of the media as another
                        form of discourse...science communication deals with the diffusion,
                        propagation and appropriation of scientific knowledge in different context,
                        for different purpose, with different effects (intended or unintended), and
                        the paradigms employed qualify these processes. Most of the time we deal
                        with non-formal knowledge of scientific knowledge, which could be (depending
                        on the theoretical frame of reference we use) representations,
                        misinterpretations, misconceptions, preconceptions, everyday knowledge, or
                        common sense knowledge. <ptr target="#gascoigne2010" loc="4"/></quote>
                </p>
                <p>Furthermore, it also tends to have a political and activist dimension: <cit><quote

                        World War II, a generation of scientists with twin commitments to political

                    <ptr target="#bucchi2008" loc="1"/></cit> Aside from affinities with DH in terms of

                        target="#losh2012"/>), need citation -->this
                    is also relevant in the context of the mainstream portrayal of DH mentioned
                    above. As I wrote, one might argue that Kirsch (and others) wilfully
                    misrepresent DH for political ends. Even if this were true, I don’t believe that
                    it would undermine the necessity of addressing the public communication of DH.
                    Rather, it draws attention to how narratives about <q>science</q> (in the sense
                    of <emph>wissenschaft</emph>) can serve political (and other) agendas, and the
                    public should be as aware of this in knowledge dissemination contexts as they
                    are in terms of commercial advertising. </p>
                <p>This editorial is not the place to address particulars about the scope or
                    implementation of the proposed sub-field in the Public Communication of DH;
                    however, a closer look at some high profile appointments such as the Simonyi
                    Professorship for the Public Understanding of Science in Oxford University in
                    the UK emphasise the many promising points of departure that already exist.
                    Firstly, as I have assumed in the above, such a post could aim to communicate
                    with not only the general public but also with scholars in other academic
                    disciplines. That this should ideally be an aspect of the Simonyi Chair is made
                    clear in the manifesto written at the time it was set up: <cit>
                        <quote rend="block" source="#simonyi1995">[the aim of the post is to] make
                            important contributions to the public understanding of some scientific

                                <q>public</q> we mean the largest possible audience, provided,
                            however, that people who have the power and ability to propagate or
                            oppose the ideas (especially scholars in other sciences and in
                            humanities, engineers, journalists, politicians, professionals, and
                            artists) are not lost in the process.</quote>
                        <ptr target="#simonyi1995"/>
                    </cit> The manifesto also explains that such a post is necessary due to the
                    centrality of symbolic expression to the sciences: <cit>
                        <quote rend="block" source="#simonyi1995">Symbolic expression enables the
                            highest degree of abstraction and thence the utilization of powerful
                            mathematical and data processing tools ensure tremendous progress. At
                            the same time the very means of success tends to isolate the scientists
                            from the lay audience and prevents the communication of the results.
                            Considering the profoundly vital interdependence between the society at
                            large and the scientific world, the dearth of effective information flow
                            is positively dangerous.</quote>
                        <ptr target="#simonyi1995"/>
                    </cit> Again, here parallels with DH can be noticed not only due to the role
                    that computation, and thus symbolic manipulation, plays in our discipline but
                    also in the way that some Digital Humanities research results have entered or
                    are entering into the mainstream. The most obvious and widely known example of
                    this is the impact that TEI (Text Encoding Initiative) had on the language that
                    would become the lingua franca of data exchange, XML.</p>
                <p>It is also notable that in recent times various appointments in what might be
                    called the <title rend="quotes">Public Communication of the Humanities</title>
                    have been made. Following on from the successful <title rend="quotes">Being

                    communicating what it does to a larger and non-specialist public. Therefore, I
                    have used part of this editorial to make what I hope to have shown is both a
                    convincing and urgent case for such a development. In the next part of this
                    editorial I will explain the rationale of the special edition that is presented
                    here and give an overview of the contributions that are contained in it. </p>

            <div>
                <head>Digital Humanities and the Humanities</head>
                <p>The establishment of a sub-field in the <q>Public Communication of DH</q> is
                    clearly a long-term goal. One important issue for it to communicate to
                    non-expert publics will be the nature of DH’s relationship to the Humanities. As
                    outlined above, this crucial question is frequently misrepresented in the
                    mainstream media. I propose that this would be an important area for endeavours
                    in the <q>Public Communication of DH</q> to address and explore as early as
                    possible. The articles included in this special edition enrich and expand
                    ongoing conversations about the nature of this relationship. In doing so they
                    make available a wealth of case studies, arguments and insights that can, in due
                    course, be drawn on to further the <q>Public Communication of DH</q>.</p>
                <p>Within the professional and non-professional literature of and about DH the
                    nature of the interrelationship that exists between it and the Humanities is
                    much discussed: it has variously, and with varying levels of plausibility, been
                    argued that DH will replace, extend, revolutionize, redeem, save or even destroy
                    the Humanities. This special issue will seek to examine this relationship from a
                    different perspective, namely how and whether DH intersects with one of the most
                    central concerns of many disciplines of the Humanities: problematization. In
                    short, the issue aims to explore not whether DH is solving Humanities’ problems;
                    instead it asks how DH is making such problems more difficult, more problematic,
                    more indicative of the Human condition. Though the articles contained in this
                    issue have been written with a broader audience in mind, it is to the
                    professional literature of the field that they seek to make a contribution. </p>
                <p>As text is central to the Humanities the focus of this issue is also text;
                    however, in light of how digitization remediates all analog sources into a
                    common binary format the notion of text is here broadly conceived to comprise
                    any source that contains even a single word or graph, whether text-based art,
                    audio-visual materials such as oral history recordings, software and computer
                    programs, visualizations, musical scores etc. It is hoped that this special
                    issue will not only contribute to current understandings of digital text but
                    also that it will shed new light on the relationship between the Humanities and
                    DH in terms of their shared and differing ways of thinking and questioning. In
                    essence, our aim was to explore, or even simply identify, new routes or
                    neglected routes for Humanities and DH scholars to traverse. This theme occurs,
                    to varying degrees, in all the articles selected for inclusion in the issue. </p>
                <p>Niels Brüegger’s comparison of digitised collections and web archives gives an
                    overview of the fascinating and emerging area of web archives while aiming to
                    understand how different <q>types of digital
                        material affect different phases of scholarly work.</q> Tanya Clement
                    argues that DH scholars <q>have made a tradition
                        of problematizing our understanding of textuality within the context of
                        designing information systems for texts that, in many cases, still look like
                        books.</q> She extends this frame of reference by proposing a rationale
                    of audio text and describing a prototype tool for analysing audio collections.
                    Claire Clivaz draws on the history of the book and philosophers like Derrida to
                    argue that the demise of covers and bindings is not a phenomenon that is unique
                    to the digital age; nevertheless, she calls for DH to <q>dare to depart from ancient bindings and create new
                        boundaries.</q> Arianna Ciula and Cristina Marras focus on a central
                    activity of DH, namely modelling, and set out an exploratory framework
                    (pragmatic modelling) for such practices and then draw on the framework to show
                    how <q>DH modelling practices challenge
                        epistemological and linguistic restrictions, by, for example, problematising
                        the adoption of terminology belonging to the domain of computer
                        sciences.</q> Stuart Dunn and Mareike Katharina Höckendorff <q>combine perspectives from historical research and
                        literary criticism to problematize the categorization, computation and
                        representation of events in cultural heritage.</q> Finally, Stan Ruecker
                    contrasts the successes that the sciences have made in <q>capturing the public imagination</q> with the situation in
                    the Humanities where cultural and heritage institutions have tended to <q>provide opportunities for passively consuming
                        cultural production, rather than with the core interest of the Humanities,
                        which is in enriching objects of study by analyzing them through a variety
                        of theoretical lenses.</q> In addition to arguing that the Humanities
                    must learn from the Sciences in this regard he argues that DH has a crucial role
                    to play as <q>the driving force behind this
                        education.</q></p>

                <head>Conclusion</head>
                <p>This article has addressed two facets of the communication of Digital Humanities
                    (DH) and how they have framed this special edition of <title rend="italic"
                        >DHQ</title>. Firstly, I argued that the time has now come to address what
                    we might call the <q>Public Communication of DH</q> so that we can better
                    communicate to the general public and academics working in other disciplines
                    what it is that we do. Secondly, I turned to overarching aim of this special
                    edition and the articles that are included in it. Though written with a general
                    audience in mind the articles are not written in a <q>Public Communication of
                        DH</q> mode (because DH has not yet developed expertise in this area);
                    rather, they seek to make a contribution to the ongoing question of the nature
                    of the interrelationship that exists between DH and the Humanities. </p>
