                  <p>Analysis of historical periodicals through digital tools is still a predominantly
                     text-based field. This paper seeks to expand the toolbox of researchers of these sources,
                     and addresses the observed capability gap, by proposing a new technique for the discovery
                     of appearance patterns in historical newspaper collections. It calls this technique
                     Bleedmapping after the effect it produces, making it seem as if a multitude of pages
                     have “bled through” each other and showing the greatest concentration of articles matching a chosen search
                     parameter visually in an intuitive and easy to interpret manner. This approach greatly
                     extends the toolbox of scholars by providing them a method to explore the metatextual
                     and spatial context of the texts they study. Using a case study on Reynolds' Newspaper
                     this article shows the value of Bleedmapping when used alongside a text-based LDA
                     analysis, showing the prevalence of the British Empire in the paper's “Notices to Correspondents”.</p>

                  <div class="ptext" id="p1">When I was younger, I used to know exactly which page of the paper the sports column
                     was on, just as my father could find the stock updates without looking. The TV-guide
                     had a rear cover dedicated to children's letters and could always be found upside-down
                     on the couch. Books were filled with dogears and would fall open on favourite pages.
                     That we could navigate through these complex textual compositions by referring to
                     their spatial nature – what page and column a certain kind of content lives in are
                     just some intimately everyday examples of the relationship between a text and the
                     spatial context it occupies.</div>

                     and textually-minded humans, is to look at the words in the spaces around it. Are
                     the signs that point to a more complete understanding of its meaning in the surrounding
                     sentence, paragraph or page? There exist a multitude of techniques that provide researchers
                     with these insights: Latent Dirichlet Analysis, Latent Semantic Indexing, Hierarchical
                     Latent Tree Analysis, Concordance analysis, and many more. Yet all of these ignore
                     the non-textual aspects of a text: the choice of font, the addition of images or embellishments,
                     or the placement on the page. Already in 1927 the French philosopher and poet Paul
                     Valérie wrote in an essay on the importance of the materiality of text. He stated:
                     “Une page est une image. Elle donne une  impression totale, présente un bloc ou un
                     système de blocs et de strates, de noirs et de blancs, une tâche de figure et d'intensité
                     plus ou moins heureuse.”<a class="noteRef" href="#d3e174">[1]</a> However, digitised historical collections are often accessible only through a text-based
                     interface [<a class="ref" href="#mussell2012">Mussell 2012</a>], which has the effect of masking its non-textual aspects. </div>

                  <div class="ptext" id="p3">Other methods have been developed to analyse periodicals in a manner that rescues
                     these sources from being reduced to just text. Some early work on the form of the
                     newspaper stems from [<a class="ref" href="#barnhurst1991">Barnhurst and Nerone 1991</a>], [<a class="ref" href="#barnhurst2002">Barnhurst and Nerone 2002</a>], who provided the theoretical foundations and proved its relevance to studying the
                     cultural connotations of the patterns of placement. Their work relied on a visual
                     close reading of their selection of newspapers, and sought to reach a general context
                     true for all papers, rather than a specific context of one article. It also meant
                     their methods do not scale well to encompass a digitised archive of thousands of newspapers.
                     Additionally, the result of their visual close reading is itself textual, which has
                     been described as problematic by some scholars, as it occludes the original nature
                     of the material [<a class="ref" href="#haskell1993">Haskell 1993</a>]. Some effort to address these problems has been made recently by Beals [<a class="ref" href="#beals2018">Beals 2018</a>], however her proposed visualisation of word counts doesn't show the space itself,
                     only an estimate based on the length of text. Meanwhile Moreaux [<a class="ref" href="#moreaux2016">Moreaux 2016</a>] has shown the value of metadata analysis and visualisation for nineteenth-century
                     newspapers.</div>

                     the spatial pattern of article placement based on the positional data encoded in its
                     metadata. The visualisation proposed by this paper will allow the heatmapping of common
                     places where a given subset of articles in a periodical appear, allowing for the identification
                     of the context in which a text needs to be seen.</div>

                  <div class="ptext" id="p5">Bleedmapping was developed as a tool to answer a simple research question: where do
                     articles appear within a paper's pages, in single issues and over a longer print run
                     of a title? It does so by extracting the positional metadata for each article in a
                     generated subset, and visualising these as grids on a density map (heatmap), creating
                     the effect of thousands of pages being put on top of each other and bleeding through
                     to reveal the meta-textual structure that frames its contents. Answering this question
                     is relevant for all research searching for non-textual contexts of appearance, but
                     it is of particular interest for studies in historical identities. It has long been
                     acknowledged that newspapers signpost the reader whether a story should be read in
                     an national or international context by grouping stories together. The banality of
                     this act serves as a marker of identity for the reader, who sees their own perspective
                     on the world validated by the paper's distinction between “homeland” and “foreign”, between “ingroup” and “outgroup” [<a class="ref" href="#billig1995">Billig 1995</a>]. Beyond studying the identity of any prospective readers of a publication, bleedmapping
                     also allows for an insight in the periodical itself. As the distribution of articles
                     through a print run of issues is not random, but instead a deliberate act on behalf
                     of the editor, we can look at the pattern of article appearance as part of construction
                     of the identity of the publication itself [<a class="ref" href="#mussell2012">Mussell 2012</a>]. </div>

                  <div class="ptext" id="p6">There are several advantages to the approach Bleedmapping takes. First, it is methodologicaly
                     and epistemologically transparent. This means it avoids being a black box by virtue
                     of not just being transparent to tool critics wishing to investigate the source code,
                     but also to any scholar unfamiliar with digital approaches who may want to use it.
                     The basic function of bleedmapping can be understood as a digital version of a manual
                     operation: drawing and counting rectangles. In this way, it stands vis-à-vis methods
                     such as topic modelling, which to fully understand require a degree of mathematical
                     aptitude that is seldom found in the humanities. The second advantage is from the
                     data it uses. Instead of being forced to rely on approximations of place and size
                     Bleedmapping can rely on (relatively) accurate positional data. </div>
                  
                  
                  <div class="counter"><a href="#p7">7</a></div>
                  <div class="ptext" id="p7">It pays to take a moment to reflect on that positional data itself. Most digitised
                     newspaper archives generate article blocks as part of the image processing undertaken
                     when a page is transformed from a “dumb” image to an archival page [<a class="ref" href="#gatos2000">Gatos et al. 2000</a>]. Such a step is required to have the OCR software “read” the text accurately, and to allow text to be read across a page boundary. This article
                     segmentation step is the field where advances in Document Image Recognition and Analysis
                     have made major contributions to accuracy [<a class="ref" href="#meier2017">Meier et al. 2017</a>], [<a class="ref" href="#oyallon2015">Oyallon and Rabin 2015</a>]. The coordinates of these article blocks are then retained in the metadata of a page,
                     and are key part of keyword search implementation, allowing the user to be dropped
                     exactly on the article they requested. Crucially, the way search indexes are set up
                     suggests that these coordinates are never used outside of this  purpose: the coordinate
                     field cannot be searched, nor easily requested. Bleedmapping therefore relies on creative
                     reuse of this data, and has to take at times roundabout ways to extract it. </div>
                  
                  
                  <div class="counter"><a href="#p8">8</a></div>
                  <div class="ptext" id="p8">When it comes to discussing the process of Bleedmapping, it is important to first
                     discuss the source of the data used. Not each digital newspaper archive is created
                     equally, and some were produced in a more structured manner than others. For example,
                     the Delpher-archive of the Dutch Royal Library is very consistent in the quality of
                     its segmentation and has a uniform resolution for all page images, while the British
                     Library 19th Century Newspapers archive was digitised by two different external partners,
                     producing different image resolutions [<a class="ref" href="#fyfe2016">Fyfe 2016</a>], [<a class="ref" href="#beals2020">Beals and Bell 2020</a>]. This has substantial implications for the Bleedmapping process, as it means in one
                     case resolving scaling issues is vital, while in the other it can be approximated
                     in favour of processing speed. The implementation below is for the British Library
                     19th Century Newspapers archive on the “legacy” Gale Text Mining Drives produced prior to 2018 [<a class="ref" href="#beals2020">Beals and Bell 2020</a>]. Yet for all implementations, as alluded to above, the existence of the positional
                     metadata is crucial. Without this, bleedmapping is not possible. Thus, if this data
                     is not present in the archive, the researcher has to either generate zoning data themselves
                     from page images, or opt for a text-length approximation approach, such as used by
                     Beals [<a class="ref" href="#beals2018">Beals 2018</a>]. </div>

                  <div class="ptext" id="p10">The first step to visualising the placement of newspaper articles is to create a subset
                     out of the corpus. This subsetting serves an epistemological goal. After all, if we
                     were to visualise all the articles in the corpus, we would produce a representation
                     of all articles in the newspaper, which means there would be no areas of greater intensity
                     from which to draw any conclusions. Thus, the creation of a subset of articles whose
                     positions might produce insight into the subject of choice, or which might answer
                     a research question is a necessity. For example, if we wanted to visualise patterns
                     in the placement of poetry columns across four decades of a specific newspaper, we
                     would first need to identify and create a subset of all the poetry columns that we

                     derived from the articles. This produces a link to the page's raw image file on disk,

                     the regular-sized dailies, which were typically 12 ¼ by 18 ¾ inches, to the much smaller
                     <cite class="title italic">Pall Mall Gazette</cite>, which was only 6 by 9 inches [<a class="ref" href="#beals2018">Beals 2018</a>]. Additionally, even if the pages were the same, the idiosyncrasy of the digitisation
                     process mean that a page might have gained or lost an inch or two to the binding or
                     simply to the way it was placed on the scanner. Compounding this issue is the fact
                     that the coordinates of an article are in pixels, not in inches, and there is no universal
                     translation between these two units. The reason for this is simple: the coordinates
                     were never intended by the archive creators to be used this way. All it was designed
                     to do was to provide a visual indication to the user where on the digitised page the
                     article they were looking at was located, either in a preview thumbnail or in an image
                     viewer. This means these coordinates were always intended to be image-specific, and
                     there was no need for uniformity of any kind between the images. In a similar vein,
                     the choice halfway through the project to use higher resolutions took place for the
                     sole reason of providing better segmentation and OCR. However these choices were made,
                     they shape the archival reality researchers have to deal with [<a class="ref" href="#fyfe2016">Fyfe 2016</a>].</div>

                     different pages with one another. First, the frames of reference in which the coordinates
                     of the article exist need to be normalised; that is, both coordinate systems need
                     to be given the same meaning. In the case of the <cite class="title italic">British Library Newspapers</cite> parts I and II, there is a disparity in resolution, with part I images being 300
                     dpi and part II at 400 dpi. This provides us with an unworkable situation for visualisation
                     if the goal is to compare an entire print run of a paper or even multiple different
                     newspapers for a year or decade, as these may be from different parts of the archive.
                     Using the image size and dpi information of the page from which an article comes,
                     we transpose the coordinates of the article onto an “ideal” newspaper page at a resolution of 400 dpi that is the same for all articles, by multiplying
                     the 300 dpi coordinates with 1.33. Next, the result is scaled non-isometrically to
                     fit the ideal page's width and height, as shown in Figure 3. A separate X and Y scale
                     are used for this, to assist in columns over different pages aligning with each other.
                     The size of the ideal page was chosen so it has an aspect ratio that is equal to modern

                     of articles that occupy any given space. For this we need to determine the coordinates
                     of each pixel within the article's area. It was found that using every pixel was impractical
                     and unnecessary: it increases computation time and memory used substantially, but
                     when analysing it offers no additional benefit. The tool therefore uses 200 by 200
                     pixel blocks in its calculations, as it saves significant resources. These represent
                     an area of 0.5 inch square in physical terms, which is small enough to show the detail

                     images. A key problem is visualising multiple pages at the same time, while maintaining
                     a uniform density scale between the graphs. If all pages were simply visualised on
                     their own without such a precaution, each would default to a local scale, and the
                     same hue on the heatmap could then indicate widely varying numbers of articles observed.
                     Neither seaborn nor matplotlib were designed to support generating multiple heatmaps
                     with a common scale, so a workaround using the manual scale settings had to be found.
                     This necessitated discovery of the maximum number of articles observed before generating
                     the heatmaps, in order to place a set value as the maximum, by generating the table
                     of occurrence for all pages in the paper, and using the maximum value from the incidences
                     column. This results in a sequence of heatmaps, which each represent a page, but which
                     share a common colour scale. An example of this is included as Figure 5. </div>

                     in places where there were only slight variations in the number of article occurrences,
                     such as on page 2 or page 5 of the visualisation in Figure 5, the slight variation
                     in shade was not easily spotted. For these visualisations a three-tone colour scheme
                     is advisable, as it combines ease of interpretation with an aesthetically pleasing

                     which is compressed into a unified scale. This is more apparent in the vertical than
                     in the horizontal, as this makes the columns more pronounced. The columns on the page
                     form by themselves, as the article placement data of each overlaps slightly with the
                     adjacent column. This has the effect of creating a darker area delineating the column.
                     The origins of this overlap lie in the segmentation undertaken during the digitisation
                     process, which appears to have defined the article zoning with relatively wide margins.
                     This is a direct result of the image being slightly curved or misaligned on the scanner,
                     while the zoning is limited to drawing perfect rectangles between its topmost left
                     and bottommost right points. The relative inaccuracy of such an approach would not
                     impact the goal of using the zoning to highlight areas in a preview window. Occasionally,
                     this can lead to artefacts forming when the newspaper changes its layout within a
                     subset; during tests with <cite class="title italic">Reynolds' Newspaper</cite> it was found that at one point between 1885 and 1889 that paper changed over from
                     a six-column to a seven-column layout, which distorted the image. This in itself was
                     a surprise, as the literature has described <cite class="title italic">Reynolds'</cite> as an eight-column newspaper for its entire existence [<a class="ref" href="#shirley2009">Shirley 2009</a>].</div>

                     to make a case for their usefulness as a means for research in digitised historical
                     newspapers. To do this, a compact historical case study is in order, showing the difference
                     in the findings attainable by commonly-used textual analysis methods such as LDA Topic
                     Modelling and Corpus Analysis using Antconc, and the more metatextual approach offered

                     comparison, but rather a way in which Bleedmapping may supplement other techniques.
                     The case study will center around the hypothetical research question: how did <cite class="title italic">Reynold's Newspaper</cite> report on imperial news compared to foreign news between 1850 and 1900? </div>

                     of random articles, for a total of three. India, Canada and Australia are used as
                     markers of empire. These were chosen because they were three of the major possessions
                     of the British Empire, spread around the three major continents on which it held territory,
                     and they related to colonies in different stages of development and of different types:
                     Canada as a developed settlement colony, Australia as a pioneer settlement colony,
                     and India as the “crown jewel” of the empire. Earlier tests to find suitable search terms for Britain's African
                     holdings proved unsuccessful, as there the geographic descriptors were too fluid.
                     For the comparison with foreign news, three imperial competitors were chosen. France,
                     Britain's oldest enemy and competitor in Africa, Russia, which competed with Britain
                     for influence in Central Asia, and Germany, which began to challenge British naval
                     power towards the end of this period, but with whom Britain had strong dynastic ties
                     in the earlier part of the century. These are respectively the imperial and foreign
                     datasets.</div>

                     As modern scholars used to certain stylistic tropes we need to be cognisant of the
                     fact that we may not understand the importance of certain cues embedded in the paper's
                     layout, or interpret them incorrectly. For example, we may consider, in our twentieth-
                     or twenty-first century mindset, the front page the most important part of a paper
                     - but this need not have been the case for a Victorian reader who would first see
                     the colourful advertisement wrapper.</div>

                     design. This was completely unexpected, as the literature describes the paper as being
                     laid out on eight larger pages and eight columns [<a class="ref" href="#shirley2009">Shirley 2009</a>]. A verification using the images themselves confirms the presence of six and later
                     seven columns. Having more columns allowed the editor more options when composing
                     the various articles into a coherent page and made more room for adverts, though at

                     of newspaper design in the second half of the nineteenth century, rational and bureaucratic
                     design elements did emerge. The centre and the periphery were made visual on the page
                     by dynamic whitespacing, which had the most central and important content in airy,
                     double-spaced lines on the top left and centre columns, with the density of the text
                     increasing towards the bottom-right, where more peripheral content was placed [<a class="ref" href="#barnhurst2002">Barnhurst and Nerone 2002</a>]. However, more recent newspaper scholars such as Liddle [<a class="ref" href="#liddle2012">Liddle 2012</a>] have argued that Victorian newspapers were very much in flux, with the information
                     density, and by necessity, organisation, of their pages changing throughout the century.
                     He states that the pages and genres within them only stabilised during the latter
                     decades of the nineteenth century. If this is the case, analysing article placement
                     would be of little value, as it would show no underlying structure. Additionally,
                     whatever the editor intended the placement of content to be, the final say on the
                     allocation of space in a newspaper was reserved for the foreman at the printers. Usually,
                     until the 1870s his task required cutting back material or cramming in content wherever
                     it would fit.</div>

                     conclusion derives from the clearly present clustering of articles for both keyword-selected
                     subsets: if articles that contain the same keywords, and thus cover the same or similar
                     topics, appear in similar places over a long period of time, we can safely consider
                     there to be evidence for a “rational and bureaucratic” design being imposed on the paper. The way these clusters shift shows that after
                     1886 the paper was redesigned in such a way that the political content, both foreign
                     and imperial, occupied a very different space, barring one major exception. The most
                     obvious section where the imperial and the foreign subsets overlap is in the first
                     two columns of page 4 after 1886, which contains the densest concentration for both
                     these families of article by far. With between 250 and 300 articles, these rows are

                     these columns housed the very popular “Notices to Correspondents” section of the paper. These kinds of sections have been theorised as “the principal forum for reader opinion”, and the space for items that have “earned their legitimate place in the public debate” [<a class="ref" href="#richardson2008">Richardson 2008</a>]. Started by <cite class="title italic">Reynolds's</cite> as a way to connect with his audience, readers could send questions, both on the
                     mundane and the political to the newspaper's offices, which the editor (G.W.M. Reynolds
                     himself until his death in 1879, subsequently his brother Edward and son William)
                     would respond to. “Notices to Correspondents” helped create a community of readers and was an integral piece of the paper's formula.
                     The change we observe in the placement of political content in general, but of foreign
                     political content in particular, from adverts, economics and news sections to these
                     discussion pages is suggestive of a deeper change in the way newspapers were read

                     methods can take us: closer reading (or a targeted topic model) is needed to show
                     the ways in which these places were referenced. It showed two contexts in which both
                     the empire and the foreign Other were used. First, they may be invoked in direct response
                     to a question from a reader. For example, in response to a query by “W.G” in 1851: “Theatrical managers in France are made to pay one-tenth of the receipts to the support
                     of the poor.” Or in October 1852, in an answer to A. Milner of Glasgow, when the response reads
                     “If your health, age, character, &amp;c., is such as to meet the view of the Government
                     Emigration Commissioners, a person of your calling might obtain a free or assisted
                     passage to Australia.” In both cases, the original query obviously specified that they were inquiring into
                     something foreign or imperial—in this case the payment into a social security system
                     by French theatre owners or the ways for “a man of certain calling” to make it to Australia. </div>

                  <div class="ptext" id="p29">The second invocation of imperial and foreign places in the editor's responses is
                     as a yardstick by which a certain factoid or measurement is to be taken. In these
                     cases, the enquirer is asking after foreign practices to compare them with those within
                     Britain. These are much more difficult to identify, as without the original query,
                     they can look much like the simple queries, and a degree of close reading is required
                     to find them. One example is the response to a question on the use of colonial troops
                     by the French by “M.E.” of Wye: “The Zauaves [sic] are natives of the French provinces of Algiers, disciplined and
                     exercised by French officers, and now forming part of the French contingent employed
                     in the Crimea. They hold exactly the same relation to the French army as the Sepoys
                     in India have to the regular British troops.” In this case, the editor recognised that by making a comparison between an unknown
                     foreign entity and a known imperial one, the reader would better understand the former.

The bleedmaps confirm those readings, as they show the newspaper's shift from being
                     a vessel for news and information about the political developments of the world to
                     being a platform for debating those politics, which suggests a substantial emotional
                     investment by the average Britton into the empire. However, we could also read this
                     as an example of the agenda-setting powers of the press: starting and fostering debate
                     on topics in a way that forces political parties to respond. Said debate has, of course,
                     shades of chickens and eggs, but nonetheless Bleedmaps may contribute to this debate

                     and occupy political spaces in the newspaper, do so mainly in the parliamentary columns.
                     Here, the empire is discussed as an integral part of British political life. Additionally,
                     news from parts of the empire, relating to (political) events that take place there
                     are not reported separately. This suggests the empire does hold a special position
                     in British political discourse, and in the political identities it imparts on its

                     holds over it, is a space that the British social, economic and political lives intersect
                     with on a regular basis. While the foreign only appears when it is relevant, the empire
                     is on every page, as it is always relevant to Britain's political debates.</div>

                     methods, such as a corpus analysis by tools such as AntConc or LDA topic modelling.
                     For this case study, LDA topic modelling is an appropriate tool to extend the insights
                     gained into the placement of articles: we have a space and a rough content based on
                     the keyword search, but what more can we learn from them? For this purpose, we use
                     a the Gensim implementation of LDA [<a class="ref" href="#rehurek2010">Řehůřek and Sojka</a>]. This model was constructed using the same data as was used for the Bleedmaps, divided
                     in the same article-sized chunks. We now turn to the two important aspects that greatly
                     influenced the quality of the resulting model, both of which underline the potential
                     issues inherent in using digitised archival data “as is” and which show the importance of critical data literacy. These two are OCR quality
                     and article segmentation. </div>

                  <div class="ptext" id="p33">Article segmentation influences the size (and quality) of the chunks that are used
                     to build the model, and in the case of Gale's Legacy Text mining drives – and the
                     British Library data these drew from – the creators decided to segment articles conservatively,
                     that is, if a page contains six columns of ten adverts each, all these sixty adverts
                     are considered one article. This was not an unreasonable approach to take when the
                     digitisation took place around 2004–2007. Even today, on much more powerful hardware
                     and using much more sophisticated techniques, article segmentation, especially of
                     historic newspapers, remains an unsolved problem [<a class="ref" href="#barman2021">Barman et al. 2021</a>]. Additionally, a greater level of precision was not needed for the intended use as
                     an index of the digitised contents of the newspaper collection [<a class="ref" href="#king2005">King 2005</a>]. However, the choices made then poses a major problem for a document-level LDA model
                     now, as it means that one of the fundamental assumptions underpinning it no longer
                     holds true: that the writer of each text sought to produce sensible texts where words
                     from the same topic-specific bag-of-words are used together more often than words
                     from other topic-specific bags-of-words. Hence, topic models generated from this dataset
                     are often barely coherent (ie. no meaning can be found in the collection of tokens)
                     or badly fragmented (ie. multiple topics contain almost the same tokens).</div>

                     the source material. While the OCR accuracy of this particular archive was excellent
                     when it was digitised between 2004 and 2007 [<a class="ref" href="#tanner2009">Tanner et al. 2009</a>], it falls behind when compared to modern standards [<a class="ref" href="#kettunen2016">Kettunen and Pääkkönen 2016</a>] [<a class="ref" href="#breuel2017">Breuel 2017</a>]. The average character transcription error rate in these articles is acceptable for
                     human readers and for search indexing, as this was what it was designed to facilitate,
                     yet it poses significant challenges for LDA. After all, if most tokens are unique,
                     how can a model learn the patterns that underlie their use? With all these caveats
                     out of the way however, the topic model does provide some additional insights in the
                     language that occupies the spaces identified by the Bleedmapping.</div>

                  <div class="ptext" id="p35">Topic modelling may, on this particular dataset, raise further research questions
                     on how the various news items of the day interacted and intersected on the pages of
                     Reynolds. It is notable that for the period 1860–69, for example, most topics contain
                     tokens that refer to the American Civil War, such as “Confederate”, “Washington” or “American”. This is not in and of itself unexpected, as the Civil War was followed closely in
                     the British press and loomed large in the public imagination [<a class="ref" href="#grant2000">Grant 2000</a>]. This interest was connected with deep-seated economic concerns about the war's impact
                     on the global cotton supply, and whether supplies from India would be enough to replace
                     unavailable or destroyed stocks. Due to the way articles are segmented in this archive,
                     it is impossible to know if this is a legitimate reading of the topic model, or if
                     it is simply caused by different imperial news articles on “India” being contaminated with larger (yet semantically separate) articles on the Civil
                     War. This problem gets more acute the later in the century we go, as forms of reporting
                     change. While in the middle of the century foreign and imperial reporting tends to
                     be longform, by its end shorter telegraph bulletins are the norm. </div>

                  <div class="ptext" id="p36">Questions around this issue of “contamination” of articles by segmentation become even more complex as we consider another popular
                     genre of article in Reynold's: the army and navy list. These articles are by their
                     very design “contaminated” with mentions of places all over the globe, named without much if any contextual
                     information. These lists of regiments of the British army and ships of the royal navy
                     and their postings throughout the Empire form into topics with high probability, because
                     they follow the same pattern for decades on end. These lists were not unique to Reynold's
                     and were often a case of “scissors and paste journalism” [<a class="ref" href="#beals2018">Beals 2018</a>], where newspapers copied whole articles from other -more specialized- periodicals.
                     Interpreting the meaning of these lists is difficult – were they solely intended to
                     inform the loved ones of serving personnel [<a class="ref" href="#jones2018">Jones 2018</a>], or did they also instill a feeling of imperial pride? Whichever is the case, the
                     lack of a clear hotspot on the bleedmap that could correlate with their placement
                     suggests they were regarded as filler, to be placed wherever there was room left.</div>

                     page, as they are designed to, while they reinforce the findings of the Bleedmaps.
                     While the technical constraints of this project were such that using them truly in
                     unison was not feasible, it is no great stretch to imagine how there two can reinforce
                     each other further. Starting from a topic model, a bleedmap might show the spatial
                     context of each topic. This can ease the topic's interpretation by providing valuable
                     metatextual clues. Alternatively, starting from a bleedmap, a topic model generated
                     for a particular hotspot and modelling only those articles that appear in a (known)
                     space in the newspaper, can be a valuable tool to further explore its textual contents.
                     These improvements, as well as integrating direct web access through api calls, are
                     being included in the mature version of the Bleedmapper I am currently building for

                     It has shown this method of <em class="term">bleedmapping</em> is an improvement over previous (manual) visual analysis methods, as it boasts a
                     high level of scalability and a low reliance on human data tagging, while still retaining
                     human authority in the analysis step. These Bleedmaps are a useful addition to the
                     toolbox of the digital historian when exploring collections of sequential publications,
                     such as newspapers and periodicals. They provide metatextual context for other, text
                     based analysis methods such as topic models, and can in future be made to show the
                     location of individual topics for easier interpretation. The method does not, however,
                     solve issues related to article segmentation and OCR accuracy completely, but it can
                     help mitigate the impact of these known issues when applying methods that are more
                     reliant on accurate segmentation and OCR, such as Topic Modelling.</div>

                     intended to be used as such. They show the density of articles that match a set of
                     selection criteria on each page of the newspaper, which can then be linked back to
                     certain categories of article through analysing these specific spaces. They are thus
                     particularly valuable for understanding the patterns of repeated content in a periodical,
                     which are known to possess this spatial identity. They are however limited in their
                     ability to carry the burden of historical evidence alone: until we gain a fuller understanding
                     of the meanings of article placement, they will have to be supplemented by other methods
                     of analysis for the identified areas of interest, be it a closer textual reading or
                     application of computational approaches. Bleedmapping has the major advantage of making
                     the subtext of each article visible by showing the spatial context in which they exist.</div>

                     placement has only been done on a small scale, as it was time-intensive when using
                     the prior existing methods. The development of this tool allows for overviews of article
                     placement to be generated without human involvement. It makes it possible to answer
                     questions about the space occupied by specific genres of content; it makes us ask
                     whether these places were static over time or if articles changed places; it generates
                     questions about the redesigning of the layout by incoming editors. It has the potential
                     to be valuable for both the field of periodicals studies and for historians wishing
                     to gauge the impact or prominence of certain content. However, in its current embryonic
                     form, it suffers from a lack of secondary literature and historical theory to embed
                     itself in. At present, there has been very little work done on the visual language
                     of Victorian newspapers, the way their layout spoke to their readers. Did readers
                     value the front page the same as we do nowadays, or did the presence of the advertising
                     wrapper mean the key content would be most eye-catching on the inner folio? Did readers
                     learn to expect certain patterns to their newspapers that editors themselves were
                     restrained by, such as expecting the Parliamentary debates to be on page three? There
                     are countless questions like this, but most of the answers are yet to be found. Additionally,
                     theories on content placement in a historical context will need to be developed; those
                     that are available for newspapers generally consider only more modern columnless newspapers,
                     which makes them unusable for content such as that in this archive. Bleedmapping allows
                     us to finally explore and theorise the pages of historical newspapers the same way
                     we navigate our everyday reads: spatially.</div>
