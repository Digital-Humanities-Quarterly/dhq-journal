                  <p>Little is left of the built environment that marked the Greenville-Longtown Black
                     Settlement, a once-thriving, free Black agricultural community on the border of Randolph
                     County, Indiana, and Darke County, Ohio. The people of Greenville have not been forgotten,
                     however, because of the memory-work undertaken by each generation of Black women whose
                     power and agency connects their past with their future descendants. This article draws
                     on “descendant archival practices” as a method to understand the importance of Greenville’s
                     Black women in the preservation of rural Black community heritage and in the writing
                     of Black women’s histories in the antebellum Midwest. Descendant archival practices
                     connect Black digital humanities practices to the Longtown-Greenville descendant community's
                     digitization of artifacts and oral histories and supports a community-owned version
                     of their active Facebook group. The result, a History Harvest called “<a href="https://longtownhistory.github.io/" onclick="window.open('https://longtownhistory.github.io/'); return false" class="ref">Remembering Freedom: Longtown and Greenville History Harvest</a>”, will facilitate ongoing community participation and future history harvests for
                     overlooked, forgotten, and long-silenced communities.</p>

                  <div class="ptext" id="p1">95-year-old Cleo Fay Goens Mason is determined to narrate her own story. In her words,
                     “Everybody has their own idea of what’s important. And you have to respect that” [<a class="ref" href="#mason2019b">Mason 2019b</a>]. Perhaps this was a lesson she learned from her mother, who kept the books at Bethel
                     Wesleyan Church in the early 1900s and held on to many of the items that adorned her
                     during her life. Mrs. Mason, like her mother, is a memory keeper and descendant of
                     the historic Longtown community, formerly known as the Greenville Black Settlement
                     and now visible as Longtown on a map of Ohio. Mrs. Mason’s participation in the September
                     29, 2019 history harvest at the annual homecoming of Longtown, and the deliberate
                     ways in which she unveiled her family's heirlooms, suggests that her memory work is
                     a practice cultivated across generations to bridge the gap of time and space between
                     ancestor and descendant, between past and present, between the collections built by
                     an individual and those housed in independent community archives [<a class="ref" href="#mason2019a">Mason 2019a</a>][<a class="ref" href="#flinn2009">Flinn, Steven, and Shepherd 2009</a>, 73].</div>

                     [<a class="ref" href="#powell2018">Powell et al. 2018</a>]. Like other history harvests, this history harvest paired the ethical concerns of
                     community archiving with university partners, including the Institute for Digital
                     Arts &amp; Humanities and the Center for Research on Race and Ethnicity in Society, to
                     digitize, preserve and showcase community historical artifacts in an open-source digital

This shifts focus away from mainstream archives, the collections of predominantly
                     white institutions that pose as inclusive and representative but fail to label Black
                     people and their material as authoritative and constitutive. Women like Mrs. Mason
                     and her female ancestors often show up in these institutional archives, both physical
                     and digital, as nameless, faceless, victimized, objectified, or in the perspectives
                     of others [<a class="ref" href="#cifor2018">Cifor et al. 2018</a>]<span class="error"><a class="ref" href="#d4e226"></a></span><span class="error"><a class="ref" href="#d4e227"></a></span>.

                     <em class="emph">Descendant archival practices</em> cites as experts the many generations of Black women elders whose memory work preserves
                     their history, and it holds as custodians the present generations of Black women whose
                     power and agency connects their memory-work inheritance with their future descendants.
                     The <cite class="title italic">Remembering Freedom History Harvest</cite> builds on these intergenerational processes — which encompass on the collaborative
                     aspects of community archiving, the individual actions of descendants who choose to
                     keep their family’s histories, and the collection practices of history harvests —
                     to examine free and fugitive Black women’s experiences of freedom in the rural Midwest
                     who have been overlooked in accounts of slavery and freedom. Over the past five years
                     Jazma Sutton has worked collaboratively with individual Longtown descendants to center
                     the sources, archives, and narratives produced by nineteenth-century Black women and
                     their descendants, illuminate the multiplicity of archives that descendants of free
                     and enslaved people have managed to create and preserve despite the constraints of
                     white colonial power and white supremacy. <em class="emph">Descendant archival practice</em> foregrounds the individual and communal archival power of Black women, past and present,
                     to “confront inequalities of power in the production of sources” as we look toward a digital future [<a class="ref" href="#trouillot2015">Trouillot 2015</a>]. The project thus grapples with the methodological and ethical concerns situated
                     between archival excess and absence across the digital and analog divide. In a world
                     that has always conceived of Black women in opposition to others, but never on her
                     own terms, <cite class="title italic">Remembering Freedom History Harvest</cite> builds a local Indiana historiography that relies less on resistant readings of archives
                     and more on the community archives and memory work that join together in <em class="emph">descendant archival practice</em> as a way to generate Black women’s histories.</div>

                  <div class="ptext" id="p5">The Greenville Settlement, which overlapped the borders of Indiana and Ohio, was one
                     of the earliest and most prosperous Black communities in the region. The settlement
                     was founded in 1818 in Darke County, Ohio, by James and Sophia Clemens. By 1822, it
                     extended over the state-line into Randolph County, Indiana where Thornton Alexander
                     purchased the first tract of Black-owned land in the county. At times, Indiana and
                     Ohio both passed state laws that prohibited immigration into the state, denied access
                     to public schools, promoted Black immigration to Africa, and stripped Black people
                     of any rights and privileges in court. Despite this, by the mid nineteenth century
                     the free and fugitive Black people of Greenville had collectively amassed the most
                     Black-owned land of any county in Indiana. They had established Wesleyan and African
                     Methodist Episcopal Churches, founded an integrated, co-educational school of manual
                     labor known as the Union Literary Institute (ULI), and operated safehouses on the
                     Underground Railroad. In these ways, Greenville pioneers forged a community that was
                     conducive to rural life and anti-slavery activism.</div>

                  <div class="ptext" id="p6">Today, the Clemens farmstead, a disintegrating ULI school building, and three cemeteries,
                     one of which stands neglected in the middle of a white-owned farm, are all that remain
                     of the settlement’s built-environment. The joint forces of racial violence, industrialization,
                     agricultural innovation, and mass migration decreased the Black population of Longtown
                     to 0.76%. Roane Smothers, a family historian, asserts “When this has happened at other African American settlements, the buildings and cemeteries
                     were demolished and the story about these African American pioneers are forgotten
                     and buried” [<a class="ref" href="#staff2015">Staff of the Dailey Advocate 2015)</a>]. Sustained resistance to archival and cultural erasure has allowed Longtown descendants
                     to digitize hundreds of historical documents and artifacts, to obtain historical markers,
                     and to restore old buildings and register them on the National Register of Historic
                     Places and as Underground Railroad sites with the National Park Service. Despite what
                     Greenville descendants have been able to achieve through grassroots preservation practices,
                     we still know very little about the women who W.E.B. Du Bois noted, after visiting

                     women created spaces for themselves as free people, citizens, and women. Landownership
                     and rural seclusion enabled Black women to raise families that could not be separated
                     or destroyed, to educate their children, and to manage their own farms and homes.

                     Underground Railroad, and some oral histories suggest that they were savvy. They adjusted
                     to, and spearheaded at times, the latest agricultural, technological, industrial,
                     and political advancements in arguably one of the most anti-Black states in the Midwest

                     Midwest) has been slow. A move towards engaging the lives of free, enslaved and fugitive
                     Black women who lived in the territory’s hundreds of free Black communities has lagged
                     even further behind. Scholars like Erica Armstrong Dunbar, Amrita Chakrabarti Myers
                     and Jessica Millward focus on urban spaces, pushing us to consider enslaved and free
                     Black women’s lived experiences of freedom, their definitions of freedom, and the
                     varying degrees of freedom they occupied. To a certain extent, they each rely on traditional
                     records such as court records, wills, church minutes, city directories, other official
                     documents, and in rare cases like <cite class="title italic">A Fragile Freedom</cite>, Black women’s friendship albums to partially piece together the lives of free Black
                     women who often left little to no sources behind about their lives [<a class="ref" href="#dunbar2008">Dunbar 2008</a>] [<a class="ref" href="#dunbar2017">Dunbar 2017</a>]. In <cite class="title italic">Forging Freedom</cite>, some of these women were considered exceptional, having owned property and other
                     enslaved people, yet they appear in the archive, not strictly in their own right,
                     but mainly as a result of their legal negotiations or sexual relations with white
                     men [<a class="ref" href="#myers2011">Myers 2011</a>]. Millward, in <cite class="title italic">Finding Charity’s Folk</cite> is fortunate to have one formerly enslaved woman’s manumission papers, will, and
                     court case, but is also aware that these records alone can not reconstruct the multifacet
                     lives of enslaved and free Black women. In search of Charity Folk whose “ghost refuses to be silent”, Millward turns to memory, descendants of enslavers and enslaved people, historical
                     buildings, and cemeteries to chronicle the life of a single woman [<a class="ref" href="#millward2015">Millward 2015</a>]. In <cite class="title italic">All That She Carried: The Journey of Ashley’s Sack, a Black Family Keepsake </cite>, historian Tiya Miles uses a single artifact from Black women’s material culture
                     — a sack filled with a tattered dress, three handfuls of pecans, and a braid of hair,
                     which one enslaved woman bequeathed her daughter before being sold away — to trace
                     the lives of a mother, daughter, and granddaughter trio during slavery and its immediate
                     aftermath. Miles’ treatment is an innovative assessment of the inheritance practices
                     Black women drew on to maintain family connections between generations when the forces
                     of slavery severed those connections all too readily [<a class="ref" href="#miles2021">Miles 2021</a>]. Millward and Miles show us what is possible when historians of enslaved women step
                     outside of the confines of the traditional archive and demonstrate the importance
                     of naming <em class="emph">descendant archival practice</em> to acknowledge the many contexts in which it appears in Black women’s history.</div>

                     to say anything at all”. To make meaning of this sort of archival encounter with “Black Venus”, for Hartman, is akin to entering a mortuary — it permits one final viewing and allows
                     for a last glimpse of persons about to disappear into the slave hold [<a class="ref" href="#hartman2008">Hartman 2008</a>][<a class="ref" href="#hartman2006">Hartman 2006</a>]. Her account is as much an account of the violence of the archive as it is of enslaved

                     impossibilities of writing about Black women during slavery. While Hartman encourages
                     historians to “respect the limits of what cannot be known”, Marisa Fuentes suggests that we stretch these limits by “reading against the bias grain” [<a class="ref" href="#fuentes2016">Fuentes 2016</a>]. Instead of focusing solely on the lived experiences of enslaved women, she shifts

                     A more adequate counter-history of slavery — a history of the past and present intertwined

As a digital archive,
                     and an easy-to-use platform for community empowerment, the “Remembering Freedom” Facebook page echoes the technical expertise that has always been necessary for Black
                     people to flourish in rural communities. The ability to learn, adapt, and invent technologies
                     was one of the hidden hallmarks of free Black rural communities, and Longtown's women
                     descendants are carrying on that tradition in digital and analog spaces. Its near-ubiquity
                     as a social media platform — Pew Research estimates 69% of adults had Facebook accounts
                     in 2019, and 74% of those users visited the site daily [<a class="ref" href="#perrin2019">Perrin and Anderson 2019</a>] — and its ease of use offers equitable access to Longtown descendants, historians
                     and other interested parties from across many demographic groups to collaboratively
                     fill the silences in Longtown’s history. At the same time, Facebook’s proprietary
                     approach to and control over its data means that, without consideration for backups
                     or presentation elsewhere, any digitized archives on Facebook’s platform are prone
                     to unexpected loss and erasure (though to be fair, this isn’t a concern limited to
                     Facebook for born-digital archives). Its algorithmic presentation of a “feed” selected

                     lightboxes to improve photo quality<a class="noteRef" href="#d4e547">[2]</a>). Both of these considerations are directly connected to the idea of the archive
                     as a nexus of community-academy partnership, rather than a site of academic praxis
                     that seeks to meet purely academic standards.</div>

                     Each of these technical considerations was driven by our digital-engagement theory.
                     Compounded, all five draw on considerations of “racialized design” — an intentional challenge to uninterrogated project management and design standards
                     that perpetuate racism [<a class="ref" href="#mercer2019">Mercer and Moses 2019</a>]. The choice of Github Pages in particular meant that we could effectively support
                     community custody of the web site with a free, stable, sustainable hosting solution
                     that emphasizes simple, static web pages. That in turn allowed us to draw on university-sponsored
                     resources and workflows to facilitate regular “backups” of the <cite class="title italic">Remembering Freedom History Harvest</cite> web site on the [<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/2021*/https://longtownhistory.github.io" onclick="window.open('https://web.archive.org/web/2021*/https://longtownhistory.github.io'); return false" class="ref">Internet Archive’s Wayback Machine</a>], ensuring long-term public access to the site regardless of community hosting considerations.
                     Together, these five changes radically transform the history harvest from a space
                     that perpetuates “white colonial power” in present-day archives and narratives to one that truly promotes “innovative new authentic learning initiatives” for the future through the historical productions of overlooked people.</div>

                  <div class="ptext" id="p21">First, we scheduled the event day around several pre-existing community traditions
                     centered on gathering at the physical site of Longtown and Greenville itself. Descendant
                     Brenda Jett was responsible for organizing the event at the local Bethel Wesleyan
                     Church, and she functioned as the main contact between researcher and community. Homecoming
                     events like the one at which the history harvest took place are evidence of how the
                     community sees its past as a source of identity and a guide for future conduct. The
                     invitation to participate in the history harvest portion of the homecoming event was
                     explicitly focused on memory as an heirloom. By signaling that oral histories rooted
                     in the built environment itself, in an ancestral home, were equally valid as contributions
                     of digitized family heirlooms, we acknowledged the silences of free and enslaved voices
                     in archives that are often dependent on physical objects and traditional historical
                     texts to anchor a community’s history.</div>

                     of computing and technology necessary to generate a digital archive and situate that
                     digitization effort in the community’s most familiar spaces [<a class="ref" href="#gil2016">Gil and Ortega 2016</a>]. This minimal-computing approach, which we address more fully below, allowed us to
                     be flexible and take community direction once we arrived at the homecoming; rather
                     than requesting guaranteed access to WiFi or power outlets, which might redirect community
                     focus to our needs rather than theirs.</div>

                     Our digitization efforts would be located at the church and began at the conclusion
                     of the Homecoming ceremony. In a small room behind the sanctuary, where we were able
                     to access a few power outlets, we set up a single, foldable light box, a scanner,
                     and a sign-in table. Members crowded the space; some were holding a few folders, others
                     carried boxes filled with decades-old materials. Still, others toted nothing but their
                     personal stories and histories. We sent a few graduate and undergraduate students
                     to the pews with handheld battery-powered audio recorders for interviews and began
                     encouraging community members to fill out our paper forms.</div>

                     One descendant sought accommodations for Shari Petersime, a family historian who is
                     visually impaired. Shari, still residing in the Longtown area, contributed a draft
                     of the family history book she was writing titled, “Only God Can Make a Tree: Tracing my Burden Family Roots”" [<a class="ref" href="#petersime2019">Petersime 2019</a>]. A couple of months after the history harvest, she contacted Sutton via phone and
                     made arrangements to send her a copy of the final project. Sutton has since then cited
                     the publication, which has a wealth of information on antebellum women from the settlement,
                     in her dissertation and consulted Petersime’s expertise to weave together archival
                     fragments. This is also when we first met Mrs. Mason, who offered the largest collection
                     of documents and objects of any descendant. The particularity with which she handled
                     her material or responded to our requests was evidence of the intentionality that
                     generations of rural Black women have placed on how they wanted to be remembered.
                     Mrs. Mason, highlights the ways in which rural Black women and their female descendants
                     have subverted the fate of Black Venus. We could not ignore the care and concentration
                     with which she chose the information she wanted to share from her personal archive.</div>

                  <div class="ptext" id="p25">As the example of Mrs. Mason makes clear, the amount of material to collect far exceeded
                     the number of hands and time available to do the work of collecting. We worked with
                     descendants to choose – or limit — what they wanted scanned, photographed, or recorded,
                     but those choices were circumscribed by the sometimes-slow nature of high-quality
                     digital capture. In some cases, we compromised the quality of the digitization process
                     in order to acknowledge the importance of a memory or heirloom. In each of these cases,
                     the question looming over our labor is one of theoretical, practical, and historical
                     importance: Would those interested in seeing this archive, whether they be researchers,
                     descendants of the public, “emerge from the encounter [with the archive] with a sense of incompleteness and with
                     the recognition that some part of the self is missing as a consequence of this engagement?” [<a class="ref" href="#hartman2008">Hartman 2008</a>]. We were compelled to contend with the possibility that, in our efforts to address
                     the silences and violence of the archive, we had sustained them because of the twin
                     limitations of time and technical ability.</div>

                     at such a face might demand” [<a class="ref" href="#hartman2008">Hartman 2008</a>]. In fact, we encountered her — Venus, rural free and fugitive Black women, Mrs. Mason
                     — because she made the decision to show up. The sum of Mrs. Mason’s collections —
                     birth, death and church records, marriage certificates, property deeds, poetry, sewing
                     baskets, photographs, a kerosene light, photos of the 1850 home built by the founder
                     of the settlement in which she was born and raised — yield a picture of everyday life

                     changes were driven by the ongoing realization that we would need to do more work
                     to address the archive as a site of erasure. To that end, our third major change reoriented
                     the web site around the idea of descendant voices, even down to the variable names.
                     As we noted earlier, our pre-event Call for Contributions included a call to contribute
                     voice in addition to object; on site, we stressed the importance of descendants’ preferences
                     for digitizing the items that were significant to them — not to us or anyone else
                     — as a way to emphasize the community’s archival power. To echo that emphasis, what
                     would have been the “Collections” and “Items” portion of another history harvest site is now called <cite class="title quptes">Descendant History</cite> In that section, we bring digitized objects together with descendant interviews and
                     give both equal weight as part of the preservation efforts. We also addressed the
                     divide between “contributor”, “creator”, and “owner” in the language of the original history harvest metadata, a holdover that assumes
                     creation, ownership, and contribution have a transactional nature. These divided roles
                     are gone, replaced by “descendant” to acknowledge the inheritance that makes descendants like Mrs. Mason the guardians
                     of their own history.</div>

                     regular updates than the history harvest page, is embedded front-and-center on the
                     history-harvest home page and on the page that documents the 2019 homecoming event
                     [<a class="ref" href="#archey2011">Archey 2011</a>]. Similarly, some of the photos that are part of the community’s own archive on Facebook
                     are re-presented as part of the history harvest collection, clearly labeled and with
                     additional links to the Facebook site and its preserved heirlooms. These embeddings
                     and linkages highlight the active role Longtown and Greenville’s descendants have
                     taken for years in their own ongoing preservation efforts. Just as Mrs. Goens’ particularity
                     in person is matched digitally in how her history is told in the history harvest,
                     the interweaving of Facebook and history harvest is a visible expression of the community’s

                     of sustainability, affordability, and access in archive building and digital preservation.
                     The community’s Facebook preservation efforts are robust, well-organized and literally
                     well-liked in Facebook terms. Community organizers, however, acknowledge that the
                     platform is less well suited to long-term permanence. The need for stability, combined
                     with a low-cost solution that encourages community ownership of the archive, led us
                     to GitHub. Most history harvests are built on a custom Omeka installation, a boutique
                     university-built content-management system with built-in metadata processing that
                     makes duplication in a university-sponsored repository easy. It does so at the cost
                     of ongoing access to paid hosting with more complex requirements that require academic
                     intervention; these requirements also make it more likely that academic ownership
                     of the site would become the default. We instead opted for a simple, static, text-only
                     site hosted using <a href="https://jekyllrb.com" onclick="window.open('https://jekyllrb.com'); return false" class="ref">Jekyll</a>] in Github Pages, a free platform whose primary function is shared, collaborative
                     technical practices. This hosting choice also better supported the necessary metadata

                     creation, contribution, and ownership. While we are committed to partnering for whatever
                     technical needs the Longtown/Greenville community identifies in the future, this platform
                     choice is part of an overall design shift that offers the community full stewardship
                     of their own preservation practices, including more history harvests in the future,
                     with minimal computing needs [<a class="ref" href="#gil2016">Gil and Ortega 2016</a>].</div>

                     projects generally, and history harvests in particular: documentation. This effort
                     has begun, but our long-term documentation efforts will be designed to offer a sustainable
                     method for Longtown and Greenville’s communities to incorporate the history-harvest
                     option as one of their own preservation efforts. We chose a well-documented Jekyll
                     theme <a href="https://jekyllthemes.io/theme/mediumish" onclick="window.open('https://jekyllthemes.io/theme/mediumish'); return false" class="ref">Medium-ish</a> on which to build our template, which gives future history-harvest preservationists
                     a community of practitioners that is much larger than the IUB history harvest team
                     [<a class="ref" href="#sal2019">sal@wowthemesnet 2019</a>]. Our own customization, including storage and naming convention for images and text,
                     builds on the standards built into that existing structure, making it more likely
                     that anyone with basic web skills can learn how to update and add to the site. Finally,
                     we have begun the process of documenting our approach to customizing Medium-ish through
                     a combination of in-person training, <a href="https://longtownhistory.github.io/documentation/" onclick="window.open('https://longtownhistory.github.io/documentation/'); return false" class="ref">video tutorials</a>], and in-line commented code. In this way, too, we actively sought to subvert the
                     supposed “clarity and simplicity” of code that obscures and excludes non-white voices and use it intentionally to support
                     Longtown’s descendants as they voice their own preservation [<a class="ref" href="#mcpherson2012">McPherson 2012</a>].</div>

                     will need to guide their preservation and outreach efforts moving forward. That will
                     take on several dimensions. As academic collaborators, we need to address not just
                     the transfer of the accounts and passwords that provide access to Github and the email
                     addresses that are used for Github logins. We also need to center the community’s
                     Facebook practices as we work together to grow the site; new additions to the Facebook
                     page that encourage community cohesion can go hand in hand with the stability of Github
                     preservation. These endeavors should also situate a more formal university partnership,
                     which should address backups and long-term file migration support for permanent preservation.
                     In all of these formal partnership efforts, we will work with the community to emphasize
                     a similar centering of descendant community needs that brings Black voices back into
                     archival spaces without reifying the archive as the only legitimate site of preservation.
                     To make this history harvest the site of true change, however, we need to consider
                     one final step: a clear provision of outreach, time, tutorials and resources so that
                     other communities can draw on this site for their own preservation work in the absence
                     of the extractive patterns that are the hallmark of “traditional” academic archives. Our hope is that this focus on community-based archival production
                     and sustainability — using digital technologies and platforms that are easily adaptable
                     for the creation of sustainable/equitable/democratized archives for the future — will
                     continue to serve those whose lives and experiences have been left void by traditional
                     archives.</div>

                     and individuals within highlighted communities to collect, preserve, and share their
                     rich histories. Advanced undergraduates lead the History Harvest project and curate
                     and digitize these artifacts and stories.... The History Harvest, then, is an invitation
                     to local people to share their historical artifacts, and their stories, for inclusion
                     in a unique digital archive of what we are calling the people’s history.”</span></div>
