                  <p>Digital source materials such as films can be transformed in ways that suggest an
                     innovative path for digital humanities research: computationally manipulating sounds
                     and
                     images to create new audiovisual artifacts whose insights might be revealed through
                     their
                     aesthetic power and transformative strangeness. Following upon the strain of digital
                     humanities practice that Mark Sample terms the “deformed
                     humanities,” this essay subjects a single film to a series of deformations: the
                     classic musical <cite class="title italic">Singin' in the Rain</cite>. Accompanying more than
                     twenty original audiovisual deformations in still image, GIF, and video formats, the
                     essay
                     considers both what each new version reveals about the film (and cinema more broadly)
                     and
                     how we might engage with the emergent derivative aesthetic object created by algorithmic
                     practice as a product of the deformed humanities.

                  <div class="ptext" id="p1">On its face, film and media studies would seem to be a natural space for digital
                     humanities to grow and thrive, as it studies cultural objects that are either born
                     digital
                     in origination, or digitized from cinematic or analog video originals for contemporary
                     distribution. Additionally, dedicated departments of film and media studies often
                     include
                     video production in their scope, meaning that there are usually more digital resources
                     and
                     expertise available than in other humanities departments. But in reality, most of
                     the
                     methods that have been adopted in digital humanities pose challenges to apply to moving
                     images and sounds as an object of study, as with tricky technicalities of text mining
                     from
                     audiovisual sources or copyright restrictions curtailing expansive digital editions
                     of
                     films, or seem to work best when analyzing data outside of the media objects themselves,
                     as with mapping exhibition patterns or doing network analyses of actors across films.
                     But
                     the existence of films and media texts as already-digital objects suggests another
                     path
                     for digital humanities research away from quantitative data analysis: computationally
                     manipulating sounds and images to create new audiovisual artifacts whose insights
                     might be
                     revealed through their aesthetic power and transformative strangeness.<a class="noteRef" href="#d4e193">[1]</a></div>

                     digital
                     humanities research method, manipulating moving images and sounds to create new
                     audiovisual texts that convey arguments and ideas that would otherwise be impossible
                     to
                     generate or articulate via the written word [<a class="ref" href="#mittell2019">Mittell 2019</a>]. In that essay, I
                     extended Mark Sample's “deformed humanities” to the videographic realm,
                     proposing three deformative techniques and applying them to a range of films to seek
                     discoveries within my research laboratory of Adobe Premiere. Such deformations apply
                     patterns and parameters to cultural works, looking to “break” the bound
                     object of a poem or film and create something new from the broken parts. As Sample
                     argues,
                     the resulting deformations, which typically defy norms of sense and logic, do not
                     need to
                     be returned into the rational realm of analysis to provide insights about the original's
                     design or meaning; instead, the strange deformed version can function as a new media
                     object, with aesthetic power and cultural resonances that are not circumscribed by
                     their
                     relationship to their original. As he writes, “the deformed work is
                     the end, not the means to the end”

                     [<a class="ref" href="#oleary2019">O'Leary 2019</a>], this “sequel” takes a different approach:
                     subjecting a single film to a broad range of deformations as a way to explore the
                     wide
                     array of deformative practices that might yield interesting results on a single object.
                     <cite class="title italic">Singin' in the Rain</cite> is a particularly apt film to
                     repeatedly deform for a number of reasons. Few films are as well-known, beloved,
                     broadly-taught, and widely regarded as historically significant — if one effect of
                     deformative work is to make the familiar strange, it's useful to start with a film
                     that is
                     quite familiar. Additionally, the film itself is about cinema at a moment of technological
                     transition from silent to sound, and thus it is thematically resonant to place it
                     into a
                     technological laboratory to perform experiments with sounds and images, even if the
                     film's
                     diegetic technologies are resolutely analog. <em class="emph">Singin</em>' also features a broad
                     array of reflexive formal techniques and moments, including color, black-and-white,
                     dialogue, singing, dancing, film-within-film, and fantasy sequences, whose range and
                     variety encourages a playful approach via deformative operations, and thus might be
                     instructive and inspirational for other potential case studies. Finally, it is an
                     unusual
                     film because it contains its own internal deformative moment: during the test screening
                     of
                     <em class="emph">The Dueling Cavalier</em>, a synching glitch in the nascent sound film
                     technology causes the dialogue of two characters to swap; the diegetic audience's
                     reaction
                     to this deformation via laughter and surprise highlights the pleasures of strangeness
                     that
                     hopefully some of my deformations will provoke.

                  <div class="ptext" id="p4">In providing an inventory of deformative practices, I do not aim to suggest
                     comprehensiveness nor a progression toward “better” methods and
                     revelations. This is a provisional list of techniques that I have found productive
                     in
                     creating new cultural objects that seem meaningful and/or pleasurable, but I fully
                     expect
                     many will find some of them uninteresting or unpleasant. I have thrown many techniques
                     at
                     the proverbial wall, but will not inventory the failures that did not stick — except
                     one
                     that might exemplify what a “failure” might mean in this context.
                     Inspired by the film's internal deformation of unsynched sound, I experimented with
                     “re-synching” that moment in <em class="emph">Dueling Cavalier</em> to line up
                     the proper dialogue, and then playing the rest of the film with this new sonic
                     synchronization — effectively making the strange moment normal, and the rest of the
                     normal
                     moments strange. But the result was neither sufficiently strange nor interesting —
                     watching the film's dialogue and musical numbers with the sound lagging around two
                     seconds
                     behind was simply annoying, not revelatory nor pleasurable. Thus the bar that each
                     of my
                     subsequent deformations clears (at least to me) is to create something interesting
                     and/or
                     enjoyable to watch and hear. I hope the same holds for all who proceed through this
                     strange wilderness of a broken classic film.

                  <div class="ptext" id="p5">I fully admit that these resulting works are difficult to categorize. Are they acts
                     of
                     scholarship? Do they contain or provoke arguments? Or are they creative works, more
                     akin
                     to experimental films? Certainly there are many parallels with the latter, where the
                     use
                     of algorithms and parameters on pre-existing footage creates new artworks, as with
                     Martin
                     Arnold's glitchy remixes of cinematic fragments or Cory Arcangel's collages of YouTube
                     musical clips (see [<a class="ref" href="#bering2014">Bering 2014</a>]

                     [<a class="ref" href="#enns2012">Enns 2012</a>]). But I present these deformations here not in the context of an
                     art gallery or film festival, but rather embedded within a written scholarly essay,
                     clearly signaling them as academic expressions over artistic works. As I previously
                     wrote
                     regarding the possibilities of videographic criticism, such works can embrace the
                     poetic
                     and experimental scholarly impulse of Robert Ray's writing, joining “scientific quantification and artistic poeticization together, creating works that
                     transform films and media into new objects that are both data-driven abstractions
                     and
                     aesthetically expressive”

                     [<a class="ref" href="#mittell2019">Mittell 2019</a>, 230]. While each deformation falls short of the bar for
                     a piece of rigorous argument-driven scholarship, taken together I believe they do
                     create
                     an argument for approaching an audiovisual work as a site of experimentation and play,
                     offering the possibility of revealing new dimensions and facets of a highly familiar

                     an impressionistic residue of the film's composition, lighting, and production design
                     that
                     would be unidentifiable without context. Knowing the source material, we can see details
                     that resonate with significance, as with the outline of the screen-within-a-screen
                     image
                     and red-tinted curtains on the margins that highlight the importance of cinematic
                     presentation within the film. Ferguson's work becomes more meaningful in comparison,
                     as
                     the visual patterns and contrasts reveal insights into a corpus of films, as seen
                     in his
                     collection of summed images of Disney features, Westerns, and gialli films [<a class="ref" href="#ferguson2016">Ferguson 2016</a>]. Thus we could compare this image to those produced by summing
                     the frames of other MGM musicals, Gene Kelly performances, or Hollywood films from
                     1952.

                     a
                     folder of 925 still images sampling every six seconds of the film — we can perform
                     other
                     operations to see what they might yield. Fellow deformation-minded digital humanist
                     Zach
                     Whalen has developed imj, a tool that allows for straightforward web-based graphical
                     analytics from a corpus of images using three basic tools: plot, montage, and barcode
                     [<a class="ref" href="#whalen2016">Whalen 2016</a>]. Plot is by far the most analytical tool, offering data
                     visualizations to plot an image corpus on a grid with a range of variables to map
                     onto the
                     X and Y axes, including brightness, hue, saturation, and luminance. Not surprisingly,
                     the
                     results create data-driven charts that reveal tendencies and patterns within the film's
                     imagery, but do not produce compelling aesthetic objects in their own rights. The
                     other
                     two tools are more deformatively effective — the montage tool creates a visual grid
                     of the
                     film's frames laid out sequentially. The resulting distillation offers some analytical
                     insights into the scene and shot breakdowns, but moreover it creates an experience
                     that
                     evokes <em class="emph">Singin'</em> as we have never seen it before, simultaneously watching all
                     scenes at once but with a different visualization of temporality than Ferguson's summed
                     frame (see <a href="#figure02">Figure 2</a>). If you know the film, you can identify
                     scenes, dance numbers, and narrative moments from this image, but you can also admire
                     designs that you could never see while watching the film.

                     though <cite class="title italic">Singin' in the Rain</cite> was originally composed of
                     approximately 146,000 still images projected sequentially, these frames were all designed
                     to create the illusion of movement. The deformations I've presented thus far have
                     all
                     excluded movement as a design element, raising the question of how we might deform
                     this
                     set of still images by reintroducing movement into their aesthetic. This question
                     arose in
                     a conversation I had with Ferguson, as we brainstormed how to visualize the process
                     of a
                     summed frame accruing over time. Most processes we explored via video editing programs
                     were underwhelming, as the accumulating image would coalesce into a composite blur
                     after a
                     few seconds, with subsequent developments building up too subtly to notice.<a class="noteRef" href="#d4e365">[2]</a> It became clear to me that a more compelling version would require the
                     images to slowly fade out, creating the effect of a rolling accumulation of images
                     that
                     was too complicated for me to figure out in Adobe Premiere. My solution, like with
                     Ferguson's use of medical imaging software, involved repurposing a tool designed for
                     far
                     different purposes — StarStaX, an image blending program designed for star trail
                     astronomical photography, proved to be the right tool to create the desired effect,
                     and
                     then screen capture the process to create a videographic deformation (see <a href="#figure05">Figure 05</a>).<a class="noteRef" href="#d4e374">[3]</a></div>

                     film's
                     images in two minutes, creating an impressionistic collage effect that highlights
                     color
                     and composition over plot and character. But the image-only version seemed lacking
                     without
                     sound, so I tried to determine what the equivalent for “summed frames”
                     would be for sound. This challenge highlighted a core differential that creates challenges
                     for deformative videographic work: sound lacks clear units like
                     “frames” or “shots,” meaning that the entire
                     soundtrack is more continuous and fluid than the image track. My colleague David Miranda
                     Hardy helped me design a soundtrack that mimicked the frame sampling idea by isolating
                     sounds sequentially from the film, and using reverb effects to evoke the blurred
                     overlapping images. Together, the video creates an evocative experience that clearly
                     derives from the sequential film source, but creates far different aesthetic and affective
                     responses. As with any successful deformation, the work builds on the source material
                     in
                     unexpected ways to create something that feels both derivative and original.

                     GIFs offers new deformative possibilities via spatial montage. Back in 2001, Lev Manovich
                     predicted that “broadband cinema” of the internet era would foreground
                     the multiplicity of frames and screens by juxtaposing images spatially as an alternative
                     to temporal montage [<a class="ref" href="#manovich2001">Manovich 2001</a>, 322–326]. More recently, Catherine
                     Grant has theorized the function of spatial montage in videographic criticism, exploring
                     how the meanings and signifiers coexist and resonate through juxtaposition via
                     split-screen designs [<a class="ref" href="#grant2018b">Grant 2018b</a>]. But applying spatial montage to GIFs
                     pushes away from signification and meaning, as the decontextualized looping images
                     bounce
                     off one another to create affecting, engaging, and surprising compositions; as Jen
                     Malkowski has productively analyzed, such compositions are popular in fan communities
                     in
                     the form of GIFsets, where users of sites like Tumblr create and curate carefully
                     arranged
                     groupings of GIFs to express affective connections between looping motion sequences.
                     As
                     Malkowski suggests, “Spatial montage displays multiple moving images
                     on screen at once, granting the work's maker new powers of artistic juxtaposition
                     and
                     its viewer access to a broader and more complex visual field”
                     [<a class="ref" href="#malkowski2017">Malkowski 2017</a>]. Thus we might imagine a GIFset as a site of deformative
                     possibility to create new ways to experience <em class="emph">Singin' in the Rain</em>'s

                     them in a three-by-three GIFset, I focused on juxtaposing mode of motion that seemed
                     to
                     interact in interesting ways, considering both camera movement and the choreographed
                     bodies of the performers. One of the interesting effects of the GIFset results from
                     the
                     varying lengths of each GIF, creating a phase effect among the repetitions of the
                     loops
                     that diverges over time. As the loops shift their sync, we can see unexpected resonances
                     between the motions in neighboring frames, making the viewing experience quite variable,
                     as spatial montage structures the productively arbitrary temporality.

                     the
                     video in a grid and copying clips to mimic the looping effect, thus providing an
                     opportunity to add a soundtrack. Given the choreographic content of the GIFs, I excerpted,
                     looped, and layered one of Gene Kelly's “Gotta Dance” lines
                     from “Broadway Melody” to create what feels like a hypnotic, if
                     arhythmic, sonic collage to accompany the grid of dancers (see <a href="#figure11">Figure 11</a>).

                     to the
                     musical number “Beautiful Girl” is the film's most chaotic,
                     random, and arbitrary sequence, with snippets of technicolor dancing and singing to
                     a
                     patchwork of early movie musical numbers, created in tribute to 1930s Busby Berkeley
                     musicals. I chose nine different visual moments and created a looped grid, allowing
                     the
                     audio to loop in a cacophonous sonic overlay (see <a href="#figure12">Figure
                        12</a>). By making the film's strangest moments even stranger, the effect is certainly
                     overwhelming and not necessarily pleasant, but seems to capture something of the
                     original's disorienting tone.

                     “You Were Meant for Me” and the opening credit sequence at
                     twenty-four frames-per-second grouped into folders for each shot from the film. He
                     then
                     experimented with ten different ImageJ algorithms to perform “edge
                     detection” operations on each set of stills, creating a variety of effects
                     that resemble hand-drawn animation and other abstractions that emphasized the edges
                     of the
                     characters and set. Ferguson reassembled the video by placing the grouped still frames
                     in
                     sequence on top of the soundtrack in a video editor, literally animating the
                     edge-abstracted images to reconstitute the film. The effect is a marvel of motion
                     and
                     blank space, provoking thoughts on how we perceive and constitute movement via cinema,
                     while creating moments of expressive beauty hidden in the original film. Additionally,
                     knowing the underlying process helps us remember the materiality of moving cinematic
                     images as successive still frames, a digital transformation that evokes the analog

                     in
                     a cinematic dance sequence entails. Certainly much of the beauty in <cite class="title italic">Singin' in the Rain</cite>'s choreography involves the coordination of moving bodies
                     and moving cameras, as many of the GIFs highlight. But what if we force ourselves
                     to focus
                     more on bodies, and specifically body parts in motion — what will we see differently?
                     With
                     that question in mind, I deformed one of the film's most iconic dance numbers, the

                     movements in rhythm to his disembodied voice. To me, the effect of the video is cartoony,
                     bringing out the animation inherent in dance, but in a more playful and almost inhuman
                     way
                     than Ferguson's “Edge” video. While we watch these body parts
                     in motion, we see them as animated shapes on a black background, where the edges of
                     the
                     mask become noticeable much like Ferguson emphasizes the edges of the dancers' bodies.

                     Rombes's “10/40/70” project [<a class="ref" href="#mittell2019">Mittell 2019</a>]
                     [<a class="ref" href="#rombes2014">Rombes 2014</a>]. Rombes's protocol juxtaposes three still frames from a
                     feature film, from the arbitrary 10, 40, and 70 minute marks, to see what meanings
                     and
                     insights might emerge; my videographic version compiles the shots that occur at those
                     minute markers to create a short film composed of three arbitrary but chronological
                     shots
                     (See <a href="#figure15">Figure 15</a>).

                  <div class="ptext" id="p27">The three shots do present an effective mini-narrative, focused on Don's romantic
                     life
                     starting with the flashback scene of Don initially meeting Lena and her rebuffed attempt
                     to silently court him once he is promoted from stuntman to movie star. The next shot
                     is
                     coincidentally the longest take in the entire film, as Don and Kathy escalate their
                     romance while walking across the studio lot and he assures her that he's not involved
                     with
                     Lena. The sequence ends with a shot of Don gleefully dancing in the rain, celebrating
                     his
                     joy over finding love with Kathy. While this brief deformation lacks the interesting
                     insights that some of the other videographic 10/40/70 examples I discussed in my earlier
                     essay, it does highlight how the combination of arbitrary shots can create meaning
                     and

                     organized into shots. In Premiere, I segmented the entire film into its component
                     376
                     shots (splitting dissolves and wipes in the middle of the transition) to create a
                     corpus
                     to experiment with. Although we don't typically think of a video editing platform
                     like
                     Premiere as a database, it effectively is — subclips are actually just metadata entries
                     referencing the original video to indicate timecode in and out points, as well as
                     any
                     other effects or transformations. Because Premiere can include some of this metadata
                     in
                     its view of a folder of clips, it was easy to sort the 376 shots ascending by length
                     with
                     a single click; then I gathered the clips into a sequence that re-organizes the entire
                     film by ascending length of shots (see <a href="#figure16">Figure 16</a>).

                     by
                     shot length, yielding some intriguing moments. The video certainly starts frenetically,
                     with fifty-nine shots in the first two minutes — many of these come from the “Beautiful Girl” number, the film's most disjointed, chaotic, and
                     quick-cut sequence. The early moments are often amusing, with massive tonal shifts
                     and odd
                     juxtapositions, such as the audience reaction shots responding to random dance moves
                     or
                     lines; at around 1:30, a number of shots from <em class="emph">The Dancing Cavalier</em> premiere
                     create a disjointed version of Lena's attempt to sing in front of an audience. As
                     the
                     shots increase in length, some of the arbitrary juxtapositions become more interesting,
                     as
                     with the cinematically reflexive sequence starting at 9:50, featuring shots of
                     <em class="emph">Variety</em> newspaper headlines, the closing “The
                     End” title, the opening credit of <em class="emph">The Dueling Cavalier</em>, and the MGM
                     lion, all intercut with random shots from the film lasting around seven seconds each.
                     At
                     43:00, a sequence emerges with shots lasting around twenty-six seconds that sandwich
                     two
                     moments from Kathy and Don's first tempestuous meeting around their final kiss, contrasted
                     with Don performing with the film's other two fictional romantic partners (Lena and
                     the
                     unnamed dancer played by Cyd Charisse), and the film's final shot of the happy couple
                     looking at their own billboard for the film-within-a-film; while not narratively coherent,
                     these arbitrary juxtapositions driven by shot length create a more compelling set
                     of
                     contrasts than the 10/40/70 sequence.

                     as the feeling of random disjuncture overwhelms any sense of continuity. However,
                     for some
                     reason this is by far my most-watched video on Vimeo with over 11,000 views as of
                     July
                     2020, vastly exceeding full-fledged video essays that have been broadly disseminated
                     and
                     shorter experiments that seem more poised to go viral. It's hard to identify what
                     the
                     appeal of this deformative take on the entire film might be, but seemingly it has
                     attracted an audience — the one theory I can imagine is that people are stumbling
                     upon it
                     while searching for an online version of the full film, although that does not explain
                     how
                     the video registers an average of 20% of the 100 minutes viewed and more than 100
                     “finished” viewings.<a class="noteRef" href="#d4e676">[4]</a></div>

                  <div class="ptext" id="p31">The biggest insight that I gained from this experiment comes toward the end of the
                     video
                     — prior to sorting by shot length, I had assumed that the longest takes in
                     <em class="emph">Singin'</em> would be within dance numbers, as the moving camera would capture
                     the choreography without frequent editing.<a class="noteRef" href="#d4e684">[5]</a>
                     However, only one of the nine longest shots to conclude this video is from a musical
                     number; the rest are lengthy dialogue sequences. The longest shot of almost two minutes,
                     as mentioned before, follows Don and Kathy through the studio lot and thus feels
                     choreographed without music, but the others (all longer than a minute) include the
                     Kathy
                     driving Don in her car, Don and Lena's red carpet interview at the start of the film,
                     the
                     cast rehearsing the dialogue scene in <em class="emph">Dueling Cavalier</em>, and numerous
                     discussions behind the scenes debating the film studio's next moves. I decided to
                     capture
                     this insight by creating another deformation highlighting these nine longest takes
                     in
                     tandem (see Video 8).

                     and thus a realm ripe for deformation. Since video editing platforms like Premiere
                     can
                     easily change the duration of a video by speeding it up or slowing it down, this is
                     a
                     useful tool for deforming footage. As I outlined in my 2019 essay, one way that speed
                     can
                     deform a film is by creating an “equalized pulse” that remaps the time
                     of every shot to match the sequence's average shot length [<a class="ref" href="#mittell2019">Mittell 2019</a>]. In
                     that essay, I deformed a number of films and scenes this way to chart a range of outcomes;
                     here we can look at a number of different sequences from a single film whose equalized
                     pulses are suggestive.

                     but this is a true endurance test (see <a href="#figure18">Figure 18</a>). Many of
                     the moments are overwhelmingly strange, such as the opening sequence of the “Beautiful Girl” number starting at the thirty-three-minute mark,
                     where the montage of quick shots that runs just fifty seconds in the original film
                     drags
                     out in super slow-motion over five minutes. Other segments provide compelling contrasts,
                     as the sequence starting at the thirty-one-minute mark: Don and Lena are shooting
                     the
                     silent version of <em class="emph">Dueling Cavalier</em> as Simpson runs in to announce the
                     transition to sound in hyperspeed. The film cuts to Lena speaking in super slow-motion,
                     distorting her already unacceptable voice before lingering on the dismayed reaction
                     of the
                     male characters. Another interesting sequence is at the fifty-three-minute mark, as
                     the
                     test screening deforms the audience members mocking the glitchy film, making their
                     reactions even more strange and unexpected than the failed screening itself. This
                     deformation can also redirect our attention, as at the forty-three-minute mark in
                     the
                     lead-up to the “You Were Meant for Me” number — the longest
                     take in the film flies by, which draws our attention to the movement through the studio
                     space rather than the dialogue or performances. In the soundstage, some slow shots
                     highlight Kathy and Don's emotions as they launch into the song and romance, but the
                     sped-up song, compressing a four-minute number into a single minute, directs our attention
                     to the camera movement and blocking within the space, more than the subtleties of
                     the song
                     and dance.

                     music and dance. When each shot conforms to a single length, the music contracts or
                     expands to fill the equalized length, and thus creates strange and often compelling
                     moments of unintended oddity.

                     radical juxtapositions, as with the opening few shots where the opening shot of Don's
                     singing sprints through at 387% speed, followed by a pan through the crowd at a glacial
                     12% speed (see <a href="#figure19">Figure 19</a>). These strange contrasts highlight

                     highlight how there is some editing variability in the original sequence — the famous
                     shot
                     of Kelly twirling on the street gets drawn out to 35% speed, allowing us to linger
                     on his
                     expressions and command of the space. This shot is followed by Kelly dancing along
                     the
                     curb at 128% speed, highlighting the playful comedy of his joyful splashing. While

                     as the
                     audio track is continuous and unbroken, and thus hard to quantify. One way that audio
                     might guide a similar equalization experiment would be to focus on the number of words
                     spoken or sung, and then equalize a sequence to a standard number of words per temporal
                     unit. How might such an audio-driven equalized pulse differ from one based on video

                     equalizing twenty-four words to the same pulse as the film's average shot length of
                     16.4
                     seconds — twenty-four words was an arbitrary number, but inspired by the film's
                     twenty-four frames per second rate. Thus I broke up the sequence into subclips by
                     cutting
                     after every twenty-four words in the scene (using the caption track to help quantify
                     words), and then treating each subclip as a “shot” to be equalized. By
                     juxtaposing these two equalizations, where the speed of each subclip changes at the
                     same
                     time every 16.4 seconds, we can contrast the relative rates of video editing and audio
                     speaking/singing in this number (see <a href="#figure22">Figure 22</a>). Most
                     notably, the word rate is faster than average for most of the song, as every clip
                     is
                     slowed down on the audio equalized pulse for the first three minutes of the video;
                     however, the final three shots compress the final 2:20 of the number into only fifty
                     seconds, with one dance-heavy clip playing at 619% in order to squeeze twenty-four
                     words
                     into 16.4 seconds. While this experiment helps highlight how words are distributed
                     unequally in a musical number, ultimately the deformative impact is not significantly
                     different than the equalized pulse driven by visual editing.

                     as
                     changing a clip's speed is a noticeable and often playful deformation. Many deformative
                     possibilities are already widespread in the wilderness of online meme culture, where
                     fans
                     mess with popular culture in transformative and imaginative ways; while such memes

                     be designed to lead to scholarly insight, like with GIFs, we can adopt such pre-existing
                     fan strategies to see what deformative possibilities might arise. One meme that I
                     felt
                     could be aptly applied to videographic deformation is what might be called the
                     “but faster” video: a film or music video gets faster every time
                     something specific is said or happens onscreen. Allegedly started by a video called
                     “The Entire <em class="emph">Bee Movie</em> but every time it says ‘bee’ it
                     speeds up by 15%”, the trend has been applied broadly to many sources to create a
                     range of playful and often silly deformed videos [<a class="ref" href="#dahir2016">Dahir 2016</a>].

                     splitting the frame vertically and reducing the scale of the left half (see <a href="#figure24">Figure 24</a>). She further deforms the sequence by slightly
                     slowing it down and replacing the original music with contemporary electronica, but
                     the
                     core visual deformation of scale has the most notable impact — we see the dance space
                     as
                     fractured and made strange, while the duo navigates the space by transforming their
                     relative scale. The most notable moments are when Astaire and Charisse are on opposite
                     sides of the split, thereby shrinking one of them until they swap sides to rescale
                     themselves, as at the four-minute mark. When I viewed this, I immediately began to

                  <div class="ptext" id="p45">I chose “Good Morning” to deform through Grant's scaled
                     approach because it was the dance number that most consistently matched her design,
                     with
                     multiple dancers distributed horizontally across the frame in an interesting architectural
                     space. Because this trio required a triptych approach, I broke the frame into thirds
                     and
                     scaled them proportionately to mimic Grant's effect. The resulting deformative video
                     is
                     particularly satisfying when the three characters line up evenly into the scaled zones,
                     as
                     at the three-minute mark, or when they cross between zones to grow and shrink, as
                     at the
                     one-minute mark. The choreography places Kathy in the center for most of the number,
                     with
                     the two men orbiting around her with more advanced dance moves (as Debbie Reynolds
                     was a
                     novice dancer when cast in the film). Aptly Gene Kelly towers over his co-stars at
                     the
                     largest scale for most of the number, as he was not only the film's star but also
                     its
                     co-director and choreographer — and he was particularly unkind to Reynolds in rehearsing
                     and shooting this number, with harsh criticism of her dancing and a late-night shoot
                     that
                     caused her feet to bleed [<a class="ref" href="#saunders2016">Saunders 2016</a>]. This scaled triptych calls
                     attention to the relative power of the performers in the frame in a way that maps
                     the
                     behind-the-scenes struggles onto the effortless footage.

                     new.
                     Another approach seeks to use deformative methods to reconstruct the space as it was
                     during the film's shoot. A version of this deformative method can be seen in Jeff
                     Desom's
                     impressive “<em class="emph">Rear Window</em> Timelapse”
                     [<a class="ref" href="#desom2012">Desom 2012</a>]. Whereas Desom reconstructs that film's apartment building as a
                     compiled static image with embedded footage throughout the film's run, I am more
                     interested in simultaneously visualizing the film footage and camera movement to create
                     an
                     original spatial reconstruction. I applied this method to “You Were
                     Meant for Me,” the musical number that takes place in a mostly empty soundstage
                     and with fairly simple choreography (but complex camera movement) through that space

                     movement and cinematic space. By moving the frame through the cinematic space as it
                     follows the dancers, it disrupts our perception of camera movement — the viewpoint
                     feels
                     fixed with a variable frame, rather than our standard perception of a fixed frame
                     with a
                     moving camera viewpoint. The frame moving through cinematic space directs our attention
                     to
                     the soundstage more than the dancers, as we come to expect the sparse props to appear
                     in
                     the same spot on the screen (which is also how I mapped the shots to reference points
                     like
                     the ladder and fan). The choreography becomes about moving through the space and guiding
                     the frame, rather than the camera following the dancers.

                     challenging for most viewers to truly intuit that it is remapping the camera movement
                     as a
                     shifting frame visualizing the soundstage. Thus I created a side-by-side version,
                     comparing the original footage with the moving frame deformation (see <span class="error"><a href="#figure27">Figure 27</a></span>). Although this juxtaposition loses the disorienting
                     power of the standalone video, it does highlight the analytical dimensions of the
                     deformation, revealing the camera movement in ways that are hard to discern in the
                     original. While it is hard to imagine such a deformation working for most scenes,
                     it is
                     well suited to reveal the spatial possibilities of the empty soundstage in this

                     audio, whether via camera movement, editing pacing, or single frames. Largely this
                     emphasis stems from the difficulty in breaking the audio channel of a film into discrete
                     units that might be algorithmically manipulated; despite the fact that the production
                     and
                     post-production of a film actually uses separate tracks for audio much more than video,
                     the final product provides only a sophisticated mix of audio elements that are challenging
                     to separate. The mixed audio track is easy to manipulate, as editing platforms offer
                     dozens of effects we might apply to the soundtrack, from equalization to reverb to
                     distortion. However in my experiments, such manipulations do little than create a
                     sonic
                     mess without revealing any insights into the clips or creating a compelling aesthetic
                     object on its own. But I certainly believe that sound is the realm of deformation
                     that
                     needs more expansion and development, and I offer two more experiments with the caveat
                     that these are far from exemplary of the wide-ranging possibilities of sonic deformation
                     that might be explored in the future.

                     remix culture to deform films. One sound-driven remix protocol focuses on alphabetizing
                     footage by the words spoken and/or sung to create an algorithmic pattern that is both
                     predictable and arbitrary. An early example of this approach is “Of Oz
                     the Wizard”, an alphabetized version of the entire <em class="emph">The Wizard of Oz</em>
                     which Matt Bucy first made in 2004, but became an online sensation in 2016 [<a class="ref" href="#vanderwerff2016">VanDerWerff 2016</a>]. While watching the entire film this way is an endurance
                     challenge, there are moments where the effect is truly impressive — for instance,
                     the
                     section for W starting at the 1:31:00 mark charts through many iconic words
                     (“wicked,”
                     “witch,”
                     “wizard”) as well as common ones (“we,”
                     “with”) to create a mosaic of the film that has some coherence but also
                     reveals new rhythmic patterns and intriguing juxtapositions. Similar full-film effects
                     can
                     be seen in “ARST ARSW: <cite class="title italic">Star Wars</cite>
                     alphabetized”, as well as smaller-scale alphabetized songs, such as Toto's “Africa” or, because it's meme culture, Smash Mouth's “All Star”.

                  <div class="ptext" id="p51">I chose “Moses Supposes” as the number to alphabetize, as the
                     tongue-twisting song about wordplay seemed best suited to reorganize in a way that
                     plays
                     with words (see <a href="#figure28">Figure 28</a>). The effect is certainly playful,
                     as common short words like “a” and “his” blur into a
                     rapid-fire hard to discern sequence, especially because in the original song such
                     words
                     are practically swallowed in the fast-paced patter rhythm; however, longer repeated
                     words
                     like “erroneously” or “supposes” standout in
                     pleasurable sequences charting their different articulations in the song. To me, the
                     effect of this alphabetized video is to highlight how the words and their performance
                     create the playful tone of the number, deemphasizing the excellent choreography that
                     more
                     obviously drives the energy of the original.<a class="noteRef" href="#d4e1064">[7]</a></div>

                     layering possibilities of sound. McCormick and Powell take a full season of a television
                     series and simultaneously play the audio of all episodes at once, creating a chaotic
                     experience of simultaneity. While most of these sound collages foreground dialogue
                     and
                     sound effects, musical moments shine through the chaos, as with the phased instances
                     of
                     Iris DeMent's theme song “Let the Mystery Be” toward the start
                     of their deformation of <em class="emph">The Leftovers</em> season two. For a comparatively sparse
                     sonic series like <em class="emph">Leftovers</em>, many lines of dialogue or sound effects stand
                     out in this layered deformation, triggering memories for fans who know the season
                     well.
                     <em class="emph">Seinfeld</em> season nine offers a very different experience, as the sonic
                     layers are far messier, with the iconic bass riffs and audience laughter sufficiently
                     obscuring nearly all recognizable dialogue, until the twenty-three-minute mark when
                     most
                     episodes end, but the extra-long series finale endures alone to be heard clearly.

                     episode to create a layered version from <cite class="title italic">Singin'</cite> (see <a href="#figure29">Figure 29</a>). With fourteen discrete numbers (including multiple
                     versions of the title song) playing at once, we experience sonic chaos punctuated
                     by some
                     sounds that stand out, such as the high-pitched singing in “All I Do
                     is Dream of You,” the loud repeated calls of “Moses”
                     at the one-minute mark, or periodic refrains of “Gotta Dance.”
                     The instrumentation can also become notable, when brass or drums burst through the
                     chaos
                     to offer recognizable fanfares and beats. The sonic collage becomes more discernible
                     as

                     more details from the performances, and creating more specific interplay between numbers.
                     By the four-minute mark, all songs have ended except “Broadway

                     design
                     to reveal potential visual insights. Given that layering video is much more difficult
                     than
                     audio, and my attempts to create layers of opacity resulted in simply an undistinguished

                     arranged chronologically across the frame. This approach reveals some of the dancing
                     and
                     physical performance presented within each number, yet makes the individual sequences
                     hard
                     to discern until adjacent numbers end to reveal more of each sequence. There are some
                     fun
                     juxtapositions, as at 1:55 when Kathy and Don appear to be dancing together in adjoining
                     clips from “Good Morning” and “Singin' in

                  <div class="ptext" id="p55">The “Listen to TV” collages all start simultaneously, with the
                     episodes ending in a more staggered timing, an approach I mimicked for my layered
                     numbers
                     deformation; however, I also made an “additive” version where the
                     fourteen numbers all end simultaneously instead, and thus appear in order of descending
                     length (see <a href="#figure30">Figure 30</a>). The effect of this version is to
                     start with more comprehensible moments, emphasizing the interplay between “Broadway Melody” and “Beautiful Girl,”
                     until new layers emerge over the course of the video. At the one-minute mark, we start
                     to
                     hear more from “Make 'Em Laugh” and “Good
                     Morning” before the sonic chaos becomes overwhelming. The closing seconds are
                     rewarding, as we hear how many numbers end with boisterous cadences out of the
                     polyrhythmic stew of the final minute. Neither of these two versions is
                     “correct,” but highlights how changing one variable or parameter in a
                     deformation can create another iteration that is potentially as impactful as the
                     original.

                     are not offered as a comprehensive list of what might be done with the film or any
                     other
                     source text. I offer them each as small (or sometimes long) curiosities that might
                     inspire
                     future experiments or provoke insights into a familiar film. In teaching and presenting
                     videographic criticism, I often suggest that one key impact of any successful videographic
                     piece is to help people see and hear a source film through the eyes and ears of the
                     critic, conveying a new perspective on a text. Deformative videographic work also
                     allows
                     us to see and hear a familiar film in a new way, but one that reveals new perspectives
                     to
                     both the critic and the audience. I did not perform any of these experiments with
                     a clear
                     idea of how they might turn out, and I was usually surprised at what was revealed
                     (or what
                     did not work at all). As critics, we too often approach a case study with our conclusions
                     already drawn, eager to apply existing theoretical paradigms or critical assumptions
                     to a
                     new instance that proves our predetermined point. Deformative criticism is a reminder
                     of
                     the joys of discovery, finding something distinct and refreshing even within the most
                     familiar film, breaking apart our critical preconceptions to point us toward new,
                     strange
                     pathways. That seems like an apt mission for digital approaches to audiovisual
                     criticism.
