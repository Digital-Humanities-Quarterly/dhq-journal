                  <p>Digital public history has emerged as a powerful tool for addressing difficult pasts
                     with concerned communities in an 
                     ethical way. This paper focuses on the ethical issues at stake in co-producing digital
                     historical knowledge about 
                     resistance to slavery in a web documentary that involved identifying and naming marginalised
                     populations in 
                     Mali, increasingly at risk of violence. The web documentary aims to bridge the gap between
                     endogenous 
                     historical resistance to enslaved people and modern anti-slavery activism, while also
                     addressing issues of funding, 
                     authority tensions, and asymmetrical relations, in which the digital gap presented
                     specific challenges. In the process, 
                     we report on a case of dialogue among researchers, practitioners, and village participants,
                     and we expose the ethical 
                     implications of digital research and citizen intervention related to past and present
                     slavery in 
                     Africa.

                     public shaming of the people considered “descendants of enslaved populations” and the 
                     disappearance over time of the few indirect witnesses still able to tell the story
                     of their enslaved grandparents 
                     [<a class="ref" href="#rodet2010">Rodet 2010</a>]. Yet understanding this history is crucial in a context where tensions surrounding
                     
                     descent-based slavery have arisen in Mali since 2018.

                  <div class="ptext" id="p2">Slavery existed in the Sahel before the Transatlantic slave trade and endured beyond its abolitions. 
                     In the 19th century, Kayes in western Mali was a major transit zone of slave caravans and 
                     experienced an expansion of internal slavery through war and conflict. French authorities
                     abolished the internal slave 
                     trade in their West African colonies in 1905 as they searched to recruit liberated
                     enslaved people for forced labour. 
                     They soon turned a blind eye on the continuation of what they called “domestic slavery”, 
                     pretending it had simply transformed into salary contract work thanks to the colonial
                     legislation 
                     [<a class="ref" href="#camara_etal2021a">Camara et al. 2021a</a>]. Descendant of those enslaved people continued to inherit “slave 
                     status” and their labour remained controlled by the local historical ruling class with the
                     complicity of the 
                     colonial and postcolonial state, a system that allowed historical hierarchies to persist
                     to present day in the form 
                     of what is henceforth called “descent-based slavery”.

                  <div class="ptext" id="p3">Despite the patchy implementation of the 1905 abolition decree on the ground, some
                     formerly enslaved people 
                     managed to take their destinies into their own hands, escaping a violent institution
                     to live freely in independent 
                     communities such as Bouillagui in western Mali. But this history has remained largely 
                     silenced as the colonial and local ideologies prevailing at the time of abolition
                     endured in the postcolonial period 
                     which has prevented the stigma of slavery from disappearing. On one hand, although
                     the region experienced successive 
                     waves of emancipation in the colonial and postcolonial eras, descent-based slavery
                     continued under disguised forms of 
                     kinship, marriage, and adoption/fosterage [<a class="ref" href="#rodet2013">Rodet 2013</a>]. On the other hand, the historical ruling class 
                     remained largely in power despite abolition and independence and thus continued to
                     exercise control over defining 
                     what a society of “freemen” had to be [<a class="ref" href="#rodet2010">Rodet 2010</a>] [<a class="ref" href="#rodet2013">Rodet 2013</a>]. In such a context, 
                     confining the history of slavery to a “public secret” well into the postcolonial era was most likely a necessary 
                     step in conveying an authoritative national identity. Today, poverty and discrimination
                     continue to exclude Malians 
                     with ascribed “slave status” from social mobility and to restrict their agency about how their history is being
                     
                     told in the public space. Conversely, the elite continues to benefit from their ostracization
                     and exploitation by 
                     ruling the moral economy of honour and shame [<a class="ref" href="#camara_etal2021b">Camara et al. 2021b</a>] [<a class="ref" href="#iliffe2005">Iliffe 2005</a>].

                  <div class="ptext" id="p4">Postcolonial Mali has never criminalized descent-based slavery, despite the numerous advocacy campaigns
                     
                     conducted by Malian human rights and anti-slavery organizations. Mali has certainly signed up to the 
                     major international conventions banning slavery (including the UN International Declaration
                     on Human Rights) and 
                     passed a law criminalizing international trafficking in 2012. More recently, slavery
                     has been made a criminal offense 
                     in the criminal code in Mali, but its definition is still based on the idea of property and thus cannot 
                     capture the complexities of descent-based slavery as a web of socio-economic subjugation
                     and control that does not 
                     necessarily manifest in overt physical violence. Perpetrators of descent-based slavery
                     can thus still only be 
                     prosecuted if physical violence has occurred. The continued amnesia on the history
                     of slavery and fraught political 
                     environment in today's Mali contribute to the state's inability or unwillingness to understand 
                     descent-based slavery as a contemporary manifestation of slavery [<a class="ref" href="#camara_etal2021b">Camara et al. 2021b</a>].

                     offering new ways to engage, 
                     share, and understand collective heritage histories for the longer term. In 2018,
                     we began working on the digital 
                     public history research project “Visualising Liberté”, which was intended to explore the 
                     history of the village of Bouillagui in western Mali. Bouillagui has a very 
                     specific history: its founders liberated themselves from slavery at the beginning
                     of the twentieth century. Despite 
                     the general taboo still surrounding slavery in West Africa, the people of Bouillagui are 
                     very proud of their history, and they were particularly keen to share it within the
                     framework of our digital history 
                     project recounting the specific histories of the struggle for freedom and resistance
                     and rebellion against slavery.

                  <div class="ptext" id="p6">“Visualising Liberté” was conceived as a transmedia research project: the villagers were 
                     given mobile phones and trained to make short video reportages about their village
                     history, which would become the 
                     narrative basis for a graphic novel, an animation film, and a web documentary. The
                     web documentary itself was also 
                     conceived as a transmedia digital object, in which associated fragments of this history
                     of resistance to slavery were 
                     collected over the previous decade of research conducted by Marie Rodet in multiple media (audio, 
                     textual documents, video, photographs, etc.) with the new videos made by the villagers
                     themselves. All this was pieced 
                     together into a single new digital media platform and made accessible to various audiences,
                     in the form of the 2020

                     the COVID-19 pandemic still strongly impacted the co-production dynamic. More importantly,

                     (negative) impact of our

                     ago, public history works to make history-making largely accessible to large audiences
                     while increasingly using various 
                     forms of collaborative, participatory research and communication processes, including

                     and emancipation in the Kayes region (1890–1940) in Mali and following a first experience of 
                     public history through a film in which Bouillagui's history was already partly featured 
                     [<a class="ref" href="#rodet2020">Rodet 2020</a>]. Rodet's first interviews in Bouillagui date back to 2009. When we 
                     began “Visualising Liberté” in 2018, the history of internal slavery had long been a taboo 
                     subject in West Africa, but there was a demand from local communities in Kayes (western 
                     Mali) to know and understand better this difficult past. Populations with ascribed “slave status” are 
                     still discriminated against and stigmatised today, though the younger generations
                     are less aware or understanding of 
                     the underlying reasons. Many of the victims of descent-based slavery are also among
                     the most vulnerable to economic 
                     uncertainties and thus at continuous risk of being subjected to further exploitation,
                     with new forms of servitude 
                     strongly overlapping with the legacies of historical slavery [<a class="ref" href="#rodet2016">Rodet 2016</a>] [<a class="ref" href="#rodet_etal2021a">Rodet et al. 2021</a>]. 
                     The main goals of “Visualising Liberté” were to capitalise upon historical resistance to 
                     slavery in Kayes to produce visual material for the young generations and to raise awareness about
                     slavery 
                     and its complex legacies in Mali, while also bridging the gap between historical resistance to slavery and 
                     contemporary anti-slavery activism.

                     slavery, in which descent-based slavery creates a terrain for a continuum of violence.
                     It is the banalization of 
                     descent-based slavery and its violence which trivializes next-door exploitation and

                     of colonial 
                     abolition of slavery, but rebelled against slavery on their own terms, in some cases
                     violently, and obtained equality 
                     through liberating themselves. Similar self-liberation movements would also be followed
                     by other enslaved populations, 
                     initiating a series of migratory waves to escape slavery during the twentieth century

                     This history needed to be named and taught, to help in the fight for human rights
                     and against other forms of modern 
                     exploitation. The timing of the project was particularly crucial, as Mali had been encountering at the time 
                     deep political, economic, and social crises for almost a decade at the time, a situation
                     that risked increasing further 
                     discrimination and exploitation of already marginalised communities. What we did not
                     predict was that the rapidly 
                     deteriorating political situation in Mali would effectively prove our hypothesis of increased risk for 
                     these populations immediately in the first year of our project (though independently
                     of it). The history of slavery has 
                     since been more widely discussed in Mali in the public space, following peaks of violence against these 
                     populations since 2018 and for which the victims have regularly been blamed until
                     recently. We will return to the 
                     specific impacts of this latter aspect on our project in Section 4 below. For now,

                     — namely, the risk of delegating the production of research materials and the collection
                     of data to 
                     “invisible third parties” [<a class="ref" href="#bertho_etal2022">Bertho et al. 2022</a>]. Marie Rodet was 
                     prevented from travelling again to Mali before the end of the project, which made face-to-face activities 
                     crucial to the co-production of the web documentary impossible. Many of the project's
                     other activities were then led by 
                     Donkosira — albeit in close collaboration with Marie Rodet via social media — while an effort 
                     was made to prevent Donkosira's members from becoming “instrument-bodies” used 
                     remotely to access difficult terrain [<a class="ref" href="#bisoka2020">Bisoka 2020</a>]. This autonomy, reinforced by the constraints of the 
                     pandemic, still enabled Donkosira to experiment with research techniques and strengthen their knowledge of 
                     local history, both theoretical and practical. Importantly, the designation from the
                     outset of the project of 
                     Donkosira as the main partner, with their own allocated budget in a legally binding collaboration
                     agreement 
                     with the School of Oriental and African Studies (SOAS) at the University of London, nonetheless greatly 
                     mitigated the risk of the Donkosira team's invisibilisation in the process. Mamadou Séne Cissé 
                     conducted two workshops in Bouillagui with school children, further supported the villagers in making their 
                     video reports about the history of Bouillagui, and conducted additional interviews with elders in the 
                     community, while also regularly organising large-screen screenings on the main village
                     square of the historical material 
                     produced within the framework of the project. Ultimately, the web documentary was
                     also screened with live translation 
                     when necessary in Bouillagui in November 2020. Everyone was able to recognise themselves or their relatives 
                     and friends and further discuss the different aspects of Bouillagui's history.

                     While the authority was shared in producing the public history narrative at the origin
                     of the web documentary, the 
                     project struggled to escape completely the classic mechanisms of practical and symbolic
                     inequality in researcher–villager 
                     relations, conditions exacerbated by the consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic. The
                     villagers could not be directly 
                     involved in the final stages of the production of the web documentary, which was thus
                     not designed by them but instead 
                     was produced online between the United Kingdom and France by Marie Rodet — with

                     remediated and translated

                     in 2018. Our initial main concern 
                     was to explore how to engage with different audiences using the digital media and
                     narratives produced with the villagers 
                     within the framework of this project. As the media had been co-produced by different
                     authors, we aimed at offering an 
                     overarching narrative piecing together polyvocal perspectives while making the material
                     accessible to a large audience. 
                     Yet, a specific event made us feel strongly about the pressing need for a rapid alternative
                     publishing platform solution. 
                     The Kayes public archives, which we had helped salvage a decade earlier with Mariam Coulibaly 
                     (and which had not been digitised), were reduced to ashes at the height of a very
                     restrictive COVID-19 lockdown that 
                     fueled widespread discontent and large-scale mob protests in Kayes in the spring of 2020

                     unfold in the conditions of the 
                     COVID-19 pandemic, we decided to make a web documentary with digital storytelling
                     professionals who would produce such 
                     output in a timely manner. In addition, the web documentary seemed compatible with
                     the initial idea of writing bottom-up 
                     history with the community. Its architecture could easily accommodate transmediation
                     (multiple media use) and remediation 
                     (change of media), while acknowledging the intrinsic shared authority of the narratives
                     that had been produced through 
                     the active dialogue between historical expertise and experience [<a class="ref" href="#frisch1990">Frisch 1990</a>] [<a class="ref" href="#frisch2011">Frisch 2011</a>]. 
                     Indeed, the web documentary offered a polyvocal transmedia narrative of perspectives
                     often missing from conventional 
                     history.

                     the web documentary aimed at changing 
                     the mainstream discourse in Mali — which still mainly featured the negationist voices of the former 
                     enslavers at the time [<a class="ref" href="#camara_etal2021b">Camara et al. 2021b</a>]. Although objectivity is often argued to be a pre-requisite for 
                     the search for historical “truth”, what is hardly considered under such an imperative is the harm that it can 
                     produce by providing “equal” space to all sides of the story, including the aggressors, while not acknowledging
                     
                     how it can reinforce and reinscribe existing systems of oppression and inequality.
                     People with ascribed “slave 
                     status” continue to face systemic and real violence in present-day Mali, and they should feel safe when 
                     co-producing and using digital media in relation to their history. To this end, the
                     recognition of the root causes of 
                     harm, past and present, is essential so that digital media used for research do not
                     reinforce or reproduce 
                     intergenerational trauma and historical harm. On the contrary, they should be transformative
                     by acknowledging and 
                     publicising histories of resilience to slavery. Thus, the project never intended to
                     research conflict narratives or 
                     integrate them into the web documentary, unlike what has been done in other transmedia

                     aesthetic choices and necessary simplification of the message to reach a broad audience.
                     The choice of having an

                     the past as a linear, chronological structure and professionalising history as based
                     on objectivity, scientific 
                     methodologies, and truth, relegated the “practical past” to the realm of “tradition” and colonised societies 
                     were perceived as “a-historical”. The web documentary — by involving Bouillagui villagers as 
                     historical knowledge producers — contributed to decolonising such positivist negation
                     of the multiplicity and

                     such history in recent years in 
                     Mali to the renewed violence against people with ascribed “slave status”, the documentary bridges the

                     for a broad audience, we worked with the Paris-based creative industry firm Narratives, which has 
                     longstanding expertise in audio and visual storytelling. It was their first audio-visual
                     project concerned with African 
                     history. As they were not involved in the initial research process of co-production,
                     their understanding of the project 
                     was primarily centred on the transmediation process and thus about sharing the historian's
                     knowledge and methods (to be 
                     narrated in the form of a voice-over by the historian, which they insisted was needed)
                     with the broader public that — 
                     we realised too late in the process — they perceived mainly as a Western-based audience.

                     first experience with the storytelling creative industry and business-format constraints,
                     which unfortunately allowed 
                     little leeway and no trial-and-error process.

                     its production that the web

                     voices, alongside systematic social media suspensions and the diffusion of fake news
                     to control Malian public opinion. 
                     Since then, Gambana's public perception as “troublemakers” flooding WhatsApp with “irresponsible”, 
                     “anti-social” discourses has nonetheless changed markedly. They have been recognised by the Malian
                     authorities as 
                     a legitimate partner in the fight against slavery. We henceforth play the full version
                     of the web documentary at 
                     public screenings.

                  <div class="ptext" id="p59">Such a situation clearly illustrates how research is an ethical process and digital
                     ethics a moving target: 
                     conflicting narratives can arise as research unfolds, and the end-user's environment
                     may unpredictably change despite 
                     regular risk assessment in the course of the project [<a class="ref" href="#ess2012">Ess 2012</a>]. In the same way, the public for such 
                     a web documentary itself can also change. Although we produced this web documentary
                     with specific audiences in mind, 
                     as discussed previously, until the web documentary is released it is difficult to
                     predict which audiences will really 
                     access and be sensitive to it. Even then, because it is web-based it allows access
                     by a wide range of publics, 
                     heterogenous in terms of class and economic status and political commitments — although,
                     as mentioned earlier, the 
                     digital gap crucially affects the web documentary's effective accessibility by all
                     publics, most notably in 
                     Mali. With digital content, the “politics of reception” is often unpredictable, with no guarantee 
                     that the content will travel well not only within, across, and between cultures, but
                     also over time

                  <div class="ptext" id="p60">This also raises questions about the future of such digital public history projects.
                     On one side, there is increasing 
                     funding pressure for open data — for example, amongst UKRI (UK Research and Innovation)-funded
                     projects in 
                     the United Kingdom, since 2023. On the other side, there is only open-access funding for published papers.
                     
                     There is no funding for alternative digital publication platforms or any research
                     website or digital collection beyond 
                     the lifetime of the funding project. Funding their continued maintenance often requires
                     applying to craete new research 
                     projects that would contribute to enhance parts of the original. We managed to get
                     the web documentary hosted on the 
                     SOAS server with the hope that this would secure its future, but as universities increasingly
                     sub-contract their data 
                     storage to expensive GAFAM “giants” (Alphabet, Amazon, Meta, Apple, Microsoft), while experiencing public budget 
                     cuts, this becomes an issue of cost-effectiveness, where the university decides which
                     data to maintain, which to store 
                     in the cloud, and which to delete — decisions concerning which the researcher is not
                     always consulted.

                  <div class="ptext" id="p61">Furthermore, an online transmedia project such as a web documentary remains fixed
                     in time; it is not meant to be 
                     modified, though the end-users might live in different political, cultural, and social
                     environments that are 
                     fast-changing. Leaving aside the illusion that the digital will allow us to record
                     and retain everything, we should be 
                     mindful as historians that electronic data and the cloud actually require physical
                     storage space and can thus 
                     disappear, just as historical evidence and archives themselves regularly do. If a
                     digital public history website becomes 
                     no longer fit for purpose, as digital ethics also evolve — while the technology to
                     maintain data can easily become 
                     obsolete (our web documentary uses Klynt, an online software to create and publish
                     interactive narratives for the 
                     web)<a class="noteRef" href="#d4e1315">[7]</a> — we should accept letting it 
                     go and take the webpage or website down. We could also consider archiving it with
                     public digital archives, such as with 
                     UK data archives.

                  <div class="ptext" id="p62">With the aim of engaging the past in the present, our digital history project took
                     two main risks at its outset: 
                     conducting a public history project on the still-taboo topic of resistance to slavery
                     in Mali; and betting 
                     on research co-production and shared authority with Bouillagui's villagers through participatory visual 
                     methods, despite the digital gap. As the socio-political context in Mali and also worldwide rapidly changed 
                     over the two years of the project, we did not anticipate all the project's twists
                     and turns. Despite some clear 
                     pitfalls, this was an important step in realising that just as research is a process,
                     so too are ethics: digital 
                     history and storytelling require responsibility toward co-producers and audiences,
                     not only during the research process 
                     but also with the online publication, especially when working with communities who
                     run the risk of sharing their history 
                     of resistance to slavery in contexts that have never properly allowed for these voices
                     to be heard. It is through such 
                     an ethical process, an ethics of care that relies on long-term engagement and commitment,
                     that the transformative 
                     potential of a digital public history project naming slavery can reveal itself. The
                     greater risk for the populations 
                     concerned may not actually lie in telling and publicising such history but in allowing
                     the hegemonic discourses to 
                     continue to silence them. As highlighted by Gardner, engaging in public history is about taking risks and 
                     dealing with unsafe ideas, even in unsafe times, but it is also a risk we should commit
                     to, especially when we have been 
                     entrusted by the concerned communities to name slavery and publicise their history
                     of resistance to it
