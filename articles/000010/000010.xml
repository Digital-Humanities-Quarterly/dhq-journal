         <dhq:abstract>
            <p>Among the alternative kinds of narrative opened up by computer technology, one of
               earliest is interactive fiction (and specifically the <q>text adventure</q> or
                  <q>adventure game</q>), which first came into being in the 1970s. Text-based
               interactive fiction enjoyed a brief period of commercial success in the 1980s until
               it was overtaken by advances in computer graphics, but it continues to be read and
               written by enthusiastic amateurs. Although interactive fiction clearly has roots in
               computer gaming, it also has potential as a new form of literature.</p>
            <p>Since interactive fiction may be a medium unfamiliar to some readers, this article
               will start by defining it, explaining some of its conventions, and outlining its
               origins. It will then describe how one recent piece of interactive fiction, <title
                  rend="quotes">All Hope Abandon</title>, explores aspects of Biblical Studies
               through the medium of IF, and will end by suggesting a number of fruitful links
               between interactive fiction and biblical text. In the course of the article several
               examples from <title rend="quotes">All Hope Abandon</title> will be given, and
               instructions on how to install and play the game will be provided at the end.</p>

            <head>What is Interactive Fiction?</head>
            <p>The term <q>interactive fiction</q> (or IF) can have more than one meaning in the
               context of computer-based storytelling. In this article, however, the term will be
               used in the narrow sense of a turn-based program driven by textual input from the
               player, responding with output that is principally or wholly textual, and involving a
               parser and a world model (two terms which will explained shortly). For the sake of
               brevity, the term <q>game</q> will be used to denote a work of interactive fiction,
               though not all such works are equally ludic, and the reader should not rush to equate
               IF <q>games</q> with the video-games more commonly associated with contemporary
               recreational computing.</p>
            <p>Such a work is <emph>interactive</emph> fiction since it is up to the reader (or
               player) to drive the story forward, usually by directing the actions of the main
               protagonist (known in IF-parlance as the player character, or PC). A work of IF
               typically opens with a brief textual description of the PC’s situation, perhaps also
               giving some indication of the tasks the PC has to perform, or the challenges he or
               she has to overcome, though these may not become apparent until the game gets under
               way. In order to progress through the game the PC must explore his or her
               environment, discover how things work, interact with any other characters in the game
               (known in IF-parlance as non-player characters or NPCs), and often solve a number of
               puzzles. The role of the player is to direct the PC in these tasks by entering
               commands at the keyboard.<note>For other definitions of Interactive Fiction, see e.g.
                     <ref target="#roberts2006">Roberts (2006)</ref>; <ref target="#maher2006">Maher

                     (2003a), vii-xi, 1-35</ref>. For a more thorough analysis of the medium see

            </p>
            <p>Part of the appeal of IF is the illusion that one has complete freedom to type
               anything one likes at the game’s command prompt. It <emph>is</emph> an illusion
               because, although one can indeed type anything one likes, the game will in fact
               understand only a very restricted subset of English (or whatever language the game
               was written in). The commands typically understood by a modern IF parser are largely
               restricted to the following three formats: either a simple imperative verb (such as
               LOOK, which generates a description of the PC’s current location), or an imperative
               verb plus a direct object (such as TAKE THE BLUE BALL, which would cause the PC to
               pick up the blue ball, assuming the action is possible), or an imperative verb plus a
               direct object plus a preposition plus a second or indirect object (such as PUT THE
               BLUE BALL IN THE BROWN BOX). This basic syntax can be slightly extended to allow
               conversing with or giving orders to NPCs; so, for example, FRED, PUT THE BLUE BALL IN
               THE BROWN BOX would be construed as a command to the PC to tell the NPC called Fred
               to put the blue ball in the brown box.</p>
            <p>The role of the <term>parser</term> in interactive fiction is to interpret such
               commands so that the game can either respond to them appropriately, or tell the
               player why it can’t. A modern IF parser is reasonably sophisticated at this task. If
               there is both a red ball and a blue ball in the game, a decent parser will
               nevertheless know what to do with a seemingly ambiguous command like TAKE BALL. If
               only one of the balls is in sight, it will assume that this is the one the player
               meant. If both balls are in sight but the PC is already holding one of them, the
               parser will assume the player meant to refer to the other. Only if the parser is
               unable to resolve the ambiguity in any such way will it ask the player to do so
               (typically by asking a question like <q>Which ball do
                  you mean: the blue ball or the red ball?</q>).</p>
            <p>A more sophisticated parser will also deal automatically with certain implicit
               actions needed to carry the player’s explicit command. For example if the player
               types N (the usual abbreviation for GO NORTH) when going north would take the PC
               through a closed door, a good parser will assume that the player wants the PC to open
               the door first, and will first attempt opening the door as an implicit action, only
               carrying out the main action if the required implicit action succeeds (it may not,
               since the door may be locked or jammed or inaccessible for some reason). Or if the PC
               needs to be holding the blue ball before he can put it in the brown box, then a
               courteous parser will carrying out an implicit TAKE BLUE BALL command when the player
               types PUT BLUE BALL IN BROWN BOX, rather than complaining that the PC needs to be
               holding the blue ball first. Unfortunately, not all parsers achieve this level of
               user-friendliness.</p>
            <p>A modern IF parser works first by identifying what <term>action</term> the player
               intends, and then by resolving the nouns involved in the action. For example, the
               TADS 3 parser (written in the TADS 3 language) first matches the player’s input
               against the grammatical patterns (known as <q>grammar productions</q>) contained in
               the TADS 3 library and the game author’s own code: thus if the player types PUT BALL
               IN BOX the parser first determines that this matches the pattern <code>PUT &lt;noun
                  phrase&gt; IN &lt;noun phrase&gt;</code> and so decides that the current action is
               of type <term>PutInAction</term>.<note>For more details of how TADS 3 uses such
                  grammar productions for pattern matching, see <ref
                     target="http://www.tads.org/t3doc/doc/sysman/gramprod.htm."
                     >http://​www.tads.org/​t3doc/​doc/​sysman/​gramprod.htm.</ref>
               </note> The parser then constructs lists of possible objects that could match the two
               noun-phrase slots. Possible matches are restricted to those objects in the game that
               (a) possess vocabulary corresponding to what the player typed and (b) are currently
               in scope (roughly speaking, this means that they must be currently visible to the
               player character). These lists are then sorted in order of logicality (i.e. fitness
               for their role in the proposed action). For example, for a PUT IN action to succeed
               its direct object (occupied by the first noun slot) must be something that the player
               character can move, so that a small rubber ball will be a more <q>logical</q> target
               for such a command than a large stone ball fixed to the top of an ornamental
               balustrade. Likewise, for a PUT IN action to succeed, its indirect object (occupying
               the second noun slot) must be a container of some sort, so that, for example, a large
               cardboard box is a more <q>logical</q> target for a PUT IN command than a box girder.
               If this object resolution phase results in one and only one most logical possibility
               for each of the noun slots, then the parser will settle on these objects; otherwise
               it will either request further clarification from the player (to select from a number
               of possibilities) or complain that there is nothing in scope that matches the command
                  entered.<note>Although the description here is specific to TADS 3, the principles
                  would apply to most modern IF authoring system. For an account of the Inform 6
                  Parser see <ref target="#nelson2001">Nelson (2001), 194-269</ref>.</note>
            </p>
            <p>The second defining characteristic of interactive fiction is the <term>world
                  model</term>. Most IF is set in a simulated environment representing physical
               space and the objects it contains (though there may be the occasional exception).
               Broadly speaking, this corresponds to the <term>setting</term> of a conventional
               narrative. Different IF systems and different games written with those systems will
               implement this simulated environment to different depths, but there are certain
               features that most if not all works of IF share. Firstly, the physical world is
               generally modelled as a series of discrete locations known as
                  <term>rooms</term>.<note>The term is actually derived from its use in caving,
                  since the first ever work of IF was a caving simulation <ptr loc="85–93"
                     target="#montfort2003a"/>; <ptr target="#nelson2001" loc="342–5"/>.</note> The
               totality of rooms in a given work of IF is often referred to as the
                  <term>map</term>.<note>Probably because someone designing a work of IF containing
                  more than a handful of rooms almost certainly needs to draw a map indicating their
                  spatial relations before attempting to write the game, and players often find it
                  useful to draw schematic maps as they play.</note> Such rooms could correspond to
               rooms in a building, but they need not and frequently do not: a <q>room</q> in the IF
               sense is just as likely to be a section of path through a forest, or one corner of a
               large town square, or a section of meadow-bank overlooking a lake. Conceptually, a
               room is that segment of physical space that is immediately accessible to the player
               character. The notional size of a room can vary greatly, but is assumed that, with
               certain qualifications, the PC can see and hear everything in the room in which he or
               she is located unless it is purposely hidden; and can taste, touch or smell
               everything in the room unless it is deliberately placed out of reach. The standard IF
               convention is that, with one exception to be dealt with below, the movement of the
               characters and objects within a room is not normally modelled. It may be that I would
               in fact have to cross a large study to take a book off the shelf, but this detail is
               generally ignored in IF; it is assumed that the PC (and any NPCs) will move around
               within a room as necessary without being explicitly commanded to, and such internal
               movements will not normally be reported, unless the game author explicitly wishes to
               mention them for artistic effect. Thus few games bother to implement commands such as
               WALK OVER TO THE TABLE or APPROACH THE BOOKCASE, since they would generally be
                  superfluous.<note>It is sometimes desirable to model sense passing between rooms,
                  for example looking out through a window, or modelling the contiguity of
                  neighbouring locations in a large open space, and this can be done. It is also
                  possible to experiment with moving around within a room. The description given
                  here nevertheless broadly applies to most IF.</note>
            </p>
            <p>It is perfectly possible for a complete work of IF to take place within a single
               room, and some do, but it is more normal for a game to contain multiple rooms and for
               the PC (and possibly the NPCs as well) to move around between them. By far the most
               normal convention is for movement commands to be given in terms of the eight
               principal compass directions together with UP, DOWN, IN and OUT. This should
               understood as a convention of the medium, not as a pretense that the PC in fact
               carries an infallible compass in his or her head; experience has shown that in
               practice this is generally the most convenient way for a player to communicate
               movement intentions to the parser, not least because movement commands can be
               abbreviated to N, SW and the like. But other styles of movement command such as GO
               THROUGH RED DOOR and ENTER THE BIG HOUSE are also common. Less common, but also
               possible are commands to go to a specific location, such as GO TO THE KITCHEN.</p>
            <p>In the normal IF world model, rooms are populated with <term>objects</term>. These
               may be portable objects that the PC can pick up and carry around, or non-portable
               objects such as trees and houses and heavy furniture that remain fixed in place. Some
               objects may play an integral part in the game, while others may only be scenery.
               Standard IF world models also implement a <term>containment hierarchy</term> for
               objects. Everything currently in the game must be contained in a room, but within
               rooms some objects may contain other objects. The most commonly implemented
               containment relations are <term>inside</term> (for containers like boxes, desk
               drawers, pockets and sacks) and <term>on top of</term> (for supporters like desks,
               tables and trays). Some objects, such as chairs, beds and platforms, may also contain
               the PC and other characters; these constitute the exception to the rule that movement
               within rooms is not normally modelled, since movement in and out of containers like
               beds and chairs normally is dealt with explicitly.</p>
            <p>Although most objects in a game are normally inanimate (as are most objects we
               commonly interact with in the real world), some may be designed to represent animate
               objects such as cats and cows or even people (or quasi-animate objects such as robots
               and talking computers). Clearly such objects – especially people – are a good deal
               more complicated to implement well.</p>
            <p>The earliest game of this type was principally a simulation of the Bedquilt/Flint
               Mammoth cave network created by Will Crowther, originally as an amusement for his
               daughters (<ptr target="#montfort2003a" loc="85–93"/>; <ptr loc="342–45"
                  target="#nelson2001"/>; also described <ref
                  target="dhq/vol/1/2/000009/000009.html">elsewhere in this issue</ref>]. It was
               subsequently expanded by Don Woods with a number of additional puzzles and treasures,
               and has continued to be expanded in many versions since, being readily available,
               generally under the name <title rend="quotes">Adventure</title> but sometimes called
                  <title rend="quotes">Colossal Cave</title>, <title rend="quotes">Colossal
                  Adventure</title> or a number of other names.<note>Many versions of the game are

               </note> This may be one reason why works of IF are also known as <q>text
                  adventures</q> (even when the plot may involve little that resembles adventuring
               in any conventional sense). </p>
            <p>Adventure’s parser was originally written in FORTRAN, and was primitive by modern
               standards: it was a <q>two-word</q> parser since the most complex commands it could
               understand were in the form of an imperative verb and a single noun. The game had
               little narrative plot, being mainly a treasure hunt, but the fact that, unlike many
               of its successors and imitators, it was based on a real cave system by an author who
               knew it well gives it a certain enduring charm.</p>
            <p>The most significant successor and imitator of <title rend="quotes">Adventure</title>
               was a game first called <title rend="quotes">Dungeon</title> and then <title
                  rend="quotes">Zork</title>, originally written on a university mainframe (at MIT,
               beginning in May 1977) <ptr loc="97" target="#montfort2003a"/>. Although <title
                  rend="quotes">Zork</title> was arguably even more of a puzzle-driven treasure-hunt
               set in a less coherent and authentic world that <title rend="quotes"
                  >Adventure</title>, it did achieve a more sophisticated parser capable of
               two-object commands (such as PUT BALL IN BUCKET or HIT TROLL WITH SWORD). Of even
               more significance is that in June 1979 the authors of the original Zork went on to
               found a company called Infocom, which proved highly successful in writing and
               marketing text adventures, or what it came to call interactive fiction <ptr
                  target="#montfort2003a" loc="125"/>.<note>Infocom was acquired by Activision in
                  1985 and there is no longer a current website for it. A website paying homage to
                  the company and supplying some information about it can be found at <ref

               conventions that IF still largely follows today, it also showed that the medium was
               capable of far more than cave-crawling treasure-hunts.</p>
            <p>Infocom (and other companies like it) made a great success of interactive fiction in
               the 1980s, but as home computers became more powerful and ever more capable of
               displaying good graphics, text-based games fell out of favour with computer gamers
               who could be offered much more visually appealing graphical video-games instead. But
               while interactive fiction largely fell out of sight, it did not die, but continued to
               develop in the hands of enthusiastic amateurs.<note>Constraints of space prevent a

            </p>
            <p>It is possible to write a work of interactive fiction from scratch in a
               general-purpose programming language such as Basic, C#, or Pascal, but it is
               extremely inadvisable to do so unless your primary aim is to practice programming in
               one of those languages. Implementing a robust parser and world model is a decidedly
               non-trivial task, and any case IF is best served by a domain-specific language.
               Systems for authoring IF had been available for some time, but amateur IF received a
               considerable boost in the early 1990s from the release first of Mike Roberts’s TADS
               (Text Adventure Design System), and then Inform, created by Oxford mathematician
               Graham Nelson.</p>
            <p>These systems comprise special-purpose programming languages (TADS, for example, is
               quite similar to C), together with a library (usually written in the same language)
               providing a standard parser and world model (which can then be extended or modified
               to a greater or lesser extent in the game author’s own code). They may also contain
               additional tools such as an integrated development environment or a debugger. The
               compilers for these languages typically output, not a native executable, but a
               byte-code file designed for running in a virtual machine on a program called an
                  <q>interpreter</q> (similar to the way a Java compiler produces byte-code to run
               on a Java Virtual Machine).<note>The TADS 3 compiler can also produce a Windows
                  native executable, which effectively bundles the interpreter with the game code.
                  The TADS 3 compiler and tools are themselves written in C++.</note> This allows
               games written in TADS, Inform and similar IF languages to run on any system for which
               the appropriate interpreter has been written.</p>
            <p>Inform had two great advantages when it was first released: first, it was free, at a
               time when Mike Roberts still charged for TADS (though it has now been available free
               for many years),<note>See <ref target="http://www.tads.org/"
                     >http://www.tads.org/</ref>.</note> and second, it compiled to the same format
               (known as the Z-machine) as the much-loved Infocom games.<note>For Inform 6, see <ref
                     target="http://www.inform-fiction.org/inform6.html"
                     >http://www.inform-fiction.org/inform6.html</ref>. For the Z-machine see <ref
                     target="#note14">note 14</ref> below.</note> With these tools it became
               possible for amateur IF enthusiasts to write games as good as or even better than
               those produced by Infocom and its competitors (which is not to say that the systems
               have not also been used to produce a glut of games that are far worse). 2006 saw the
               release of the latest version of both of these authoring systems: Inform 7 (still in
               beta) and TADS 3 (finally out of beta after several years).<note xml:id="note14">For
                  Inform 7 see <ref target="http://www.inform-fiction.org/i7/welcome.html"

                  >http://www.tads.org/tads3.htm</ref>.</note> Inform 7 is an experiment in a
               natural-language style of programming that is proving attractive to many potential
               authors who would not feel so comfortable with conventional coding.<note>Games
                  written in Inform 7 undergo two stages of compilation. The Inform 7 compiler first
                  translates the <q>natural language</q> code into the Inform 6 programming
                  language, and then compiles the Inform 6 code into byte-code that will run on the
                  Z-machine (a virtual machine originally designed by Infocom for running games they
                  wrote in ZIL, which was short for <title rend="quotes">Zork Implementation
                     Language</title>). For details of the Z-machine see <ref target="#nelson2001"
                     >Nelson (2001), 304-41</ref>.</note> TADS 3 is more like a conventional
               programming language (much of its syntax is identical to C),<note>There are also
                  significant departures from C, however; for example variable types are not defined
                  at compile-time, provision for string-handling is much more programmer-friendly,
                  and although the object/class model bears some resemblance to that of C++, there
                  are important differences in detail, not least in the fact that TADS 3 minimizes
                  the distinction between objects and classes.</note> but incorporates the most
               sophisticated parser and world model yet seen in IF, as well as providing the best
               toolset to date for the implementation of NPCs. Between them, Inform 7 and TADS 3
               provide the IF author with a choice of state-of-the-art development tools that take
               radically different approaches.<note>Historically, Inform 6 has proved the most
                  popular IF development system, and it seems likely that the majority of IF will
                  continue to be written in Inform 6 and 7 for some time to come. TADS has also
                  always had a significant user base, and there is considerable interest in TADS 3,
                  which should become more widely used once its power is fully appreciated. Other
                  authoring systems include Hugo, Alan and Adrift, the latter two being aimed at
                  non-programmers. It is fair to say that rather less work of high quality has been
                  produced with these systems, although the few people who use Hugo do produce good
                  work with it, and Adrift can be used to good effect in the hands of the adept. For

            <p>Amateurs writing for other amateurs have perhaps felt freer to innovate and
               experiment, and one trend has been an increasing appreciation and ambition for
               story-driven as opposed to puzzle-driven IF. That is not to say that well-made puzzle
               games do not continue to be appreciated – they clearly are<note>See, for example, the
                  generally favourable reviews of Rune Berg’s 2004 game <title rend="quotes">Isle of
                     the Cult</title> at <ref target="http://www.sparkynet.com/spag/i.html#isle"

                     >http://www.ifreviews.org/index.php?analise=2</ref>,</note> – but there has
               also been increasing interest in the narrative possibilities of IF. There have also
               been developments in the generally accepted conventions of the medium. Back in the
               1980s, and even the early 1990s, IF games often contained huge illogical mazes and
               puzzles that were frequently arbitrary and unfair, as well as all too often allowing
               a player to continue unknowingly with a game long after it had been put into an
               un-winnable state. Such things are now usually frowned upon. The modern ideals are
               that puzzles should be properly and fairly clued, and fully integrated into the
               narrative structure of the game (although this can often be hard to achieve), that
               the player should be given fair warning if the game gets into an un-winnable state,
               and that no game should contain a maze without a very good reason for it indeed (and
               even then it had better be a very original kind of maze). Again, modern standards are
               much more demanding on depth of implementation. If a room description mentions
               striped wallpaper then the parser had better recognize striped wallpaper if the
               player tries to refer to it. It may be acceptable for the parser to respond with
                  <q>The striped wallpaper is not important</q> if
               the wallpaper is indeed pure scenery, but it looks very clumsy if, having told the
               player that the room is decorated with striped wallpaper, the game responds with
                  <q>You see no such thing</q> when the player
               tries to examine it (as would all too often be the case in much <q>old-school</q> IF
               and all too much poorly-implemented modern IF). It is better still if a description
               of the wallpaper is provided in response to <q>X
                  WALLPAPER</q> (i.e. EXAMINE WALLPAPER), even if the <q>not important</q>
               message is used in response to any other command involving the wallpaper; this kind
               of detail can make the difference between immersion in the story world and the
               feeling that, after all, you are merely interacting with a computer
                  program.<note>That said, different works of IF can legitimately employ different
                  depths of implementation; the generally accepted standard is that the
                  implementation depth should be consistent throughout any given work.</note>
            </p>
            <p>These modern expectations raise a further pair of issues, namely the roles of room
               descriptions and puzzles. In conventional (or <q>static</q>) fiction a description of
               a location may be used, <foreign>inter alia</foreign>, to paint a picture in the eye
               of the reader, or to evoke a mood, or to provide information needed to understand the
               plot. All these functions apply to room descriptions in interactive fiction, but with
               additional constraints. First, whereas the author of a novel or short story has
               considerable latitude in choosing the length of any description (provided it is not
               so long as to kill the narrative momentum), an IF author has to be economical; the
               text of a room description (or any other kind of output) will appear on a scrolling
               screen between one command prompt and the next, and for that reason will appear too
               long if it amounts to more than half a dozen lines of text or so. Second, there are
               certain pieces of information that a room description must convey to the player, not
               least the direction of the available exits from the current location. Third, the
               description ideally needs to be so arranged as to draw the player’s attention to
               items that merit further investigation (say, the large desk in the corner, in which
               resides an important letter from the PC’s husband’s lover) rather than to items that
               are purely decorative (such as an ornamental vase on the mantelpiece). To achieve all
               these goals while writing good prose is not always easy; one technique is to minimize
               the kind of extraneous detail that might typically be used for scene-setting in
               static fiction.<note>For further discussion of writing room descriptions, see <ref

            <p>It is possible to write IF that is virtually puzzleless, but puzzles can play an
               important part even in IF that aims to be more literary than ludic.<note>Adam Cadre’s
                     <title rend="quotes">Photopia</title> is perhaps the most celebrated example of
                  a virtually-puzzleless story-based game; see <ref target="#cadre1998">Cadre
                     (1998)</ref>.</note> What exactly constitutes a puzzle is a little hard to
               define; in essence it is a task that the player has to perform or an obstacle he or
               she has to overcome where the necessary sequence of actions is not immediately
               obvious but requires some thought or experimentation to arrive at; but what may seem
               immediately obvious to one player may seem more obscure to another. However defined,
               puzzles have a number of important uses. First, they may simply be integral to the
               plot, since the game may describe a situation in which the protagonist would
               naturally have to overcome obstacles or achieve difficult tasks of this type (for
               example, if the protagonist is a detective investigating a murder). Second, puzzles
               are one of the main devices in IF for creating a sense of tension and opposition,
               without which any narrative is liable to feel dull and slack. Third, they can help
               pace and direct the plot. In static fiction, authors have complete control over the
               course of events and can accordingly structure their narrative to suit their plot.
               Authors of IF surrender much of this control to the player, who controls the actions
               of the protagonist and thus the course of events. Putting strategically placed
               obstacles in the path of the protagonist is a means of regaining a measure of
               authorial control; for example certain parts of the map can be closed off until
               certain tasks have been performed (paradigmatically, the PC cannot pass through the
               locked door until he or she has discovered the key), or the accomplishment of certain
               tasks can trigger certain key events. Third, placing obstacles in the path of the PC
               can deepen the players’ involvement in the narrative by forcing them to think about
               the PC’s situation and come up with a solution. Players are made to identify more
               closely with the actions of the protagonist if they have directed those actions
               themselves, and can feel a considerable sense of satisfaction at being able to
               overcome a difficult obstacle. But puzzles can also misfire in a number of ways. If
               they are too hard they can bring the narrative to a standstill as the player thrashes
               about in increasing frustration trying to find a solution. If they seem arbitrary,
               insufficiently well clued, or otherwise unfair they can simply provoke annoyance.
               Conversely, if they seem too easy there is little satisfaction at solving them, and a
               sense of tedium may set in if the player is forced to go through a series of routine
               actions (find next key, unlock next door).<note>On puzzle design see further <ptr

            <p>Puzzles are not the only way to achieve some of these effects; for example, it would
               be possible to present the player with a series of choices that were not so much
               puzzles as dilemmas, or to write a puzzleless simulation,<note>Jacqueline A. Lott’s
                  game <title rend="quotes">The Fire Tower</title>, a simulation of a hike to the
                  Mt. Cammerer Fire Tower in the Great Smoky Mountains National Park, is a good
                  example of this done well. See <ref target="#lott2004">Lott (2004)</ref>.</note>
               or a game that works in some other way, but this can be difficult to bring off. If a
               game presents players with more or less the same linear narrative without offering
               any significant challenges, it can all too easily create the feeling that one may as
               well be pressing the space bar between reading chunks of text, and that the story
               might better have been presented as conventional static fiction. </p>
            <p>What drives the narrative in most static fiction is the interaction between the
               (normally human) characters, but this is the hardest thing to do well in interactive
               fiction, particularly when it comes to representing the subtleties of human
               relationships. Many NPCs in IF turn out to be little more than elaborate puzzles or
               talking robots. Examples of the first category might be someone I have to get out of
               the way so I can see what’s in his desk or the bouncer who won’t let me past the
               door. The second category is part of the wider reason it is so difficult to produce
               lifelike NPCs in IF, namely the difficulty of producing realistic dialogue in the
               medium.</p>
            <p>Authors of static fiction have complete control over what their characters say, with
               all the nuances that may imply for the relationships between them. Authors of IF
               surrender control of speech as well as action to their players, but whereas a good
               modern IF parser can cope very well with interpreting commands directed at physical
               action, the same is not so true of speech commands. The reason is quite
               straightforward: whereas there is only a fairly limited range of physical actions a
               PC might sensibly attempt at any one time, there is no such limit to what he or she
               might sensibly say, but the technology to make sense of any textual input and provide
               a good response simply does not exist, and would in any case be a move away from
               interactive fiction to artificial intelligence (at least as things are now).
               Attempting fake AI in NPC responses (for example, by getting the parser to look out
               for certain keywords) is nearly always a bad idea, since it is almost bound to be
               given away by incongruous responses sooner or later. The only practical solution with
               existing IF parser technology is to put a drastic limit on the range and syntax of
               conversational commands, and to program a finite range of suitable NPC responses,
               together with a range of totally non-committal <q>default</q> responses for topics
               not otherwise catered for.</p>
            <p>A number of approaches are possible within these limitations.<note>For a useful
                  discussion, see <ref target="#short2007a">Short (2007a)</ref>.</note> The simplest
               is to restrict conversational commands to TALK TO X, and then respond with canned
               conversation; this can work well enough in certain contexts, and does retain maximum
               authorial control over the course of conversations, but greatly restricts players’
               freedom of choice with concomitant loss of interactivity. Another option is to have
               TALK TO X respond with a menu of things the PC can say (possibly linked with a second
               command to switch topic); again this can work reasonably well, but is not without its
               disadvantages, the most prominent of which are first that switching to a
               restricted-choice menu interface may not sit well with the open-ended command line
               interface used for every other kind of player input, and second that when players are
               presented with a menu interface for conversations the temptation is to try to
               navigate them like a kind of conversational maze, which risks breaking immersion in
               the narrative.</p>
            <p>Perhaps the most commonly used conversation system, and that most frequently provided
               as standard in many IF authoring system, is the ASK/TELL system. This allows players
               to type commands of the form ASK BOB ABOUT THE LETTER or TELL JILL ABOUT JANE, where
               what follows <q>ABOUT</q> is a topic to which the
               NPC may have a programmed response (the ASK/TELL system usually also allows SHOW
               SOMETHING TO SOMEONE and GIVE SOMETHING TO SOMEONE and often ASK SOMEONE FOR
               SOMETHING). The advantages of this system is that it allows a form of user input
               congruent with the user interface used for all other commands, preserves the illusion
               of player freedom, but makes it reasonably possible for the author to provide
               suitable responses, at least to the most significant topics (the others can then be
               fielded with a non-commital response such as <q>Let’s
                  talk about that some other time</q> or <q>Bob
                  pretends not to hear you</q>). The disadvantages are first that the NPC can
               all too easily end up resembling a talking robot more than a believable human being
               (for example if the command ASK BOB ABOUT LETTER repeatedly provokes the response,
                  <q>
                  <q>It’s from Jill</q>; he tells you, <q>she’s left me to run off with Jack!</q>
               </q>), and second that the system allows little or no control over what precisely
               is asked or told: if I issue the command ASK BOB ABOUT LETTER do I want to ask Bob
               who the letter is from, or what it says, or when he received it? If I type the
               command TELL JILL ABOUT JANE do I want to tell Jill that Jane is pregnant, or that
               I’m in love with her, or that she’s emigrated to Australia? In particular, the only
               dimension of human conversation it copes with is the exchange of information; it is
               thus quite incapable of modelling, say, a developing relationship (whether of
               affection or enmity) in any realistic way.</p>
            <p>One of the great achievements of TADS 3 is that it extends the ASK/TELL system in a
               number of ways that greatly mitigate these limitations. For example, it provides
               tools for varying NPCs’ responses in accordance with what has been said before, and
               for threading conversations in a more realistic manner, allowing a greater range of
               possible responses that just ASK or TELL at critical points in the dialogue. It also
               encourages authors to write both halves of a conversational exchange, which generally
               makes the dialogue read much better.<note>A full description of the NPC toolset TADS
                  3 provides and the rationale behind it cannot be presented here; for a fuller
                  account see the series of articles by Mike Roberts on <title rend="quotes"
                     >Creating Dynamic Characters</title>, starting at <ref
                     target="http://www.tads.org/t3doc/doc/techman/t3actor.htm"
                     >http://www.tads.org/t3doc/doc/techman/t3actor.htm</ref>.</note> It is not that
               it is impossible to do these things in other IF languages, but rather that TADS 3
               provides by far the best set of tools as standard (and also makes it reasonably easy
               for more ambitious authors to extend them as desired). This is one reason why TADS 3
               was chosen for <title rend="quotes">All Hope Abandon</title> (as well as a number of
               other games I have written).</p>
            <p>The difficulty of implementing life-like NPCs is perhaps one of the major differences
               between IF and conventional static fiction; it can certainly restrict the kind of
               story that can be told well in the medium, since it is far harder to produce a game
               involving the emotional interaction of characters (such as a love story) than one
               focusing mainly on the gathering and exchange of information (a detective story or
               spy story, for example). That is not to say that IF necessarily lacks emotional
               impact, but this must often be achieved by other means, and it would be fair to say
               that the implementation of convincing NPCs is one area in which there is currently
               vast scope for experimentation. But the more fundamental difference between static
               and interactive fiction is that the latter is interactive, and requires a particular
               kind of input from the reader to advance the story. This is not to say that the
               reader of static fiction is wholly passive, as reader-response criticism in
               particular emphasizes, but IF does raise reader participation to a greater level; it
               also both operates under different constraints and offers different opportunities
               from static fiction.<note>For further reading on the creation of NPCs in Interactive
                  Fiction see <ref target="#short2007b">Short (2007b)</ref>. For an on-line

            </p>
            <p>Implementing the Player Character also presents its own challenges. In early works
               such as <title rend="quotes">Adventure</title> and <title rend="quotes">Zork</title>
               this was not an issue, since the PC was usually anonymous with no characteristics
               beyond the ability to act as the player’s eyes and hands in the game. Once authors
               became more interested in the narrative possibilities of IF this changed, however;
               PCs needed to become more specific, of a determinate gender, with particular
               characteristics and a history of their own, more like the protagonists of
               conventional figure than the convenient puppets of the early games. This then raises
               the possibility that the PC’s motivations might clash with those of the player who is
               supposed to be controlling his or her actions. In such a case the game author has to
               choose between allowing the action at the cost of the integrity of the character, or
               disallowing the action at the cost of restricting player freedom. This potential
               conflict is normally resolved by means of some kind of compromise: typically a PC
               might be motivationally restricted from committing murder or suicide while being far
               less scrupulous about stealing (since players of IF quickly develop the kleptomaniac
               strategy of taking anything that isn’t nailed down on the assumption that it will
               probably come in useful later in the game). It is in any case impossible to satisfy
               all players, since some will always complain if the PC won’t do their bidding (<q>but Bob is such an irritating character that I
                     <emph>want</emph> to punch him on the jaw</q>, while others will complain
               if they can make their PC act too obviously out of character (<q>my PC is meant to be a genteel elderly spinster who would
                     <emph>never</emph> punch anyone on the jaw, however irritating she found
                  him!</q>); nevertheless, some kind of reasonable compromise seems to satisfy
               most players most of the time.</p>
            <p>Less easy to negotiate is the discrepancy that can arise between what the player
               knows and what the player character supposedly knows. This can work both ways.
               Someone playing a game for the second or subsequent time almost certainly starts out
               knowing more than the PC knows at the start of the game, and this can create problems
               when the player wants to put that additional knowledge to use. Before the PC has been
               introduced to Mrs. Prancealot he logically cannot know that she <emph>is</emph> Mrs.
               Prancealot, but the player may try to refer to her as Mrs. Prancealot before the
               introduction takes place and become irritated either because the parser allows the
               use of the name that the PC cannot yet know or because it refuses to recognize the
               name that the player knows perfectly well. Or, to take another example, if a key has
               been dropped under a sofa, should second time players be forced to issue a LOOK UNDER
               SOFA command in order to be allowed to refer to a key they already know to be there?
               Some players may find such a restriction irksome, while others may feel it
               unreasonable that the PC can pick up a key from under the sofa before he has any good
               reason to suspect its presence there. </p>
            <p>Conversely, the PC may well know things the player (especially the first time player)
               does not. Such knowledge may be relatively trivial, such as the PC’s knowledge of his
               or her own locality, which the player has to discover by exploration (this can
               usually be handled by writing room descriptions that emphasize the PC’s familiarity
               with the locations visited). But it may be something rather more complex, such as the
               specialist knowledge the PC ought to possess in his or her persona as safe-cracker,
               starship captain, or (as in the example about to be discussed) scholar. This can be
               particularly tricky if it results in the player fumbling to perform tasks the PC
               ought to be able to manage in his or her sleep, or if the PC’s specialist knowledge
               is particularly relevant to understanding the puzzles and other plot elements, as
               turned out to be the case in <title rend="quotes">All Hope Abandon</title>.<note>For

            <p>The particular example of IF to be discussed here is one of my own works, <title
                  rend="quotes">All Hope Abandon</title>. The reason this game may be of interest to
               readers of <title rend="italic">Digital Humanities Quarterly</title> is that it
               combines relatively a new digital medium (interactive fiction) with a very
               traditional academic discipline (Biblical Studies). I shall start by explaining what
               the game is about, and then go on to discuss some of the design goals and
               implementation challenges.</p>
            <p>The game opens with the protagonist, Dr. William Fisher, listening to a particularly
               dire lecture at a New Testament conference. Since our discussion of interactive
               fiction has been fairly abstract up to now, it may be helpful to show a sample
               transcript of the first few turns by way of illustration (lines beginning &gt; show

               <p>The conference organizers must have been really scraping the barrel when they
                  invited Professor Wortschlachter as a keynote speaker. Until you saw the
                  conference programme you’d never heard of him, and from what the handout has to

                     indicating that the Jesus Seminar are quite clear that the account is utterly
                     unhistorical. We can assume that a first-century Jesus Seminar would have voted
                     the same way, at once recognizing the midrashic intertexture of this text and

            <p>The PC’s attention now wanders as he recalls a brief encounter he had with an
               attractive female delegate, Felicity Hope, at breakfast that morning. His attention
               soon returns to the lecture, but not long thereafter he suffers a heart attack, and
               the bulk of the game takes place in his subsequent near-death experience.</p>
            <p>How exactly this experience is to be interpreted (for example, as an objective
               depiction of an after-life, or as a purely subjective dream-like experience) is left
               up to the player to decide. In creating this environment I thought of it as
               mythological, and as containing both subjective and objective elements. It is closely
               connected to the theme of the preceding lecture, in that the Empty Tomb story recurs
               in various guises as a leitmotiv, as does the PC’s attraction to Felicity Hope. On
               the other hand what the PC does in this segment of the game can have real world
               consequences, in particular whether he returns to life or ends up in ultimate
               frustration or oblivion.</p>
            <p>This mythological section is structured in two main halves surrounded by a prologue
               and epilogue. The prologue effectively allows players to start to get their bearings
               in this strange environment. There they will discover that a great chasm separates
               the PC from a distant golden glow that looks like it might be a city of the blessed.
               On this side of the chasm is the gate of hell, bearing a sign saying that hell has
               been closed for demythologization. A workdemon is busily chipping away at the
               inscription over the gate, but has so far only manage to obliterate the final letter
               of <q>Abandon Hope All Ye Who Enter Here</q>
               (thereby creating a nice double entendre for those who spot it). It turns out that
               the only way to progress is to go through hell, via another entrance (the debts to
               Dante’s <title rend="italic">Divine Comedy</title> will be obvious).</p>
            <p>The first main section begins once the player has found out how to get into hell. The
               PC soon arrives in a Victorian gallery with a choice of routes labelled <q>Via Antiqua</q> and <q>Via Moderna</q>. I originally intended to force the player to take the Via
               Moderna, which pokes gentle (or not-so-gentle) fun at various aspects of
               twentieth-century New Testament scholarship (appropriate to the PC’s profession). I
               soon felt, however, that this left the Via Antiqua as a rather pointless digression,
               so I decided to add an alternative route through that as well, in which the PC has to
               overcome the temptations of an alluring female demoness (a sort of demonic
               counterpart to Felicity Hope). Both routes eventually converge at the same barrier
               (it would be too much of a spoiler to be more specific) that the PC has to overcome
               to proceed to the second main section of his near-death experience.</p>
            <p>This second section is intended to be a recapitulation of the main lines of New
               Testament eschatology. Symbolically speaking the PC must past through the crucifixion
               and the Empty Tomb and then play an apocalyptic game of chess against an opponent who
               starts out as Pontius Pilate but is soon replaced with a composite Roman emperor
               (representing an amalgam of all the emperors from Augustus to Domitian). The chess
               game is played out with somewhat unconventional pieces and is meant to reflect, first
               the events leading up to the Jewish war of 66-70 CE, and then aspects of the
               apocalyptic scenarios of Revelation and 4 Ezra. If the PC loses the game he loses his
               soul; if he wins he can pass on to the next stage. In neither case is the game played
               much like an ordinary game of chess.</p>
            <figure xml:id="figure02">
               <head>The chess game, at the point where the Player Characters takes over from
                  Caiaphas as the Emperor's opponent. The text in bold in the main (white) window
                  represents commands enterered by the player (sit on chair, play chess); the text
                  that follows constitutes the game's response. Note how the command <q>play chess</q> does not actually achieve anything
                  beyond causing the player to be prompted with the specific commands to be used;
                  this is a useful aid to a player who may be unsure what kind of command to enter
                  at this point.</head>

            </figure>
            <p>Thereafter the player character finds a sort of reverse Eden, in which the serpent is
               helpful and in fact prevents the PC from taking the forbidden fruit (the idea is to
               represent an <foreign>Urzeit – Endzeit</foreign> typology<note>I.e. the notion that
                  the endtime (<foreign>Endzeit</foreign>) will resemble the beginning
                     (<foreign>Urzeit</foreign>), particularly in the restoration of paradisal
                  conditions.</note> and the reversal of the fall through the acts of redemption),
               but realizes that this is not where he is meant to stay. Instead he must rescue
               Felicity Hope from the swamp in which she is mired (and which is clearly meant to
               represent Professor Wortschlachter’s lecture). Escape from this region leads to the
               epilogue of the near-death experience. Between them Felicity Hope and the PC discover
               a way to cross the chasm to reach the distant golden glow, but only one of them can
               cross. The player must decide whether it is the PC or Felicity who crosses the chasm,
               and on that decision rests the ultimate fate of the PC. If the right choice is made,
               the PC wakes up in a hospital bed with the real Felicity Hope at his side; otherwise
               he is eternally lost.</p>
            <p>In the most general terms, my design goals were to combine my interest in Biblical
               Studies with my interest in interactive fiction in a game that contained a
               substantial surreal (or at least, non-real-world) segment that would give some sense
               of what it might be like to inhabit one interpretation of the Christian
               symbolic/mythological universe. I also wanted to poke fun at some aspects of New
               Testament scholarship of the last hundred years, while unobtrusively informing
               players about it. The game also had to be entertaining and engaging to play, given
               that my target audience would be fellow IF-enthusiasts rather than fellow New
               Testament scholars. It therefore had to conform to the conventions and expectations
               of the medium, and it seemed advisable to include elements such as puzzles that would
               hopefully prove amusing and accessible to all players, regardless of their background
               knowledge, on the basis of information provided in the game. It was quite
               emphatically not meant to preach to the player.</p>
            <p>The game seems to have achieved mixed success in relation to those goals. On the
               positive side <title rend="quotes">All Hope Abandon</title> received nominations in
               six out of the ten categories for Xyzzy awards (the Oscars of IF, named after a magic
               word featured in <title rend="quotes">Adventure</title>) for games released in 2005,
               although it failed to win the prize in any of them (see <ref
                  target="http://wurb.com/if/award/3#518">http://wurb.com/if/award/3#518</ref>). In
               general it also seems to have been well received; the fact that it does not try to
               preach to the player was generally appreciated, and it received a number of broadly
               favourable reviews.<note>For those by Paul Lee and Valentine Kopteltsev, see <ref
                     target="#lee2006">Lee (2006)</ref> and <ref target="#kopteltsev2006">Kopteltsev

                  discussion on rec.games.int-fiction, see <ref target="#dollahite2005">Dollahite
                     (2005)</ref>. </note> On the other hand the overarching scholarly and
               mythological structures that were intended to lend coherence to the two main
               afterlife sections were clearly missed by some players, to whom these sections then
               appeared to be a somewhat rag-bag collection of puzzles <ptr target="#shiovitz2004a"
               />. </p>
            <p>This underlines the main design challenge I faced: the huge gap between PC and player
               knowledge. Although this can be an issue in any work of IF, in this case the problem
               was acute: my PC was a New Testament scholar who could be expected to have a thorough
               knowledge not only of the biblical text and related ancient texts, but also of the
               contemporary scholarly debate surrounding them. My target audience might have none of
               this knowledge, and it became apparent in the course of beta-testing and subsequent
               player feedback that many players did not possess even the most elementary knowledge
               of the biblical stories presupposed and alluded to in the game.</p>
            <p>My first attempt at meeting this problem was to add footnotes to responses I thought
               might be a little obscure.<note>This can be done quite readily, and is a standard
                  feature of TADS 3. The player sees a footnote number and can either click on it or
                  enter a suitable command to read the text of the footnote.</note> But I quickly
               came to the conclusion that this solution was both cumbersome and obtrusive. Players
               who wished to refresh their memories of what a footnote said on a particular topic
               would have to remember the number of the footnote in which the topic was discussed
               (or else scroll back to find it), and there were so many responses that potentially
               needed further explanation that the game was beginning to resemble an article in an
               academic journal; the too frequent appearance of footnote markers would make the game
               look too forbidding.</p>
            <p>I therefore decided to scrap the footnotes and employ a different approach:
               implementing a THINK ABOUT command. If the game mentioned something that might be
               obscure to the player, such as the Synoptic Problem or Q, or even Moses or the Empty
               Tomb, the player could simply type, say, THINK ABOUT Q, to tap into the player
               character’s specialist knowledge (and opinions). The advantage of this approach is
               that it never thrusts itself on players’ attention; there is seldom any need to think
               about anything in the game,<note>With one exception, where doing so constitutes the
                  solution to a puzzle.</note> and players can use the THINK ABOUT command when and
               only when their curiosity is roused. This approach also opens up further educational
               potential for the game; those players can learn quite a lot about the biblical text
               and scholarly approaches to it if they are so minded, but none is compelled to do so,
               though hopefully the context of the game makes it an enjoyable way to learn.</p>
            <figure xml:id="figure03">
               <head>The THINK ABOUT command in action. On the previous turn Professor
                  Wortschlachter used the expression <q>Sitz im
                     Leben</q> in the course of his lecture; since this term is likely to be
                  unfamiliar to most players, the inquisitive player can use the THINK ABOUT command
                  to find out what it means. Note that the command on the previous turn was X ME, X
                  being a standard IF abbreviation for EXAMINE; providing a suitable response to X
                  ME is one way an author can quickly convey something about the Player Character to
                  the Player. In this instance both THINK ABOUT and X ME serve to close the gap
                  between what the Player Character knows and what the Player knows.</head>

                  Abandon</figDesc>
            </figure>
            <p>Many of the other challenges and design decisions affecting <title rend="quotes">All
                  Hope Abandon</title> were of a kind common to many works of IF, such a pacing and
               puzzle design. The key decision made in the design of <title rend="quotes">All Hope
                  Abandon</title> was to link narrative progress with geographical progress; the
               narrative advances through the near-death experience as the player character advances
               through the map. This in turns means that most of all the puzzles are <q>gating</q>
               puzzles, obstacles that need to be overcome in order to advance to the next set of
               map locations. All this was part of the design from the beginning. A subsidiary
               aspect of this design included making the gating puzzles irreversible at crucial
               points, limiting the ability of the PC to backtrack and so driving the narrative
               forwards. Linked to this were puzzles that forced the PC to part with all of his
               inventory (the items carried) at various points, thus preventing an accumulation of
               an ever-growing stack of objects that were no longer useful.<note>This had proved to
                  be something of a problem in my previous game, <title rend="quotes">Square
                     Circle</title>
                  <ptr target="#eve2004"/>, in which the PC could very easily end up carrying a huge
                  stack of mostly useless items around; regular players of IF quickly learn to pick
                  up and retain anything that is not firmly nailed down, just in case it proves
                  useful or vital at some later stage in the game.</note>
            </p>
            <p>Apart from a number of purely technical issues, the other main design challenge was
               the implementation of the NPCs. Here, the setting of the main part of the game in a
               mythological landscape greatly helped; since the setting was clearly not a real-world
               one, and many of the NPCs were so strange (they included a demon, a demoness, a
               talking crow and a talking serpent) that it would not be particularly jarring if some
               of their responses were a little odd; on the contrary, oddity is only to be expected.
                  <title rend="quotes">All Hope Abandon</title> does make full use of the
               conversational tools provided by TADS 3, but its use of them is less taxing than it
               would be in a game set in more realistic world. Moreover, the two real-world segments
               right at the beginning and end of the game are so brief that the PC only has the
               opportunity to converse with one NPC (Felicity), and then only for such a short span
               of time that any unnaturalness in the conversation hardly has a chance to become
               apparent.</p>
            <p>
               <title rend="quotes">All Hope Abandon</title> breaks no new ground in the matter of
               room descriptions, the constraints of supplying adequate information in limited space
               remain, but it does add one related feature, the ability of the PC not simply to LOOK
               at the current location, but to LOOK in particular directions (such as LOOK NORTH or
               LOOK SOUTHEAST). The game then responds with a brief description of what can be seen
               in that direction from where the PC is currently located. This probably turned out to
               be little more than a gimmick, however, since it would have been too unwieldy to have
               supplied any new information to the player by this means. If new information had been
               conveyed to the player through such commands, then players would have been forced to
               look in every direction in every location to be sure of not missing anything, and
               this would rapidly have become intolerably tedious. It would also have gone against
               the convention that a normal room description should supply players with all the
               information they need (which may include calling attention to objects they need to
               examine more closely). The ability to LOOK in particular directions may have created
               a slightly deeper sense of immersion for some players, since the game could at least
               give a reasonably appropriate response to such commands, but it is not an experiment
               I have so far felt like repeating in subsequent works.</p>

            <head>Interactive Fiction and Biblical Text</head>
            <p>At first sight interactive fiction, which began life as a species of computer game,
               would seem to be a world apart from Biblical Studies (or any other humanities
               discipline). It may nevertheless be interesting to reflect on how a work such as
                  <title rend="quotes">All Hope Abandon</title> may be suggestive for relating these
               seemingly disparate worlds.</p>
            <p>The first point to make is that <title rend="quotes">All Hope Abandon</title> makes
               no attempt to render the biblical narratives it employs in any straightforward,
               realistic manner. It alludes to a number of biblical stories, and full appreciation
               of the game probably requires quite a good grasp of the sweep of biblical narrative,
               but nowhere does <title rend="quotes">All Hope Abandon</title> make a serious attempt
               to retell a biblical story. This is partly a recognition of the real differences
               between the media of static text and IF; attempts to render existing stories as IF
               rarely come off well.<note>One notable example would be Graham Nelson’s attempt to
                  produce an IF version of the <title rend="quotes">The Tempest</title>
                  <ptr target="#nelson1997"/>; more recent examples might include Bill Powell’s IF
                  version of G.K. Chesterton’s novel <title rend="italic">Man Alive</title>
                  <ptr target="#powell2006"/>, and, closer to our theme (and to Mark’s Gospel),
                     <title rend="quotes">The Bible Retold: Loaves and Fishes</title>, (<ref
                     target="http://www.wurb.com/if/game/2962"
                     >http://www.wurb.com/if/game/2962</ref>) though the latter was clearly
                  tongue-in-cheek. Some better received recent attempts to produce IF versions of
                  Interactive Fiction include Torbjšrn Anderson, <title rend="quotes">The Tower of
                     the Elephant</title>
                  <ptr target="#anderson2006"/>, based on the short story by Robert E. Howard, and
                  Peter Nepstad’s games <title rend="quotes">The Journey of the King</title>
                  <ptr target="#nepstad2006a"/> and <title rend="quotes">The Ebb and Flow of the

                     >http://www.illuminatedlantern.com/if/</ref>).</note>Taking all or part of a
               static text like Mark’s Gospel and trying to turn it into IF almost certainly would
               not have worked (though a piece of IF loosely inspired by the biblical text could be
               a very different matter). For one thing there is an essential mismatch between the
               linearity of the narrative in a conventional static text, and the player’s apparent
               freedom in a work of IF. This freedom may only be apparent; a skilled IF author can
               effectively force players to a predetermined conclusion while creating the illusion
               of almost total freedom, but the route to that conclusion cannot be so tightly
               controlled as in static fiction (or, if it is, the resulting game will scarcely work
               as a piece of IF; players generally object when the game too obviously puts them on
               rails). There is no way that an IF author can successfully force a player to follow
               the precise sequence of events that appears in a static text, and a well-written
               piece of IF has to reckon with the possibility that a player may choose to do
               something different from the protagonist of a pre-existing story.<note>This problem
                  can be eased by making the PC someone who was a relatively minor character in the
                  original story and giving the original protagonist’s role to an NPC. Thus, for
                  example, one could probably write a perfectly good IF rendering of the Empty Tomb
                  story by making Mary Magdalene the PC; but then most of the content of such a
                  piece of IF would have to come from the author’s imagination rather than the
                  biblical text, and although the resulting game <emph>would</emph> in some sense be
                  a retelling of the Empty Tomb story, it would nevertheless be a new telling of it,
                  and not simply a reproduction of the story as found in Mark or any of the other
                  gospels.</note>
            </p>
            <p>That said, there are a number of ways in which <title rend="quotes">All Hope
                  Abandon</title> functions similarly to the biblical texts it plays off. The first
               is in the employment of intertextuality. For the most part <title rend="quotes">All
                  Hope Abandon</title> uses the biblical text (and other texts) allusively,
               occasionally quoting them, sometimes representing aspects of them more or less
               closely. This is similar to the way in which many New Testament texts make use of the
               Old Testament. Thus, for example, the opening of Luke’s gospel is written in such a
               way as to resemble the opening of 1 Samuel, or the opening of Matthew’s gospel
               recalls the birth of Moses and a dreaming patriarch named Joseph. Thus, too, is the
               way that several of the more spectacular miracle stories operate; the Feeding of the
               Five Thousand (Mark 6.30-44 and parallels) resembles a similar feeding conducted by
               the prophet Elisha (2 Kings 4.42-44) and is probably meant to recall the feeding in
               the wilderness (Exodus 16) as well as the promise of a Davidic shepherd who would
               heal and feed his flock (Ezekiel 34). Likewise the Stilling of the Storm (Mark 4.35)
               recalls both the story of the storm at sea suffered by Jonah (Jonah 1) and the song
               of praise from those who go down to the sea in ships (Psalm 107.23-32). Such examples
               could be multiplied almost endlessly; they are integral to the way much of the New
               Testament (and also quite a bit of the Old Testament) functions.<note>For a general
                  introduction, see <ref target="#moyise2001">Moyise (2001)</ref>. For examples of
                  discussions of Mark’s use of the Old Testament see <ref target="#marcus1993"

                     381-84</ref>.</note> To be sure the New Testament is not only a static text but
               a sacred one; its employment of intertextuality is inevitably both different in
               nature and more serious in intent from that of any work of IF. Again, the
               intertextual allusiveness of <title rend="quotes">All Hope Abandon</title> is hardly
               characteristic of IF as a whole. There are nevertheless similarities in intent
               insofar as both the New Testament and <title rend="quotes">All Hope Abandon</title>
               seek to create new narratives that rely for much of their meaning on earlier sacred
               texts, and neither is simply giving a new rendering of an old story.<note>Although
                  new renderings of old biblical stories were common enough at around the time the
                  New Testament was being written, the most notable being the first half of
                  Josephus’s <title rend="italic">Jewish Antiquities</title>, which retells the
                  entire Old Testament in the form of Hellenistic historiography. Other examples
                  from around this time would include Philo’s <title rend="italic">Life of
                     Moses</title>, Pseudo-Philo’s <title rend="italic">Book of Biblical
                     Antiquities</title>, and the book of <title rend="italic"
                  >Jubilees</title>.</note>
            </p>
            <p>A less incidental link between IF and biblical text lies in their common relation to
               the riddle. Nick Montfort argues that the riddle is one of the main literary
               precursors to interactive fiction in that it is both textual (or at least verbal) and
               challenges the reader/hearer to find a solution <ptr target="#montfort2003a"
                  loc="37–63"/>. There is also a riddling quality to some biblical texts, not least
               the Gospel of Mark, which provides some of the main biblical allusions in <title
                  rend="quotes">All Hope Abandon</title>. Mark 4.1-34 to some extent presents Jesus’
               parables as riddles;<note>The Greek word <foreign>parabolé</foreign> (literally
                     <q>thrown alongside</q>) means some form of comparison; the corresponding
                  Hebrew and Aramaic terms <foreign>mashal</foreign> and <foreign>methel</foreign>
                  have a far wider semantic range, including <q>riddle</q> among their possible
                  meanings.</note> to those outside, everything comes <q>in parables</q> so that <cit>
                  <quote rend="inline" source="#canonical">seeing they may see and not
                     perceive, and hearing they may hear and not understand</quote>
                  <ref type="offline">Mark 4.10-12, alluding to Isa. 6.9-10</ref>
               </cit>. The parable of the sower is thus made a parable about the reception of
               parables, but just as seed is sown in the ground for the purpose of growth, so the
               concealment of teaching in the guise of parables is apparently intended for the
               purpose of revelation: <quote rend="inline" source="#canonical">for nothing is
                  hidden except in order to be made known, nor does it become hidden but that it
                  might come into the open</quote> (Mark 4.22).<note>The translation is my own,
                  intended to bring out the force of the purpose clauses. The literature on this
                  section of Mark’s Gospel is vast; for two contrasting approaches see <ref
                     target="#vaniersel1998">van Iersel (1998), 176-92</ref> and <ref
                     target="#hooker1991">Hooker (1991), 119-38</ref>.</note> The Markan Jesus
               continually challenges the disciples to understand, and they continually fail (Mark
               4.10-13, 41; 6.52; 7.17-18; 8.14-21). Mark’s readers are challenged to do better:
                  <quote rend="inline" source="#canonical">if anyone has ears to hear, let
                  them hear</quote> (Mark 4.23). The careful reader of Mark’s Gospel may easily come
               to the conclusion that this applies, not just to the parables in Mark, but to the
               entire narrative: there is clearly much more going on in this gospel than appears on
               the surface.<note>It’s possible that this is due in part to a modern audience’s
                  distance from the intended audience of Mark’s Gospel; we could well have lost a
                  great many shared assumptions that would otherwise have helped determine the
                  meaning of this text. The original author quite likely did not intend his gospel
                  to appear quite so puzzling as its modern scholarly interpreters tend to find
                  it.</note>
            </p>
            <p>Hiding something in order that it may come to light is (both literally and
               figuratively) a common strategy in writing IF; it is the essence of puzzles that the
               player/reader is meant to solve them in order to advance the plot, and perhaps also
               the player’s understanding of the work as a whole.<note>Some puzzles may literally
                  involve concealing something, such as the key needed to open a particular door,
                  which the player can find by diligently searching the PC’s environment; in more
                  creative puzzles it is the solution that is hidden and needs to be revealed
                  through diligent reading of the text and thinking through the clues the text (i.e.
                  the various responses to player commands) provides.</note> Used well, this is
               intended to deepen the player’s involvement in the narrative; to the extent players
               are forced to provide their own solutions to the puzzles the story provides they tend
               to find themselves taking ownership of the outcomes. The puzzling nature of the
               parables (and other material) in Mark’s Gospel seems directed at a similar (though
               deeper) end; in particular it seems to be part of Mark’s strategy to bring his target
               audience round to the authorial viewpoint (or, at least, the point of view of the
               implied author of the Gospel).<note>There is obviously a vast body of scholarly
                  literature on the interpretation of Mark’s Gospel. For this issues raised here
                  interested readers may like to start with <ref target="#rhoads1982">Rhoads and
                     Michie (1982)</ref>.</note> Gospel and IF games remain examples of different
               media, but there is here a convergence of reader responses, even though in the case
               of the Gospel the reader cannot direct the actions of the protagonist. Insofar as a
               work of IF is designed so that part of the challenge of the work is to understand
               what is going on, that convergence becomes greater (without ever approximating to
                  identity).<note>This should not be misunderstood as claiming any kind of direct
                  genetic relationship between biblical narrative and interactive fiction, beyond a
                  common debt to the riddle.</note>
            </p>
            <p>Although a modern reader cannot affect either the course of events or even the style
               of narration in a static text like a gospel, the situation may have been a little
               different when the gospels were first written. Like most texts in antiquity (when
               literacy was restricted to a small fraction of the population), they would have been
               written as scripts for oral performance, not books for private perusal, and some
               proportion of the material now incorporated in the gospels probably enjoyed oral
               circulation for some time before being committed to writing. Mark’s Gospel is
               particularly close to oral storytelling, both in its folksy narrative style (such as
               the frequent use of the historic present, parataxis, the word <q>immediately</q>, and
               otherwise non-literary Greek), and in its overall structure.<note>On the narrative
                  structure of Mark, see <ref target="#vaniersel1998">van Iersel (1998),
                  68-86</ref>, and <ref target="#donahue2002">Donahue and Harrington (2002),
                     16-19</ref>. For a detailed discussion of Mark’s Greek style, see <ref
                     target="#elliott1993">Elliott (1993)</ref>.</note> Although it is now in fixed
               textual form, it was very likely shaped in interaction with its first
                  hearers.<note>See <ref target="#downing2000">Downing (2000), 75-94</ref>; also
                     <ref target="#vansina1985">Vansina (1985), 34-5</ref>, and <ref
                     target="#ong2002">Ong (2002), 143</ref>; but note the contrasts Ong draws
                  between literary and primary oral narration (<ref target="#ong2002">pp.
                     131-52</ref>). Neither Mark’s Gospel nor any work of Interactive fiction was
                  composed in a situation of primary orality, and the nature of the audience’s
                  participation is clearly different in each case.</note> What we have now is a
               static text, and so a modern reading does not reproduce this experience of shaping
               the text (as opposed to its interpretation), but there is a possible analogy between
               the way many biblical texts came into being and the way the textual output of a work
               of interactive fiction comes into being, by the co-operation of performer/author and
               active listener/reader.<note>This analogy is perhaps not very apparent in comparing,
                  say, <title rend="quotes">All Hope Abandon</title> with Mark’s Gospel; the analogy
                  between the audience’s role in oral storytelling and the player’s role in IF
                  becomes far more explicit in Aaron Reed’s game <title rend="quotes">Whom the
                     Telling Changed</title>; for which see <ref target="#reed2005">Reed
                     (2005)</ref>.</note>
            </p>
            <p>Finally, IF provides an interesting analogy in the age-old problem of divine
               sovereignty and human free will. One obvious place where this surfaces in the
               biblical text being used for comparison here is where the Markan Jesus declares that
               his betrayer is performing a preordained role in the divine plan, but must
               nevertheless bear full responsibility for his actions (Mark 14.21), but the problem
               is clearly much wider than that one instance. If the universe has been made by an
               omnipotent and omniscient creator, what space is left for human free will? One useful
               analogy is that between the author of a novel and the characters within the novel.
               Clearly the novelist has full control over the story world he or she creates and the
               actions of everyone with it, yet if the characters are not to appear mere puppets,
               they must have a certain authenticity and vitality of their own; from the
               inner-narrative perspective of the story world they act as free agents. It would not
               be appropriate, for example, for a criminal collared by Sherlock Holmes to plead,
                  <q>It wasn’t my fault, it was that scoundrel Conan
                  Doyle who made me do it; he’s writing this story after all.</q> Such an excuse
               would involve a confusion of levels, since at the story-level the villain is free and
               responsible for his actions.</p>
            <p>But useful though that analogy is, it breaks down if pressed too far, for, after all,
               novelists do control all the thoughts and actions of all their characters, so that
               their characters enjoy no real independence. Interactive fiction provides a more
               satisfactory analogy, since here the protagonist is genuinely guided by an
               intelligence distinct from that of his or her creator, namely that of the player. The
               story-world is still the creation of the author, but the player is genuinely free to
               direct the actions of the PC. It is up to the author what difference that makes; a
               work of IF can be so structured that the outcome is the same regardless, or so that
               the PC’s choices make a real difference. Both design options are intriguing in this
               context, the one modelling freedom of action leading to a predetermined conclusion,
               and the other a created world in which the author allows choice to influence outcome. </p>
            <p>It is true that the actions open to a player character in a work of interactive
               fiction are generally circumscribed, but this is often if not mostly true of real
               life as well; in practice we all operate under a number of constraints that limit our
               practical options to a finite and frequently quite small number. Reflecting on the
               relation of author, player and player character will not solve any age-old
               theological problems, but it may provide some new insights for thinking about human
               free will in relation to the powers of a creator.</p>

            <head>Conclusions</head>
            <p>Interactive fiction is a distinct medium. In many important respects it is unlike
               static fiction, film, drama, opera, poetry or any such more conventional medium; in
               certain respects it perhaps most closely resembles the give-and-take of oral
               narrative performed in the presence of a participatory audience. Its distinctiveness
               means that it is unlikely to shed much light on, say, the kind of traditional
               historical-critical questions that still occupy much of contemporary biblical
               scholarship. But it may help to generate fresh insights in other areas, such as how
               readers and listeners interact with texts, and how the puzzling nature of a text like
               Mark’s gospel helps draw readers into the narrative and take ownership of their
               interpretations. That virtually all interactive fiction has an element of play does
               not of itself disqualify it from serious consideration; there can be a playfulness
               about static texts as well, including the way some biblical texts play with other
               biblical texts. </p>
            <p>
               <title rend="quotes">All Hope Abandon</title> has so far had a small audience of IF
               enthusiasts. It is unlikely that those will have included many who are also biblical
               scholars or theology students. Yet it may have the potential to entertain both (not
               least the former who will be in the best position to understand its jokes and
               appreciate its allusions) and perhaps even contribute to the education of the latter.
               It would be interesting to see the reactions if it ever did find such an
               audience.</p>

                  <label>Apocalyptic:</label>
                  <p>A term that is used almost as loosely within biblical scholarship as outside
                     it; etymologically the word is derived from the Greek for <q>revelation</q> or
                        <q>unveiling</q> and some scholars would wish to restrict its use to a type
                     of literature in which heavenly secrets are revealed to the seer by a vision, a
                     heavenly journey, or the words of an angel (or some combination of all three).
                     All too often, however, the term is used as if it meant eschatological, and for
                     want of a better term it is often used to describe a particular type of
                     eschatology in which ordinary human history is expected to be interrupted by a
                     catastrophic divine intervention in the near future (the reason being that such
                     eschatology is frequently expressed through the medium of apocalyptic in the
                     first sense).</p>

               <item>
                  <label>Byte Code:</label>
                  <p> The name often given to the intermediate product of compilation; a byte code
                     file can typically be run on an interpreter or virtual machine rather than
                     directly by a computer’s operating system.</p>
               </item>
               <item>
                  <label>Code:</label>
                  <p> Without further qualification this normally refers to <q>Source Code</q>, the
                     set of instructions the author/programmer writes in whichever programming
                     language he or she is writing to tell his or her program (in this case, work of
                     IF) how to behave.</p>
               </item>
               <item>
                  <label>Compiler:</label>
                  <p> A piece of software to translate human readable source code into machine
                     readable form. Compilation may be to a native executable (a file that can be
                     executed by a particular operating system without further ado) or, more usually
                     with Interactive Fiction, to some intermediate (byte code) form that can be run
                     by different interpreters on different operating systems.</p>
               </item>
               <item>
                  <label>Containment Hierarchy:</label>
                  <p> The system of containment that determines which objects are within which other
                     objects. In this context <q>within</q> includes inside, on top of, underneath
                     or behind. At the top of the containment hierarchy stand the rooms; rooms are
                     regarded as not being contained by anything but as directly or indirectly
                     containing everything else (except for objects temporarily out of play and so
                     outside the map althogether).</p>
               </item>
               <item>
                  <label>Debugger:</label>
                  <p> A tool which helps a programmer (or in this case, game author) track down
                     programming errors or <q>bugs</q>. For example TADS 3 Workbench for Windows
                     incorporates a highly sophisticated debugger that allows the programmer to step
                     through his code line by line to see what it is doing each step of the way (and
                     so determine where something is going wrong if it is going wrong).</p>
               </item>
               <item>
                  <label>Domain-Specific Language:</label>
                  <p> A computer programming language (such as Inform or TADS) specifically tailored
                     to a particular type of task (such as writing Interactive Fiction).</p>
               </item>
               <item>
                  <label>Eschatology:</label>
                  <p> Anything that deals with the last things, the end of the age or the
                     consummation of history (from the Greek eschatos, meaning <q>last</q>). In
                     Christian theology eschatology traditionally deals with matters such as Heaven,
                     Hell, the Second Coming and the Last Judgement; in a first-century context it
                     is better thought of in terms of the coming of the kingdom of God, the age to
                     come in which the evils of the present age would be overcome.</p>
               </item>
               <item>
                  <label>IDE (Integrated Development Environment):</label>
                  <p> A single piece of software containing all (or at least) most of the tools a
                     game author needs in order to write a game, including an editor, a compiler, a
                     debugger and an interpreter on which the game may be tested.</p>
               </item>
               <item>
                  <label>Inform:</label>
                  <p> The most popular language/system for authoring Interactive Fiction, written
                     and maintained by Graham Nelson. Two versions of Inform are currently in use.
                     Inform 6 (the older version) resembles a conventional programming language.
                     Inform 7 adopts a more <q>natural language</q> style of programming with the
                     aim of making the process of writing Interactive Fiction more like writing
                     prose and less like conventional programming.</p>
               </item>
               <item>
                  <label>Implicit Action:</label>
                  <p> An action automatically carried out by the parser in order to facilitate the
                     command the player actually typed; for example if the player types GO THROUGH
                     RED DOOR when the red door is locked but the player has the key, a well-behaved
                     parser would carry out implicit UNLOCK RED DOOR and OPEN RED DOOR actions
                     rather than forcing the player to type these commands explicitly.</p>
               </item>
               <item>
                  <label>Inventory:</label>
                  <p> The items currently carried by the Player Character.</p>
               </item>
               <item>
                  <label>Interpreter:</label>
                  <p> A piece of software that (typically) implements a Virtual Machine and so
                     allows a game compiled to byte code to be run on the player’s computer; one
                     generally needs an interpreter to run a work of Interactive Fiction in the same
                     way that would need a copy of MS-Word to read a Word file, or a program such as
                     Windows Media Player to watch a DVD on a computer. The advantage is that an
                     interpreter needs to be written only once for each operating system (Windows,
                     MAC-OS, Linux, etc.) and can then play all the games written for that
                     interpreter.</p>
               </item>
               <item>
                  <label>Library:</label>
                  <p> A set of supporting routines supplied with an IF authoring system such as TADS
                     or Inform that handles most of the tasks common to most works of Interactive
                     Fiction; a library will typically implement a parser and at least a basic world
                     model, and will generally be written in the same language as that supplied with
                     the authoring system to allow ready customization by game authors. </p>
               </item>
               <item>
                  <label>Map:</label>
                  <p> The totality of rooms within a particular work of Interactive Fiction,
                     together with the interconnections between them.</p>
               </item>
               <item>
                  <label>Menu:</label>
                  <p> A set of options presented to a computer user from which he or she is meant to
                     select one.</p>
               </item>
               <item>
                  <label>Non Player Character (or NPC):</label>
                  <p> Any animate character (human, animal, alien or robotic) that appears in a work
                     of Interactive Fiction apart from the Player Character; characters whose
                     actions are not controlled by the Player Character. Usually, the term is
                     restricted to characters who are actually implemented and can be interacted
                     with rather than characters who are only mentioned or who never remain on stage
                     long enough for the Player Character to interact with.</p>
               </item>
               <item>
                  <label>Object:</label>
                  <p> Something physical that the Player Character can interact with (or at least
                     examine) in the course of the game, such as a table, chair, pen, or book (or,
                     indeed, another character). Some objects may be quasi-physical (such as smoke
                     or sunlight). In many IF authoring systems based on OOP (object-oriented
                     programming) design, <q>object</q> may also refer to a programming object; in
                     such systems a game object (in the first sense) will usually be represented by
                     a programming object (the second sense), but programming objects may also be
                     used for other purposes (if you don’t know anything about OOP, this second
                     sense of <q>object</q> is probably irrelevant to you).</p>
               </item>
               <item>
                  <label>Parser:</label>
                  <p> That part of the software in a work in the Interactive Fiction that interprets
                     the player’s command and translates it into an action that the program can
                     perform (or else complain if translation is impossible or ambiguous).</p>
               </item>
               <item>
                  <label>Player:</label>
                  <p> The flesh-and-blood human being typing the commands at a keyboard and reading
                     the game’s responses on screen.</p>
               </item>
               <item>
                  <label>Player Character (or PC):</label>
                  <p> The protagonist of a work of Interactive Fiction, whose actions are controlled
                     (or at least guided) by the player, and through whose eyes and ears the
                     fictional world is described to the player.</p>
               </item>
               <item>
                  <label>Room:</label>
                  <p> A (normally discrete) unit of space within the game’s map. The usual
                     convention is that the Player Character can interact with anything that is in
                     the same room as himself or herself (unless it is deliberately concealed), and
                     so a room is effectively that volume of space that is immediately present to
                     the Player Character. A room may be a room in the ordinary sense of a room
                     within a building, but it may also be a section of space outdoors, such as a
                     meadow, the top of a hill, or a section of street. </p>
               </item>
               <item>
                  <label>Scope:</label>
                  <p> Roughly speaking, the set of objects with which the Player Character can
                     currently interact, given the nature of the action he or she is meant to be
                     carrying out. Normally this will be restricted to the objects the PC can see or
                     touch, but this is not always the case. If the action is conversational, e.g.
                     ASK ACTOR ABOUT TOPIC, then any object (or topic) is potentially in scope. If
                     the author has implemented a GO TO ROOM command to take the Player Character to
                     anywhere on the map, then any (known) room will be in scope.</p>
               </item>
               <item>
                  <label>Spoiler:</label>
                  <p> A piece of information (typically in a review) which reveals too much to
                     someone who has yet to play the game, and so spoils the experience of playing
                     it for the first time.</p>
               </item>
               <item>
                  <label>TADS:</label>
                  <p> An acronym for Text Adventure Development System, one of the two major
                     languages/systems in which amateur Interactive Fiction is currently written.
                     TADS 2 is still in use, but the latest incarnation (in which <title
                        rend="quotes">All Hope Abandon</title> was written) is TADS 3. TADS was
                     written by and is maintained by Mike Roberts.</p>
               </item>
               <item>
                  <label>Virtual Machine (or VM):</label>
                  <p> technically, a computing device implemented in software rather than as a piece
                     of hardware (hence <q>virtual</q>); a piece of software that can execute byte
                     code written for it, usually implemented as an interpreter for Interactive
                     Fiction.</p>
               </item>
               <item>
                  <label>World Model:</label>
                  <p> That part of a work of an IF that defines the behaviour of the story-world in
                     which the action takes place (such as movement around the map, the containment
                     hierarchy, and some basic physics); typically, much of a game’s world model is
                     supplied by the library of the authoring system used.</p>
               </item>
               <item>
                  <label>Z-Machine:</label>
                  <p> The Virtual Machine for which the Infocom games were written, and to which
                     games written in Inform compile.</p>
