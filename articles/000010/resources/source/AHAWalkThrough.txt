"ALL HOPE ABANDON" WALKTHROUGH
==============================

To use this walkthrough, type the commands on lines beginning >.
Note that there's more than one way to win ALL HOPE ABANDON; this walkthrough
merely suggests one route to a winning solution that shows a reasonable amount
of the game, but you do no in fact need to type this exact sequence of commands
to win, and at several points you could do things very differently.

1. Inside the lecture hall
--------------------------
Start by studying your surroundings

>EXAMINE WORTSCHLACHTER
>X ME
>I
>X BLONDE WOMAN

1a. Flashback to breakfast
--------------------------
You may as well take the opportunity to talk to the blonde woman here.
It doesn't matter too much what you say; the following is one suggestion:

>IT'S GREAT
>NO
>A HIS BOOKS
(note that the above command is equivalent to ASK ABOUT HIS BOOKS)
>A HERSELF
>A PANTS
>A HERSELF
>A MARK
>T YOURSELF
(note: this is equivalent to TELL HER ABOUT YOURSELF)

1b. Flashback ended - back to the lecture
-----------------------------------------
Let's continue finding out more about the player character and what he's
doing there. The commands you use here don't really matter, as after a few
times you'll in any case find yourself suffering an attack and being transported
to a different place.

>X BADGE
>X HANDOUT
>X AUDIENCE
>CRY OUT
>STAND


2. In Limbo
------------
You find yourself in an unexpected place; at this stage it's not clear what it is,
or how you got here, so the first step is to explore your new surroundings.

>X FAINT ORANGE GLOW
>N
>X GATE
>X NOTICE
>X DEMON
>X LETTERING

2a. Chatting with the demon
---------------------------
Okay, maybe we can learn something from the workdemon, so let's try engaging him
in conversation:

>ASK DEMON ABOUT HELL
>A GATE
>A DEMYTHOLOGIZATION
>A BEST MATES
>A BULTMANN
>A HELL
>A TOTAL ANNIHILATION
>A DEMON
>A LETTERING
>A THEOLOGICAL CORRECTNESS
>A HEAVEN
>A HIMSELF

2b. Exploring some more
-----------------------
That's probably as much as we need to know from the demon for now, so let's explore
some more.

>W
>X THIN BLACK LINE
>X GOLDEN GLOW
>X LAVA
>N
>X HEAT
>X BRIDGE
>X POST
>X ROPE
>W
>E
>X FAINT GOLDEN GLOW
>X TREE
>CLIMB TREE
>X KNIFE
>TAKE IT
>I
>X STONE
>MOVE IT
>W
>S
>S


// See if the demon can shed any light on what we've found.
>SHOW KNIFE TO DEMON
>G
(= AGAIN)
>G
>A BRIDGE
>A GLOW
>G
>A KNIFE

//Now, what's with the pipe?
>E
>X PIPE
>STAND ON IT
>CLIMB HILLSIDE
>LOOK IN PIPE
>PULL CABLE
>BREAK IT
>CUT CABLE WITH KNIFE
>CRAWL INTO PIPE

3. Out of the frying pan?
-------------------------
You now find yourself inside a boiler that is mercifully defunct. The next job
is to find a way out.

>UP
>LOOK UP
>E
>X WINDOW
>CLEAN THE WINDOW
>X DUSTY ASH
>SEARCH IT
>X BLACK HANDLE
>PULL IT
>OUT

4. Victorian Hell
-----------------
Before we explore more widely, we'll take a close look at the two rooms comprising
this curious corner of Victorian Hell:

>X BOILER
>X OLD NEWSPAPER
>READ IT
>THINK ABOUT NEWSPAPER
>N
>X MURAL
>X BUREAU
>OPEN LID
>X STRANGE DEVICE
>X LENS
>TURN HANDLE
>LOOK THROUGH LENS
>TURN HANDLE
>LOOK
>OPEN SMALL RED BOX
>TAKE GREY DISK
>X DEVICE
>X SMALL PANEL
>OPEN IT
>TAKE BLACK DISK
>PUT GREY DISK IN COMPARTMENT
>LOOK THROUGH LENS
>TURN HANDLE
// The movie you see is a clue of sorts, so think about what it shows.
>OPEN GREEN BOX
>LOOK IN RED BOX
>PUT BRASS CYLINDER IN GREEN BOX
>PRESS BLACK BUTTON
>THINK ABOUT STRAUSS
>PUT SILVER CYLINDER IN GREEN BOX
>PUSH BLACK BUTTON
// The song you just heard was, of course, a parody of "Onward Christian Soldiers",
// but it's also a clue pointing to the same thing as the movie you saw earlier.
// Both concern destroying a city until nothing is left but a solitary church.
// We'll see the meaning of that later.

>X BUREAU
>X DRAWERS
>OPEN TOP DRAWER
>TAKE YELLOW LINING PAPER
>TAKE KEY
>OPEN BOTTOM DRAWER
>CLOSE DRAWERS
>UNLOCK BUREAU WITH KEY
>OPEN BUREAU
>TAKE BOTTLE
>X IT
>OPEN IT

5. The Parting of the Ways
--------------------------
Okay, we've done about as much as we need to do here, so where next?

>X SIGNS

Right, so it looks like we have a choice to make; let's go for the Via Moderna:

>NE
>I

Oops! We just lost dropped our inventory. Never mind, let's just continue exploring
for now.

>LOOK
>X BRASS SIGN
>NE
>X POSTER
>X RIFLE

It might be tempting to take this rifle, but it's actually better not to.

>E
>X MUD
>X RUINED CHURCH
Hm. A Ruined church standing alone among ruin and destruction. Does that remind you
of anything? Like the song and the movie perhaps?

>X CRATERS
>N
>ENTER CHURCH
>X DUSTY STONE FONT
>E
>TAKE SCRAP
>READ IT
>X APSE
>X FRAGMENTS
>SEARCH RUBBLE
>TAKE ALL
>W
>W
>W
>N
>X CLOCK
>X SLOT
>X EXAM BOOKLET
>READ EXAM QUESTIONS
>WRITE ON EXAM PAPER
>ANSWER QUESTION 1
>X PEN

6. The Quest for Ink
--------------------
Okay, obviously we need to fill the pen with ink before we can proceed with the exam.
Well, we dropped a bottle of ink back in the Long Hall, so let's go back for it.

>S
>Sw
>FILL PEN WITH INK
>NE

Oh dear! Now the pen has got some "Victorian" ink in it, the snappy door won't let it
through. We'll have to try another route.


7. The Via Antiqua
------------------
>NW
>NW
>X TREE
>X BRANCHES
>TOUCH TREE
>NW
>X SEA
>DRINK SEA
>SE
>SE
>N

Now that we find ourselves in this vast cathedral, let's look around a bit.

>X WINDOWS
>X CITY
>X BLONDE WOMAN
>X GREEN WOMAN
>X MOSES
>X SERPENT

We won't be meeting the green woman on this path through the game (though I'll give you
some pointers for how to find her). The empty tomb clearly refers back to Wortschachter's
lecture, while the blonde is Felicity. Perhaps Jesus walking on the sea and Moses with his
rod are clues for the future.

>N
>N
>W
>X STATUES
>X TALL WOMAN
>N
>X CARVING

If you want to go in search of the green woman, you could do so from here (as well as from two
other places on the via Antiqua). If you go back to the cathedral, you'll find a short metal
rod that fell onto the floor. Bring the rod back here and insert it in the eye of the carving.
Pull the key from the carving and press the foot. This should open the lid of the altar;
go down through the altar and use the stone key to unlock the door you'll find down there.
Go through the door and you'll shortly find yourself in a labyrinth. Once in it, there's no
way back: whatever route you try to take you'll shortly find yourself confronted by the green
woman (Agrath). This is an alternative route through the game you can explore on your own;
for now we'll continue trying to get back on the Via Moderna.

>S
>E
>E
>E
>LISTEN
>E
>X MOSAIC
>X CHRIST
>X WAVES
>X BOAT
>X MEN
>W
>W

By now this church should strike you as familiar; it's the same church you saw on the
battlefield, but before all the destruction took place. Maybe we can take advantage
of that somehow.

>DOWN
>X SLAB
>X CARVINGS
>X PAINTING
>X TREE
>X WOMAN
>X LONG BROWN HAIR
>FEEL PAINTING
>PRESS IT
>X DARK CAVE
>ENTER IT
>X STATUE
>X MANE

Incidentally, you could also go off in search of the green woman from here: what you
would need to do is to pull the mane, go down through the trap door that then opens
in the floor, then head north into the labyrinth. But for now, we'll stick with trying
to get into the battlefield church.

>X PILLAR
>CLIMB IT
>LOOK UP
>PUSH PILLAR
>CLIMB IT

At first sight you might think we're back in the church we just left, but a second look
should reassure you that this is the battlefield version of the church. So, let's go
and finish that exam.

8. Completing the Exam
----------------------

>W
>W
>N
>READ QUESTIONS
>ANSWER Q 1
>ANSWER Q 2
>ANSWER Q 6
>X BOOKLET
>PUT BOOKLET IN SLOT

9. Interlude
------------
We could nip straight through this section, but we'll pause to see what the monitor
has to show us:

>N
>X YELLOW DOOR
>N
>E
>X NOTE
>X EXAM BOOKLET
>X TV MONITOR
>TURN ON SWITCH
>X DIAL
>X MONITOR
>TURN DIAL TO 1
>TURN DIAL TO 2
>TURN DIAL TO 3
>TURN DIAL TO 4
>TURN DIAL TO 5
>TURN DIAL TO 6
>TURN DIAL TO 7
>TURN DIAL TO 8
>TURN DIAL TO 9
>X BUTTONS
>PRESS GREEN BUTTON
>OUT
>N


10. The Deconstruction Chamber
-----------------------------
It'll soon become apparent that we're somehow back in the subject-matter of
Wortschlachter's lecture. It should also soon become apparent that about the
only commands that work in the Deconstruction Chamber are EXAMINE and THINK ABOUT,
so let's get examining and thinking:

>X SCREEN
>THINK ABOUT MARK
>THINK ABOUT TEXT
>THINK ABOUT JESUS
>THINK ABOUT HOPE
>THINK ABOUT LOVE
>THINK ABOUT A WAY OUT
// We could have typed this command straight away; the other ones are listed just
// to show how this place works.


11. The Garden and the Tomb
---------------------------
Well, this is still related to Wortschlachter's lecture, so let's take a look around
before entering the cave:

>X TOMB
>X STONE
>X MARKING
>W
>X TREE
>X FRUIT
>TAKE FRUIT
>N
>I
>UNLOCK DOOR WITH KEY
>N
>X VALLEY
>X FLAMES
>X HILLSIDE
>X CROSSES
>N
>S
>E
>ENTER TOMB

We now find ourselves confronted by a puzzle that's not quite what it seems at first;
what matters is not what you do so much as knowing why you do it (it's intended as a
satire on some types of modern historical Jesus scholarship).

>ASK ABOUT BEADS
>THINK ABOUT JESUS SEMINAR
>A AUTHENTICITY
>A CRITERIA
>A SCROLL
>THINK ABOUT CRITERIA
>THINK ABOUT MULTIPLE ATTESTATION
>THINK ABOOT DOUBLE DISSIMILARITY
>LOOK
>X OSSUARY
>TAKE IT
>X IT
>OPEN IT
>X ROSETTE
>TURN IT
>X MENORAH
>PRESS IT
>TURN ROSETTE
>OPEN LID
>TAKE SCROLL
>READ IT
>GIVE RED BEAD TO MAN
>YES
>YES
>NORTH

12. Lake and Valley
------------------
You would also emerge at this point had you stuck with the Via Antiqua and
encountered Agrath.

You could in principle go wandering over the plain for ever, but that would
be wholly unproductive. The way ahead is across the lake, and both the stained-glass
window and the mural in the apse of the intact church have shown you how to do that.

>WALK ON WATER
>DROP ALL
>WALK ON WATER
>N
>THINK

We don't actually need to take a detour down the slope, but since we're here
we may as well see what's there.

>NE
>X GREEN GATE
>E
>SIT ON SOFA
>TAKE FOLDER
>OPEN IT
>READ IT
>X PICTURE
>OUT
>OUT
>UP

13. The Steep and Rugged Pathway
--------------------------------
Your thoughts at this place suggest that this is the way you need to go, so let's
give it a try:

>X NARROW PATHWAY
>X MOUNTAIN
>UP
>X VALLEY
>OPEN GATE
>X IT
>REMOVE THORNS
>OPEN GATE
>UP


14. Skull Mountain
------------------
According to the Gospels, Jesus was crucified between two criminals at a place
called Golgotha, 'the place of the skull'. That's the key to understanding this
scene - the central cross is the cross of Jesus, so what we put on the titulus
(and it doesn't make any in-game difference what that is) is in a sense a statement
about what Jesus stands for. But remember that the Christian story doesn't end
with the death of Jesus; there's a resurrection too. If we put something on the
titulus we must expect to see it resurrected.

>X BLACK SUN
>X GOLDEN GLOW
>X OLD BONES
>X LARGE STONE
>X CROW
>X CROSSES
>SEARCH BONES
>TAKE STACK
>TAKE CROW
>TAKE BONES
>THROW STONE AT CROW
>ASK CROW ABOUT CROSSES
>A CRIMINALS
>A CENTRAL CROSS
>A WORDS
>PUT HOPE ON CROSS
// or whichever of the words you choose.
>STAND ON STONE
>PUT HOPE ON CROSS
>X HOLE
>DOWN
>D
>DROP ALL
>D

15. Resurrection and Apocalytpic Chess
--------------------------------------
Once again we find ourselves in an "Empty Tomb" (empty in the sense that there's
no body). It's not hard to get out of here, but what comes next may be more of
a challenge:

>UP
>X FLAT SHELF
>W
>X PILATE
>X CAIAPHAS
>X CHESS BOARD
>X CHESS PIECES
>ASK PILATE ABOUT GAME
>Z

This strange chess game is based very loosely on a reading of the book of Revelation
(with a little bit of help from 4 Ezra). It is the lamb who was slain and is risen,
Jesus of Nazareth, who conquers the forces of oppression exemplified by the Roman Empire,
but not necessarily by force of arms:

>ASK EMPEROR ABOUT GAME
>PLAY GAME
>X PIECES
>X BOARD
>MOVE WHITE PAWN
>X WHORE
>TAKE WHORE WITH PAWN
>LOOK UNDER TABLE
(Remember where the Emperor got his whore from)
>TAKE SHAPED PIECE
>X IT
>PUT QUEEN ON BOARD
>TAKE WHORE WITH QUEEN
>X EMPEROR
>W



16. Paradise Regained? Back to Eden
-----------------------------------
>N
>N
>E
>W
>X TREE
>X APPLE
>TAKE IT
>X SNAKE
>A GOLDEN
>A HELL
>A NETHERWORLD
>A HEAVEN


17. Finding Hope and Felicity
-----------------------------
>S
>W
>TALK TO FELICITY
>N
>X LECTERN
>SEARCH IT
>TAKE PARCHMENT
>READ IT

Well, maybe the reference to Moses put you mind of that stained-glass window in the
cathedral with Moses performing his rod-snake trick. It so happens there's a
conveniently-placed snake nearby...

>S
>X HOPE
>E
>N
>TELL SNAKE ABOUT FELICITY
>TELL HIM YOU NEED A ROPE
>YES
>PICK UP THE SNAKE
>X ROPE
>S
>W
>THROW ROPE TO FELICITY
>PULL ROPE
>G
>G

Now you've rescued her, it's time to get reacquainted, and then get out of here.

>X FELICITY
>A HERSELF
>A PROF
>A HELL
>YES
>S
>X RECESS
>X SLAB
>PUSH IT
>TAKE OSSUARY
>X LEVER
>PULL IT
>TURN LEVER

Okay, this is going to require a collaborative effort:
>PULL LEVER
>ASK FELICITY TO TURN THE WHEEL
>S
>X GLOW

Ah yes, that golden glow! Maybe the time has come to find a way to reach it.

>T GLOW
>D
>S
>S
>E
>LOOK IN PIPE
>X GRATING
>PULL GRATING

Well, there's no chance of going that way, so it's back to the bridge:

>W
>W
>N

Aha! Now here's a dilemma, which will you choose? Will you let Felicity sacrifice her
chances by letting you across so you can reach that fabulous golden glow? Not without
a protest surely!

>REFUSE
>ARGUE
>PROTEST
>YES

Oh dear, we walked into that one! Well, in that case we may as well try crossing
the bridge and seeing what happens:

>CROSS THE BRIDGE
>X ROTTING FLOWERS
>N
>TAKE OSSUARY
>OPEN IT
>TAKE SCROLL
>READ IT
>S
>X GLOW
>Sw
Well that didn't work out too well! Fortunately we can try again and aim for a
happier outcome:

>RETRY
>Y
>REFUSE
>TAKE ROPE
>YES
>THANK HER


And that's it!
