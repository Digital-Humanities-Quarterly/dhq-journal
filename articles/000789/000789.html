The goal of this study was to explore the new perspective that artificial intelligence (AI) can provide us with when we study traditional methods and heterogenous domains. When we translate the task (painter attribution), we have to consider the idiosyncrasies of the data domain (Attic vase paintings). This is challenging for both, classical archaeologists and computer scientists. In this paper, we address how to approach the challenges in the creation of the dataset. We carefully selected and prepared the data, reflected on potential biases and trained a convolutional neural network (CNN) accordingly. Specifically, we developed sampling criteria to combat the biases and a hierarchical labelling system to segment the images into details. Our model architecture was designed to process sets of images instead of only one individual image, which enables us to experiment with different combinations of image segments. This forms the basis for an analysis framework, which allows us to go beyond mere painter attribution and to explore the ambiguity of image similarity itself. </p><p>In this case study the authors explore Attic vase painters using CNNs, investigating image similarity through both archaeological and computational perspectives.</p></div><h2>Table of contents</h2><ul class="toc toc_body"><li class="toc"><span class="headingNumber">1. </span><a class="toc toc_0" href="#index.xml-body.1_div.1">1.

Introduction</span></h1></header><p>When visitors look at a painting in a museum, they might expect a clear answer to the question “who painted it?”. Often a painting contains a signature, which makes the answer to this question seem pretty obvious. However, the answer is not always straightforward. Sometimes the painter cannot be pinpointed to one specific individual, and our knowledge might be limited to a timeframe, a region, a workshop. Even well-known paintings were not always signed. A good example is the Sleeping Venus. It was first thought to be from the school of Titian and was later identified to be by Giorgione (Anderson 1996; Lüdemann 2005; Uglow 2014). Identifying a painter is a riddle, waiting to be solved by Art Historians and Classical Archaeologists. In our project EGRAPHSEN we view this question from the perspective of artificial intelligence (AI): Can AI help solving this riddle? What does this reveal about the task itself? And more importantly: How can artificial intelligence help us go beyond that and answer fundamental questions regarding image similarity and variation? How exactly does an artificial neural network differ from a human scholar? Painter attribution – the task of identifying painters on unsigned images – is a complex field with many differing opinions, which poses a challenge to the operationalisation of the task from the data selection up to the interpretation of the results. </p><p>The overall situation is complicated: It was not always common practice to sign paintings. And even a famous painter may have left some paintings unsigned, for reasons which we can only speculate about (Hegener and Horsthemke 2013; Burg 2007). Nor is an existing signature necessarily a confirmation of authorship, as it may have been forged for profit (Jones and Craddock 1990). Due to atelier workflows we cannot take real historical signatures at face value either: Was it the actual painter who signed a work, or the leader of the workshop (Liedtke 2004, Büttner 2017)? Overall, painter attribution can be understood as a tool which paves the way for further research on historical contexts, workshop processes and style in general. </p><p>In EGRAPHSEN we approach this task at the very core: Our main focus lies in understanding painter attribution as a method, especially its manifestation in Classical archaeology. Our use case are Attic vase paintings from Greek antiquity, which pose an even greater challenge than later canvas paintings, as the former are only rarely signed at all. With this, other hints to solving this riddle become increasingly important, which in this case are primarily found in the visual comparison of stylistic phenomena. By studying the artists styles a scholar can “develop an eye” for the respective artists. As fundamental as this method is, this skill is subjective and not always verifiable. The expert’s eye has to be trained and for an untrained eye the arguments might seem elusive and presumptuous, begging the question if they hold any value at all. Throughout the times the value of connoisseurship has been questioned in both Art History and Classical Archaeology (for the classical archaeological perspective see: Graepler 2016; Sparkes 2013, 90–113). The discussion is extensive and while Painter attribution has its defenders (Oakley 1998), it is still controversial and challenging to navigate. Despite of this, painter attribution is still practiced in major publications recently. The insight it offers is too valuable, making it a good use case to revise and discuss traditional methods through the lens of a novel computational approach. </p><p>With this, we are also researching the role of AI in in humanities disciplines, including its metrics and its dangers. Humans are complex, as is humanities research and the material we study. Can a computer understand humans or art? This is a controversial question, which leads to heated discussions between computer scientists and art historians (Wasielewski 2023). Our work adds a case study which emphasizes the complexity of humanities research questions and the necessity of an informed and reflective approach, shaping the data compilation closely to our research questions. </p><p>Our use case is particularly suitable because of its dual nature: On the one hand it is strictly about shapes and lines: the style of a painting. We call them formal characteristics, with “form” meaning the lines and shapes, the design, arrangement and style. This describes a phenomenological approach to images that should not be confused with formalism as a scholarly direction of the late 20th century (Pinotti 2012). These characteristics ultimately help answer the question: “How is a painting painted?” in contrast to what is painted. It seems that neither a human nor a computer needs additional information beyond the painting itself to be able to “learn” connoisseurship. On the other hand, painter attribution includes subjectivity and visual association and therefore uncertainty, fuzziness and ambiguity. These concepts are difficult to grasp with computational methods, but they are essential for the method of painter attribution as well as many research questions in the humanities in general. At first glance, it seems that painter attribution could be easily translated into a machine learning classification set-up, with the different painters representing the classes. However, human connoisseurship is inherently instinctive and algorithms require specificity. A neural network needs distinct and well-defined categories to function, but the data is subject to biases and distortion. In the end, additional information beyond the painting might prove more important than one might anticipate. </p><p>This research promises new insights on both sides: As Classical Archaeologists we re-evaluate our view on painter attribution and the underlying concept of image similarity through the lens of AI, while Computer Scientists re-evaluate their algorithms using our complex and heterogenic data. Thus, our research goal is as follows: We aim to evaluate and develop methods for image-related research questions with the help of artificial intelligence. We do not aim at recreating painter attribution through computational means; instead we re-evaluate it critically and beyond its surface. In EGRAPHSEN we developed methods to (1) compile our data in a meaningful way and (2) explore image similarity with computational means. In this paper we are going to present the first part of our research and provide a preliminary insight into our results. </p><p>Working with AI presents major challenges when it comes to the translation of humanities knowledge into data – and conversely, it is also difficult to generate knowledge from experiment results. For the purpose of this paper, our research question can be divided into the following sub-questions: </p><ul><li class="item">How do we operationalize the traditional method painter attribution and how does it relate to the algorithms used?</li><li class="item">What biases must be taken into account when compiling the dataset, and to what extent can we control the input in order to find an adequate data representation for the purpose of attribution?</li></ul><p> Overall, these questions set the baseline for the interpretation and exploration of the model in regards to uncertainty and fuzziness of visual references and relations.</p><p>In a first step we need to contextualize our research questions, both for the traditional method (2.1) as well as in regards to other computational painter attribution projects (2.2) and machine learning in general (2.3). Doing so, we want to demonstrate the methodological demands of the task. The second step concerns the sampling strategies on different levels of input – the selection of painters (3) and the selection of input segments (4). After a short interim conclusion (5), we present our experimental set-up and model architecture (6), where we outline the main challenges of the algorithms. We then provide a first analysis of our results, which outlines our model’s performance and first insights into the similarity networks between the painters (7). A final conclusion explores possibilities for further research, including an outlook on the analysis part of our work (8). </p></section><section class="teidiv0" id="index.xml-body.1_div.2"><header><h1><span class="headingNumber">2. </span><span class="head">2.

How do Classical Archaeologists attribute painters on Attic vases? </p><p>We study an era so long ago that some aspects of the culture have been distorted and lost. Yet others have been carefully preserved. The ancient world has fascinated many people throughout the times, sometimes even taking on an exemplary character. This includes all kinds of cultural property: history, philosophy and literature. As Classical Archaeologists we study the appearance, execution, creation and contexts of material culture, developing methods to describe the developments of imagery, objects and style. For this purpose, we have to correlate them with each other, which results in intricate chronological and typological systems (on the dating of vases specifically see Schmidt 2022). One interest of painter attribution lies in the creation of such an overarching system based on individual style, but also covering chronological aspects. </p><p>The interest in the objects themselves is manifold due to the insight they give us into the realities and ideas of life in ancient Greek society. One aspect is their use in everyday life, for example as grave goods (Tsingarida 2009). Another aspect concerns the imagery they depict. The themes range from mythological stories to portrayals of everyday Athenian citizens (Bérard and Vernant 1985). This gives us an insight into the values, ideas and culture of that time. Research on Attic vase paintings is vast, as witnessed by numerous introductory handbooks on the subject (Vierneisel 1990; Robertson 1992a; Scheibler 1995; Boardman 2001; Mannack 2012; Cook 2013; Sparkes 2013). Another interest lies in artisan production and craftsmanship (Coulson, Oakley, and Palagia 1997; Palagia and Oakley 1997; J. Oakley 2014; Eschbach and Schmidt 2016). </p><p>While some artists’ names, for example those of sculptors, are known from historical sources , we do not know much about vase painters historically. Sometimes, however, there is a Greek name painted on a vase, accompanied by the phrase EΓΡAΦΣEN (I was painted by), meaning that the person with that name painted that particular vase (Osborne 2010; Pevnick 2010; Hurwit 2015). These signatures were tempting clues that fuelled scholars to study the painters of the vases as if they were great masters. The deep appreciation for the paintings and the challenge of analysing their stylistic details led to decades of research on painter attribution in 19th-20th century Classical Archaeology (Schmidt 2016). The question “Who painted this vase?” became hard to resist. </p><p>One particular scholar, Sir John Davidson Beazley (1885-1970), emerged as an authority in this field. Beazley developed his skills at the height of painter attribution research on Attic vases during the first half of the 20th century (Rouet 2001). But his method is often retraced to earlier studies of Renaissance paintings and the specific approach developed by the art historian and doctor of human anatomy Giovanni Morelli (1816-1891, see Kurtz 1986). Morelli theorized about painter attribution and developed a specific approach for this task. It was his approach, that led to the Sleeping Venus being recognized as a painting by Giorgione. Morelli prided himself on being a anatomist and his method consisted of a systematic and refined comparison of anatomical details between the alleged paintings of an artist. Specifically those details that might seem insignificant at first glance turn out to be particularly important, because this is where the individuality of the artists is most clearly expressed (Wollheim 1973; Ginzburg and Davin 1980; Vakkari 2001; Hinojosa 2009; Uglow 2014). Regardless of whether Beazley actually followed Morelli specifically, it is conceivable that Attic vase painters could be distinguished by such characteristics as well. The craftsmen produced multiple paintings per day and were routinely handling their tools, making shapes flow easily from their hands. </p><p>By studying the signed works of a painter, scholars were able to grasp a painter’s handwriting, with details like eyes, hands or ankles being the letters. Looking at a signed cup (Figure 1 ), we are able gain a first impression of the painter Douris. He is one of the painters with the most signatures and as such his style is well studied and established (Buitron-Oliver 1995). Looking at the pictures, we are often drawn to the faces first. It is possible to discern the similarity between eyes or mouths, for example. Their context is also important: How are the features arranged in the face? How big or small are they? Are they scrunched together or more spaced out? With this, we look beyond mere letters, we also consider the context; the words they are used in. Scholars have of course examined not only faces, but other body parts as well. In fact, the monograph on Douris features a section on the renderings of larger body parts of naked male figures, such as the chest and the legs (Buitron-Oliver 1995). </p><p>Studying the paintings in great detail gives a good impression of a painter’s idiosyncrasies. But it also reveals the variation of their ‘handwriting’. Beazley was one of the first to shift the focus from the signed works and to unsigned works on a larger scale (Neer 1997; Sparkes 2013; John H. Oakley 2009; Pérez 2018; Driscoll 2019). Not only was he able to identify unsigned paintings from known painters, he even identified painters with no known signatures at all. He named them after a topic they painted (e. g. “painter of the Paris Gigantomachy") or the city of the museum with their most well-known work (e. g. “Berlin Painter"). This way, he created an extensive structure with hundreds of painters. </p><figure class="figure"><figcaption class="caption">Figure 1. Faces from a signed cup by Douris.

Figure 2 shows a few examples of the way the Berlin Painter drew faces. Beazley was especially fascinated by this painter, as attested by several publications (Beazley 1922; 1930; 1911). In the first publication he describes the linework of a handful of vases in great detail. He not only looked at faces, but placed great importance on the rendering of the body and especially the drapery of the clothes. A combination of all the features, including their deviations, led him to the conclusion that these particular vases must come from one hand. He writes "A system so definite, coherent, distinctive, and in some respects so wilful, is most easily intelligible as a personal system" and "the child, above all else, of one man's brain and will (Beazley 1922). He describes the painters’ style as “system of renderings”, which helps to understand his approach: Beazley compared not only stylistic details, but their overall interconnection, allowing him to not only identify known painters, but systems themselves. Beazley trained his eye well during his long-lasting career and sometimes he changed his mind about certain attributions. The more pictures he studied, the better his connoisseurship became. </p><p>Beazley’s success was unparalleled and many of his observations, especially those regarding the Berlin Painter, still hold value today (Sparkes 2013; Oakley 2017). His most important contribution remain the volumes of his Attic vase painter series, where he simply lists hundreds of thousands of vases, sorted by painter (Beazley 1963; Beazley 1956). His approach itself became subject of study as well (Kurtz 1986; Neer 1997). This demonstrates the ambivalent relationship of Classical Archaeology towards painter attribution. </p><figure class="figure"><figcaption class="caption">Figure 2.
