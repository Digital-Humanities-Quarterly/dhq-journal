                <!-- Include a brief abstract of the article -->
                <p>In recent years, there has been impressive progress in the automatic analysis of
                    Spanish verse. However, despite the excellent results of previous attempts,
                    there is still room for improvement, as this article shows. It presents
                    libEscansión, a new automatic scansion tool that, although initially designed
                    for analysing the verses of plays, outperforms all its predecessors in the
                    scansion of fixed-meter poetry. The library uses two novel approaches to achieve
                    this result: linguistically, it uses Castilian syllabification instead of the
                    more diphthong-prone American syllabic division. It uses a dedicated module that
                    can also be run independently. Methodologically, the library resolves metrical
                    ambiguities using a perceptibility-based recursive prioritisation system. The
                    combination of both allows libEscansión to perform a scansion 0.78% more
                    accurately than the best of its peers against a gold standard corpus, reaching
                    an accuracy of 97.01% (99.50% discarding non-erroneous disagreements).</p>

                <head>Introduction and motivation</head>
                <p>Spanish Golden Age plays are composed in verse, and their analysis requires
                    considering their metrical features. A noteworthy feature of these works is
                    their polymetry – that is, they combine sections of different metres without a
                    solution of continuity –, although octosyllables are predominant. Nevertheless,
                    there are further challenges beyond the polymetry as the ortho-typography may be
                    unorthodox, intercalations of words, verses, or even whole stanzas in different
                    languages are not uncommon, and, most importantly, the poetic creation serves
                    the speech and not the other way around. Spoken language is, thus, the actual
                    gold standard to which we have to aspire. Unfortunately, working with recordings
                    turns out to be a difficult endeavour, as it raises several practical challenges
                    but, in the first place, involves theoretical issues regarding sample
                    representativity <ptr target="#sanchez2017"/>. Therefore, we have opted for a
                    simplified model, which phonology fulfils in the case of speech, even if
                    assuming some general metrical principles.</p>
                <p>Digital approaches to classical Spanish theatre have experienced a small golden
                    age in recent years, largely thanks to the role played by stylometry in the
                    attribution to Lope de Vega of the obscure play <title xml:lang="es">La francesa
                        Laura</title> as a result of research by Álvaro Cuéllar and Germán Vega
                        García-Luengos<ptr target="#cuellarvega2023a"/>. This groundbreaking
                    discovery brought worldwide media attention to digital methodologies applied to
                    philological studies. However, such an astonishing discovery is not an isolated
                    event but the culmination of the rapid development of Digital Humanities in the
                    literary studies of the Spanish Golden Age theatre. Studies dedicated to this
                    historical genre with digital methodologies have flourished over the last
                    decade, making them a mainstream tool in the field. This has spilt over effects
                    on other areas, timidly opening the door to their adoption, notwithstanding the
                    commendable work of some notable scholars dedicated to other periods and genres
                        <ptr target="#calvo2021"/> of Hispanic literature within the digital
                    humanistic field - some even renowned pioneers of Spanish digital philology <ptr
                        target="#fradejas2010"/> – and a well-grounded theoretical scaffolding on
                    Digital Humanities in in general <ptr target="#rio2022"/>. However, in spite of
                    these almost isolated, albeit fruitful, efforts, the convergence of research
                    groups in these other areas has not, in general, reached a critical mass that
                    would give it a momentum comparable to that enjoyed by the theatre of the Golden
                    Age, which has already come to the the point where even well-informed
                    self-reflection takes place <ptr target="#hernandez2020"/>.</p>
                <p>Recent developments in digital philology focused on Spanish Early Modern theatre
                    should be understood in their context and, most specifically, considering a
                    crucial factor that has prompted such an explosion: the relative availability of
                    well-curated editions. The colossal annotated edition by Presotto <ptr
                        target="#vega"/>, which sets the quality standards that further attempts
                    should pursue, has found worthy successors in project Prolope <ptr
                        target="#prolope"/>, DICAT <ptr target="#dicat"/> or ISTAE <ptr
                        target="#istae"/>. Even though they have more modest pretensions than their
                    predecessor, as the resources are shared among multiple plays, they provide a
                    fixated text with enough enrichments to perform distant analyses of multiple
                    types on it. </p>
                <p>These projects have paved the way for further endeavours in the field of digital
                    humanities by providing qualitative editions ready to be used as subjects for
                    computer-assisted analysis. Stylometry, together with digital editions, is
                    arguably the spearhead of this advance <ptr target="#calvo2016"/><ptr
                        target="#cuellar2024"/><ptr target="#cuellarvega2023b"/> which undoubtedly
                    benefits from recent advances in palaeographic text recognition <ptr
                        target="#rosacuellarlehmann2024"/><ptr target="#cuellar2023b"/>, metrical
                    analysis of plays <ptr target="#krollsanz2022"/><ptr target="#krollsanz2023"
                        /><ptr target="#sanzlazaro2024b"/> and dramatic analysis <ptr
                        target="#ehrlicheretal2020"/>.</p>
                <p>Even if in a more modest way, several new approaches have arisen in recent years
                    to facilitate automatic metrical scansion of Spanish verses. The ways they
                    tackle ambiguity resolution are diverse, but, in most cases, the outcomes are
                    fairly positive as they tend to fall into the narrow margin of human
                    inter-annotator agreement. In other words, they perform as well as their human
                    counterparts. However, this also means that bias among human annotators may
                    produce a more tolerant gold standard and increase the margin of the
                    inter-annotator agreement. This seems to happen with the corpus of sonnets ADSO
                    100 <ptr target="#navarrocoloradoetal2016"/> used by precedent studies as a gold
                    standard <ptr target="#marcogonzalo2021"/>. Therefore, we have some grounds to
                    believe that the 96% inter-annotator agreement Navarro-Colorado <ptr
                        target="#navarrocolorado2017"/> reported may be an underestimation.
                    Consequently, we considered whether metrical analysis could benefit from another
                    take on the issue, especially regarding the two primary sources of
                    inconsistencies: syllabification and verse ambiguities.</p>
                <p>The particular issues raised by a play must be adequately addressed to analyse
                    Golden Age theatre as such pieces are intended for the stage and, consequently,
                    an adequate interpretation leaves little place for orthographical idealisations.
                    On the other hand, speech follows phonological rules to solve the interaction
                    between neighbouring sounds. Indeed, one such situation is when vowels interact
                    between word boundaries, a prominent Spanish verse adjustment device. Therefore,
                    phonological rules apply. However, staged Golden Age plays substantially differ
                    from ordinary speech, as they are intended not to be ordinarily spoken but
                    declaimed. Consequently, the most extreme assimilation issues typical of rapid
                    and careless speech in everyday conversation are virtually nonexistent in the
                    genre. Conversely, plays provide additional information that poetry lacks, which
                    allows informed guesses on the length of particular verses.</p>
                <p>As a result, we have designed a tool for theatre-analysis purposes, which
                    produces state-of-the-art results when tested against fixed metres. We aimed to
                    produce a reusable library to scan Spanish verses that is able to cope with all
                    the shortcomings stated above. That is, the result should be robust enough to
                    handle orthographic and linguistic irregularities, consider phonological
                    exceptions, and solve ambiguities in the best way possible. We have built on
                    previous works, considering that Navarro-Colorado's <ptr
                        target="#navarrocolorado2017"/> PoS-tag/syllabification model is
                    conceptually sound and the nearest to manual analysis. Posterior developments of
                    the idea <ptr target="#rosaetal2020b"/> have succeeded by focusing on those
                    areas more prone to be the culprit of scansion errors, setting the right track
                    to follow. The result is three Python libraries for syllabification <ptr
                        target="#sanzlazaro2021b"/>, phonological transcription <ptr
                        target="#sanzlazaro2021a"/>, and metrical scansion <ptr
                        target="#sanzlazaro2023b"/>.</p>

                <head>Related work</head>
                <p>Studies on automatic metrical scansion of Spanish verse have already yielded
                    significant outcomes. There were promising results already at the very beginning
                    of the 2000s when Gervás <ptr target="#gervas2000"/> conducted a groundbreaking
                    study on the matter. He primarily used a dictionary approach to syllabification,
                    resorting to rules only for those words lacking a matching key in the
                    dictionary. This process provides a list of syllables, the syllable count,
                    prosodic stresses and rhyme. As with any pioneer method, this one presented
                    various shortcomings that must be addressed. The first issue arises due to
                    stress identification, as it only considers orthography. As a result, unstressed
                    syllables such as, for instance, the determiners <foreign xml:lang="es"
                        >la</foreign> and <foreign xml:lang="es">mi</foreign> are marked as
                    stressed. Therefore, the first verse of Quevedo's famous sonnet <title
                        xml:lang="es">Amor constante más allá de la muerte</title>, with which
                    Gervás illustrates its paper, would be parsed as in <ref target="#example01"
                        >Example 1</ref> below.</p>
                <eg xml:id="example01" xml:lang="es"> Cerrar podrá mis ojos la postrera <emph>ce
                        rrár po drá mís ójos lá pos tré ra</emph>
                    <code>- + - + + + - + - + -</code>
                </eg>
                <p>Even though the classification of this particular verse in one of the four major
                    hendecasyllabic types – which is Gervás' approach – would not be affected, a
                    more fine-grained analysis of the verse shows the problem: this short heroic
                        <note n="1">We use Varela Merino, Moíno Sánchez and Jauralde Pou <ptr
                            target="#varelaetal2005"/> systematics here for convenience.
                        LibEscansión aims to describe the features of the verse and considers the
                        criteria used by Varela Merino, Moíno Sánchez, and Jauralde Pou as well as
                        Navarro Tomás <ptr target="#navarrotomas2015"/> in their respective
                        taxonomies. It provides enough elements of judgment to classify a verse
                        according to both systems but does not perform the classification
                        itself.</note> verse would be classified as a long one. Furthermore,
                    improper stresses may alter even the primary classification if located in one of
                    the first four syllables. The second issue is related to the sequential way
                    Gervás analyses synaloephas. The resolution is straightforward if the number of
                    supernumerary syllables equals the potential synaloephas. However, if the
                    numbers do not match, parsing the verse from left to right one potential
                    synaloepha at a time may place a synaloepha between the wrong pair of vowels.
                    Moreover, Gervás acknowledges that his programme does not offer a satisfactory
                    method to solve ambiguities derived from tropes such as synaereses and hiatuses.
                    In any case, the author reported an 88.73% accuracy against ADSO 100 <ptr
                        target="#navarrocoloradoetal2016"/>, a corpus of 100 manually annotated
                    sonnets that has become the gold standard for fixed-metre scansion in the last
                    years <ptr target="#marcoetal2021"/>.</p>
                <p>Navarro-Colorado <ptr target="#navarrocolorado2015"/> noted those shortcomings,
                    which led him to develop a more sophisticated method. In order to improve stress
                    identification, the words are first PoS-tagged – that is, they are annotated
                    with information regarding their grammatical category – to decide whether they
                    are stressed. Roughly described, classes such as, for instance, verbs or nouns
                    carry prosodic stress in Spanish, while prepositions or conjunctions do not, ,
                    regardless of the word's intrinsic lexical stress <ptr target="#quilis2013"/>.
                    The next step is syllabifying and placing prosodic stresses only in those words
                    with the appropriate PoS-tag. If the syllable count is eleven, a hendecasyllabic
                    verse is solved. Otherwise, the programme launches an adjusting module. If it
                    produces multiple potential results, it calls a disambiguation module to
                    consider all possible alternatives in the corpus. This approach solves Gervas'
                    stress placement problem and substantially improves ambiguity resolution, which
                    raises the accuracy to 94.44% <ptr target="#marcoetal2021"/> against the same
                    test corpus.</p>
                <p>Some years later, Agirrezabal, Alegría, and Hulden <ptr
                        target="#agirrezabaletal2017"/> approached the issue by employing neural
                    networks, with a reported accuracy of 90.84%. However, the best results have not
                    been obtained until the current decade. More concretely, Rantanplan <ptr
                        target="#rosaetal2020b"/> reaches 96.22% against ADSO 100 <ptr
                        target="#marcoetal2021"/> following Navarro-Colorado's classic approach,
                    making this last project the most accurate up to the present date. Furthermore,
                    it reduces the processing time from 40 min to 3s. Almost simultaneously, another
                    team at the same university developed a new approach, Jumper <ptr
                        target="#marcogonzalo2021"/>, which neither syllabifies the words nor relies
                    on PoS-tagging. These innovations improve the scansion speed even more with
                    minimal accuracy loss, reaching an astounding 94.97% in 0.31s analysing
                    Navarro-Colorado's corpus. </p>

                <p>As previous methods do, we have divided metrical scansion into two stages: naive
                    analysis and syllabic adjustment, but we approach the latter in a different
                    fashion. Firstly, we perform the syllabification and PoS-tagging of the words.
                    Then, we try to adjust the verse if it does not match the expected syllable
                    count. Our library introduces two novelties – apart from the phonological
                    transcription, which is for convenience rather than conceptual – namely, full
                    exceptions-handling in the syllabification and its approach to ambiguity
                    resolution (see <ref target="#figure01">Figure 1</ref>).</p>

                    <head>Naive analysis</head>
                    <p>The first step is a word-wise analysis of the verse by the libEscansión class
                            <code>PlayLine</code>, whose practical usage is explained <ref
                            target="#usage">below</ref>. It consists of dividing the words into
                        syllables and determining whether a particular word carries prosodic stress.
                        The former task is carried out by the library Fonemas <ptr
                            target="#sanzlazaro2021a"/>, whilst the latter resorts to Stanza <ptr
                            target="#qietal2020"/> PoS-tagger to determine the grammatical category
                        and whether it is stressed. This class has two public attributes: a string
                        containing the verse and a list of its words, each of whose elements is, in
                        turn, another list with the corresponding word syllables, which are marked
                        if they carry metric stress.</p>

                    <head>Syllabification</head>
                    <p>Even though a phonological transcription is not strictly necessary to analyse
                        a verse, it is convenient for diverse reasons. Firstly, using IPA notation
                        with a single Unicode character for each phoneme expedites the
                        straightforward handling of syllabic division, as we can treat each
                        character equally without exceptions<note n="2">A SAMPA transcription, for
                            instance, would share the disadvantages of the orthographic text in this
                            regard.</note>. Spanish digraphs (<emph>ch</emph>, <emph>rr</emph>,
                            <emph>ll</emph>, <emph>qu</emph>, <emph>gu</emph>) or phonemes
                        represented by a single grapheme (e.g., <emph>x</emph>) are no longer
                        required. Second, the output allows an out-of-the-box rhyme analysis as the
                        relation phoneme-character is biunivocal, which spares a special treatment
                        for ambiguous graphemes (<emph>b</emph>, <emph>v</emph>, <emph>c</emph>,
                            <emph>z</emph>, <emph>g</emph>). In this step, the text is not only
                        transcribed but also preprocessed. Stranded letters are transliterated to
                        their spelling (e.g., <emph>B</emph> would become <emph>be</emph>) as well
                        as non-Spanish diacritics (e.g., Catalan <emph xml:lang="cat">què</emph>
                        would become <emph>ké</emph>); other potential sources of errors are also
                        handled here (e.g., typographic ligatures). Finally, it allows a
                        straightforward treatment of vowel clusters, as syllabic and non-syllabic
                        vocalic allophones do not share a common representation.</p>
                    <p>The syllabification proper is carried out by the independent library
                        Silabeador, called by the transcriber. First, the programme looks for
                        non-transliterated Latin words and tries to transliterate them according to
                        the Spanish orthographic rules. Contrary to other foreign words, Latin words
                        are not phonologically adapted and tend to respect not only stress positions
                        contradicting Spanish rules but also the original syllabic division, which
                        may also differ from Spanish due to the disparate sets of diphthongs of both
                        languages. Then, the programme marks forced syllabic divisions where an
                        exception should occur according to an external file. This file consists of
                        two columns with <term>regular expression</term> substitutions; the first
                        field contains a matching pattern, and the second corresponds to its
                        substitution, including an underscore where a syllabic division must be
                        forced. These phonological exceptions include ubiquitous words whose
                        Castillian pronunciatiation differs from the orthographic hyphenation. To
                        name some extremely common in any kind of speech, this rule matches the
                        hiatuses of verbs in <emph>-iar</emph>, <emph>-uar</emph>, <emph>-uir</emph>
                        <ptr target="#quilis2019"/>, <emph>-eir</emph>, and <emph>-oir</emph>
                        <ptr target="#rios1999"/>, adjectives in -uoso <ptr target="#quilis2019"/>,
                        some particular nouns <ptr target="#navarrotomas1957"/>, and other words
                            <ptr target="#canelladamadsen1987"/>. Adjectives in <emph>-mente</emph>
                        are also exceptional since they carry secondary stress <ptr
                            target="#quilis2013"/>, which Spanish phonology otherwise lacks. They
                        are marked too in the morpheme, and the syllabification module receives the
                        lexeme alone; finally, both parts are rejoined after their separate
                        treatment.</p>
                    <p>There are ambiguous words, such as <emph xml:lang="es">juez</emph>, <emph
                            xml:lang="es">suave</emph> or <emph xml:lang="es">fiel</emph>
                        <ptr target="#dominguez2012"/>, in which the diphthong is often broken in
                        Spanish Golden Age verses. They might be typographically marked with a
                        diaeresis (<emph>ï</emph> or <emph>ü</emph>) by the editor of the source, in
                        which case they are parsed as usual, but this may not be the case.
                        Therefore, these ambiguous clusters are marked as a diaresis, although their
                        sinaeresis will be given priority later.</p>
                    <p>The resulting text is divided in its syllabic nuclei, arranging the
                        diphthongs except for those explicitly separated in the previous step.
                        Non-syllabic vowels – the non-nuclear sounds in a vocalic glide – are marked
                        as such by substituting them for the character representing the
                        corresponding allophone. The outcome is a list of syllabic nuclei and free
                        consonants. Finally, those free consonants are assigned to the proper
                        syllable on coda or onset according to Spanish phonological rules <ptr
                            target="#quilis2019"/>. The output is a list of phonological transcribed
                        syllables and the prosodic stress on the due ones.</p>

                            <code>VerseMetre</code> of libEscansión determines which words carry
                        metric stress. It takes a verse as an argument, cleans it, and divides its
                        words into syllables using the library Fonemas. It also uses Stanza <ptr
                            target="#qietal2020"/> to PoS-tag each word. After this, it decides
                        whether a particular word carries stress according to its PoS tag, but also
                        considering the relation to neighbouring words when forming a compound as it
                        may deprive from their prosodic stress to otherwise stressed words (e.g.
                            <emph xml:lang="es">Santo Tomás</emph> /san.to toˈmas/ but <emph
                            xml:lang="es">el santo padre</emph> /el ˈsan.to ˈpa.dɾe/ or <emph
                            xml:lang="es">cuarenta</emph> /kwaˈɾen.ta/ but <emph xml:lang="es"
                            >cuarenta y dos</emph> /kwa.ɾen.tai̯ˈdos/), in a similar fashion as it
                        occurs, for example, with English numerals.</p>
                    <p>PoS-tagging may produce consistent errors or not be detailed enough. It can
                        be bypassed in such situations by marking the words according to lists of
                        stressed or unstressed occurrences. Undetected errors, however, are still
                        possible. The greatest difficulty is detecting when an unstressed word
                        should not carry prosodic stress as it involves several open word classes,
                        whilst unstressed words belong to close ones. Therefore, a relatively high
                        proportion of wrongly tagged words has no impact on the outcome as long as
                        the tag represents an equivalent class in terms of stress.</p>

                <head>Syllabic adjustment</head>
                <p>The syllabic adjustment resorts to libEscansión class <code>VerseMetre</code>, a
                    child of <code>PlayLine</code>. This class takes a sorted list of possible
                    numbers of syllables apart from the verse as an argument. For a play, a
                    reasonable value for the list would be at least <code>[8, 11, 7, 6]</code> as
                    most verses are octosyllabic, but hendecasyllables or these mixed with
                    heptasyllables, hexasyllables for sung verses, and even more exotic combinations
                    may appear. On the other hand, regular sonnets would encounter no problem with a
                    list with one element <code>[11]</code>.</p>
                <p>The syllables are then parsed considering word boundaries by the private method
                        <code>__adjust_metre()</code>, which takes a list of words and a sorted list
                    of potential metres. Firstly, it tests whether the syllabic count plus the
                    rhyme-stress correction (in other words, adding a syllable if the rhyming word
                    is oxytonic or subtracting one if it is proparoxytonic) matches the first
                    element of the list, which would be a trivial solution. Otherwise, it tries to
                    adjust the metre.</p>
                <p>The function has subroutines to search for potential synaloephas, hiatuses, and
                    epentheses and apply them when necessary. If the verse length equals the number
                    of orthographic syllables minus the number of potential synaloephas, it applies
                    the synaloephas to the list of words. If this is not the case, it tries to do
                    the same, but removing potential epentheses this time. In the opposite
                    situation, if the orthographic syllables count is lower than the expected
                    number, the function tries to apply hiatuses in suitable positions.</p>
                <p>Finally, the function checks whether the corrected length matches the expected
                    one more time. If this is the case, it returns the list of words flattened to a
                    list of syllables. Otherwise, it calls itself recursively passing the list of
                    expected lengths after removing its first element. Consequently, in the next
                    recursion level, the method repeats the same process but regarding the second
                    element of the original list as the expected length.</p>
                <p>Syllabic splitting and joining are done with equivalent procedures. Placing
                    synaloephas and synaereses or hiatuses and diaereses follows the same steps.
                    First, a function locates all potential instances of the trope in question and
                    produces a list of potential positions. Second, another function assesses and
                    ranks those instances according to a system of preferences. Finally, another
                    function applies the figure according to each position's rank until it matches
                    the expected verse length. The three functions are invoked sequentially by a
                    recursive function. With the sorted list of potential adjustments, the function
                    applies the first one and invokes itself for the new list of words.</p>
                <p>Let us illustrate it with the synaloephas and synaereses as the process involves
                    additional steps. Finding potential syllabic mergers involves finding pairs of
                    vowels in syllabic boundaries, providing they are compatible according to the
                    perceptibility scale <ptr target="#navarrotomas1957"/>. That means finding those
                    combinations in which the perceptibility decreases in both directions of the
                    nucleus.</p>

                        target="#example2b">second</ref> transcriptions, as its long vocalic is
                    built around a nucleus <emph>a</emph> with higher perceptibility than the
                    non-syllabic semiconsonant at its side (in <ref target="#example2a">the
                        first</ref>) or semivowel (in <ref target="#example2b">the second
                    one</ref>). Conversely, <ref target="#example2c">the third</ref> and <ref
                        target="#example2d">fourth</ref> examples contradict the Spanish phonology,
                    as <emph>o</emph> is the vowel of highest perceptibility and, therefore, cannot
                    follow a less perceptible <emph>u</emph>. In the best case, three words can join
                    in a five-vowel synaloepha, such as <emph xml:lang="es">envidio a
                        Eustaquio</emph> (/j̯o̯ae̯u̯/).</p>

                <p>With the list of potential synaloephas, each element is evaluated and given
                    points according to the prosodic circumstances colluding <ptr
                        target="#canelladamadsen1987"/> and their relative position according to the
                    perceptibility scale and the Spanish preference for crescent diphthongs <ptr
                        target="#alarcos1964"/>. Potential synaloephas between hemistichs have a
                    penalisation – exceptional cases such as the conjunctions <emph xml:lang="es"
                        >y</emph> need to be addressed individually. Additionally, a correction to
                    potentially aspirated <emph>h</emph> is added. The latter responds to the poets'
                    custom of making it aspirated (/h/) when in need of breaking a synaloepha,
                    despite having become mute in the regular speech a long time ago and being kept
                    in the orthography on pure etymological grounds <ptr target="#lapesa2008"/>.
                    Once the inter-word boundaries are parsed, the same is done with the in-word
                    syllables, not without adding an offset to prioritise synaloephas over
                    synaereses. The list of positions is sorted according to their scores.</p>
                <p>Finally, another function rearranges the list of syllables by joining words where
                    required. This step involves not only moving phonemes and joining syllables but
                    also marking non-syllabic vowels as such in the newly created clusters.</p>
                <p>Diaereses are solved in a similar fashion. Firstly, the programme composes a list
                    of potential divisions. Then, it assigns priorities and applies them recursively
                    until meeting the expected count, or it tries with the next length value of the
                    list if no suitable arrangement can be found.</p>

                <head>Mixed verse scansion</head>
                <p>Using a sorted list of expected verse lengths confers great flexibility to
                    libEscansión. For example, our approach to parsing plays consists of creating an
                    instance of <code>VerseMetre</code>, providing an initial list with typical
                    lengths such as <code>[8, 11, 7, 6, 5, 4]</code>. The verses usually are
                    octosyllabic, so we put <code>8</code> in the first position. However, if a
                    hendecasyllabic appears, the new instance of <code>VerseMetre</code> for the
                    next verse will be given a list with <code>11</code> on top. We also know that
                    poetic forms composed of hendecasyllabic and heptasyllabic verses are common.
                    Therefore, we relegate <code>8</code> to the third position. Furthermore, as we
                    work with parsed plays, we can use additional data to infer the length. For
                    example, if the speaker is a musician or plainly <code>MUSIC</code>, it would
                    probably be a popular form in hexasyllabic verses rather than a more
                    prescriptive one; thus, we can parse that particular verse directly with
                        <code>6</code> on top.</p>
                <p>For example, the first <term xml:lang="es">estrambote</term> verse of Quevedo’s
                    ‘Pintando la vida de un señor mal ocupado’ has seven syllables instead of eleven
                        (<emph>Ca.ba.lle.ros chan.flo.nes</emph>). We pass <code>[11, 7, 8,
                        6]</code> to the disambiguation module when analysing sonnets. After
                    confirming that there are no possible divisions to obtain eleven syllables, the
                    module calls itself removing the first element of the list of lengths and
                    passing <code>[7, 8, 6]</code> to the next recursion level. As <code>7</code> is
                    indeed possible, it returns this resolution.</p>
                <p>In addition to attributes for syllables and rhythm, the class
                        <code>VerseMetre</code> provides others for full and partial rhymes,
                    syllabic nuclei, and ambiguity. The last one takes an integer value and can be
                    used for a second pass to improve mixed-verse results.</p>

                            >trans-at-lán-ti-co</emph>), the syllabification module achieves 99.92%

                        <emph>a-mam-baien-se</emph> instead of <emph>a-mam-ba-ien-se</emph>. All in

                        37 differences are wrongly syllabified in the corpus, 41 have alternative
                        yet acceptable differing syllabifications, and our programme wrongly

                        improvement over previous scansion engines (<ref target="#table02">Table
                            3</ref>). The American syllabification renders slightly worse results,
                        with 96.51%. However, as noted above, this corpus considers interjections
                        such as <emph xml:lang="es">oh</emph> and <emph xml:lang="es">ay</emph> as
                        unstressed, whilst our library does not. This behaviour can be reproduced
                        with an ad hoc three-line hack in the code, in which case the accuracy would
                        reach 98.65% for the standard setting and 98.15% for the American
                        syllabification. We have considered inconsistencies in the corpus notation
                        for the test as some proparoxytonic verses of the corpus are marked by
                        omitting one of the last two unstressed syllables.</p>

                    <p>Apart from the disagreements due to interjections, there are 19 disparate
                        verses left for other reasons and another with disagreements beyond the
                        interjections (<ref target="#table04">Table 4, row 18</ref>). There are ten
                        disagreements due to spelling deviations (rows 1–5) and annotator mistakes
                        (rows 6–12). In the first case, the manual annotation reflects the
                        pronunciation despite the lack of accents, such as in words like <emph
                            xml:lang="es">Príamo</emph> and the more subtle diacritics of <emph
                            xml:lang="es">aún</emph> and <emph>dó</emph>. Consequently, humans have
                        an advantage over machines as the former can recognise the proper
                        pronunciation despite the spelling. The second case ranges from non-marked
                        stresses in content words, disregarding the primary stress of an adverb in
                            <emph>-mente</emph> or an adjective, or the opposite, stressing an
                        unstressed syllable like in an honorary title preceding a noun or the
                        locution <emph xml:lang="es">ya que</emph>.</p>

                    <p>Two disagreements (rows 18–19) deserve a special mention. The first is due to
                        a PoS-tagging mistake, as <emph xml:lang="es">para</emph> has been tagged as
                        a preposition due to the lack of a vocative comma, which illustrates what we
                        said above. Even though other potential errors of a similar kind have been
                        intercepted, ambiguities resembling row 18 cannot be bypassed since the
                        PoS-tagger has operated as expected, and it is unviable to predict any
                        potential typo or edition mistake. The second mistake (row 19 )is rather
                        interesting. The syllabificator breaks the diphthong, but
                            <code>VerseMetre</code> after pondering all the options and joins the
                        vowels again as it prioritises placing the caesura between words when
                        keeping editorial diareses is not explictly forced.</p>

                <p>libEscansión was intended to be an internal part of a more complex mechanism. As
                    the aim was to parse hundreds of thousands of verses from various sources
                    automatically <ptr target="#sanzlazaro2023c"/>, the verse was the last step
                    after digging into œuvre, play, and act. Therefore, it was conceived as a Python
                    library to be called by the programmes in charge of working at a higher
                        level<ptr target="#sanzlazaro2023a"/>. Nonetheless, it can be used as a
                    standalone tool even if lacking knowledge of Python or programming, as long as a
                    Python 3.9 or later distribution is installed on the computer. It has been
                    released under the Free Software GNU LGPL licence, making it available for
                    embedding in other software without requiring an equivalent licence as long as
                    the library's code remains unmodified; otherwise, Free Software licencing would
                    be required.</p>
                <p>As libEscansión relies on several libraries, these must also be installed (see
                        <ref target="#code01">Listing 1</ref>).</p>

                <p>To deploy libEscansión, the library must first be imported into the Python
                    environment. Then, an instance of the class VerseMetre can be created, passing
                    the verse to scan as a parameter. For convenience, the class VerseMetre can be
                    imported independently. The resulting object possesses a number of attributes to
                    represent verse features. Even though IPA notation has been preserved to a great
                    extent – and thus, Unicode support is required for optimal visualisation – the
                    main concern was automating tasks. To simplify text processing, stressed
                    syllables have upper-case letters as their nuclear vowel instead of the IPA
                    stress symbol. A typical workflow is represented in the <ref target="#figure02"

                    in such pieces. The aforementioned manually annotated corpus of sonnets was the
                    only one providing inter-annotator agreement, but it fulfilled the project's
                    purposes. That means that no tests have been carried out with other types of
                    verse, such as Alexandrines, regardless of their popularity and usage prior to
                    and after the period, and further tests are required to measure LibEscansion's
                    accuracy beyond the Spanish Golden Age theatre versifying customs.</p>
                <p>Furthermore, the tool was implemented as a means to build a data frame rather
                    than a standalone tool. Therefore, speed has not been considered, and the
                    processing time reflects it. Even though the hardware substantially differs from
                    that used by Marco et al. <ptr target="#marcoetal2021"/> to carry out their
                    tests, the processing time is still two orders of magnitude higher than the
                    fastest method's score.</p>
                <p>A weak spot is a dependency on a reliable PoS-tagger to mark prosodic stresses,
                    which, in turn, depends on a language model. Consequently, erroneous tags have
                    to be intercepted to bypass the PoS-tagging. This is not always possible, as
                    some errors are unpredictable, and creating an exception for others would
                    provoke side effects.</p>

                <head>Conclusions and further work</head>
                <p>We have presented a new library for analysing Spanish verses that surpasses other
                    automatic scansion tools for Spanish fixed-metre verses. The contribution of
                    this work is twofold, as it involves different linguistic choices and a novel
                    approach to ambiguity resolution. On the one hand, we have opted for Castilian
                    syllabification rather than the more diphthong-prone American (and
                    orthographical) variety. According to the results, this may be a sensible choice
                    as the former outperforms the latter under identical conditions. On the other
                    hand, we have presented a perceptibility-based recursive prioritisation system,
                    which, combined with the Peninsular syllabification, raises the score of
                    libEscansión well above its peers.</p>
                <p>Additionally, working with Unicode-based phonological transcriptions removes
                    layers of abstraction and the necessity of mapping correspondences to go back
                    and forth from written to spoken text. This dramatically simplifies the handling
                    of vocalic clusters since it explicitly discriminates between syllabic and
                    non-syllabic vowels.</p>
                <p>The high degree of modularisation of the tools, with separate libraries for
                    syllabification, phonological transcription and scansion, extends the range of
                    uses beyond metrical analysis, as the lower layers can be used independently for
                    different purposes. Syllabification and phonological transcription undoubtedly
                    have uses beyond the narrow spectrum of historical theatre, in fields such as
                    linguistics and language teaching.</p>
                <p>With regard to poetry, which is the main focus of this work, there are many
                    examples of the library being used in a real-life scenario. It has been
                    developed primarily to provide a corpus for remote reading analyses, taking into
                    account metric features. The corpus annotated with a previous version of
                    libEscansión is available under a Creative Commons BY licence as an SQL database
                        <ptr target="#krollsanz2024"/>, which is also hosted online and available
                    for external queries through a graphical interface. <ptr target="#sound2022"
                    />.</p>
                <p>There is plenty of room for further improvement. However, comprehensive testing
                    requires manually annotated corpora. Hopefully, in the near future, manually
                    annotated corpora of polymetric pieces and other poetic forms besides the sonnet
                    used here will be prepared. This would allow for further testing, which would
                    undoubtedly reveal shortcomings and help improve libEscansión. </p>
                <p>Although libEscansión was conceived as an auxiliary tool, it has transcended its
                    original purpose. However, its interface limits it to a specialised niche with
                    some technical knowledge. A graphical interface could help a broad public to
                    access the capabilities of LibEscansión without coding. As for users familiar
                    with programming, thanks to the Free Software licence, libEscansión can be
                    integrated into new developments – including third-party frontends – and its
                    code can be adapted for new purposes.</p>
