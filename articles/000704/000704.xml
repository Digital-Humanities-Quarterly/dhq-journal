            <head>Why we need new theoretical and methodological perspectives on categories in the
               digital humanities – a <q>rolling editorial</q></head>
            <p>In the realm of digital humanities, computational social sciences and related fields,
               categories are omnipresent. Not only do we use them to systematize our objects of
               interest, such as texts or aesthetic artifacts, and organize their representations in
               databases and repositories. Categories also play an important role in text analysis,
               especially when extracting or annotating parts of texts in a structured manner.</p>
            <p>Categories serve as powerful tools for both purposes. They allow, for example, the
               linguistic labeling of objects or elements and their subsequent grouping according to
               selected relevant features. In this context, categories seem suited to integrate two
               important complementary tasks: if they are based on adequate parameters, they can
               further a sensible <emph>reduction of complexity</emph>, thereby facilitating the
               analysis of and communication about complex textual artifacts and data sets. At the
               same time, categories offer the possibility of a <emph>detailed description</emph>
               through the creation of subcategories. When categories are organized in systems such
               as ontologies or taxonomies, they can additionally provide information about the
               relationship between relevant phenomena. Moreover, since creating categories usually
               requires defining terms explicitly, categories greatly facilitate the scholarly
               exchange of information on subjects in the humanities, cultural studies, or social
               sciences – among other things, through enhancing  understanding and comparability of
               claims and hypotheses.</p>
            <p>The prevalence of categories in the digital humanities can be attributed, in part, to
               the influence of standards from the formal sciences in this field. In contrast to
               this, developing and using categories is rather the exception than a rule when we
               look at most traditional humanities disciplines, where it is limited to certain
               sub-disciplines. This, together with the omnipresence of categories and at the same
               time little systematic reflection in the digital humanities, raises a number of
               questions: Which categories or which types of category systems are appropriate for
               objects in the humanities? What determines the validity and fruitfulness of
               categories in this field? How can we develop and revise category systems using
               existing or new procedures?  And how can we employ categories to address complex, and
               often hermeneutical, questions that are central to most humanities disciplines?</p>
            <p>Answering these questions requires considering multiple perspectives, not only from
               different humanities disciplines and social sciences, but also from information
               science and technology. Taking this as impetus, we have organized two
               interdisciplinary workshops on the topic of categories in the digital
                  humanities.<note> Both workshops were associated with the project forTEXT;
                  workshop reports can be accessed via the project website: <ref
                     target="https://fortext.net/news/2020/workshop-report-non-hierarchical-concept-ontologies-and-markup-schemas"
                     >https://fortext.net/news/2020/workshop-report-non-hierarchical-concept-ontologies-and-markup-schemas</ref>
                  and <ref
                     target="https://fortext.net/news/2021/workshop-report-development-and-application-of-category-systems-for-text-research"
                     >https://fortext.net/news/2021/workshop-report-development-and-application-of-category-systems-for-text-research</ref>.</note>
               The first workshop focused on theoretical and formalistic aspects, exploring
               non-hierarchical concept ontologies and markup schemas. The second workshop
               emphasized methodological and application-oriented aspects, specifically the
               development and application of category systems for text research. Drawing from the
               inspiring ideas and projects presented and discussed there, we  decided to collect
               the ideas in a special issue. With an open call for papers, we therefore invited the
               workshop contributors as well as other interested researchers to contribute to this
               issue.</p>
            <p>One focus of this issue lies on the work on and with categories for text annotation
               and analysis. A second focus is on systems and methods for the organization and
               classification of texts in the context of databases – as well as the interplay
               between these two areas where category systems play a crucial role. We requested that
               the contributions be based on concrete studies in the field of the digital humanities
               or related fields, or provide an information science perspective that has been, or
               can be, adapted in the digital humanities.</p>
            <p>The contributions that were selected for this issue cover a wide range of work on and
               with categories. They delve not only the development and application of category
               systems themselves and the disciplines that inform and require them but also the
               various conceptual and pragmatic problems encountered during these processes.</p>
            <p>This special issue will be published as a rolling issue, with the first bundle of
               articles in July 2023. Leveraging the advantages of the digital format, subsequent
               bundles of articles will be published gradually, accompanied by a cumulative
               expansion of this editorial – a rolling  editorial, so to speak.</p>

               and Eveline Wandl-Vogt presents the design of a taxonomy of sources of uncertainty in
               digital humanities datasets with an interdisciplinary and international group. A
               special focus in this contribution lies on the process of finding a common ground
               between different communities of practice.</p>
            <p>With their article <title rend="quotes">Visualization of Categorization: How to See
                  the Wood and the Trees</title>, Ophir Münz-Manor and Itay Marienberg Milikowsky
               contribute a paper that discusses how figurative language has been annotated in a
               corpus of Late Antiquity Hebrew Liturgical Poetry – first on paper and then with the
               annotation and analysis software CATMA – and which new kinds of innsight this
               transition from analog to digital was able to show. The contribution also introduces
               a way to visualize the annotations in a way that supports category-based hermeneutic
               speculation about the analyzed texts and phenomena with the visualization tool
               Vis-À-Vis.</p>
            <p>Marlene Ernst, Sebastian Gassner, Markus Gerstmeier and Malte Rehbein contribute an

               This paper presents three different approaches to categorizing semi-structured
               information concerning legal history. It discusses the development of a
               categorisation system for the analysis of approximately 10,000 inventory entries for
               legal cases from the Special Court Munich (1933–1945).</p>
