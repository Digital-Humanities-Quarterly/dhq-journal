                     of digital humanities projects. In both cases a combination of outside events or project
                     decisions negatively impacted the project. This was discussed as part of a symposium
                     for the Endings Principles for Digital Longevity and reflects on whether following
                     these principles would have benefited these projects. Overall, the case is made that

                     research projects.

                     						The <cite class="title italic">CURSUS</cite> project (2000-2003) and the <cite class="title italic">William Godwin’s Diary</cite> project (2007-2010), as
                     						case studies in which outside events or decisions made negatively
                     						impacted the project.<a class="noteRef" href="#d3e206">[1]</a> The <cite class="title italic">CURSUS</cite> project
                     						is a collection of XML editions of medieval liturgical texts, and The
                     						William Godwin’s Diary project makes available 32 volumes of Godwin’s
                     						diaries covering 1788 to 1836. Although both websites are still
                     						available, they have had difficult histories and both should be
                     						considered at risk of disappearing from the web at any moment. The <cite class="title italic">CURSUS</cite> project faced challenges partly because
                     						the principal investigator passed away. The <cite class="title italic">William
                        							Godwin’s Diary</cite> project suffered because the people
                     						maintaining the project were not given the resources to do so, and
                     						because all stakeholders left the institution. As the main technical
                     						developer for both of these projects, I have direct insight into the
                     						technical background and general lessons learned, which are useful to
                     						examine as case studies for each project before contrasting them with
                     						the <cite class="title italic">Endings Principles for Digital Longevity
                        							([<a class="ref" href="#endings2021">Endings 2021</a>]; hereafter “Endings Principles”)</cite>. Although
                     						pre-dating these <cite class="title italic">Principles</cite>, they are the most
                     						appropriate for comparison as both of these projects are TEI-based
                     						editions and relate directly to the issues the <cite class="title italic">Principles</cite> tackle. It is easy, of course, to criticize the
                     						technical decisions of a project decades afterwards; seeing in
                     						hindsight how the digital landscape has evolved in the meantime gives
                     						us an immediate sense that we would certainly have done things
                     						differently and definitely have made different choices. In these
                     						cases, since I was the developer and technical consultant on these
                     						projects, I do not need to guess. While I would like to think I would
                     						make better decisions now, I know that I would not unless I were
                     						time-traveling back with my current knowledge and experience. These
                     						two projects are useful proxies for examining many issues of the
                     						longevity of our research outputs. </div>

                  <div class="ptext" id="p2">Part of the overall argument I am making through these case studies is
                     						that we should always plan for events that affect the sustainability
                     						of digital research projects. Some of these events are obviously
                     						unpredictable, while others are of our own making. While we pay lip
                     						service to doing so in funding applications, once a project is under
                     						way, unexpected challenges present themselves and our solutions to
                     						them should adhere to an underlying set of principles. We need to plan
                     						for failure, plan for the project being cut short, plan for staff
                     						disappearing, and plan for all kinds of threats to the project by
                     						adopting and following principles such as those recommended by the

                     						associate. This project was the brainchild of Professor David Chadd of
                     						the School of Music at University of East Anglia (UEA) and sought to
                     						produce editions of medieval Benedictine Latin liturgical texts
                     						online, and experimentally to explore the use of XML publication for
                     						such materials. The main purpose was to enable investigation of the
                     						order of antiphons, responds, and prayers in these liturgical
                     						manuscripts. The project proposed that this order of service in many
                     						ways gives a fingerprint of the liturgy in different places in
                     						England. As such, we edited these liturgical items with the utmost
                     						care, but for other aspects such as the biblical readings transcribed
                     						only the first few and last few words, since the point of the project
                     						was not to spend time making a critical edition of the Latin Vulgate
                     						Bible. </div>

                  <div class="ptext" id="p4">In the end, the project produced editions of twelve main texts and a
                     						number of ancillary works. These included an XML conversion of the
                     						Latin Vulgate Bible, derived lists of individual incipits, and a
                     						repository of liturgical items (antiphons, responds, and prayers)
                     						based on the <cite class="title italic">Corpus Aniphonalium Officii</cite> (CAO).
                     						The approach the project used was not merely to edit a liturgical item
                     						in its context in the edition of a particular manuscript, but also to
                     						create a textual-critical apparatus in a repository with all the other
                     						textual variants from CAO and any other manuscripts edited by the
                     						project. In this way each liturgical item in the edition of a
                     						manuscript, instead of existing in the source file for that manuscript
                     						edition, is in reality a pointer to a specific antiphon, respond, or
                     						prayer in the project’s CAO repository file. Pointers are not a
                     						URI-based system in TEI P4, so extraction involves looking up the
                     						correct reading for that manuscript to display and importing it to
                     						this point through an XSLT stylesheet. This makes for a dense CAO
                     						repository file but for very light editions where most of the file is
                     						filled with pointers. </div>

                        							non-TEI P4 elements (such as “Day,” “service,” and “incipit”).
                        							What starts to become evident through these examples, at least to
                        							those familiar with TEI P4 markup, is that this project took full
                        							advantage of a TEI DTD-based feature allowing the creation of
                        							custom DTD entities for repeated formulaic text, punctuation, and
                        							markup that are very common in the highly repetitive liturgical
                        							documents. This means that the encoders did not need to include
                        							repetitive portions of markup, and merely used a smaller “entity”
                        							to stand in for that markup. Even in the context shown through
                        							the markup in Figure 2, the use of the entity “<span class="monospace">&amp;AE;</span>” at the
                        							beginning of the “<span class="monospace">&lt;antiphon&gt;</span>” element demonstrates this
                        							exploitation of a technical method of providing formulaic text
                        							and markup. The cursus.ent file listing the project’s DTD

                        							example, we never considered the so-called “Bus Factor” – the

                        							the relative simplicity of the site that has enabled its
                        							preservation. Just as a physical object in good condition might

                        							enabled it to survive relatively well despite being subject to
                        							benign digital neglect. More active interventions and
                        							conservation might have resulted in the use of more advanced

                     						and other people and extracting datasets of information from the
                     						diaries. To do this, I trained a team consisting of the PI (Professor
                     						Mark Philp), a postdoctoral research associate (Dr David
                     						O’Shaughnessy), and two DPhil students (Kathryn Barush and James
                     						Grande) in a project-specific TEI P5 customisation that was very
                     						reduced and used renamed elements to make encoding these entries
                     							easier.<a class="noteRef" href="#d3e713">[19]</a> The XML they were hand-encoding in successive passes consisted
                     						of fewer than 20 separate elements in total but was automatically
                     						expanded to full TEI on the website each evening. So while the project
                     						might encode using a non-TEI <span class="monospace">&lt;dMeal&gt;</span> (diary meal) element, the
                     						renamed element was converted to a pure TEI <span class="monospace">&lt;seg type=”dMeal”&gt;</span>
                     						element in the production XML [<a class="ref" href="#cummings2008">Cumming 2008</a>]. Similarly, the project
                     						workflow meant checking work into an institutional subversion version
                     						control system; unlike the <cite class="title italic">CURSUS</cite> project the
                     						real risk of data loss, while never zero, was minimal. The overall
                     						training took just over a day, but the project benefited by having me
                     						as their on-call technical support when they needed it. </div>

                        							was not the easy interface, but the fact that we provided a link

                        							postdoctoral research associate moved on to another university,

                        							this meant a fairly large (for the time) VM. The availability of

                        							for the Bodleian’s purchase of the rest of these (and other)
                        							materials of the Abinger Collection was that as part of the
                        							purchase agreement the library had promised that web hosting for
                        							this project, like the imaging, would be provided pro bono. At
                        							the beginning I brought together representatives of the project
                        							with those from Bodleian Digital Library Systems and Services,
                        							who agreed to provide a suitable VM inside the Bodleian
                        							Libraries’ infrastructure. When it came to it, however, since I
                        							was the sole technical developer on the website and happened to
                        							work for the Oxford University Computing Services (OUCS), the
                        							Bodleian decided that I should just set up a VM in Computing
                        							Services, and that they would transfer it over to their
                        							infrastructure at the end of the project. At the conclusion of
                        							the project, the Bodleian then made the argument that the OUCS VM
                        							was working well, and so even though it had a Bodleian URL there
                        							was no pressing reason to move the underlying VM to their
                        							infrastructure. It was only several years later, when the
                        							Computing Services (by then IT Services) and Bodleian Library
                        							were both having major upgrades to their VM infrastructure, that
                        							I finally convinced them that the VM should be moved under the
                        							Bodleian Library’s care. The operating system itself was updated
                        							to the latest long-term support version, but as I had only
                        							limited time to donate to the project, the version of eXist-db
                        							(now quite ancient) was not upgraded and just copied across. Even
                        							so, the VM remains one of those VMs on an older infrastructure on
                        							the outskirts of the purview of Bodleian’s overworked
                        							infrastructure team.<a class="noteRef" href="#d3e945">[26]</a> As it is, the website occasionally needs a
                        							restart;when the VM is rebooted, the website does not
                        							automatically start, and occasionally a small partition fills up
                        							with log files.<a class="noteRef" href="#d3e947">[27]</a> Both of these are problems that would
                        							have been addressable while I had access to the server, but in an
                        							immediately post-project setting, it never seemed important
                        							enough to ensure such access. While I would restart the website
                        							maybe once or twice a year while working there, since I left the
                        							University of Oxford in 2017 I have no local access to the server
                        							and, as there is no one connected to the original project left at
                        							the institution, this falls to the busy infrastructure team of
                        							the Bodleian Library. This need to care for legacy websites and
                        							their compounding maintenance burden will only become more
                        							pressing as we continue to produce digital projects that are

                        							section, for not providing a VM at the beginning of the project
                        							as they had promised to do. And while they should have done so

                        							for their point of view. Before the start of the project, the
                        							upper levels of the library administration committed them to
                        							providing support from system administrators but without
                        							providing any extra resources to the staff to enable this
                        							additional work. The necessary imaging of materials was provided,
                        							pro bono, and they promised to host the website but, when the
                        							development of the website had finished, this was understandably
                        							not a priority task for them. If I had been working directly for
                        							the Department of Politics and International Relations (where the
                        							project originated) and had not had sophisticated local IT
                        							resources at the time, then there would have been no question
                        							that the Bodleian would have provided the necessary
                        							infrastructure — the project would have been impossible without
                        							it. However, I happened to work for the Oxford University
                        							Computing Services, and so I had easy access to VMs and it seemed
                        							natural to them that I should provide these at no extra cost or
                        							immediate effort from them. This kind of approach is dangerous,
                        							and projects should be sure to get formal agreements of in-kind

                     						extol the standards used and the long-term preservation benefits
                     						resulting from the way their data and websites will be constructed.
                     						But as with the agreements for in-kind support or partnerships with
                     						external partners, projects should also plan their afterlife with more
                     						than just funding bid fictions. However good a digital research
                     						project’s sustainability plan is, it is still very rare for the
                     						lifespan of most digital projects to outlast their creators for very
                     						long. Just as humans should not leave it up to the grief-ridden
                     						survivors to guess at what should be done with their effects after
                     						they pass away, neither should digital humanities research projects
                     						leave it to librarians or technical teams to decide what should be
                     						done with their outputs. Instead, we should all be clear in advance
                     						what the plan is for the eventual sunsetting of projects, having
                     						already archived our well-documented data long in advance, and not
                     						rely on the best efforts of those left to interpret what should be
                     						done with them. Some websites will be rejuvenated and preserved as the
                     						front-facing access to their data is seen as too important (or costly)
                     						to merely archive, while others will become nothing more than a ZIP
                     						archive downloaded by those who really want to explore the data. But
                     						we should plan for failure, and we should plan for the project being
                     						cut short for any reason with no notice. To do this we should be
                     						making the data we produce as transportable and transparent as
                     						possible. We should simultaneously recognise that all aspects of an
                     						archival research project’s website may be important, not only the
                     						underlying data but the choices made in presenting it. Some may be
                     						inconsequential, as with both of these two websites, but we should be
                     						mindful that this interface through which the data is presented also
                     						forms a part of the editorial argument and needs to be preserved if
                     						possible. Limiting oneself to minimal technologies may facilitate
