        <p>The concept of literary genre is a highly complex one: not only are different genres
          frequently defined on several, but not necessarily the same levels of description, but

          further complicate the matter. This contribution focuses on thematic aspects of genre with

        <head>Introduction</head>
        <p> The concept of literary genre is considered highly complex for several reasons. First,
          genres can be defined and described on a number of levels of description, such as plot,
          theme, personnel, structure, and style (for an introduction, see <ptr
            target="#schoech2017"/>), with style in turn concerning a range of aspects, such as
          spelling, lexicon, morphology, semantics, and syntax as well as rhythm, imagery, or
          complexity (for an overview, see <ptr target="#herrmann2015"/>). Second, related genres
          are frequently defined on several different levels, such as length, form or theme: for
          example, subgenres of narrative prose fiction include the short story, the epistolary
          novel, and the libertine novel, creating overlap if not contradictions. Finally,
          consideration of genres as cognitive, social, and of course scholarly constructs with a
          rich history further complicate the matter, raising the question of what part formal
          features, on the one hand, and tradition and construction, on the other, play in the
          perception of literary genres (see <ptr target="#hempfer1973"/>, <ptr
            target="#schaeffer1989"/>). </p>
        <p> The wider context of this contribution is the early career research group on <ref
            target="http://cligs.hypotheses.org">Computational Literary Genre Stylistics
            (CLiGS)</ref>. There, we consider it of interest to analyze genres (and especially
          subgenres of drama and the novel) on a wide range of levels of description, stylistic as
          well as structural and thematic, and ranging from the use of function words all the way to
          plot structures. A particular focus lies on the question of how these various levels
          correlate and interact, and how they evolve over time in a given generic subsystem. The
          present contribution is one brick in that building, laying the focus on thematic aspects
          of genre and using Topic Modeling. This technique has proven to be useful to discover
          thematic patterns and trends in large collections of texts. Here it is applied, as has
          rarely been done so far, to collections of dramatic texts.<note>
            <ptr target="#schmidt2014"/> has used Topic Modeling for the analysis of screenplays of
            TV shows, which may be considered a genre related to the more traditional dramatic texts
            considered here. </note>
        </p>
        <p> In this contribution, Topic Modeling is used to analyze a collection (further described
          below) of French Drama of the Classical Age and the Enlightenment. This is a
          well-researched domain in French literary studies (for an account of the genre's formal
          poetics, see, for example, <ptr target="#scherer2001"/>, and for a thorough overview, <ptr
            target="#mazouer2010"/>). The general aim of this contribution is to assess whether
          Topic Modeling can be a useful, quantitative complement to established, qualitative
          methods of analysis of French dramatic texts from this period. More specifically, the
          contribution would like to discover: (1) what kinds of semantic types of topics appear in
          this collection, knowing that Topic Modeling applied to fictional texts usually yields
          less abstract topics than when applied to non-fictional texts; (2) whether different
          dramatic subgenres have distinctive dominant topics, and if yes, whether those topics are
          expected or surprising, specific or vague, and abstract or concrete; (3) whether dramatic
          subgenres have distinctive plot-related topic patterns, and if yes, whether these patterns
          are dependent on subgenre or not; (4) and finally, to what extent clustering and
          classification methods based on topic scores produce results which agree with conventional
          genre distinctions. </p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <head>Hypotheses</head>
        <p>Based on what we know about the history of French drama on the one hand, and the basic
          principles of Topic Modeling on the other hand, we can formulate a number of hypotheses or
          questions concerning the relations between topics and dramatic genres and subgenres.</p>
        <p>First of all, dramatic subgenres such as comedy or tragedy being in part defined on the
          basis of their themes, and Topic Modeling bringing to the fore the hidden thematic
          structure of text collections, it can be expected that Topic Modeling applied to a
          collection of dramatic texts from a small range of different subgenres (comedies,
          tragedies and tragicomedies, in the present case) should bring out relatively strong
          genre-related topic patterns in the data.</p>
        <p>More specifically, and because there is only a small number of subgenres in the
          collection, there should be a relatively large proportion of topics which are clearly
          distinctive of one of the subgenres involved. It will be interesting to note which of the
          topics will be most distinctive of comedies and tragedies: for instance, will they be
          clearly thematic topics, or will the semantic commonalities of topic words be of some
          other type? Will they be topics which we would expect to be characteristic of tragedies
          and comedies written in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries (such as royalty vs.
          bourgoisie, honor vs. love, etc.), or will they be unexpected? It will also be of interest
          to investigate the topic-wise position of tragicomedy, which may either turn out to mix
          topics of both comedy and tragedy in a specific manner, or may also contain distinctive
          topics of its own.</p>
        <p>Another aspect of the relations between topic and genre concerns plot. We know that on a
          very fundamental level, comedies and tragedies from the period studied here are
          distinguished by their typical plot patterns: tragedies tend to have a final act in which
          a lot of the protagonists are defeated or die, with conflictual power-relations and
          violent crime dominating. Comedies tend to have a final act leading up to one or several
          marriages, that is with a triumph of socially-accepted love relationships and happiness.
          If, as can be expected, there are topics related to such themes or motives, we should see
          a pattern across textual progression showing an increased importance of such topics
          towards the end of tragedies and comedies, respectively.</p>
        <p> Finally, it is possible to invert the perspective from <foreign xml:lang="la">a
            priori</foreign> categories and their distinctive characteristics to a data-driven,
          entirely unsupervised grouping of texts into (potentially genre-related) clusters. If
          topics turn out to be strongly distinctive of genre, then it can also be expected that
          clustering based on scores of topic proportions per play should result in groupings
          strongly related to genre. However, it remains to be seen whether such groupings confirm
          traditional genre-related divisions or diverge from them, and how they compare to
          groupings based not on topic scores, but directly on word frequencies. </p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <head>Data</head>
        <p> The data used in this study comes from the <title rend="italic">Théâtre
            classique</title> collection maintained by Paul Fièvre (<ptr target="#fievre2007"/>). At
          the time of writing, this continually-growing, freely available collection of French
          dramatic texts contained 890 plays published between 1610 and 1810, thus covering the
          Classical Age and the Enlightenment. The majority of the texts are based on early editions
          made available as digital facsimiles by the French national library (BnF, Bibliothèque
          nationale de France). The quality of the transcriptions is relatively good without always
          reaching the consistent quality expected of more formally edited scholarly editions. In
          addition, the plays contain detailed structural markup applied in accordance with the
            <title rend="italic">Guidelines</title> of the Text Encoding Initiative (TEI P4; for a
          general introduction, see <ptr target="#burnard2014"/>). For example, the plays' structure
          with respect to act and scene divisions as well as speeches, speaker names, stage
          directions and many other phenomena are all carefully encoded. In addition, detailed
          metadata has been added to the texts relating, for instance, to their historical genre
          label (e.g. <foreign xml:lang="fr">comédie héroique</foreign>, <foreign xml:lang="fr"
            >tragédie</foreign>, or <foreign xml:lang="fr">opéra-ballet</foreign>) as well as the
          type of thematic and regional inspiration (e.g. French history, Roman mythology, or
          Spanish mores). A large part of this information can fruitfully be used when applying
          Topic Modeling to this text collection. </p>
        <p> The collection of plays used for the research presented here is a subset of the <title
            rend="italic">Théâtre classique</title> collection, defined by the following criteria:
          Only plays from the period between 1630 and 1789 were included, because the collection
          contains only a comparatively small number of plays for the decades before and after these
          dates. Plays have only been included if they have between three and five acts, effectively
          excluding a certain number of one-act plays, in order for the plays to have a similar
          length and a comparable plot structure. Finally, all the plays included belong to one of
          the following subgenres: comedy, tragedy or tragicomedy. For most of the other relevant
          genres, only a relatively small number of examples is available. These criteria resulted
          in a collection of 391 plays (150 comedies, 189 tragedies, and 52 tragicomedies in verse
          or in prose), corresponding to approximately 5.6 million word tokens or 31 MB of plain
          text. For the purposes of this study, the plays have been split into smaller segments,
          resulting in 5840 documents used for Topic Modeling (see details below).<note>The metadata
            table used can be found in the annex to this paper.</note>
        </p>
        <figure xml:id="figure01">
          <head>Distribution of plays in the collection used, by decades.</head>
          <graphic url="resources/images/figure01.jpg"/>
        </figure>
        <p> The plays' distribution over the time period covered by this study is shown in <ref
            target="#figure01">Figure 1</ref>. As can be seen, the coverage is not entirely
          balanced, with more plays from the seventeenth than from the eighteenth century, but there
          is a minimum number of 10 plays per decade. This collection corresponds neither to a
          random nor to a representative and/or balanced sample of all dramatic works produced
          during the period in question, which are more varied in length and more diverse in genre,
          and whose total number can only be estimated. To put the size of the present collection in
          perspective, one may consider the registry of known plays from the period 1620 to 1720
          maintained by the <title rend="italic">Théâtre classique</title> project, which currently
          lists 1914 plays for a 100-year period. </p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <head>Method</head>
        <p>In the following, two aspects of the method used here are described. First, a brief
          explanation of Topic Modeling will introduce readers unfamiliar with the procedure to some
          of its most basic assumptions. However, Topic Modeling itself is just one step in a larger
          workflow involving both preprocessing and post-processing. Therefore, the more general
          processing workflow is also briefly described, with a focus on some of the decisions that
          need to be made with respect to several parameters used in the procedure. Also, a strategy
          for setting the parameters given a specific research goal is presented.</p>
        <div>
          <head>Topic Modeling</head>
          <p> Topic Modeling is an unsupervised method used to discover latent semantic structure in
            large collections of texts (for an introduction, see <ptr target="#blei2012"/>). In
            practice, individual words with the highest scores in a given topic are assumed to be
            semantically related words. This does not mean they must all belong to a common abstract
            theme (such as justice or biology). Especially in literary texts, it is also common for
            the shared semantic basis of words in a topic to be a particular setting (such as
            interiors or natural landscape), a narrative motive (such as horse-riding or reading and
            writing letters), or a social group of characters (such as noblemen or family members).
            However, the basis of similarity can also be some other aspect, such as the fact that
            all words are character names, or that all words come from a certain register (such as
            colloquial words) or from a distinct language (such as Latin terms in otherwise French
            text). This fact somewhat qualifies the general assumption that the topics with the
            highest scores in a given text represent that text's major themes. Also, literary texts
            do not necessarily treat their dominant themes explicitly: unlike an essay or a research
            paper, a novel can be about social injustice, or a poem about death, without using these
            specific terms explicitly, showing them through concrete examples rather than explaining
            them through conceptual discussion. </p>
          <p>On a slightly more technical level, a topic is a probability distribution over word
            frequencies; in turn, each text is characterized by a probability distribution over
            topics. Topic modeling is an entirely unsupervised method which discovers the latent
            semantic structure of a text collection without using lexical or semantic resources such
            as electronic dictionaries. This means that Topic Modeling is not only
            language-independent, but also independent of external resources with potential built-in
            biases. Rather, Topic Modeling is based on assumptions about language first developed in
            distributional semantics, whose basic tenet is that the meaning of a word depends on the
            words in whose context it appears. As John R. Firth famously put it in 1957, <quote
              rend="inline" source="#firth1957">a word is characterized by the company it
              keeps</quote>. In line with this idea, the highest-ranked words in a topic are those
            words which frequently occur together in a collection of documents. A second, related
            assumption of Topic Modeling is a specific view of how the writing process is
            envisioned. In this view, text is generated from several groups of semantically related
            terms which are chosen, in different proportions for each text, when the text is
            written. Topic modeling reconstructs, based on the resulting text alone, which words
            must have been in which group and which probability they had of being selected in the
            writing process (see <ptr target="#steyvers2006"/>). Because this is a model with a very
            high number of unknown variables, it cannot be solved deterministically. Rather, it is
            solved with an initial random or arbitrary distribution of values which is then
            iteratively improved until a certain level of convergence between the texts predicted by
            the model and the actual texts in the collection analyzed is reached. This also means
            that the results of Topic Modeling a given collection, even with identical parameters,
            may not yield exactly identical results every time the technique is applied. However,
            experience with multiple repeated modeling processes show that generally speaking, and
            given enough iterations, it is a rather robust technique, with results varying in the
            details of word ranks rather than in the general topics obtained (see below). </p>
          <p> The most commonly used implementation of Topic Modeling uses an algorithm called
            Latent Dirichlet Allocation (<ptr target="#blei2003"/>), but there are several
            precursors (such as Non-Negative Matrix Factorization) and an increasing number of
            alternative algorithms. Also, besides the most commonly used tool, MALLET (<ptr
              target="#mccallum2002"/>), which is written in Java, several other tools are
            available, such as gensim (<ptr target="#rehurek2010"/>) and lda (<ptr
              target="#riddell2014b"/>), both written in Python. Several extensions to Topic
            Modeling have been proposed, such as hierarchical Topic Modeling (<ptr
              target="#blei2004"/>) and supervised or labeled Topic Modeling (<ptr
              target="#ramage2009"/>), with both variants also being available in MALLET. Due to the
            availability of relevant tools and tutorials (e.g. <ptr target="#graham2012"/> or <ptr
              target="#riddell2014a"/>), and because it answers to the wish of many scholars in the
            humanities to gain a semantic access to large amounts of texts, Topic Modeling has
            proven immensely popular in Digital Humanities (for applications, see e.g. <ptr
              target="#blevins2010"/> , <ptr target="#rhody2012"/> , or <ptr target="#jockers2013"
            />) for analyses of different literary genres. </p>

          <head>The Topic Modeling Workflow</head>
          <p> Topic Modeling has been performed as part of a larger processing workflow described in
            this section (see <ref target="#figure02">Figure 2</ref> for an overview of the
            process). The workflow is almost entirely automated using a custom-built set of Python
            scripts called tmw, for Topic Modeling Workflow.<note>The tmw toolchain is being
              developed at <ref target="https://github.com/cligs/tmw"
                >https://github.com/cligs/tmw</ref> (DOI: 10.5281/zenodo.439975). It uses lxml to
              read the XML-TEI encoded files, calls TreeTagger and Mallet via the subprocess module,
              adapts code by Allen Riddell for aggregating per-segment topic scores, relies heavily
              on pandas and scipy for data management and statistical analyses, and uses the
              word_cloud, seaborn and pygal modules for visualization.</note> Starting from the
            original XML/TEI-encoded texts from <title rend="italic">Théâtre classique</title> and
            making use of the structural markup, speaker text and stage directions have been
            extracted from the plays in order to exclude interference from prefaces, editorial
            notes, or speaker names. In the next step, as the plays are relatively few but have a
            considerable length, each play has been split into several smaller segments of similar
            length (around 1000 words). For the research reported here, arbitrary segment boundaries
            have been preferred to segmentation along the act and scene divisions, as this would
            result in overly heterogeneous segment lengths. This results in an average of 14.9 text
            segments of comparable length per play, or 5840 segments in total.<note>The vast
              majority of the text segments have a length of around 900 to 1100 word tokens, with
              only a small number of shorter segments originating from the end of some of the plays.
              This choice has been inspired by reports by <ptr target="#jockers2013" loc="134"/>
              that in his corpus of novels, text segments of 1000 words with arbitrary boundaries
              produced the best, i.e. the most interpretable topics. However, the relation between
              text segment length and formally measured topic coherence scores, for example using
              one of the measures implemented in Palmetto (see <ptr target="#roeder2015"/>) has not
              been assessed in this study. In an earlier iteration of this research,
              structurally-motivated text segments have been used by splitting the plays on the act
              and scene boundaries and merging very short scenes while splitting longer ones. An
              argument can be made for respecting the original act and scene boundaries which can be
              assumed to be, in the majority of cases, locations of thematic shift. However, it
              turns out that whether the segments have been split at arbitrary or
              structurally-motivated points does not affect the results as much as one might expect.
              Therefore, the decision has been made to use the more straightforward option here.

          <p> Lemmatization and morpho-syntactic tagging have been performed using TreeTagger (<ptr
              target="#schmid1994"/>) with a language model and tagset specifically developed for
            historical French in the framework of the PRESTO project (<ptr target="#presto2014"/>).
              <note>The PRESTO language model and tagset have been developed for sixteenth- and
              seventeenth-century French. Eighteenth-century French, especially in tragedies,
              retains many of the characteristics of this earlier period, so that the tagger can be
              expected to work equally well with that part of the corpus. An informal sampling test
              revealed that for the task of identifying the nouns, verbs and adjectives, the tagging
              step reaches a very satisfactory level of accuracy (F1-score: 0.945), with excellent
              recall (extremely few false negatives) and very good precision (very few false
              positives). Precision is then increased in the following, rule-based lemma selection
              step, as it involves a short stoplist for false positives. Due to this two-step
              process, the list of lemmas ultimately used to build the MALLET corpus has a very high
              accuracy.</note> Lemmatization, i.e. the transformation of each word form to its base
            form such as could be found in a dictionary entry's head word, has been performed
            because French is a highly inflected language, and differences in the word use in
            different inflectional forms may obscure the common semantic structure which is of
            interest here. Morpho-syntactic tagging identifies the grammatical category of each word
            token and not only allows to filter out (speaker) names mentioned by other speakers
            (which are not of interest here), but also allows for the specific selection, for Topic
            Modeling, of only a certain number of word categories. For the research presented here,
            only nouns, verbs and adjectives have been retained for analysis, under the assumption
            that those are the main content-bearing words, while all other word categories, which
            mostly contain function words, have been excluded from the data. </p>

          </figure>
          <p>Ultimately, this means that instead of 391 XML-encoded entire plays, 5840 short
            pseudo-text segments made up of sequences of noun, verb, adjective and adverb lemmata
            have been submitted to the Topic Modeling procedure. Each of these segments can be
            identified as to the individual play it belongs to (which, in turn, is associated with
            descriptive metadata, such as the date of publication, the author, and the subgenre of
            the play) and as to the relative position in the play it comes from (with a granularity
            of five subsequent sections of the plays, corresponding roughly, if not structurally, to
            the five acts of the majority of the plays included).</p>
          <p>The Topic Modeling procedure itself has been performed using MALLET. After (in this
            case) 6000 iterations, the result of this process is a topic model of the initial data,
            represented, among other things, by a table of all topics, ranked according to their
            overall probability in the entire text collection, with a ranked list of words most
            strongly associated with each of them; by a table containing the probability score of
            each topic in each of the 5840 text segments; and by a table containing the probability
            score of each word in each topic.</p>
          <p> There are many parameters influencing the result of the modeling process, but the
            following are of particular importance: The number of topics (what level of granularity
            should the model have?), the hyperparameters alpha and beta (affecting the
            distributional profile of the words in each topic and that of the topics in each
            document, respectively; see <ptr target="#wallach2009"/> and <ptr target="#buntine2014"
            /> for details), the number of iterations (how many times should the model be updated?),
            and the optimization interval (at which intervals, in terms of iterations, should the
            hyperparameters be adjusted automatically? see <ptr target="#schoch2016"/>). For all of
            these parameters, there doesn't seem to be any hard-and-fast rules on how to determine
            an appropriate setting, other than a firm understanding of the topic modeling procedure
            combined with a good knowledge of the dataset under scrutiny and a clear research
            objective which the model is supposed to support. In order to overcome this difficulty
            of largely intuitive and arbitrary decisions, a series of 48 different models have been
            created based on a range of parameter settings, systematically varying the number of
            topics (six levels: 50, 60, 70, 80, 90, 100) and the hyperparameter optimization
            interval (eight levels: 50, 100, 300, 500, 1000, 2000, 3000, None) while keeping the
            number of iterations constant (at 6000 iterations). In order to evaluate the model and
            decide which model should be used in the remainder of the study, a machine-learning task
            has been defined which consists of classifying the plays according to their (known)
            subgenre. This task appears to be appropriate since the main focus of the present study
            lies in the thematic differentiation of the dramatic subgenres present in the
              collection.<note>Optimizing the parameters by optimizing some measure of model quality
              would have been another empirical way to solve this issue. Topic coherence measures
              such as the ones implemented in Palmetto (see <ptr target="#roeder2015"/>), in
              particular, would be interesting for this and many other purposes. The optimal
              parameters could then be found by maximizing both average topic coherence scores (to
              obtain maximally semantically coherent topics) and overall topic word vector distances
              (to obtain maximally distinct topics) as a function of the parameters. However, doing
              so independently of a specific task may be a misleading strategy in the case at hand.
              Indeed, it is likely that it results in a high number of very coherent topics with
              each of them being specific to a small number of documents, rather than serving the
              purpose of finding topics characteristics of large groups of plays, such as plays
              belonging to a given subgenre.</note> The data relating to the probabilities of each
            topic in each play, for each combination of parameters, has been used as input to this
            task and the performance evaluated in a ten-fold cross-validation setting using four
            different machine learning algorithms (Support Vector Machines, k-Nearest Neighbors,
            Stochastic Gradient Descent and Decision Tree). The performance of each algorithm for
            different input data is shown in <ref target="#figure03">Figure 3</ref> . As can be
            seen, the subgenre classification task is solved with an accuracy of around 0.70-0.87
            (the baseline being 0.48). Although differences between the best-performing models are
            slight, the best results are obtained by the SVM for the model built with 60 topics and
            the optimization interval set at 300 iterations, with a mean accuracy of 0.87.
            Therefore, this is the model which has been used in the remainder of this
              study.<note>Apart from the model selection process described here, the effect of the
              choice of number of topics can be described as follows: If the number of topics is set
              to a smaller value, several distinct and well-defined topics fail to be included among
              the results and several topics become aggregates of more than one semantic field. If
              it is set to a larger value, an overly large number of very similar topics emerge. The
              number of topics chosen may also interact with the length of the text segments
              used.</note>

          </figure>
          <p> It should be noted that even with such precautions taken, some degree of intuitive or
            arbitrary decisions remains in the procedure and may have more or less direct influence
            on the results obtained. For this reason, it is all the more important to document the
            choices made. With this in mind and in order to increase the transparency of this

        <head>Results and Discussion</head>
        <p>In the following three sections, three types of results will be discussed and related to
          the hypotheses described above. First of all, results relating to the topics found in the
          collection of plays. Then, results pertaining to topics which are distinctive for the
          three subgenres contained in the collection, including results relating to genre-specific
          plot-related patterns. Finally, results from clustering and classification based on topic
          scores as well as raw word frequencies will be presented.</p>
        <div>
          <head>Topics: Structure and semantic coherence</head>
          <p> An initial inspection of the 60 topics obtained with their top-40 words, visualized as
            word clouds, shows that most of the topics display a relatively high level of
            (subjective) coherence. A first selection of topic word clouds is shown in <ref
              target="#figure04">Figure 4</ref>. One common effect of a highly asymmetric topic
            probability distribution is that the topics with the highest probability scores (i.e.
            the ones most widely represented in the collection) are less interpretable than most
            others, in the sense that they are rather generic and vague. However, the model used
            here is notable for the absence of such topics; even the most widely present topics are
            relatively well-defined: Here, topic 32 is the highest-ranked topic; it has an overall
            score of 0.244 and its top five words are <q><foreign xml:lang="fr">coeur</foreign>,
                <foreign xml:lang="fr">amour</foreign>, <foreign xml:lang="fr">aimer</foreign>,
                <foreign xml:lang="fr">oser</foreign>, <foreign xml:lang="fr">madame</foreign></q>
            (heart, love, to love, to dare, madam), describing a perspective on the omnipresent love
            theme marked by love as a challenge and a reward. Another highly-ranked topic is topic
            3; it has an overall score of 0.172 and its top five words are <q><foreign xml:lang="fr"
                >secret</foreign>, <foreign xml:lang="fr">connaître</foreign>, <foreign
                xml:lang="fr">craindre</foreign>, <foreign xml:lang="fr">cacher</foreign>, <foreign
                xml:lang="fr">apprendre</foreign></q> (secret, to know, to fear, to hide, to learn),
            resulting in a topic concerned with epistemological issues. Topics with very low
            probability scores (i.e. those appearing only in a few plays) are typically highly
            specific, but tell us less about the collection as a whole. Again, this phenomenon is
            comparatively less prevalent in the model used here, but it can still be noted for
            topics 30 and 15, which are both of a very low rank. Topic 30 has a score of 0.024 and
            its top five words are <q><foreign xml:lang="fr">vers</foreign>, <foreign xml:lang="fr"
                >auteur</foreign>, <foreign xml:lang="fr">pièce</foreign>, <foreign xml:lang="fr"
                >beau</foreign>, <foreign xml:lang="fr">esprit</foreign></q> (verse, author, drama,
            beautiful, spirit/wit) and is a metafictional topic centered on producing aesthetic
            literary works. Topic 34 has an even lower score of 0.014 and its top five words are
                <q><foreign xml:lang="fr">mal</foreign>, <foreign xml:lang="fr">monsieur</foreign>,
                <foreign xml:lang="fr">médecin, guérir</foreign>, <foreign xml:lang="fr"
                >malade</foreign></q> (hurting, mister, doctor, to recover/heal, sick). Both topics
            are precisely focused and interesting, but occur only in very few plays or a single
            author. For instance, the sickness-topic just mentioned (topic 34) is strongly present
            only in two comedies, in <title rend="italic">L'amour médecin</title> by Molière and in
              <title rend="italic">Élomire hypocondre, ou les médecins vengés</title> by Le
            Boulanger de Chalussay, and a lot less strongly in a small handful of other plays. If
            one happens to be interested in one of these very specific topics, Topic Modeling
            provides a great way of identifying plays which should be included in a more detailed
            analysis. The most relevant topics for the research presented here, however, are those
            with less extreme probability scores, because subgenre distinctions are located by
            definition somewhere between individual plays and an entire collection of plays. Using
            just 60 different topics and a relatively low optimization interval provides a maximum
            of such topics of mid-range importance in the collection. </p>
          <figure xml:id="figure04">
            <head>Word cloud visualization for selected topics: high and low overall topic
              probability (larger font size indicates higher word probability; the numbers in
              brackets indicate the topic rank).</head>
            <graphic url="resources/images/figure04.png"/>
          </figure>
          <p> The selection of topics in <ref target="#figure05">Figure 5</ref> shows another
            phenomenon, related to the internal structure of topics (which in part depends on the
            alpha hyperparameter). Most topics show a small number of quite important words (i.e.
            with high probability in the topic, displayed in a very large font size), with a
            relatively smooth drop-off and a long tail of less important words (displayed in very
            small font size). However, some topics show a different internal structure: for
            instance, in topic 48, only <q><foreign xml:lang="fr">père</foreign></q> and <q><foreign
                xml:lang="fr">enfant</foreign></q> (father, child) has a very large score, with
            subsequent words much less important in that topic. The effect is even more marked in
            topic 27, in which only a single word, <q><foreign xml:lang="fr">ciel</foreign></q>
            (sky), has a very high score, with an extremely clear drop in scores for all other words
            in the topic. Inversely, topic 1 has a large number of words with relatively high
            scores, the first five being <q><foreign xml:lang="fr">monsieur</foreign>, <foreign
                xml:lang="fr">argent</foreign>, <foreign xml:lang="fr">bon</foreign>, <foreign
                xml:lang="fr">payer</foreign>, <foreign xml:lang="fr">écus</foreign></q> (mister,
            money, good, to pay, écus). The same phenomenon can be observed in topic 50. The word
            cloud visualizations nicely bring out this internal structure of the topics. </p>

              probabilities.</head>
            <graphic url="resources/images/figure05.png"/>
          </figure>
          <p> What, then, are topics characteristic for this collection of plays, what are the
            themes most commonly found in them? <ref target="#figure06">Figure 6</ref> shows
            examples for several types of topics. Many of the topics found are related to clear,
            abstract themes, such as love, death, crime and marriage, which are also themes we can
            expect to appear in plays of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. One such topic is
            shown here for illustration, namely topic 18, clearly related to life and death:
                <q><foreign xml:lang="fr">mourir</foreign>, <foreign xml:lang="fr">mort</foreign>,
                <foreign xml:lang="fr">douleur</foreign>, <foreign xml:lang="fr">vivre</foreign>,
                <foreign xml:lang="fr">vie</foreign></q> (to die, death/dead, pain, to live, life).
            Such topics typically come from the upper region of the probability scores. Others focus
            on the dramatic personnel, such as topic 5 related to family members: <q><foreign
                xml:lang="fr">fils</foreign>, <foreign xml:lang="fr">père</foreign>, <foreign
                xml:lang="fr">mère</foreign>, <foreign xml:lang="fr">frère</foreign>, <foreign
                xml:lang="fr">enfant</foreign></q> (son, father, mother, daughter, child). Quite a
            number of topics are rather more concrete, such as those related to a setting, as in
            topic 46: <q><foreign xml:lang="fr">beau</foreign>, <foreign xml:lang="fr"
                >berger</foreign>, <foreign xml:lang="fr">bois</foreign>, <foreign xml:lang="fr"
                >arbre</foreign>, <foreign xml:lang="fr">lieu</foreign></q> (beautiful, shepherd,
            wood, tree, place). Others focus on quite specific activities, such as topic 30
            mentioned above or topic 26 devoted to reading and writing letters: <q><foreign
                xml:lang="fr">lettre</foreign>, <foreign xml:lang="fr">lire</foreign>, <foreign
                xml:lang="fr">écrire</foreign>, <foreign xml:lang="fr">billet</foreign>, <foreign
                xml:lang="fr">main</foreign></q> (letter, to read, to write, note, hand). These
            topics typically come from a somewhat lower range of probability scores. The latter
            types of topics, related to activities, setting and personnel, show that taking a method
            such as Topic Modeling, developed initially for collections of non-fictional prose such
            as scholarly journal articles or newspapers, and adapting it to the domain of literary
            texts, actually changes the meaning of the word <q>topic</q>: to put it another way, the
              <q>topics</q> found in literary texts are not only abstract themes such as justice,
            knowledge or crime, but also more concrete activities typically performed by fictional
            characters, like writing, eating, drinking, hunting, speaking and thinking, or literary
            settings or motives such as the sea, the forest, or interiors. While the presence of the
            former is related to the choice of including verbs into the analysis, the same is not
            true for the latter. Note that what becomes visible here are different
              <emph>types</emph> of semantic coherence, irrespective of the <emph>degree</emph> of
            semantic coherence as assessed by various topic coherence measures (for an overview, see
              <ptr target="#roeder2015"/>. </p>
          <figure xml:id="figure06">

              topics.</head>
            <graphic url="resources/images/figure06.png"/>
          </figure>
          <p> In a small number of cases, several topics are related to very similar semantic
            fields, despite the fact that with just 60 topics, the granularity of the model is
            already comparatively low. This indicates that there may be a hierarchical structure to
            the topics, and that it may be useful to think of topics in a hierarchical relationship
            or as clusters.<note>This has not been assessed here systematically and could be
              investigated in the future using hierarchical Topic Modeling or by clustering the
              topics based on the similarity of their word vectors.</note> This is the case for
            topics concerning family members and relations as well as for death-related topics (not
            shown), and especially for no less than 8 topics related in some way to love, and
            containing among their top-ranked words items such as <q><foreign xml:lang="fr"
                >amour</foreign></q> and <q><foreign xml:lang="fr">coeur</foreign></q> (love,
            heart). Four such topics are shown in <ref target="#figure07">Figure 7</ref>.
            Interestingly, the words following these top-ranked words differ significantly in each
            of these topics: for instance, in topic 6, words like <q><foreign xml:lang="fr"
                >ingrat</foreign>, <foreign xml:lang="fr">trahir</foreign>, <foreign xml:lang="fr"
                >perfide</foreign>, <foreign xml:lang="fr">venger</foreign>, <foreign xml:lang="fr"
                >crime</foreign></q> (unthankful, to betray, insidious, to avenge, crime) link this
            kind of love to ideas of intensely negative emotions. Conversely, topic 24 prominently
            contains words such as <q><foreign xml:lang="fr">aimer</foreign>, <foreign xml:lang="fr"
                >âme</foreign>, <foreign xml:lang="fr">beau</foreign>, <foreign xml:lang="fr"
                >yeux</foreign>, <foreign xml:lang="fr">doux</foreign></q> (to love, soul,
            beautiful, eyes, soft), linking this kind of love to pleasing outer appearance as well
            as inward beauty. What seem to be very similar topics, at first, turn out to
            contextualize the top words in very different ways. These differences may turn out to be
            related, in addition, to subgenres, because some of these several love topics are
            associated more strongly with one subgenre than with others, an issue that will be
            addressed in the next section. </p>

          <head>Topics and genre: distinctiveness and plot-related patterns</head>
          <p> While it is possible (and interesting) to extract, from the data, information showing
            which topics are over-represented or under-represented in certain authors or in certain
            decades, this paper focuses on the relation between topic and dramatic subgenres. One
            way to discover such distinctive topics is to proceed as follows. The topic scores
            obtained for each text segment are aggregated and their mean (or median) is calculated,
            taking into account the genre of the play that each text segment belongs to. This
            yields, for each topic, a score for its average importance, technically speaking its
            mean (or median) probability in each of the three subgenres. The topics with the highest
            probability in a given subgenre are not necessarily also the most distinctive ones, i.e.
            those which are over-represented in one subgenre relative to other subgenres, because
            some topics are just highly present in all subgenres. Therefore, a topic-wise mean
            normalization is performed, effectively creating positive values for topics
            over-represented in a given subgenre and negative values for topics under-represented in
            a given subgenre. In order to identify the topics with the most extreme differences
            between topics, the topics are then sorted by decreasing topic-wise standard deviation
            across the three subgenres. In this way, the topics with the highest variability across
            subgenres can be displayed, which are also the topics which are the most distinctive of
            different subgenres.<note>An alternative to this strategy is to perform clustering of
              topics with the scores of each topic in each genre as the features (not shown). This
              yields similar results but also shows that each genre seems to have two distinct
              groups of characteristic topics: those that are highly distinctive of them, and those
              which, although on a significantly lower level, also tend to be more associated with
              one genre than with the two others.</note>
            <ref target="#figure08">Figure 8</ref> shows a heatmap of such subgenre-related average
            topic scores for the twenty topics with the highest cross-genre variability. </p>

            <graphic url="resources/images/figure08.png"/>
          </figure>
          <p> As can be seen, each subgenre has several distinctive topics, i.e. topics which in one
            genre have a score significantly higher both in relation to the other genres for the
            same topic (across rows), and to other topics for the same subgenre (across columns).
            The two most distinctive topics for comedies, with their top-ranked words, are topic 14
                (<q><foreign xml:lang="fr">madame</foreign>, <foreign xml:lang="fr">aimer</foreign>,
                <foreign xml:lang="fr">monsieur</foreign></q> / madam, to love, mister) and topic 36
                (<q><foreign xml:lang="fr">bon</foreign>, <foreign xml:lang="fr">monsieur</foreign>,
                <foreign xml:lang="fr">beau</foreign></q> / good, mister, beautiful), relating
            somewhat vaguely to social interactions. The most distinctive topics for tragedy are
            topic 39 (<q><foreign xml:lang="fr">sang</foreign>, <foreign xml:lang="fr"
                >mort</foreign>, <foreign xml:lang="fr">main</foreign></q> / blood, death, hand) and
            topic 58 (<q><foreign xml:lang="fr">seigneur</foreign>, <foreign xml:lang="fr"
                >soin</foreign>, <foreign xml:lang="fr">lieux</foreign></q> / sire, care, place).
            The first of these topics is much more immediately thematic than the two top comedy
            topics and relates unequivocally to violent, physical, and deadly crimes, something
            which seems to indicate that the tragedies analyzed here fulfill, to a significant
            extent, rather stereotypical genre expectations. The second is a bit less interpretable,
            but appears to be related to courtly negotiations and intrigue. Tragicomedy,
            interestingly, only has one very clearly distinctive topic, topic 53 (<q><foreign
                xml:lang="fr">amour</foreign>, <foreign xml:lang="fr">beau</foreign>, <foreign
                xml:lang="fr">yeux</foreign></q> / love, beautiful, eye) and one a bit less so,
            topic 28 (<q><foreign xml:lang="fr">amour</foreign>, <foreign xml:lang="fr"
                >coeur</foreign>, <foreign xml:lang="fr">aimer</foreign></q> / love, heart, to
            love). This seems to indicate that at this level of analysis, tragicomedy is a mix of
            both tragedy and comedy rather than a genre of its own, something which confirms
            established knowledge about the genre, but does not yet give us more detailed
            information about which of the two genres is related more closely, topically and hence,
            thematically, to tragicomedy. Does tragicomedy have more topic-based overlap with
            comedies or with tragedies? (The next section will attempt to give an answer to this
            question.) Finally, all three subgenres each have at least one quite distinctive topic
            related to <q>love</q>, i.e. topics in which either <q><foreign xml:lang="fr"
                >amour</foreign></q>, <q><foreign xml:lang="fr">aimer</foreign></q> or <q><foreign
                xml:lang="fr">coeur</foreign></q> are among the top two words. As has already been
            seen, each of the <q>love</q> topics actually represents quite a different perspective
            on the theme of love, when looking at some of the words in the top twenty range or so
            (see <ref target="#figure07">Figure 7</ref> , above). </p>
          <p>To summarize, not only are very different topics associated with different subgenres,
            but they also seem to be different types of topics: rather vague topics concerning
            personal relations and interactions and love for comedy, and quite focused, abstract
            topics related to crime and politics for tragedy. This seems to indicate that while
            tragedy remains defined by the topics it addresses, possibly quite explicitly, for
            example in monologues, comedy does not have such clear, abstract defining topics,
            although marriage, money and deception (topics 23, 14 and 3) do seem to be somewhat
            distinctive. Other expected themes like humor for comedies or vengeance for tragedies do
            not appear prominently among the topics. Also, some topics which seem quite similar at
            first glance but are distinctive, one for comedy, one for tragedy, actually reveal
            deep-running differences which explain their association with different subgenres.</p>
          <p>While topic-related patterns across subgenres, then, are very clearly present, the
            question remains whether this is also the case for plot-related patterns. This question
            can be investigated in the following manner: for each topic, topic scores are aggregated
            not by grouping the values of each topic in each of the 5,840 text segments only by
            their genre association, but also by the section of the play they belong to. This was
            done here with a relatively rough granularity of five sections per play corresponding,
            numerically if not structurally, to the five acts of most of the plays, and for comedy
            and tragedy only. In addition, instead of calculating mean values per genre and section,
            all individual scores are taken into account so that the boxplots display key aspects of
            the distribution of the topic scores. In this way, the rising or falling importance of a
            given topic over the course of the comedies or tragedies can be assessed and compared
            with existing knowledge about characteristic features of plot in these subgenres.</p>
          <figure xml:id="figure09">
            <head>Distribution of topic scores over the course of average tragedies and comedies:
              topics 39 and 24.</head>
            <graphic url="resources/images/figure09.png"/>
          </figure>
          <p> Overall, while many topics do not show strong changes in importance over the course of
            plays in one or several subgenres, approximately one fifth of the topics in the model
            analyzed here do. In several cases, a topic rises or falls in one genre while remaining
            stable in the other. This is the case, for example, for topic 39 (another death-related
            topic) and obviously related to tragedy (see <ref target="#figure09">Figure 9</ref>).
            Not only is this topic indeed much more prevalent in tragedy than in comedy, but it also
            gains importance over the course of many tragedies: in the first two fifths of the
            tragedies, its median is close to zero, with a considerable amount of outliers, i.e.
            single text segments with an unusually high score. (This is an effect of the many
            segments in which a given topic plays only a negligible role, given that each segment
            analyzed here is very short and only accommodates a few of the sixty topics). However,
            in the remaining three fifths of the tragedies, the median gradually raises to 0.05 (in
            section 3), 0.98 (in section 4) and 0.15 (in section 5; the underlying distributions
            differ very significantly). Quite obviously, the fact that tragedies frequently end with
            threats of cruelty and actual death manifests itself in the topic scores here. A similar
            pattern, but only in comedies, can be found for topic 0 related to marriage and
            indicative of a happy ending (not shown). Similar raising patterns can be also be found
            for topic 18 and 21 for either tragedy or comedy (not shown). A falling pattern can be
            seen for topic 24, a love-related topic, and while the decrease over the course of the
            plays is less marked than in the previous examples, the same pattern appears to be
            present in both comedies and tragedies (only some underlying distributions differ
            significantly). Because there are several other love-topics, this does not necessarily
            mean that love is of decreasing importance over the course of the plays; rather,
            different types of love-related topics appear to be of importance at different times in
            many of the plays. Other topics with patterns of falling importance over the course of
            the plays are topics 13, 22, 56, 57 and 58 (not shown). </p>
          <p>A number of plot-related trends exist in the data, then, some stronger than others, and
            some of which lend themselves more easily to interpretation than others. When these
            kinds of patterns concern only one genre but not the others, they may easily be
            overlooked when looking only at all plays together. Therefore, this approach is relevant
            on a methodological level, because this is an example of a genre-related characteristic
            which only becomes clearly visible when looking at the development of topic importance
            over the course of many plays separated into subgenre-related groups.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <head>Topic-based clustering</head>
          <p> The differences observed so far rely on the <foreign xml:lang="la">a priori</foreign>
            subgenre classification of plays, accepting the historical subgenre labels as given.
            This, it may be argued, is problematic not only because the labels and their use may not
            be uncontroversial, but also because some seemingly significant differences in topic
            score distribution across such a small number of categories may always be found, no
            matter what the categories are. Moreover, if the aim is to find out how the dramatic
            genre as a whole is structured internally into subgroups of similar plays, such
            preconceived categories are not helpful. To explore whether the topics are indeed
            structuring the collection along the lines of subgenres, the perspective should also be
            inverted and a topic-based, unsupervised clustering method be performed on the data.
            This also allows one to move away from predefined, historical, potentially problematic
            genre labels, which allow discovering distinctive topics but may obscure other structure
            in the data, be it topic-based commonalities between several subgenres or additional
            divisions within one subgenre. </p>
          <p> Several approaches to this clustering task can be taken, for example Principal
            Component Analysis (PCA) or Hierarchical Clustering (HC), among others. In any event,
            such a clustering step performs another data transformation on the topic scores. These
            topic scores, however, are already the result of a dimensionality reduction process,
            since LDA takes the very high-dimensional word vectors representing the documents and
            transforms them to the much lower dimensionality of the topics. (Note that both PCA and
            HC can also be applied directly to the word vectors instead of taking the intermediary
            step of LDA). In fact, PCA is in some ways quite similar to LDA in that it transforms
            the vectors to a new space of lower dimensions and may not perform optimally on data
            that has already undergone a similar procedure (<ptr target="#joliffe2002"/>). However,
            the advantage of PCA is that the topics most strongly correlating with a given principal
            component can be determined through the <q>loadings</q> of that component, something
            which aids the interpretation of the resulting model. Also, the position of documents to
            each other can be visualized in a two- or three-dimensional plot which allows for
            considerable nuance. HC builds a distance matrix out of the feature vectors representing
            the distance (or degree of dissimilarity) of every document to every other document.
            This and the following steps of creating a linkage matrix and visualizing it as a
            dendrogram is a somewhat distinct type of process from LDA (and PCA) and may for that
            reason be preferred when using data that has already undergone a dimensionality
            reduction. Also, clusters and subclusters of the data can be more readily inspected
            based on the distances at which more or less large clusters and subclusters are merged.
            Rather than choosing among these two analyses, both have been performed and their
            results are compared here. </p>
          <p>
            <ref target="#figure10">Figure 10</ref> shows the result of a PCA based on the topic
            scores. Here, the unit of analysis is the play, and the features characterizing each
            play are the mean probability scores of each of the 60 topics. The scatterplot displays
            the two components in the data which summarize the greatest amount of variation in the
              data.<note>PCA has been performed using the sklearn package for Python. In our case,
              the first three principal components, together, account for only 22% of the variation
              in the original 60 topic dimensions. The cumulated proportion of the variance reaches
              60% at 19 dimensions and 80% at 33 dimensions out of 60. Although PCA performs on data
              that is already the result of a dimensionality reduction, there are still correlations
              in the topic distribution data that are captured by the PCA.</note>

          <p> Each circle in the plot represents one play, and their relative proximity or distance
            indicates topic-based, thematic similarity or difference in the three dimensions shown.
            The colors of the circles correspond to the conventional genre labels of each play,
            which however do not influence the positions of the circles. The coloring only allows us
            to see to what degree the topic-based similarity of the plays corresponds with their
            conventional genre label. This correspondence is very high, and the first component
            (PC1, 11%, horizontal axis) clearly contributes the most to a separation of the plays
            into comedies (red circles to the left) and the tragedies (blue circles to the right).
              <note>This observation can be confirmed mathematically by computing the correlation
              between genre categories and positions on the first principal component (t-test
              correlation is very strong at -0.81, and highly significant at p &lt; 0,0001).</note>
            It is true that to some extent, this may be an effect of correlations between authorship
            and genre (some authors, like Voltaire, having predominantly written only in one
            subgenre), but many authors in the collection have written plays in several subgenres.
            The second component (PC2, 6%, vertical axis) separates the tragicomedies from the rest
            of the plays, at least to some extent, with the tragicomedies being found only in the
            upper center region of the plot. However, there is substantial overlap between
            tragicomedy and tragedy as well as some degree of overlap between tragicomedy and
            comedy. When clustering plays based on their topic scores, then, tragicomedy appears to
            be more closely related to tragedy than to comedy. This fits one conventional
            description of tragicomedy as a tragedy that ends well, i.e. as a type of play with
            similar personnel, plot and themes as tragedy, except that there is no disastrous
            ending. Another interesting feature of the PCA plot is that there seem to be at least
            two distinct groups of tragedies. These groups cannot be simply explained by chronology,
            and the prose/verse distinction is also not pertinent for tragedy, for which virtually
            all examples are written in verse (an exception is discussed below). </p>
          <p> Overall, we see that there are two major, well-defined groups of tragedies and
            comedies, but also secondary groups of tragedies as well as overlap between tragedies,
            tragicomedies and comedies. This supports the idea of a theory of genres as prototypes
            that can be realized in more or less complete ways (see e.g. <ptr target="#hempfer2014"
            />). A thorough investigation into what unites the plays of each subgroup and what
            distinguishes them from the other subgroup, thematically and/or otherwise, will need to
            be performed in further research. </p>
          <p>The second strategy intended to yield an insight into how the topics structure the 391
            plays into distinct groups is Hierarchical Clustering. Cluster Analysis has been
            performed using the Euclidean distance metric and the "Ward" method of agglomerative
            clustering. The correlation coefficient achieved was 0.447.</p>
          <figure xml:id="figure11">

              with Euclidean distance metric).</head>
            <graphic url="resources/images/figure11.png"/>
          </figure>
          <p> The cluster dendrogram (<ref target="#figure11">Figure 11</ref>) shows similar plays
            or clusters of plays being connected at low distance values. The labels to the right
            indicate the identifier of the play as well as its conventional genre category ("TR" for
            tragedy, "CO" for comedy, "TC" for tragicomedy). The colors of the clusters do not
            correspond to genres, but to clusters whose members are joined beyond the (arbitrarily
            set) threshold value of 1.3, resulting in 10 distinct subclusters. We can see that among
            these subclusters, the green and red ones at the bottom of the graph are populated
            exclusively by tragedies. The smaller turquoise cluster just above them is made up of
            comedies only, and they appear quite distinct from the remaining plays. The three
            magenta, turquoise and red subclusters at the top of the dendrogram correspond almost
            exclusively to comedies. In the middle of the dendrogram, there are several more mixed
            clusters, notably containing most of the tragicomedies along with other plays. The black
            subcluster in the middle of the dendrogram, for example, is an almost even mix of
            tragedies and tragicomedies, while the yellow subcluster just below it contains mostly
            comedies and tragicomedies. In a manner similar to the PCA-based scatterplot, the
            dendrogram shows that while some tragedies and comedies form quite large distinct
            groups, the tragicomedies mingle partly with the comedies, partly with the tragedies. </p>
          <p> The two tragedy clusters at the bottom of the graph do not contain a single play of a
            different subgenre label.<note>Several plays which in an earlier iteration of this
              research appeared to have been placed in a subcluster dominated by another genre
              turned out to be mislabeled in the source of the data used here. This has been
              corrected in the meantime.</note> But the occasional exception can be found in the
            three upper comedy clusters, where a small number of tragicomedies appear. One
            interesting case from among the more mixed clusters is <title rend="italic"
              >Socrate</title>, written by Voltaire in 1759 (identifier: tc0872) and a rare specimen
            of a tragedy in prose, something which may explain its position separate from most other
            tragedies. In addition, it appears closest to another play written in prose, an
            allegorical play in which the personified tragedies of Voltaire enter into a dialogue,
            something which appears to produce a play with topic proportions similar to the actual
            Voltaire play. In addition, although this play is labeled as a tragedy, it is certainly
            a very unusual tragedy and its historical subtitle is in fact <q><foreign xml:lang="fr"
                >comédie</foreign></q>. </p>
          <p>Overall, the results from clustering using PCA confirm that even when the algorithms do
            not know about subgenre categories, but cluster the plays only based on their topic
            scores, that is relating to their thematic similarity in a broad sense, subgenre turns
            out to be a prominent factor entering into the resulting clusters.</p>

          <head>Topics or words?</head>
          <p>As we have seen, topic-based clustering, both in the form of Principal Component
            Analysis and Hierarchical Clustering, appears perfectly able to use the information
            about the topic probability scores to create groups of plays that are in line, to a very
            significant proportion, with conventional subgenre labeling of the plays in the <title
              rend="italic">Théâtre classique</title> collection. In addition, we have seen at the
            beginning of this paper that topic-based classification into subgenres, when evaluated
            on those same conventional subgenre labels using ten-fold cross-validation, performs
            with a mean accuracy of between 70 and 87 percent, depending on data and classifier
            used. It is true that the tragedies, with 189 of the 391 plays, constitute a significant
            proportion of the plays in the collection. This means that the classification baseline
            should be considered to be no lower than 189/391, that is 48.3 percent, which
            corresponds to the proportion of true positives one would obtain when simply always
            choosing the category of the largest group. Still, these high levels of accuracy are a
            considerable feat, given the highly controversial nature of subgenre distinctions, even
            for a strongly conventionalized genre such as Classical and Enlightenment French
            drama.</p>
          <p> However impressive these results may be, the question remains whether topic-based
            classification or clustering, because it is based on information highly relevant to
            genre distinctions, outperforms established alternative approaches, such as
            classification based on simple most-frequent words as commonly used in stylometry and
            particularly in authorship attribution (for an overview, see <ptr
              target="#stamatatos2009"/>). It turns out that when comparing results from
            classification based on topic scores on the one hand and word frequencies on the other,
            performance for both methods is on a similar level, with a slight advantage for the
            word-based approach. For both approaches, standard classifiers from the scipy package
            (k-Nearest-Neighbor, Decision Trees, Stochastic Gradient Descent and Support Vector
            Machines) have been used with very little fine-tuning. In the case of the topic
            probabilities, the model with 60 topics and a moderate optimization interval of 300
            iterations yielded an accuracy of 87.0% when using SVM (with a linear kernel), an
            improvement of almost 40 percent points compared to the baseline (see <ref
              target="#figure03">Figure 3</ref> above). However, when using word frequencies
            transformed to z-scores and using a word-vector of the 3500 most frequent words, the
            best-performing SVM achieved an accuracy of 90.5 percent (see Table 3 in the annex).
            This is not much above the topic-based classification, but the results are robustly
            above 90% even with word vectors of a length between 2500 and 4500, while the accuracy
            for the topic-based methods drops rather more quickly and unpredictably with slightly
            different parameters. </p>
          <p> This result is surprising, because both methods rely on different views of the
            original text of the plays: while the topic scores have been obtained based only on
            content-bearing words and are abstractions from individual word tokens, the frequencies
            of the 3500 most frequent words used here have not been lemmatized and also contain a
            large number of function words. Such function words used to be associated with
            authorship rather than genre or subgenre, and could have been expected to skew results
            or represent noise with regard to genre. However, recent research has also shown that
            there is no simple separation of authorship and genre signals based on the word
            frequency spectrum (see e.g. <ptr target="#rybicki2011"/>, <ptr target="#kestemont2012"
            /> or <ptr target="#schoch2013"/> on the issue of authorship and genre in stylometry).
            In addition, the author signal is likely muted here due to the large number of authors
            in the dataset compared to the very small number of subgenres. </p>

        <head>Conclusions</head>
        <p>To summarize the major results of this study, one may state first that, as far as the
          topics obtained are concerned, most topics obtained with the parameters chosen through the
          classification task are highly interpretable. Some of the topics are clearly thematic,
          others are related to the character inventory of plays, to recurring dramatic actions or
          to setting. Future work could usefully establish a more systematic approach to the types
          of topics, ideally leading to an empirically-founded typology of topics. Such a typology
          would allow to describe major genres such as narrative fiction, dramatic works and poetry
          by the prevalence of their types of topics (rather than specific individual topics),
          something which would allow better comparison across collections and even languages.</p>
        <p>Also, based on metadata regarding the subgenre of each play in the collection, the
          strength and nature of topic-related patterns across subgenres can be observed, with each
          subgenre having a number of clearly distinctive topics. In addition, some topics show
          plot-related trends over the course of an average comedy or tragedy, trends which can in
          many cases be meaningfully related to existing knowledge about the subgenres' plot
          structure, especially the happy ending in comedy and the deadly finales of tragedy.</p>
        <p>Clustering based on the topic scores obtained also yields results which can be usefully
          related to subgenres and show that the distinctiveness of topics with regards to genre is
          not a projection but an actual pattern in the data. Overall, it appears that interesting
          patterns can be detected using topic modeling, patterns which, in many cases, confirm
          existing knowledge about the themes and plot of subgenres on the basis of a significantly
          larger amount of data than can be taken into account in close-reading approaches. In some
          cases, surprising results provide new insight into the history of French drama of the
          Classical Age and the Enlightenment or provoke new hypotheses which may need further
          inquiry in the future. This is the case, particularly, of the finding that there may be
          three relatively distinct groups of tragedies as well as two groups of comedies.</p>
        <p>It has been found in previous (as yet unpublished) studies by the author of this paper
          that strong genre signals exist in the collection explored here on the levels of function
          words, content words and syntactic structure. It is interesting to see that they also
          exist on the level of theme or topic. Once each of these (and more) levels of description
          of genre have been analyzed in more detail for the collection of French plays, new
          insights into the structure of the subgenres and into their development over time will
          become possible by analyzing the ways in which these different levels of description
          correlate, interact, or possibly contradict each other. Ultimately, these results also
          show that far from merely being a projection or a social construct, literary genres do
          have a textual reality that can be assessed quantitatively. It is on the basis of such a
          reality and within the potentialities and constraints it offers, that different views of
          literary genre as a concept, and of literary history as the continual evolution of
          literary genres, become possible.</p>
        <p> It would be tempting to finish this paper on such an optimistic note. However, it seems
          necessary to also point to some of the challenges connected to research of the kind
          presented here. First of all, many questions remain open and while some results can
          readily be linked to established knowledge in traditional literary scholarship, other
          phenomena remain to be explained. For example, the subgroups of tragedies and comedies
          found in the PCA scatterplot and Cluster Analysis dendrogram will need to be investigated
          in future work. Also, the results obtained for plot-related patterns are promising, but
          the inclusion of three-act plays as well as plays with a prologue, in the collection used
          here, may have obscured plot-related patterns in the majority of five-act plays. However,
          confirming established knowledge or widely accepted hypotheses on the basis of larger
          datasets is useful in itself, especially at a time when there is only a limited amount of
          experience with techniques newly applied to the domain of literary texts. This helps build
          confidence in results which may support entirely new hypotheses. A second, more technical,
          challenge is related to the methods used here to obtain values for topics depending on the
          subgenre of a play or the section in a play. It may be more appropriate, and may produce
          better results, to either perform logistical regression on the data to discover
          associations between topics and genres (or other categories), or to include the section
          information into the modeling process from the start, which would effectively mean
          practicing "sequential LDA" (<ptr target="#du2010"/>) or "topics over time" (<ptr
            target="#politz2015"/>). Tentative experiments with labeled LDA (<ptr
            target="#ramage2009"/>; <ptr target="#blei2008"/>) have been inconclusive so far. Also,
          as can be seen from the close relations between a number of topics, hierarchical LDA (<ptr
            target="#blei2004"/>) may be able to capture existing structure among the topics
          themselves. A third, less technical but no less important challenge is the fact that it
          would still be advantageous to have larger number of texts available. 391 plays certainly
          is a substantial number, even compared to the total production of the time (see <ref
            target="#p01">section <q>Data</q></ref> above). Also, it is certainly more than a single
          researcher could read with benefit inside a limited time period. However, considering that
          the study covers a period of 150 years and three subgenres, 391 plays are actually not
          that many. For example, this effectively means there are only around 8 plays per decade
          and subgenre, on average, included in the collection (not considering the uneven
          distribution over the decades). Also, several significant subgenres had to be discarded
          from the analysis, because only a handful of examples of them are currently available in
          the <title rend="italic">Théâtre classique</title> collection. This is a challenge that
          only continued efforts in high-quality, full-text digitization in standard formats such as
          TEI, and their open-access dissemination, will alleviate. However, trying to show that
          based on such data, interesting results can be obtained for literary history, may be the
          best way to motivate continued digitization efforts. This is what this study, despite its
          specific thematic and methodological scope, has attempted to do. </p>
