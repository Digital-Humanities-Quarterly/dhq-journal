            <p>A novel, rule-based, automatic framework for identifying rhetorical elements in
               classical Arabic poetry is described. Since rule-based approaches have well-known
               limitations, it is proposed as an interim solution until a sufficient quantity of
               annotated text has been amassed with which to train a machine-learning algorithm. The
               manual process of identifying rhetorical features in classical Arabic poetry is both
               time-consuming and requires high-level expertise in Arabic literature. Hence, an
               automatic recognition system will solve this challenge. Automatic identification is,
               however, challenging, mainly because there is no existing annotated corpus with which
               to train a machine-learning-based classifier. The framework proposed here combines
               natural language-processing techniques with a rule-based reasoning approach, and will
               continually improve as more examples become available. It is intended as an initial
               step toward building the essential annotated corpus. Its focus is 20 rhetorical
               elements, all of importance according to classical Arabic rhetoricians, and it
               achieves the extremely encouraging result of an overall F-measure of 0.902.</p>

            <p>Rhetoric, <foreign xml:lang="ar">balāgha</foreign> in Arabic, is the art of
               persuasion as well as affectation through language. It is the means of conveying an
               idea in the most effective and convincing way, and with the most emotional impact
                  <ptr target="#moreau"/>. In Arabic criticism, the term <foreign xml:lang="ar"
                  >balāgha</foreign> refers both to figures of speech (such as <q>simile</q>) and
               stylistic — including embellishing — elements (such as <q>paronomasia</q>) that are
               used by critics to analyse the aesthetic value of an artistic expression; mainly in
               classical Arabic poetry and the Qurʾān <ptr target="#schaade_vongrunebaum2012"/>.</p>
            <p>Since the ninth century CE, study of rhetoric has been stimulated by an increased
               interest in understanding the structure and development of poetry as well as by the
               need to rationalise the aesthetic implications of the theological postulate of the
               uniqueness (<foreign xml:lang="ar">iʿjāz</foreign>) of the Qurʾān <ptr
                  target="#schaade_vongrunebaum2012"/>.</p>
            <p>Despite the great potential for study of rhetoric for so wide a range of research
               priorities both in and beyond itself, it remains lamentably neglected in modern
               research. Whereas there has been extensive research into Greek and mediaeval European
               rhetoric, there is nothing comparable for that of Arabic-Islamic texts, despite their
               high level of sophistication and their derivation from a major world civilisation.
               Among many factors which may explain this is the very large number of the rhetorical
               elements. In late rhetorical anthologies from the seventeenth-eighteenth century CE,
               their number is about one hundred and eighty. Identifying these elements in the
               thousands of classical Arabic poems that have been preserved from the pre-Islamic to
               the later Islamic periods, is a hard, if not impossible, mission. Tracing the
               development of rhetoric in this poetry is one way of understanding its development
               through ages. This is done by analysing their use in different poems during different
               periods, which is a lengthy and demanding undertaking far beyond a scope of a single
               study or researcher.</p>
            <p>In order to make this feasible, our Arabic Rhetoric Identifier (known as the REI) had
               to be developed.<note>
                  <ref target="https://arabic-rhetoric.haifa.ac.il/#/aboutApp.html"
                     >https://arabic-rhetoric.haifa.ac.il/</ref>
               </note> The REI was created by a team led by A. Hussein and T. Kuflik. Its purpose is
               to enable researchers to annotate manually the rhetorical elements in Arabic poetry,
               and compile them into a database of rhetorical elements in classical Arabic poetry
               between the 5th and 16th centuries CE. The canon comprises 26,925 classical Arabic
               poems, only 75 of which have, to date, been manually analysed. The main challenges to
               researchers are the time-consuming nature of manual annotation and the high level of
               expertise required to identify and comprehend the properties of each element [see,
               for example, the elements in 7, 19, 20]. While automating this process is thus very
               necessary, it is also extremely challenging.</p>
            <p>While there are many modern studies of rhetorical usage in non-Arabic literatures,
               there is a lacuna in the modern era in Arabic literature (see, for example, Western
               literature’s rich bibliography in comparison with its scarce listing for metaphor and
               metonymy in the <title rend="italic">Bibliography of Metaphor and Metonymy</title>
               <note>
                  <ref target="https://benjamins.com/online/met/"
                     >https://benjamins.com/online/met/</ref>
               </note>). Scholars of classical Arabic poetry agree that the differing use of
               rhetoric is the main reason for the development of Arabic poetry in its different
               periods [16; cf. chapters 1, 2]. <foreign xml:lang="ar">Badīʿ</foreign> — literally
                  <term>the new style</term> (or the novel, original, extraordinary style) — was the
               term used by Arabic rhetoricians to describe the sophisticated use of some rhetorical
               elements in this poetry, a use which renders the literary text differently
               sophisticated and differently aesthetic. In short, scholars agree that rhetoric was
               used in pre- and early Islamic poetry (5th-8th centuries CE), although it was
               considered more important in the ʿAbbāsid era (750–1517 CE). The <foreign
                  xml:lang="ar">badīʿ</foreign> is the major element which distinguishes ʿAbbāsid
               from pre-ʿAbbāsid poetry — although which figurative speeches in <foreign
                  xml:lang="ar">badīʿ</foreign> style and how they were used to make this difference
               remains unresolved.</p>
            <p>Despite the importance of <foreign xml:lang="ar">badīʿ</foreign>, studies which
               discuss it are few and incomplete (<ptr target="#habash_rambow_roth2009"/>, cf. pp.
               28-41): <list type="ordered">
                  <item>Most discuss <foreign xml:lang="ar">badīʿ</foreign> in separate and randomly
                     chosen verses rather than in complete poems. Considering this style in complete
                     poems gives a far more accurate picture of the nature of <foreign xml:lang="ar"
                        >badīʿ</foreign> in classical Arabic poetry.</item>
                  <item>Since the main hypothesis of modern research (and of classical scholars) is
                     that <foreign xml:lang="ar">badīʿ</foreign> is more important in
                        <emph>ʿAbbāsid</emph> than in the pre-Islamic era, modern studies focus on
                     the <foreign xml:lang="ar">badīʿ</foreign> of this poetry in the later
                     period.</item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p>As far as we know, there are no comparative studies that analyze the development of
                  <foreign xml:lang="ar">badīʿ</foreign> from one period to another, other than
               those recently conducted by one author of this article <ptr target="#hussein2015b"/>,
               and by Wolfhart Heinrichs in 1994 <ptr target="#heinrichs1994"/>. Our approach is
               that the essence of <foreign xml:lang="ar">badīʿ</foreign> in classical Arabic
               periods, especially in ʿAbbāsid and pre-ʿAbbāsid times, cannot be described without
               identifying and analysing the rhetorical elements in complete poems. There are some
               180 rhetorical elements described in classical books on rhetoric <ptr
                  target="#cachia1998"/>. The number of classical Arabic poems, from the pre-Islamic
               era until the most recent pre-modern period, is enormous, making manual rhetorical
               analysis for the entire corpus a mission impossible. For this reason, Hussein and
               Kuflik began developing a system that will automatically analyse several rhetorical
               elements in an existing corpus of some 26,000 poems<note>
                  <ref target="https://arabic-rhetoric.haifa.ac.il/"
                     >https://arabic-rhetoric.haifa.ac.il/</ref>
               </note> (in development so access is currently restricted). This corpus includes
               poetry from pre-Islamic times to the Mamluk era, which ended early 16th century. All
               the poems were entered manually into the system by students of Arabic language and
               literature, according to printed versions of the poems. This article reports on the
               automatic analysis of 20 rhetorical elements. A manual analysis by A. Hussein of
               several poems in the present corpus showed these to be the main, recurrent rhetorical
               elements in the pre- and early Islamic period, including the ʿAbbāsid poetry in its
               first four centuries (that is, until the twelfth century CE). In addition, most of
               these elements (nos. 1, 2.3, 3.3, 10, 12, 14, 16, 17, 18, 19-20) are discussed in the
               first and oldest books on Arabic rhetoric, while the others (the rest of the 180
               elements) appear only as later developments and feature in later rhetoric books.
               These were the two reasons for focusing on these elements in the present study. </p>
            <p>The classical automation approach uses text-mining and machine-learning techniques to
               identify rhetorical elements in the text. This approach requires collecting a large
               set of examples for each rhetorical element, and training a machine-learning-based
               classifier to recognize them. As we did not have an annotated set of examples, our
               first task was finding a way for assembling a sufficient number of analyzed poems to
               train a classifier. Our proposal aims at automating this step by proposing a
               framework to identify individual rhetorical elements in classical Arabic poetry by
               combining natural language processing (NLP) techniques with a rule-based approach.
               This framework has been evaluated on a small set of Arabic poems, and results have
               been extremely encouraging.</p>
            <p>The development of this automatic framework will make a vital contribution to the
               study of rhetoric in classical Arabic poetry. It will enable automatic recognition of
               the 20 selected rhetorical elements in a vastly larger corpus (26,925 poems) that
               cannot be handled manually. Analyzing the rhetoric in a corpus of this size will
               yield better understanding of the development of rhetoric in Arabic poetry from the
               pre-Islamic period to the 16th century CE.</p>
            <p>It is nonetheless important to note that rule-based systems have their own
               limitations <ptr target="#hayesroth1985"/>, including the need for continuous
               maintenance and updating by experts – as demonstrated by this research. This is why
               we see it as an interim approach until sufficient sets of examples are available for
               training state-of-the-art machine learning algorithms for the task.</p>
            <p>Another challenge is the imprecise nature of such systems. Not only do they tend to
               misclassify examples, they also miss relevant elements (false negatives) and suggest
               wrong elements (false positives). Even the current framework, which achieved,
               overall, extremely encouraging results, had widely differing success rates for
               different elements. There is more work to do to ensure a success rate closer to
               100%.</p>
            <p>This paper is structured as follows. Section 2, which follows this introductory
               section, gives background and reviews related work. Section 3 describes the features
               of classical Arabic poems. Our framework is delineated in Section 4, together with
               the NLP tools and resources used in its implementation. The dataset, experiments and
               results are described in Section 5, and Section 6 discusses the study’s implications
               and limitations. Conclusions and future work are considered in Section 7.</p>

            <head>2. Background and Related Work</head>
            <p>Over the years, considerable research efforts have been invested in developing
               methods and tools for NLP of Arabic. NLP of Arabic poetry, and, especially,
               identifying characteristics in this poetry, remain challenging.</p>
            <p>Previous studies have focused on a range of aspects — morphology, morphological
               decomposition, morpho-syntactic analysis, sentiment analysis, semantic analysis and
               many others. One main research avenue is morphological analysis of Arabic texts, for
               which several tools exist. Among them are AlKhalil Morpho Sys 2 <ptr
                  target="#boudchicheetal2017"/>, MADA <ptr target="#diehletal2009"/>, MADA+TOKAN
                  <ptr target="#habash_rambow_roth2009"/>, MADAMIRA <ptr target="#pashaetal2014"/>,
               ASMA <ptr target="#abdulmageed_diab_kubler2013"/>, MAGEAD <ptr
                  target="#habash_rambow2006"/>, BAMA <ptr target="#buckwalter2002b"/>, SAMA <ptr
                  target="#maamourietal2010"/>, SALMA <ptr target="#sawalha_atwell_abushariah2013"
               />, Arabic Sentence-level <ptr target="#shoukry2013"/> and ArSenL <ptr
                  target="#badaroetal2014"/>.</p>
            <p>Of these, AlKhalil2 <ptr target="#boudchicheetal2017"/> is the most recent and seems
               to be the best. It is an Arabic morpho-syntactic analyzer with a large database,
               which it uses to segment and then analyze partially or totally vocalized Arabic
               words. For each, the resulting analysis is derived as a set of features — prefix,
               stem, type, pattern of word, root, part of speech (POS), lemma, pattern of lemma and
               suffix. It outperforms BAMA and SAMA, achieving coverage of over 99%, as well as
               performing better in identifying various features, including those determined in the
               word context: the lemma, the stem and the diacritized form. This, therefore, was the
               tool used in our study.</p>
            <p>ArSenL <ptr target="#badaroetal2014"/> is a large sentiment lexicon for Arabic, which
               uses different approaches linked to the English SentiWordnet (ESWN). It has 154,396
               entries, each referring to a single Arabic word, and each consisting of eight fields
               — Arabic morphologic lemma (1), POS (2), positive sentiment score (3), negative
               sentiment score (4), confidence (5), Arabic WordNet (AWN) offset (6), sentiment
               WordNet offset (7), and AWN lemma (8). An example is: <dhq:example>
                  <head>Two entries in ArSenL. NIL = not in language</head>
                  <eg lang="code-general">&lt;imobiyriyAliy~_1; a;0;0.125;50; NIL;02746897; NIL
                     zrAEap_1; n;0;0;100;100861982;00916464; ziraAoEap_n1AR</eg>
               </dhq:example> Given its large lexicon, it was selected for our study.</p>
            <p>Another tool that we used was the Arabic WordNet (AWN) (<ptr
                  target="#fellbaum_alkhalifa2006"/>, <ptr target="#elkatebetal2006"/>, <ptr
                  target="#habash_rambow_roth2009"/>) based on WordNet <ptr target="#miller1995"/>,
               which are, respectively, lexical resources in standard Arabic and English. The Arabic
               WordNet is a large lexical database, comprising nouns, verbs, adjectives and adverbs,
               grouped in sets of cognitive synonyms, each expressing a distinct concept <ptr
                  target="#elkatebetal2006"/>.</p>
            <p>Hussein conducted pioneering manual studies to learn the use of rhetorical elements
               in classical Arabic poetry. These studies are few in number and deal with a very
               small corpus. In <ptr target="#hussein2018"/>, he focuses on the use of a single
               rhetorical figure, the <q>intellectual trope</q> or <foreign xml:lang="ar">majāz
                  ῾aqlī</foreign> (an important rhetorical element neglected in modern research) in
               one pre-Islamic wine poem. He explains in detail the idea of the <foreign
                  xml:lang="ar">majāz ῾aqlī</foreign>, and discusses its semantic aspects in
               classical Arabic poetry, as shown in an incident concerning wine in a poem composed
               by Abū Dhu᾿ayb al-Hudhalī (d. ca. 648 CE). In another study <ptr
                  target="#hussein2015a"/>, he examines other rhetorical techniques and their use by
               Hudhalī poets in describing the element of wine. He suggests that rhetorical elements
               should be studied in as many classical Arabic poetry themes as possible. He also
               investigated <ptr target="#hussein2015b"/> rhetorical texture in two traditional
               tripartite poems — one dating from the pre-Islamic period, composed by ʿAlqama l-Faḥl
               (d. ca. 603 CE), the other from the early ʿAbbāsid era, composed by Bashshār b. Burd
               (d. 784 CE). The two have the same structure, address the same themes and comprise
               virtually the same number of verses. A key question concerns the rhetorical figures
               each poet uses, which leads to a broader question: How different was the <foreign
                  xml:lang="ar">badīʿ</foreign> (<q>rhetorical</q>) style in the poetry of the two
               eras, assuming that each poem is representative of its time?</p>
            <p>Abuata and Al-Omari <ptr target="#abuata_alomari2018"/> adopt the same rule-based
               approach as us for computerized analysis of Arabic prosody. They introduce an
               algorithm to determine the correct metre for a given Arabic poem and to convert the
               poem into metric writing.</p>
            <p>A new way of recognizing the characteristics of classical Arabic poetry is presented
               by <ptr target="#ahmed_trausanmatu2017"/>. The authors focus on rhythm, which is
               considered the crown of this type of poetry. A stylistic study of Arab-American
               poetry <ptr target="#pashaetal2014"/> attempts to analyze and describe the major
               features of this poetry, written by prominent Arab poets who immigrated to America
               during the 19th century. It examines their poetry according to linguistics, grammar,
               lexicon and rhetoric <ptr target="#abushihab2020"/>.</p>
            <p>A study of NLP for Arabic metaphors in <ptr target="#alkhatib_shaalan2017"/> presents
               the challenges central to developing a computational NLP-based system for classical
               Arabic, Modern Standard Arabic and Dialect Arabic. It also highlights the main
               problems of translating Arabic metaphors into other languages.</p>
            <p>This article proposes a method for supporting the study of rhetoric in Arabic
               literature. It demonstrates and evaluates an automatic rule-based framework for
               recognizing its 20 most important rhetorical elements, previously identified by
               experts in a time-consuming process. As we have seen, a wide variety of tools enables
               analysis of Arabic texts, and has paved the way for the present study — the first to
               examine automatic identification of rhetorical elements in classical Arabic
               poetry.</p>

            <head>3. Features of classical Arabic Poems</head>
            <p>Style is very much more salient than content in the historical development of the
               Arabic literary register, especially in classical Arabic poetry, where rhetoric is a
               primary feature. The development of rhetoric in literary texts, however, is
               significantly under-researched. Study of rhetoric and its development in practice are
               important not only for literary and critical studies, but also have considerable
               implications for our understanding of other fields of knowledge. The dense use of
               periphrasis in poems in one period, for example, followed by its relative
               displacement by simile in the next and by metaphor in the one after that may indicate
               and/or reflect cognitive-linguistic changes in Arab communities over time <ptr
                  target="#Husseinnd"/>.</p>
            <p>Classical Arabic poetry is built of consecutive verses (lines in a poem), with each
               verse divided into two parts (hemistiches), the so-called <foreign xml:lang="ar">ṣadr
                  -صدر</foreign> and <foreign xml:lang="ar">ʿajuz-عجز</foreign>, respectively. This
               is an example of a <hi rend="bold">verse</hi>:</p>
            <dhq:example>
               <head>A classical Arabic verse</head>

                  <p xml:lang="ar">ولا عيب فيهم غير أن سيوفهم - بهن فلول من قراع الكتائب</p>
                  <p>There is no fault in them, excepting that their swords<lb/> have suffered dents

               </quote>
            </dhq:example>
            <p>Of the 180 rhetorical elements in Arabic poetry <ptr target="#cachia1998"/>, we focus
               on the 20 most frequently used. In the following, we bring brief definitions,
               sometimes with simple examples. Detailed definitions, including detailed examples,
               are found in the Appendix (9.1):</p>

            <p>For the purpose of the study, a dataset of annotated poems was built. A set of 20
               rhetorical elements was selected and the poems were annotated accordingly. The
               individual properties of each rhetorical element must be understood to create an
               automatic process that will recognize them. This identification requires different
               kinds of resources and techniques. Some features can be detected by applying
               one-to-one string-matching procedures, others by using Arabic morpho-syntactic
               analysis to tease out the <q>ingredients</q> of each word (e.g., root, stem), others
               still with sentimental analysis, which requires resources such as sentiment lexicons. </p>
            <p>Working with only a small number of annotated poems, we were unable to use any
               classical machine-learning technique to identify these elements automatically, so our
               approach was rule-based.</p>
            <p>A prototype of a rule-based system was built for automatic identification of these

                  comprising 26,925 poems by 675 different poets. It includes pre-Islamic poetry,
                  written before 622 CE; work by poets who lived in the pre-Islamic and early
                  Islamic periods, known as <foreign xml:lang="ar">mukhaḍrams</foreign>; that of
                  poets who lived in the Umayyad era (661-750 CE); and of Abbasid poets who lived
                  after 750 CE. For the purpose of this study, 75 poems, composed according to the
                  classical Arabic meters called the Khalīlian meters, and comprising an average 27
                  verses each, were collected and manually analyzed to identify their rhetorical
                  elements. The poems were chosen to cover two main periods: the Abbasid (between
                  the 8th and 10th centuries CE) and pre-Abbasid eras (poets who lived between the
                  6th and 8th centuries CE). The poems of the first period are often shorter than
                  those of the second, and therefore their number is greater: 48 poems in comparison
                  with 29 from the first era (five pre-Islamic poems, seven poems which were
                  composed by poets who lived in pre-Islamic times, but whose lifetimes extended
                  into the early Islamic [<foreign xml:lang="ar">mukhaḍrams</foreign> poets], and 17
                  poems from the Umayyad era). The number of verses in the poems in the two main
                  eras is, however, to some degree balanced. It comprises 887 verses from the
                  Abbasid period and 752 from the pre-Abbassid (140 pre-Islamic verses, 232 <foreign
                     xml:lang="ar">mukhaḍrams</foreign>, and 380 Umayyad).</p>
               <p>From these poems, 20 different rhetorical elements were selected and manually
                  annotated. (See Appendix 9.3 for the exact number of examples in each
                  dataset.)</p>

                     because it is a morpho-syntactic analyzer of standard Arabic words out of

                     used their morphological features, including prefix, stem and type of word, all
                     of which are very useful in identifying most of the rhetorical elements. It is
                     important to note, however, that AlKhalil2 was designed for modern Arabic
                     whereas the classical Arabic poetry with which we worked differs from modern
                     Arabic. As a first step, we report on evaluating it on our corpus and then
                     discuss its implications.</item>

                     section — positive sentiment score (3), negative sentiment score (4) and AWN
                     lemma (8). When the AWN lemma includes NIL (i.e., not in language), we

                     of each word, which is the sum of the fields of positive and negative sentiment

                        <item>Step 1 was building a lexicon of sentiment words. It comprised two

                           negative. In addition, we manually created a text file of negative
                           words.</item>
                        <item>Step 2 was building an Arabic Sentiment Analyzer based on polarity.
                           Text verses were inputted, each verse devoted to one word in all its
                           possible forms. (All words in each verse appear without diacritics
                           because the lexicon includes words without diacritics.) The analyzer
                           checks each word in the verses. Should it appear in one of the lexicons,
                           its polarity value is set according to that lexicon. If, however, there
                           is a negation particle before the word (in Arabic, they are mainly
                              <foreign xml:lang="ar">بلى, ليس, لكن,لم، لا، لن</foreign>), its
                           polarity is assigned the opposite value of the lexicon. The analyzer then
                           calculates the final sentiment of the input: if the number of positive
                           words is greater than that of negative words, the analyzer returns a
                           value of 1; if negative words comprise the greater number, it returns -1;
                           where they are equal, it returns 0 (i.e., neutral). This serves to
                           identify the Satirist’s and Encomiast’s Feints (see Figure 6).</item>

               <head>iii. Rhetoric Elements Identification Framework and Prototype</head>
               <p>We created a user-friendly system that integrates the NLP tools described above
                  with a rule-based elements identification mechanism for automatic identification
                  of rhetorical elements. The GUI and the algorithms are from NetBeans IDE 8.0.1
                  using Java platform JDK 1.8. The source codes of the first six tools were also
                  implemented in Java. Figure 1 presents the abstract process of rhetorical element
                  identification on a complete poem, line by line, while Figures 1 &amp; 5 show the
                  process of identifying a rhetorical element. Figure 1 shows the overall abstract
                  process of line by line analysis while Figure 5 shows an example of identifying
                  one specific rhetorical element – <q>Simile</q> (as there are different
                  implementations for different rules).</p>

               <head>iv. Identifying Rhetorical Elements (Rules)</head>
               <p>The individual properties of each rhetorical element must be understood to create
                  an automatic process capable of recognizing them. This identification requires
                  different kinds of resources and techniques. Some features can be detected by
                  applying one-to-one string-matching procedures, others by using Arabic
                  morpho-syntactic analysis to tease out the <q>ingredients</q> of each word (e.g.,
                  root, stem), others still with sentimental analysis, which requires resources such
                  as sentiment lexicons. Next, we describe the rules we applied to identifying each
                  rhetorical element, how we applied them, and the tools we used. <list
                     type="simple">
                     <item>1. <title rend="italic">Simile</title> (<foreign xml:lang="ar"
                           >تشبيه</foreign>). This can appear with and without word tokens. The
                        latter is not included in our system. This rhetorical element is identified
                        in two steps. The first identifies it by full word tokens in one of four
                        groups (see also <ref target="#figure05">Figure 5</ref>): <list
                           type="simple">
                           <item>1.1. Words starting with the tokens <foreign xml:lang="ar">مثل,
                                 فمثل, ومثل ,كالـ</foreign> for which the system searches.</item>
                           <item>1.2. Words starting with the simile tokens <foreign xml:lang="ar"
                                 >كأن, فكأن ,وكأن</foreign>. Each word is analyzed using the
                              AlKhalil2 <ptr target="#boudchicheetal2017"/> tool. If the type of the
                              word is a <foreign xml:lang="ar">حرف مشبّه بالفعل</foreign> (particle
                              that resembles the verb; a group of particles including <foreign
                                 xml:lang="ar">إن – أن / كأن – لكن / ليت – لعل</foreign>) and the
                              word is one of the three tokens mentioned above, it is considered a
                              simile.</item>
                           <item>1.3. All word tokens <foreign xml:lang="ar">كما, كأنما, وكما, فكما,
                                 وكأنما فكأنما</foreign>. The system searches for whole tokens. For
                              each, vocalization (<foreign xml:lang="ar">تشكيل</foreign>) is
                              removed, and it is then checked as to whether it is equal to one of
                              the tokens. Where a match is found, it is a simile.</item>
                           <item>1.4. Verb tokens <foreign xml:lang="ar">ظن, خال, حسب, شبه</foreign>
                              are analyzed using the AlKhalil2 <ptr target="#boudchicheetal2017"/>
                              tool to retrieve type and root. If its type is a verb and its root is
                              equal to one of the tokens, it is a simile.</item>
                        </list> The second step is identifying similes by the letter k- <foreign
                           xml:lang="ar">كـ</foreign>. Each word is analyzed using AlKhalil2 <ptr
                           target="#boudchicheetal2017"/> to check whether it is a prefix. If the
                        prefix is equal to <foreign xml:lang="ar">كَ: حرف التشبيه</foreign>, it is a
                        Simile. </item>
                     <item>2. <title rend="italic">Repetition 1-4</title> (<foreign xml:lang="ar"
                           >تكرار</foreign>). These rhetorical elements are identified by two tests.
                        The first is when two identical words appear in the same verse. This is
                        Repetition. The second is finding the same stem in more than one word, with
                        different predefined prefixes. We exclude words of the following types: {
                           <foreign xml:lang="ar">حرف جر</foreign>- preposition, <foreign
                           xml:lang="ar">حرف نداء</foreign> – interjections, <foreign xml:lang="ar"
                           >حرف عطف</foreign> – copulative particle, and particles that indicate
                           <foreign xml:lang="ar">حرف نصب</foreign> – accusative, <foreign
                           xml:lang="ar">حرف نفي</foreign> – negation, <foreign xml:lang="ar">حرف
                           جزاء</foreign> – compensation, <foreign xml:lang="ar">حرف عطف</foreign> –
                        disjunctive, and <foreign xml:lang="ar">حرف جزم</foreign> – apocopative,
                           <foreign xml:lang="ar">أداة شرط</foreign> - conditional particle}. Such
                        particles are frequently repeated in poetry and are not, therefore,
                        considered part of the text’s rhetorical texture. To exclude these words, we
                        analyze every word in the verse using AlKhalil2 <ptr
                           target="#boudchicheetal2017"/> to determine its type. Where the type
                        matches one of those mentioned above, the word is excluded. These tests also
                        eliminate words used in the <q>flowing</q>
                        <q>rhetorical element no. 6</q> identifications. To identify
                        Repetition1-4-type (see Appendix 1) rhetorical elements, contextual
                        association is also needed — for example, Semblance (<foreign xml:lang="ar"
                           >مشاكله</foreign>). At this point, however, it is sufficient to recognise
                        repetition of the same word without reference to context.</item>

            <head>5. Experiments and Results</head>
            <p>This section first describes the study that evaluated the suitability of AlKhalil2
               for our task, and then the datasets, the process of defining the rules and testing
               the framework. <ref target="#figure08">Figure 8</ref> illustrates the evaluation
               process.</p>
            <div>
               <head>i. Dataset</head>
               <p>As noted, we used a dataset comprising 75 classical era Arabic poems, composed by
                  35 poets (see Appendix 2 for the names and numbers of poems).</p>
               <p>We divided these poems into two datasets: a training set (77%) and a test set
                  (23%) (Appendix 2 shows details of poems and rhetorical elements in each). All
                  were then manually annotated by an Arabic literature researcher. Each poem
                  consists of several verses that include different rhetorical elements (see
                  Appendix 4). It is important to note that we used only the training set for
                  developing the rules for identifying the different rhetorical elements, while the
                  test set was used to test the system. The experimental results described later
                  refer to the automatic analysis of examples that were set aside and not used for
                  training (development of rules).</p>
               <p>The datasets are small because of the intensive manual effort required in
                  annotation. There is, thus, only a modest number of manually tagged poems, each
                  containing a modest number of rhetorical elements. Rules for identifying elements,
                  which were not found in any of the poems (see Appendix 9.4), were defined by
                  creating a second dataset of verses from poems in which they are featured (<ptr
                     target="#habash_rambow2006"/>, <ptr target="#ahmed_trausanmatu2017"/>, <ptr
                     target="#diehletal2009"/>). <figure xml:id="figure08">

               <head>ii. Procedure</head>
               <p>The procedure (Figure 8) was: (1) defining identification rules by studying the
                  training set; (2) testing the system on the training set to debug, correct,
                  improve and refine the rules, repeating the process until results could not be
                  improved further; (3) finally, we applied the resulting rule-based system to the
                  test set, that had been set aside and not used for training, and measured the
                  results with precision, recall and F1 measures <ptr target="#sasaki2007"/>.</p>

            <div>
               <head>iii. Evaluating AlKhalil2</head>
               <p>Given the potential language differences, we first evaluated the suitability of
                  AlKhalil2 as an NLP tool.</p>
               <p>We thus selected eight poems from our 75 poems by different poets, regions and
                  times, used AlKhalil2 to analyze them, and checked the results manually. Overall,
                  the results were good, but far from perfect (Table 1 presents the results).</p>
               <p>Overall, AlKhalil2 correctly analyzed 74.2% of the words. It did not analyze 25.8%
                  or analyzed them wrongly. The majority of the unanalyzed/wrongly analyzed words
                  are either proper names (places, plants, tribes or given names) unknown to the
                  system, or words which are incompletely or improperly vocalized. By improperly we
                  mean one of four possibilities: (1) a consonant of the given word has no
                  diacritics (i.e,, is not vocalized); (2) the <q>Sun</q> letters (<foreign
                     xml:lang="ar">t, th, d, dh, r, z, s, sh, ṣ, ḍ, ṭ, ẓ, n</foreign>), that follow
                  the definite article <foreign xml:lang="ar">al-</foreign>, are not vocalised with
                  the <foreign xml:lang="ar">shedda</foreign> mark (indicating that a consonant is
                  duplicated); (3) the <foreign xml:lang="ar">tanwīn al-fatḥ</foreign> is typed over
                  the vowel <foreign xml:lang="ar">ā</foreign> instead of over the preceding
                  consonant (such as <foreign xml:lang="ar"> كتاباً </foreign> instead of <foreign
                     xml:lang="ar">كتابًا</foreign> meaning <q>a book</q> in the accusative form);
                  both ways of putting the <foreign xml:lang="ar">tanwīn</foreign> are possible in
                  Arabic, however, in AlKhalil2 the second way is preferred); (4) the rhyming
                  letter, in the accusative form, is often suffixed to the <foreign xml:lang="ar"
                     >ā</foreign> vowel, which is a prolongation of the <foreign xml:lang="ar"
                     >fatḥa</foreign> (such as <foreign xml:lang="ar">akala</foreign> is written a
                     <foreign xml:lang="ar">akalā</foreign>; the verb means <q>to eat</q>).</p>

               <p>AlKhalil2 wrongly identifies this <foreign xml:lang="ar">ā</foreign> as the dual
                  pronoun <foreign xml:lang="ar">ā</foreign>. In addition, in poetry, because of
                  metric considerations, sometimes the masculine <foreign xml:lang="ar">y</foreign>
                  and feminine <foreign xml:lang="ar">t</foreign> prefixes, from the imperfect verb
                  in the two forms <foreign xml:lang="ar">tafaʿʿala</foreign> and <foreign
                     xml:lang="ar">tafāʿala</foreign> (known as forms 5 and 6), are omitted (i.e.,
                     <foreign xml:lang="ar">yatafaʿʿal</foreign> and <foreign xml:lang="ar"
                     >tatafaʿʿal</foreign> can become <foreign xml:lang="ar">tafaʿʿal</foreign>;

                     >tatafāʿal</foreign> becomes <foreign xml:lang="ar">tafāʿal</foreign>). In
                  these cases, AlKhalil fails to analyse the verb. Most can be addressed by a manual
                  revocalisation or retyping. In any case, while the percentages 25.8 and 8.4 make
                  AlKhalil2 less than perfect, its results were currently good enough for us
                  (especially since it was the best tool we had).</p>

               <p>The overall results were quite good: overall precision of 0.918, recall of 0. 902
                  and F measure of 0.906. They are presented in <ref target="#table02">Table
                  2</ref>. The results differ greatly, with extremely successful identification of
                  most of the elements, but relatively lower success levels in identifying Negative
                  Antithesis, Positive Antithesis and the Satirist’s and Encomiast’s Feints. These
                  differences are further discussed later.</p>
               <p>We measured the success rate in identifying each rhetorical element separately,
                  other than for Repetition1, Repetition2, the Satirist’s Feint and the Encomiast’s
                  Feint (the results are presented in <ref target="#table02">Table 2</ref>).
                  Elements 2.1, 2.2, and 2.3 (Repetition1) were treated as a single element since
                  their classification is based on the same general rule with only minor differences
                  — in 2.1, the word is repeated in the same context; in 2.2, two words with the
                  same meaning are repeated in two different contexts; 2.3 resembles 2.2 but the
                  meaning of the repeated words differs.</p>

                  the Encomiast’s Feint ) are treated as one, since they follow the same rules other

            <p>Our results demonstrate that the system performs extremely well for most rhetorical
               elements — Repetition4, Flowing, Afterthought/Retraction, Catchword Verbal,
               Distribution Characters/Alliteration, Hemming, Unraveling and Repartee (<ref
                  target="#table02">Table 2</ref>). This can be explained by the fact that
               identifying these elements requires checking the words and their occurrences without
               analysis or consideration of context. This means that identification of these
               rhetorical element is not conditioned by recognition of the context in which they
               appear, so the system does not need to understand the meaning of the verse to decide
               whether these elements are present. For example, opening a verse with the same word
               in which the previous one ended (the rhetorical element known as the Catchword
               Verbal) can be noted without understanding the content of the verses in which they
               appear.</p>
            <p>Other rhetorical elements proved more challenging with errors in their
               identification. We conducted error analysis for each, and suggest possible solutions
               to improve results. This remains for future study.</p>
            <p>While the framework’s identification of Simile and Repetition2 is high (precision =
               0.916; recall = 0.925; F1= 0.913), we assume that the second test in Simile
               identification (that is, by the prefix <foreign xml:lang="ar">ka-</foreign> which is
               the particle of simile meaning <q>like</q>. The word after it is in the genitive) can
               be upgraded by considering context. Using the AlKhalil2, we encountered situations
               where a word could be segmented into multiple forms — one of the forms with the
               simile particle <foreign xml:lang="ar">ka-</foreign>, and the other with the <foreign
                  xml:lang="ar">ka-</foreign> as part of the word. The word <foreign xml:lang="ar"
                  >كواعب</foreign>, for example, can be analysed in multiple forms, one of them with
               the simile <foreign xml:lang="ar">ka-: ka-wāʿib</foreign>; i.e., <q>similar to a
                  person who takes everything</q>), but considering the context of the verse (which
               describes women), the word should not be understood as a simile; the <foreign
                  xml:lang="ar">k</foreign> is part of the word <foreign xml:lang="ar"
                  >kawāʾib</foreign> (pl. of <foreign xml:lang="ar">kāʿib</foreign>) which means
                  <q>girls with swelling breasts</q>. Moreover, identification of Counterchange,
               Rhyming and Paronomasia can be improved when we have sufficient poems containing
               them, allowing definition of appropriate rules. The current set is drawn from the
               scarce appearances of these rhetorical elements in the training set.</p>
            <p>Identification of Repetition1 and Repetition3 is very good but can be further
               improved by considering context. Because the false negative rate for Repetition1 is
               high, we must add an option for removing them. Negative Antithesis identification,
               too, can be bettered by adding negation words, with further study needed to resolve
               situations where a word appears between the negation word and that which is repeated
               — for example, in poem <title rend="italic">Al-Najāshī</title> 62:</p>
            <dhq:example>
               <head>A passage from <title rend="italic">Al-Najāshī</title> 62</head>
               <quote rend="block">
                  <p>وَمَا زَالَ مِنْ هَمْدَانَ خَيْلٌ تَدُوسُهُمْ *** سِمَانٌ وَأُخْرَى غَيْرُ جِدّ

            </dhq:example>
            <p>Identifying the Satirist’s and Encomiast’s Feints was less successful for several
               reasons: (1) a word may have positive and negative polarity, which requires
               contextual analysis (that is, guessing the verse’s meaning according to its other
               content). (2) The lexicons include words retrieved from non-formal sources, such as
               Twitter, requiring creation of a richer lexicon based on formal language. (3) The
               poet sometimes boasts of negative qualities or facts, as if they are positive (e.g.,
                  <q>His sword is dripping blood in war</q> means <q>he is a warrior</q>), which
               requires consideration of context. And (4) ambiguous words can be misclassified,
               again requiring attention to context. Lowest of all in performance is identification
               of Positive Antithesis, largely because the <title rend="italic">Arabic Lexicon for
                  Antithesis</title> which we built is insufficient. Since false negatives rate high
               in this poetry, a new, richer <title rend="italic">Arabic Lexicon for
                  Antithesis</title>, based on formal language, must be created.</p>
            <p>The diacritical text in which classical poems are usually written increases the
               accuracy of text analysis, reducing, as it does, the number of possible segmentations
               for each analyzed word. When this same text is inputted into the framework without
               diacritics, results are poorer. The AlKhalil2 tool returns all possible diacritical
               options for the word.</p>
            <p>As in any study, ours has limitations, some of them indicated above. The first is its
               relatively small number of poems — 75 of the total 26,925 classical Arabic poems in
               the canon. The second is that some of these 75 are written without diacritics. And
               third is that the AlKhalil2 misses small parts — for example, the word <foreign
                  xml:lang="ar">كَتَيْسِ</foreign> in the verse:</p>
            <dhq:example>
               <head>A classical Arabic verse, read by AlKhalil2</head>
               <quote rend="block">

                     الْغَذَوَانِ</p>

                     torrent.</p>
               </quote>
            </dhq:example>
            <p>This leads to a fourth limitation and is directly related to AlKhalil2 performance on
               classical Arabic poetry that is far from its performance on modern Arabic. Adapting
               it to classical Arabic poetry is an idea for future research.</p>
            <p>Finally, the lack of a large annotated corpus forced us to apply a rule-based
               approach that is limited by the examples annotated to date, and considered by the
               developers. The rule-based approach is a well-known method that was used in early
               days of expert systems. It has numerous limitations, as it depends heavily on manual
               encoding of reasoning rules. It also applies only to instances for which rules were
               explicitly written, and thus needs ongoing maintenance <ptr target="#hayesroth1985"
               />. This is a major limitation, especially given the small dataset we used. The
               process we followed exemplifies both the benefits of the approach as well as its
               limitations (also shown in the analysis above). Still, as noted, we see this as an
               interim solution, despite our very encouraging results. There remains great diversity
               between different rhetorical elements. We continue to strive for better results that
               ensure high quality results, even even sacrificing precision (accepting false
               positives) in order to increase recall (reducing, even eliminating false negatives).
               We thus suggest its use only until a sufficiently large dataset of annotated poems is
               available for training machine-learning classifiers for the task.</p>

            <head>7. Conclusion and Future Work</head>
            <p>Identification of rhetorical elements in classical Arabic poetry is a time-consuming
               process. It requires many resources, and high-level Arabic literature experts. A new,
               automatic, rule-based mechanism for their identification is proposed in this article,
               and its use with 20 elements is demonstrated as a case study. For most, the
               framework's performance is very high.</p>
            <p>Further work is needed in several areas. One is addressing the study’s limitations,
               presented in the Discussion, and exploring the suggested solutions, such as including
               a significantly larger number of manually analyzed poems in the system. Another is
               improving the performance of the current framework by adding rules to identify missed
               elements, ignore misidentification and generally upgrade results. A third direction
               is building Arabic Sentiment Lexicons based on formal words, which will manually
               enrich the Negation Word Lexicon and include context-based analysis.</p>
            <p>This study selected 20 rhetorical elements for identification. The automatic
               identification of some of them (such as the Positive Antithesis, the Satirist’s Faint
               and the Encomiast’s Feint) can be improved by developing the existing program. There
               are others still to add — among them, Metaphor (the most challenging rhetorical
               figure), Periphrasis, Exaggeration and types of Paronomasia that we have not
               addressed — which require resources such as antonym lexicons and context-based
               analysis. One major impediment is that identifying these elements depends mainly on
               semantics: the system must be capable of recognising the semantic meaning of a
               word/expression/phrase in order to identify some of these rhetorical elements.
               Automatic identification of elements not addressed in the present research and the
               improving automatic identification of those that are, are left to future
               research.</p>
            <p>The present system may also be used for identifying and studying rhetoric in the
               modern Arabic poetry. For this, poems from the 19th-21st centuries should be added to
               Hussein and Kuflik’s existing system. Since most rhetorical elements in Arabic
               culture have equivalents in other literatures (the simile for example is also used in
               English, German, Chinese and more), the system can be adapted, modified and improved
               to identify and analyze rhetoric in non-Arabic literatures. Global use will enable
               in-depth comparisons of rhetorical fabrics across literatures and cultures.</p>
            <p>Finally, we note that the proposed approach is generic, and the same framework may be
               applied to any kind of literature. The issue is not the framework’s generality but
               the expertise, time and effort required for defining rules. We thus reiterate that
               the suggested approach may be used as an interim solution when there are insufficient
               examples of rhetoric elements to train a classical machine-learning algorithm.</p>

               <p>The definitions, most examples and verse translations (sometimes with
                  modifications) are taken mainly from Cachia <ptr target="#cachia1998"/>. It is, to
                  the best of our knowledge, the only existing bi-lingual dictionary for Arabic
                  rhetoric. As the author indicates in the introduction to the book’s
                  English-language edition, each rhetorical element has been given an English name
                  although in some cases the Arabic element cannot be translated (p. 3). Where there
                  is an identical or very similar rhetorical element in English, the English term is
                  adopted. Where there is no or only partial equivalence, the term is translated by
                  Cachia to reflect the meaning of the Arabic. The explanations of the terms clarify
                  what it is intended by them.</p>

                           different orders. An example from Shams al-Dīn Muḥammad al-Bakrī (d.1060
                           C.E.): <quote rend="block">

                           dots (which, in Arabic script, differentiate many letters from one

                     Arabic literature produces two main kinds of antithesis — positive and
                     negative. Our focus was the negative, which is considered a type of Repetition,
                     with the opposite word preceded by a negation article {<foreign xml:lang="ar"
                        >لا, ما, لم, لن, ليس, لات, غير</foreign>}. This example is from the poem by
                     al-Buḥturī (d. 898 C.E.) between the phrases <term>knowing</term> and <term>not
                        knowing</term>: <quote rend="block">

                     opposites appear in the same verse. Opposites formed by negation words are not
                     positive antitheses. An example from Ibn Nubāta: <quote rend="block">
