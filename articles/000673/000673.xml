                <p>A novel, rule-based, automatic framework for identifying rhetorical elements in
                    Classical Arabic poetry is described. Since rule-based approaches have
                    well-known limitations, it is proposed as an interim solution until a sufficient
                    quantity of annotated text has been amassed with which to train a
                    machine-learning algorithm. The manual process of identifying rhetorical
                    features in Classical Arabic poetry is both time-consuming and requires
                    high-level expertise in Arabic literature. Hence, an automatic recognition
                    system will solve this challenge. Automatic identification is, however,
                    challenging, mainly because there is no existing annotated corpus with which to
                    train a machine-learning-based classifier. The framework proposed here combines
                    natural language-processing techniques with a rule-based reasoning approach, and
                    will continually improve as more examples become available. It is intended as an
                    initial step toward building the essential annotated corpus. Its focus is 20
                    rhetorical elements, all of importance according to Classical Arabic
                    rhetoricians, and it achieves the extremely encouraging result of an overall
                    F-measure of 0.902.</p>

                <head>1. Introduction</head>
                <p>Rhetoric, <foreign xml:lang="ar">balāgha</foreign> in Arabic, is the art of
                    persuasion as well as affectation through language. It is the means of conveying
                    an idea in the most effective and convincing way, and with the most emotional
                    impact [28]. In Arabic criticism, the term <foreign xml:lang="ar"
                        >balāgha</foreign> refers both to figures of speech (such as <q>simile</q>)
                    and stylistic — including embellishing — elements (such as <q>paronomasia</q>)
                    that are used by critics to analyse the aesthetic value of an artistic
                    expression, mainly in classical Arabic poetry and the Qurʾān [32].</p>
                <p>Since the ninth century CE, study of rhetoric has been stimulated by an increased
                    interest in understanding the structure and development of poetry as well as by
                    the need to rationalise the aesthetic implications of the theological postulate
                    of the uniqueness (<foreign xml:lang="ar">iʿjāz</foreign>) of the Qurʾān
                    [32].</p>
                <p>Despite the great potential for study of rhetoric for so wide a range of research
                    priorities both in and beyond itself, it remains lamentably neglected in modern
                    research. Whereas there has been extensive research into Greek and mediaeval
                    European rhetoric, there is nothing comparable for that of Arabic-Islamic texts,
                    despite their high level of sophistication and their derivation from a major
                    world civilisation. Among many factors which may explain this is the very large
                    number of the rhetorical elements. In late rhetorical anthologies from the
                    eighteenth century CE, their number is about one hundred and eighty. Identifying
                    these elements in the thousand Classical Arabic poems that have been preserved
                    from the pre-Islamic to the later Islamic periods, is a hard, if not impossible,
                    mission. Tracing the development of rhetoric in this poetry is one way of
                    understanding its development through ages. This is done by analysing their use
                    in different poems during different periods, which is a lengthy and demanding
                    undertaking far beyond a scope of a single study or researcher.</p>
                <p>In order to make this feasible, our Arabic Rhetoric Identifier (known as the REI)
                    had to be developed.<note><ref
                            target="https://arabic-rhetoric.haifa.ac.il/#/aboutApp.html"
                            >https://arabic-rhetoric.haifa.ac.il/#/aboutApp.html</ref></note> The
                    REI was created by a team led by A. Hussein and T. Kuflik. Its purpose is to
                    enable researchers to annotate manually the rhetorical elements in Arabic
                    poetry, and compile them into a database of rhetorical elements in Classical
                    Arabic poetry between the 5th and 16th centuries CE. The canon comprises 26,925
                    Classical Arabic poems, only 75 of which have, to date, been manually analysed.
                    The main challenges to researchers are the time-consuming nature of manual
                    annotation and the high level of expertise required to identify and comprehend
                    the properties of each element [see, for example, the elements in 12, 22, 23].
                    While automating this process is thus very necessary, it is also extremely
                    challenging.</p>
                <p>While there are many modern studies of rhetorical usage in non-Arabic
                    literatures, there is a lacuna in the modern era in Arabic literature (see, for
                    example, Western literature’s rich bibliography in comparison with its scarce
                    listing for metaphor and metonymy in the Bibliography of <title rend="italic"
                        >Metaphor and Metonymy</title><note><ref
                            target="https://benjamins.com/online/met/"
                            >https://benjamins.com/online/met/</ref></note>). Scholars of classical
                    Arabic poetry agree that the differing use of rhetoric is the main difference in
                    Classical Arabic poetry in its different periods [16; cf. chapters 1, 2].
                        <foreign xml:lang="ar">Badīʿ</foreign> — literally <term>the new
                        style</term> (or the novel, original, extraordinary style) — was the term
                    used by Classical Arabic rhetoricians to describe the sophisticated use of some
                    rhetorical elements in this poetry, a use which renders the literary text more
                    sophisticated and more aesthetic. In short, scholars agree that rhetoric was
                    used in pre- and early Islamic poetry (5th-8th centuries CE), although it was
                    considered more important in the ʿAbbāsid era (from the 8th century CE; their
                    poetry was defined as <foreign xml:lang="ar">muḥdath</foreign> or
                        <term>new</term> poetry). The <foreign xml:lang="ar">badīʿ</foreign> is the
                    major element which distinguishes ʿAbbāsid from pre-ʿAbbāsid poetry (or <foreign
                        xml:lang="ar">muḥdath</foreign> from pre-<foreign xml:lang="ar"
                        >muḥdath</foreign> poetry) — although which figurative speeches in <foreign
                        xml:lang="ar">badīʿ</foreign> style and how they were used to make this
                    difference remains unresolved.</p>
                <p>Despite the importance of <foreign xml:lang="ar">badīʿ</foreign>, studies which
                    discuss it are few and incomplete [17; cf. pp. 28-41]: <list type="ordered">
                        <item>Most discuss <foreign xml:lang="ar">badīʿ</foreign> in separate and
                            randomly chosen verses rather than in complete poems. Considering this
                            style in complete poems gives a far more accurate picture of the nature
                            of <foreign xml:lang="ar">badīʿ</foreign> in classical Arabic
                            poetry.</item>
                        <item>Since the main hypothesis of modern research (and of classical
                            scholars) is that <foreign xml:lang="ar">badīʿ</foreign> is more
                            important in ʿAbbāsid than in the pre-Islamic era, modern studies focus
                            on the <foreign xml:lang="ar">badīʿ</foreign> of this poetry in the
                            later period.</item>
                    </list></p>
                <p>As far as we know, there are no comparative studies that analyze the development
                    of <foreign xml:lang="ar">badīʿ</foreign> from one period to another, other than
                    those recently conducted by one author of this article [17], and by Wolfhart
                    Heinrichs in 1994 [14]. Our approach is that the essence of <foreign
                        xml:lang="ar">badīʿ</foreign> in Classical Arabic periods, especially in
                    ʿAbbāsid and pre-ʿAbbāsid times, cannot be described without identifying and
                    analysing the rhetorical elements in complete poems. There are some 180
                    rhetorical elements described in classical books on rhetoric [10]. The number of
                    Classical Arabic poems, from the pre-Islamic era until the most recent
                    pre-modern period, is enormous, making manual rhetorical analysis for the entire
                    corpus a mission impossible. For this reason, Hussein and Kuflik began
                    developing a system that will automatically analyse several rhetorical elements
                    in an existing corpus of some 26,000 poems<note><ref

                    access is currently restricted). This corpus includes poetry from pre-Islamic
                    times to the Mamluk era, which ended early 16th century. All the poems were
                    entered manually into the system by students of Arabic language and literature,
                    according to printed versions of the poems. This article reports on the
                    automatic analysis of 20 rhetorical elements. A manual analysis by A. Hussein of
                    several poems in the present corpus showed these to be the main, recurrent
                    rhetorical elements in the pre- and early Islamic period, including the ʿAbbāsid
                    poetry in its first four centuries (that is, until the tenth century CE). In
                    addition, most of these elements (nos. 1, 2.3, 3.3, 10, 12, 14, 16, 17, 18,
                    19-20) are discussed in the first and oldest books on Arabic rhetoric, while the
                    others appear only as later developments and feature in later rhetoric books.
                    These were the two reasons for focusing on these elements in the present study. </p>
                <p>The classical automation approach uses text-mining and machine-learning
                    techniques to identify rhetorical elements in the text. This approach requires
                    collecting a large set of examples for each rhetorical element, and training a
                    machine-learning-based classifier to recognize them. As we did not have an
                    annotated set of examples, our first task was finding a way for assembling a
                    sufficient number of analyzed poems to train a classifier. Our proposal aims at
                    automating this step by proposing a framework to identify individual rhetorical
                    elements in Classical Arabic poetry by combining natural language processing
                    (NLP) techniques with a rule-based approach. This framework has been evaluated
                    on a small set of Arabic poems, and results have been extremely encouraging.</p>
                <p>The development of this automatic framework will make a vital contribution to the
                    study of rhetoric in Classical Arabic poetry. It will enable automatic
                    recognition of the 20 selected rhetorical elements in a vastly larger corpus
                    (26,925 poems) than cannot be handled manually. Analyzing the rhetoric in a
                    corpus of this size will yield better understanding of the development of
                    rhetoric in Classical Arabic poetry from the pre-Islamic period to the 16th
                    century CE.</p>
                <p>It is nonetheless important to note that rule-based systems have their own
                    limitations [13], including the need for continuous maintenance and updating by
                    experts – as demonstrated by this research. This is why we see it as an interim
                    approach until sufficient sets of examples are available for training
                    state-of-the-art machine learning algorithms for the task.</p>
                <p>Another challenge is the imprecise nature of such systems. Not only do they tend
                    to misclassify examples, they also miss relevant elements (false negatives) and
                    suggest wrong elements (false positives). Even the current framework, which
                    achieved, overall, extremely encouraging results, had widely differing success
                    rates for different elements. There is more work to do to ensure a success rate
                    closer to 100%.</p>
                <p>This paper is structured as follows. Section 2, which follows this introductory
                    section, gives background and reviews related work. Section 3 describes the
                    features of Classical Arabic poems. Our framework is delineated in Section 4,
                    together with the NLP tools and resources used in its implementation. The
                    dataset, experiments and results are described in Section 5, and Section 6
                    discusses the study’s implications and limitations. Conclusions and future work
                    are considered in Section 7.</p>

                <head>2. Background and Related Work</head>
                <p>Over the years, considerable research efforts have been invested in developing
                    methods and tools for NLP of Arabic. NLP of Arabic poetry, and, especially,
                    identifying characteristics in this poetry, remain challenging.</p>
                <p>Previous studies have focused on a range of aspects — morphology, morphological
                    decomposition, morpho-syntactic analysis, sentiment analysis, semantic analysis
                    and many others. One main research avenue is morphological analysis of Arabic
                    texts, for which several tools exist. Among them are AlKhalil Morpho Sys 2 [5],
                    MADA [11], MADA+TOKAN [18], MADAMIRA [29], ASMA [30], MAGEAD [19], BAMA [6, 9],
                    SAMA [26], SALMA [30], Arabic Sentence-level [33] and ArSenL [8].</p>
                <p>Of these, AlKhalil2 [5] is the most recent and seems to be the best. It is an
                    Arabic morpho-syntactic analyzer with a large database, which it uses to segment
                    and then analyze partially or totally vocalized Arabic words. For each, the
                    resulting analysis is derived as a set of features — prefix, stem, type, pattern
                    of word, root, part of speech (POS), lemma, pattern of lemma and suffix. It
                    outperforms BAMA and SAMA, achieving coverage of over 99%, as well as performing
                    better in identifying various features, including those determined in the word
                    context: the lemma, the stem and the diacritized form. This, therefore, was the
                    tool used in our study.</p>
                <p>ArSenL [8] is a large sentiment lexicon for Arabic, which uses different
                    approaches linked to the English SentiWordnet (ESWN). It has 154,396 entries,
                    each referring to a single Arabic word, and each consisting of eight fields —
                    Arabic morphologic lemma (1), POS (2), positive sentiment score (3), negative
                    sentiment score (4), confidence (5), Arabic WordNet (AWN) offset (6), sentiment
                    WordNet offset (7), and AWN lemma (8). An example is: <dhq:example>
                        <head>Two entries in ArSenL. NIL = not in language</head>
                        <eg lang="code-general">&lt;imobiyriyAliy~_1; a;0;0.125;50; NIL;02746897;
                            NIL zrAEap_1; n;0;0;100;100861982;00916464; ziraAoEap_n1AR</eg>
                    </dhq:example> Given its large lexicon, it was selected for our study.</p>
                <p>Another tool that we used was the Arabic WordNet (AWN) [9, 18], based on WordNet
                    [27], which are, respectively, lexical resources in standard Arabic and English.
                    The Arabic WordNet is a large lexical database, comprising nouns, verbs,
                    adjectives and adverbs, grouped in sets of cognitive synonyms, each expressing a
                    distinct concept [24].</p>
                <p>Hussein [15, 16, 17] conducted pioneering manual studies to learn the use of
                    rhetorical elements in Classical Arabic poetry. These studies are few in number
                    and deal with a very small corpus. In [15], he focuses on the use of a single
                    rhetorical figure, the <q>intellectual trope</q> or <foreign xml:lang="ar">majāz
                        ῾aqlī</foreign> (an important rhetorical element neglected in modern
                    research) in one pre-Islamic wine poem. He explains in detail the idea of the
                        <foreign xml:lang="ar">majāz ῾aqlī</foreign>, and discusses its semantic
                    aspects in Classical Arabic poetry, as shown in an incident concerning wine in a
                    poem composed by Abū Dhu᾿ayb al-Hudhalī (d. ca. 648 CE). In another study [16],
                    he examines rhetorical techniques and their use by Hudhalī poets in describing
                    the element of wine. He suggests that rhetorical elements should be studied in
                    as many Classical Arabic poetry themes as possible. He also investigated [17]
                    rhetorical texture in two traditional tripartite poems — one dating from the
                    pre-Islamic period, composed by ʿAlqama l-Faḥl (d. ca. 603 CE), the other from
                    the early ʿAbbāsid era, composed by Bashshār b. Burd (d. 784 CE). The two have
                    the same structure, address the same themes and comprise virtually the same
                    number of verses. A key question concerns the rhetorical figures each poet uses,
                    which leads to a broader question: How different was the <foreign xml:lang="ar"
                        >badīʿ</foreign> (<q>rhetorical</q>) style in the poetry of the two eras,
                    assuming that each poem is representative of its time?</p>
                <p>Abuata and Al-Omari [3] adopt the same rule-based approach as us for computerized
                    analysis of Arabic prosody. They introduce an algorithm to determine the correct
                    metre for a given Arabic poem and to convert the poem into metric writing.</p>
                <p>A new way of recognizing the characteristics of Classical Arabic poetry is
                    presented by Ahmed and Trausan-Matu (2017) [36]. The authors focus on rhythm,
                    which is considered the crown of this type of poem. A stylistic study of
                    Arab-American poetry [29] attempts to analyze and describe the major features of
                    this poetry, written by prominent Arab poets who immigrated to America during
                    the 19th century. It examines their poetry according to linguistics, grammar,
                    lexicon and rhetoric [1].</p>
                <p>A study of NLP for Arabic metaphors in [25] presents the challenges central to
                    developing a computational NLP-based system for Classical Arabic, Modern
                    Standard Arabic and Dialect Arabic. It also highlights the main problems of
                    translating Arabic metaphors into other languages.</p>
                <p>This article proposes a method for supporting the study of rhetoric in Arabic
                    literature. It demonstrates and evaluates an automatic rule-based framework for
                    recognizing its 20 most important rhetorical elements, previously identified by
                    experts in a time-consuming process. As we have seen, a wide variety of tools
                    enables analysis of Arabic texts, and has paved the way for the present study —
                    the first to examine automatic identification of rhetorical elements in
                    Classical Arabic poetry.</p>

                <head>3. Features of Classical Arabic Poems</head>
                <p>Style is very much more salient than content in the historical development of the
                    Arabic literary register, especially in Classical Arabic poetry, where rhetoric
                    is a primary feature. The development of rhetoric in literary texts, however, is
                    significantly under-researched. Study of rhetoric and its development in
                    practice are important not only for literary and critical studies, but also have
                    considerable implications for our understanding of other fields of knowledge.
                    The dense use of periphrasis in poems in one period, for example, followed by
                    its relative displacement by simile in the next and by metaphor in the one after
                    that may indicate and/or reflect cognitive-linguistic changes in Arab
                    communities over time [20]. Rhetorical analysis can thus be a rich evidentiary
                    source for linguists, anthropologists, cultural scholars, psychologists,
                    sociologists and historians in their understanding of the histories of different
                    societies.</p>
                <p>Classical Arabic poetry is built of consecutive verses (lines in a poem), with
                    each verse divided into two parts (hemistiches), the so-called ṣadr -صدر and
                    ʿajuz-عجز, respectively. This is an example of a verse:</p>
                <dhq:example>
                    <head>A Classical Arabic verse</head>
                    <quote rend="inline"><p xml:lang="ar">ولا عيب فيهم غير أن سيوفهم - بهن فلول من
                            قراع الكتائب</p>
                        <p xml:lang="en">There is no fault in them, excepting that their swords have
                            suffered dents in clashes with battalions</p></quote>
                </dhq:example>
                <p>Of the 180 rhetorical elements in Arabic poetry [10], we focus on the 20 most
                    frequently used. In the following, we bring brief definitions, sometimes with
                    simple examples. Detailed definitions, including detailed examples, are found in
                    the Appendix (9.1):</p>

                <p>For the purpose of the study, a dataset of annotated poems was built. A set of 20
                    rhetorical elements was selected and the poems were annotated accordingly. The
                    individual properties of each rhetorical element must be understood to create an
                    automatic process that will recognize them. This identification requires
                    different kinds of resources and techniques. Some features can be detected by
                    applying one-to-one string-matching procedures, others by using Arabic
                    morpho-syntactic analysis to tease out the <q>ingredients</q> of each word
                    (e.g., root, stem), others still with sentimental analysis, which requires
                    resources such as sentiment lexicons. </p>
                <p>Working with only a small number of annotated poems, we were unable to use any
                    classical machine-learning technique to identify these elements automatically,

                        the purpose of this study, 75 poems, composed according to the classical
                        Arabic meters called the Khalīlian meters, and comprising an average 27 <hi

                        eras (poets who lived between the 6th and 8th centuries CE). The poems of
                        the first period are often shorter than those of the second, and therefore
                        their number is greater: 48 poems in comparison with 29 from the first era
                        (five pre-Islamic poems, seven poems which were composed by poets who lived
                        in pre-Islamic times, but whose lifetimes extended into the early Islamic
                            [<foreign xml:lang="ar">mukhaḍrams</foreign> poets], and 17 poems from

                        however, to some degree balanced. It comprises 887 verses from the Abbasid
                        period and 752 from the pre-Abbassid (140 pre-Islamic verses, 232 <foreign

                            either partially or totally vowelized words. We used their morphological
                            features, including prefix, stem and type of word, all of which are very
                            useful in identifying most of the rhetorical elements. It is important
                            to note, however, that AlKhalil2 was designed for modern Arabic whereas
                            the classical Arabic poetry with which we worked differs from modern
                            Arabic. As a first step, we report on evaluating it on our corpus and
                            then discuss its implications.</item>
                        <item><title rend="italic">ArSenL Sentiment Lexicon</title>, The ArSenL [8]
                            was selected for its large sentiment lexicon (154,396 entries). They
                            comprise the eight fields shown in our background section — positive
                            sentiment score (3), negative sentiment score (4) and AWN lemma (8).
                            When the AWN lemma includes NIL (i.e., not in language), we interpreted
                            the morphological word in the first field according to the Buckwalter
                            Arabic Morphological Analyzer [7] to retrieve the Arabic word-form.
                            Where the field AWN lemma included a valid offset (i.e., not NIL), we
                            retrieved the Arabic word from AWN [23]. The final step was calculating
                            the objective score of each word, which is the sum of the fields of
                            positive and negative sentiment scores. It should be noted that most
                            words scored neutral.</item>
                        <item><title rend="italic">Arabic WordNet</title>. We used the AWN source
                            code to retrieve Arabic words from sentiment lexicons (described
                            below).</item>

                            [7] helped build a sentiment lexicon (tool 2), because entries in ArSenL
                            [8] contain fields that include NIL. This tool was used to convert
                            Morphologic Arabic words to Arabic words (e.g., &lt;imobiyriyAliy~ to
                                <foreign xml:lang="ar">إمبيريالي</foreign>).</item>
                        <item><title rend="italic">Arabic Sentiment Lexicon</title>. We developed an
                            Arabic sentiment lexicon, comprising 8,765 positive words and 9,813
                            negative words, in three phases. The first phase involved automatically
                            retrieving Arabic words and their sentimental polarities from ArSenL
                            [8], using the Buckwalter Arabic Morphological Analyzer [7] and AWN
                            [24]. The second phase manually retrieved Arabic words and their
                            polarities from another lexicon [31], and the final phase was manually
                            enriching the lexicon with Arabic words and their polarities from the
                                    internet.<note><ref

                                <item>Step 1 was building a lexicon of sentiment words. It comprised

                                <item>Step 2 was building an Arabic Sentiment Analyzer based on
                                    polarity. Text <hi rend="bold">verses</hi> were inputted, each
                                        <hi rend="bold">verse</hi> devoted to one word in all its
                                    possible forms. (All words in each <hi rend="bold">verse</hi>
                                    appear without diacritics because the lexicon includes words
                                    without diacritics.) The analyzer checks each word in the <hi
                                        rend="bold">verses</hi>. Should it appear in one of the
                                    lexicons, its polarity value is set according to that lexicon.
                                    If, however, there is a negation particle before the word (in
                                    Arabic, they are mainly <foreign xml:lang="ar">بل, بلى, ليس,
                                        لكن, نعم. لم، لا، لن</foreign>), its polarity is assigned
                                    the opposite value of the lexicon. The analyzer then calculates
                                    the final sentiment of the input: if the number of positive
                                    words is greater than that of negative words, the analyzer
                                    returns a value of 1; if negative words comprise the greater
                                    number, it returns -1; where they are equal, it returns 0 (i.e.,
                                    neutral). This serves to identify the Satirist’s and Encomiast’s

                    <p>We created a user-friendly system that integrates the NLP tools described
                        above with a rule-based elements identification mechanism for automatic
                        identification of rhetorical elements. The GUI and the algorithms are from
                        NetBeans IDE 8.0.1 using Java platform JDK 1.8. The source codes of the
                        first six tools were also implemented in Java. Figure 1 presents the
                        abstract process of rhetorical element identification on a complete poem,
                        line by line, while Figures 1 &amp; 5 show the process of identifying a
                        rhetorical element. Figure 1 shows the overall abstract process of line by
                        line analysis while Figure 5 shows an example of identifying one specific
                        rhetorical element – <q>Simile</q> (as there are different implementations
