            <dhq:abstract>
                <p>This paper discusses findings of a global survey of nearly 600 musicologists in
                    35 countries in 2022, asking about their uses of technology during the pandemic.
                    The survey focused on participants’ frustrating and rewarding experiences,
                    risks, limitations and benefits of technology, and highlighting changes they
                    would keep after the pandemic. There was a preference for digital resources over
                    physical counter-parts, apart from where physical books were more popular than
                    e-books. Zoom and other video conferencing software were frequently mentioned in
                    both positive and negative terms, particularly around music performance and
                    fieldwork, conferences and collaborations. Access and availability of online
                    resources was positive, due to availability, and negative due to losing the
                        <q>analogue experience</q>. Methodologies had also been impacted on,
                    allowing researchers to ask new questions, while shaping and limiting these
                    questions. There was impact of technology on community-building and enhancing
                    the ability to meet across borders while limiting networking opportunities. The
                    shift to teaching online impacted on teaching music performance, and heavy
                    teaching loads were prioritised over research, highlighting the interconnected
                    roles of the musicologist researcher in teaching and learning. This research
                    contributes towards an understanding of the complex nature of the information
                    behaviour of musicologists. Insight into how musicologists‘ attitudes and
                    practices have changed and fulfil their multiple roles suggests they are moving
                    closer to the digital humanities field in their practices.</p>
            </dhq:abstract>
            <dhq:teaser>
                <p>Over 500 musicologists reported about their experiences with digital technology
                    during the COVID-19 pandemic. Main findings: a common technical skill set has
                    emerged and the digital has become an integral part of the musicological
                    discipline.</p>

                <head>1. Introduction</head>
                <p>The Covid-19 pandemic forced many people online to engage with their work, their
                    clients, friends and family during long periods of isolation in lockdowns. The
                    music sector benefits particularly from in-person encounters in teaching,
                    listening, performing and enjoyment, while music researchers are generally
                    considered to prefer engaging with physical sources such as manuscripts and
                    books in situ rather than online. <ptr target="#ros_fabregas_2020"/> Although
                    performance, music education and music listening all received notable attention
                    from researchers keen to explore the impact of the online pivot, eg <ptr
                        target="#spiro_et_al_2021"/>; <ptr target="#rossel_et_al_2021"/>; <ptr
                        target="#octaviani_2021"/>; <ptr target="#spahn_et_al_2022"/>, the impact of
                    the pandemic on musicology research is as yet relatively unexplored. </p>
                <p>In terms of the scholarly study of music, musicology research studies various
                    aspects of music: history, role in society, structure, aesthetics, perception
                    and performance <ptr target="#ams_2023"/>. This has led to a segmentation of the
                    field into a large number of specialisations, the main ones being: Historical
                    musicology and critical editing, Cultural musicology, Popular music studies,
                    Music theory, Analysis and composition, Music psychology, Sociology and
                    neuroscience, Music performance studies, Systematic musicology, Ethnomusicology,
                    Computational or digital musicology, Music libraries and Archives. This
                    segmentation acknowledges the wide role music has in society and leads to the
                    adoption of a variety of research practices and information behaviours <ptr
                        target="#inskip_et_al_2015"/>. Digital tools and resources are increasingly
                    being adopted by musicologists. Research exploring images, encoded scores, audio
                    and metadata have been supported by rapid developments in the capability of
                    technology, allowing new questions to be asked by musicologists across the
                    spectrum of specialisations. Although this increase in the use of text and data
                    mining and the availability of digital tools and resources brings musicology
                    closer to the digital humanities field, it has been suggested at times that
                    musicology is not strongly embedded in large-scale data creation efforts and
                    general methodological discussions in digital humanities <ptr
                        target="#dohl_2020"/>. Other evidence suggests however that the digital
                    elements of musicology are increasingly being recognised as being part of the
                    field of digital humanities <ptr target="#burgoyne_et_al_2016"/>.</p>
                <p>The paper explores the practices of musicologists during the pandemic, while
                    exploring the differences and commonalities with those of other humanities
                    researchers. A global online survey was designed to explore the impact of the
                    pandemic on the information behaviours of self-identifying musicologists,
                    associated scholars and facilitators such as librarians and archivists, and key
                    factors are discussed: the place of technology within musicological and adjacent
                    disciplines; and shifting to online work. The findings demonstrate that the
                    pandemic forced the community to attain a technical skill set that enabled
                    online communication in many forms and provided access to a wealth of resources,
                    which has widened horizons in terms of collaboration and networking, resources,
                    tools and research topics and methodologies.</p>

                <head>2. Literature Review</head>
                <p>As in other humanities disciplines, sources for musicologists are primarily text
                    (reviews, concert programmes, scholarly articles, popular press), image
                    (including manuscripts and music notation), audio (commercial and field
                    recordings) and video (concert recordings, promotional clips). The range of
                    sources includes digital books and journals, physical books and journals,
                    digitised archives and manuscript collections, physical archives and manuscript
                    collections, music audio on computer, phone, mobile device, music audio on tape,
                    record, CD, physical collections of music editions, digital collections of music
                    editions and online music audio collections <ptr target="#inskip_et_al_2015"/>.
                    The use of digital and physical/analogue sources varies according to the
                    speciality. Until the digital impact on accessibility of music resources,
                    researchers had to track down and visit collections of physical materials and
                    audio sources, or request copies or scans. Access to digital resources was
                    hindered by strict copyright regulations surrounding contemporary recordings in
                    particular <ptr target="#dohl_2020"/> and special issues surrounding optical
                    music recognition which have caused it to trail behind text-based and audio work
                        <ptr target="#pugin_2015"/>. Previous research has explored how
                    musicologists used technology in their research practices, finding that while
                    the participants described themselves as mostly comfortable with digital
                    resources in their research, they would benefit from ongoing support with their
                    digital information skills and from reliable and usable technology <ptr
                        target="#inskip_et_al_2015"/>. These findings seemed to align with other
                    digital humanities research of the time <ptr target="#bulger_et_al_2011"/>
                    <ptr target="#warwick_2012"/>, which demonstrated how <quote rend="inline"
                        >humanities scholars are not luddites; they simply behave differently from
                        scientists, and many social scientists when interacting with physical and
                        digital information</quote>
                    <ptr target="#warwick_2012" loc="2"/>. In the years since, it is said that the
                    field of musicology has broadened from a focused computational analytical
                    approach towards a <quote rend="inline">bigger tent</quote> similar to that
                    identified by Urberg <ptr target="#urberg_2017" loc="137"/>. The expansion of
                    digital humanities research to include <quote rend="inline">digital publishing,
                        philosophies of digital research, and ‘born digital’ projects that cannot
                        exist outside of a digital medium</quote>
                    <ptr target="#urberg_2017" loc="134"/> is said to have led to a field where
                    researchers can ask new questions and inter-disciplinary work can be
                    facilitated. In musicology, the ongoing development of digital analytical tools
                    has been catching up the rapid and mature development of tools for text
                    analysis, leading to wider access to digital musicological resources, databases
                    and formats. This is exemplified by the AHRC Digital Transformations project
                        <title rend="italic">Transforming Musicology</title> in the UK, which ran
                    between 2013–2017, with the aim of bringing in together musicologists and
                    associated researchers and facilitators to <quote rend="inline">explore how
                        emerging technologies for working with music as sound and score can
                        transform musicology, both as an academic discipline and as a practice
                        outside of universities</quote>
                    <ptr target="#transforming_musicology_n.d."/>.</p>
                <p>The gradual shift to encompass the digital in research practices highlights the
                    creative tensions between musicology and the digital. Findings suggest that
                    while scholars prefer physical monographs over e-books, they are happy to read
                    electronic journal articles or book chapters <ptr
                        target="#chrzastowski_et_al_2015"/>, they may work with scanned artefacts
                    but also have the urge to visit the original, and they will experience a live
                    music event and will listen to mp3s or CDs in the car on the journey home. These
                    fragile balances may have been disturbed by the recent pandemic. </p>
                <p>From the outset of the pandemic, apart from what could be done at home, the
                    analogue was almost removed from the landscape. News items identified the
                    popularity of singing on one’s balcony or organising online concerts <ptr
                        target="#ros_fabregas_2020"/>. Concerts were cancelled and some music
                    workers suddenly ceased to have any income <ptr target="#wipo_2023"/>. Early in
                    2020, courses and classes were moved online, travel was limited, physical
                    resources locked down. It is suggested that the impact on the in-person nature
                    of music-making, -listening and -learning was lengthy and profound, cementing
                    the <quote rend="inline">digital turn</quote>
                    <ptr target="#camlin_and_lisboa_2021"/> which had already been taking place for a
                    number of years in teaching and other aspects of music-making and
                    consumption.</p>
                <p>Musicology research was also impacted, not least because many higher education
                    institutions required their academic staff to shift their teaching online <ptr
                        target="#bowman_2022"/>, which required many of those doing
                    non-Covid-related research to pause their research activities to enable them to
                    focus on teaching <ptr target="#gao_et_al_2021"/>. Studies indicate that this
                    pause was further limited by travel and access limitations and has been found to
                    have notable impact in a variety of research disciplines, broadening the gender
                    gap in publishing <ptr target="#lewis_2021"/>
                    <ptr target="#madsen_et_al_2022"/>, negatively affecting mental health <ptr
                        target="#lewis_2021"/> and reducing collaborations <ptr
                        target="#gao_et_al_2021"/>, community-building <ptr
                        target="#pursell_et_al_2021"/> and social capital <ptr
                        target="#froehlich_2021"/>. Due to the wide-ranging formats and pursuits,
                    the impact of the pandemic on music-related activities could be wider and more
                    complex than other disciplines. The challenges of moving conferences <ptr
                        target="#merrick_et_al_2020"/> and fieldwork online have already been
                    discussed <ptr target="#ozah_2022"/>, particularly where the music being studied
                    is not from a recording <ptr target="#onyeji_et_al_2022"/>, chiming with the
                    findings of Pokhrel and Chhetri (2021) in their review of the impact of the
                    pandemic on teaching and learning in developing countries <ptr
                        target="#pokhrel_et_al_2021"/>.</p>
                <p>As we approach a global humanities discipline <ptr target="#crymble_2021"
                        loc="161–170"/>, the concept of global musicology recognising the variety of
                    its nature and the distributed make-up of its community, its fluidity, and the
                    importance of its community <ptr target="#chua_2022"/> is possibly becoming
                    ever-more in reach. Bohlman describes a two-dimensional <quote rend="inline"
                        >global musicological moment</quote>, where <quote rend="inline">a change of
                        revolutionary proportions takes place</quote>
                    <ptr target="#bohlman_2020" loc="14"/> and where this paradigm shift also
                    changes the understanding of historical processes, both in the past and in their
                    future unfolding. This article considers the impact of the pandemic on the
                    digital practices and resources of musicology in an attempt to determine the
                    extent of this so-called musicological moment, and the way ahead.</p>

                    (abbreviated WDMDAD)<note>The title of the project is inspired by one of the
                        authors’ favourite children’s book
                        Scarry, R. (1968) <title

                    technologies by musicologists and their attitudes towards these. We conducted a
                    world-wide survey in 2014–2015, the outcomes of which were published in Inskip
                    and Wiering (2015)
                    <ptr target="#inskip_et_al_2015"/>. In 2022, we did a follow-up survey with the
                    following two research questions: <list type="ordered">
                        <item>To what extent has the use and acceptance of digital technology by
                            musicologists changed since 2015?</item>
                        <item>What was the impact of the pandemic on musicologists’ use of
                            technology?</item>
                    </list>This article focusses on the second question, looking at the changing
                    role of technology during the pandemic and the expected impact on future use of
                    technology in musicological research. On the launch page of the survey (see <ref
                        target="#appendix1">Appendix 1</ref>), we listed a range of technologies
                    commonly used in musicology, with an emphasis on digital technology. We decided
                    not to provide a strict definition of (digital) technology in order to give
                    respondents the freedom to answer in accordance with their own understanding of
                    the term.</p>

                    <head>3.a Data collection</head>
                    <p>An online survey was designed, using Opinio, using questions from the
                        previous survey which were revised to make them relevant to the pandemic.
                        The survey home page stated (see <ref target="#appendix1">Appendix 1</ref>):
                            <quote rend="block">We are looking at the research practices of
                            musicologists and other music researchers to gather information which

                            practices. This survey will provide some insights into how you have
                            responded to the Covid-19 pandemic.</quote> The research was approved by
                        the University College London Department of Information Studies Ethics
                        committee (16 February 2022) and GDPR (Z6364106/2022/02/129) approved on 23
                        February 2022. As with the previous survey, which was run in 2014–2015 and
                        had 621 usable responses, the survey link was made available to
                        musicologists via musicology societies mailing lists, and social media. The
                        survey ran from Tuesday 1 March 2022 – Friday 10 June 2022 and delivered 584
                        usable responses. The responses were gathered into Opinio and subsequently
                        downloaded as an Excel spreadsheet, which was imported into NVivo. </p>

                    <head>3.b Sample</head>
                    <p>Efforts were made to encourage participation from around the world by
                        approaching local musicology societies and asking them to circulate the link
                        to their members. The survey was anonymous although it is recognised that
                        some participants could be identifiable through their research topics, and
                        these have been redacted where necessary. The invitation was widely
                        circulated via musicology societies and networks. Participants were invited
                        to complete the survey if they had an involvement with musicological
                        research. This led to the inclusion of musicology-focused librarians,
                        archivists and scholars in adjacent disciplines, recognising the wide scope
                        of the segmented discipline, as noted earlier. Some previous participants
                        had provided their contact details separately from their data and were
                        notified of the survey and asked to take part.</p>

                    <div>
                        <head>3.c Data Analysis</head>
                        <p>When the survey was closed the data was downloaded from Opinio and
                            imported into NVivo for analysis. One researcher was using NVivo for
                            Mac, the other NVivo for PC. Coding was done by both the researchers
                            over a period of months, with access to a password-protected shared
                            drive and regular online discussions taking place. Both researchers were
                            coding the whole dataset, and it was planned to merge both coding sets;
                            however, technical incompatibilities meant that this was not possible,
                            so the two separate coding books were compared and reviewed to ensure
                            consistency. The numerical data was analysed separately from the textual
                            data, using basic Excel spreadsheets and charts to visualise relevant
                            results.</p>
                        <p>The approach to coding the qualitative data was partially derived from
                            grounded theory and followed two stages: open and axial <ptr
                                target="#corbin_et_al_1990"/>. In the open coding stage, the
                            responses were initially organised by their associated questions (e.g.
                            Q13: Tell a story about a frustrating experience with technology during
                            the Covid-19 pandemic), open coding allowing the researchers to immerse
                            themselves in the responses to each of the questions and identify themes
                            within each set of responses: frustration, reward, risks, limitations,
                            benefits, changes. During axial coding, the links between each of the
                            themes were then identified and compared between researchers to find
                            commonalities and outliers. The texts were visualised using word cloud,
                            text search and cluster map features in NVivo, helping the researchers
                            identify patterns in the word usage.</p>

                            they participated in 2015, while 71 doubt if they did: nearly 80% thus
                            participated for the first time (Q1). Spread over continents is rather
                            similar (Q2), though showing a dip in North American and increase in
                            European participants (Table 2).</p>

                            interaction, teaching and learning. These are presented and discussed

                                about the use of video conferencing services in various contexts,
                                one of which is education. Digital and physical materials, focussing
                                on the issue of access, comes second. Location of work and
                                travelling also attract a lot of comments, whereas technology itself
                                is less discussed. Table 7 compares the responses from Q18 with the

                                    Percentages are calculated over columns: they relate the number
                                    of comments in an area of change (Q18) to the number of
                                    participants with a particular preference change (Q11).
                                    Percentages don’t add up to 100% due to (a) responses that don’t
                                    mention an area of change and (b) responses that mention

                            <p>Two interesting patterns seem to emerge. One is about human
                                interaction: The less the respondents’ preference has changed, the
                                more human interaction seems to be an issue. In other words, their
                                most important experience of technology may have been the use of
                                different modes of communication. This is supported by the frequent
                                mention of Zoom in the responses, for example that <quote
                                    rend="inline">For better or for worse, Zoom is here to
                                    stay</quote> [156].</p>
                            <p>Another pattern concerns resources, which are mentioned much more
                                often by those reporting a strong preference change and may indicate
                                an increased use (or wish to use) digital resources. Some remarks
                                suggest a changed working practice: <quote rend="inline">My thesis
                                    has made the turn towards digital archives and will continue in
                                    this direction</quote> [59], while other suggest a mixed
                                approach: <quote rend="inline">Use of digital sources in the first
                                    instance to establish if the content merits an ‘in-person‘
                                    follow up visit</quote> [45].</p>
                            <p>Other patterns are apparent but are weaker, such as that respondents reporting some preference change relatively made most remarks about remote work and travel.</p>

                                In the words of respondent 289: <quote rend="inline">Without
                                    technology such as Zoom or other platforms, we could not have
                                    any interaction.</quote> Delving deeper into responses from Q18
                                about human interaction can tell us something about how
                                musicologists expect these changes to affect their professional
                                lives in the future. Table 8 gives a breakdown of these

                            <p>We’ll focus here on the two largest categories, professional
                                interaction and conferences. Discipline in general is the topic of
                                the next section, while the comments on musical events are too few
                                to draw a conclusion from. From the respondents speaking about
                                online conferences, the large majority either appreciates them or at
                                least intends to keep participating. Appreciation speaks from
                                remarks such as <quote rend="inline">Zoom conferences/research
                                    meetings are pretty cool</quote> [381] or just <q>Remote
                                conferences!</q> [211]. They extend networks: <quote rend="inline">We
                                    just organized a hybrid conference. I would do that again at any
                                    time, since it brought scholars from all over the world to the

                                    more accessible.</quote> [236]. Conversely, online may just be a

                                    person</quote> [484]. Several respondents take a middle

                                participation in a <q>Zoom writing group</q> [231]. Especially for
                                long-distance collaboration, working and meeting remotely has become
                                a viable alternative: <quote rend="inline">I’ll continue my

                            <p>At a more individual and informal level of interaction, we found
                                several remarks, mostly with a positive slant, about <quote

                                [312]. Finally, there is a small but interesting group of responses
                                addressing fieldwork and participant research, noticing on the one

                            <p>Some responses in Q18 go beyond the individual and seem to reflect on
                                more widespread changes in the musicological community. A good
                                starting point is the following: <quote rend="block">Many: perhaps
                                    none of them huge or transformative on their own, but in sum the

                                    huge. [176]</quote> Prompted by this observation we searched for
                                remarks concerning the discipline in general through all responses
                                to Q13–18 and identified over 180 relevant remarks (as always, there
                                were borderline cases where it was unclear whether they described
                                the respondent’s personal situation or a more general observation).
                                These responses are summarised in Table 9:</p>

                                    sentiment score is based on number of remarks in Q13–Q17.
                                    Remarks in Q14 and Q17 are considered positive; those in Q13,
                                    Q15 and Q16 negative. Remarks from Q18 are not included since
                                    they can have either sentiment.</head>

                            <p>For each category we calculated a naïve sentiment score from the
                                responses from the <q>positive</q> (Q14, Q17) <q>and negative</q> (Q13,

                                category. Weighting is necessary since there are three
                                    <q>negative</q> questions and two <q>positive</q> ones: hence a
                                negative response must receive two thirds of the weight of a
                                positive response:</p>

                            <p>Scores above 0.5 indicate a positive sentiment on the topic, scores
                                below 0.5 a negative one; a score of 0.5 indicates a neutral
                                sentiment. Since just the number of responses, not their content is
                                taken into account, these scores can only serve as a rough
                                indication. The positive sentiment of some of the smaller categories
                                (travel, working remotely; environment) is hardly surprising.
                                Learning skills is also quite positively valued (see Section
                                4.c.iv), as is, somewhat surprisingly, interaction (see Section
                                4.c.vi). Mixed feelings seem to exist surrounding equity and
                                inclusion (see Section 4.c.v).</p>

                                nevertheless deserve some consideration because of both their
                                importance and relatively low score: access, method and values. Many

                            <p>Earlier (Section 4.c.ii) we discussed how individual researchers
                                expected their own interactions to be affected by the pandemic. Here
                                we look into the changes they observe at the disciplinary level. We
                                already saw many responses in Q18 that concern conferences. The
                                discipline-level responses from the other questions suggest again
                                that this has been perhaps the most impactful change during the
                                pandemic. Some respondents see this change as the future of the
                                discipline, and not just for reasons of convenience, for example:
                                    <quote rend="block">We’ve learned that you can hold conferences

                                    in-person colloquium — the economics are squarely against it.
                                    And as global travel becomes less common (because it has to),
                                    online conferences are sure to become increasingly important.

                                back to in-person or hybrid, with students in-person and on-line
                                simultaneously. The tensions surrounding the two modes of
                                participation were frustrating and distracting: <quote rend="inline"

                            <p>In terms of teaching and learning, therefore, we should end on a

                                    class-time. Having to teach caused me to make a lot of changes
                                    in course design, all of them for the good. It gave me the
                                    license to try things I had thought about doing for years, and
                                    most of them worked. The year I taught online was a year of
                                    ceaseless innovation. I used it as an opportunity to do things
                                    differently and better. Yes, there will challenges, but I
                                    focused on the medium’s potential and not it’s limitations. In
                                    order to do ear training online, we required the students to
                                    acquire digital pianos, and we made those pianos smoke, with a
                                    corresponding (and unprecedented) spike in student learning and
                                    achievement. [543]</quote>
                                <quote rend="block">Zoom and other teams surfaces allowed me to

                                    who invented these programs. Zoom is not the same as teaching or

                    <p>In this section we discuss our main findings and place them in the context of
                        other research into the impact of the pandemic on academia. Our central
                        research question, <q>what was the impact of the pandemic on musicologists’
                            use of technology,</q> is answered by a quantitative and qualitative
                        analysis of the 584 usable responses to our 2022 online survey. The
                        demographics and disciplinary interests of the respondents are rather
                        similar to those of our previous survey (2014–2015), and we did not widen
                        our request for demographic information because we wanted to follow the
                        design of the previous survey to enable comparisons between the two
                        datasets, focusing on location, level of education, affiliation and specific
                        musicological interests. Most respondents come from the global north, the
                        anglophone world in particular, and since the survey was online, it is
                        biased towards participants with access to technology and digital literacy.
                        The outcomes therefore cannot be generalised without question.</p>
                    <p>As shown earlier (see Section 4.c.i), we observed a limited preference change
                        towards digital resources, primarily due to the general increase in
                        availability of digitised materials, but also because of lack of access
                        caused by the pandemic and the general increase in working from home. This
                        <q>perfect storm</q> enacted an acceleration of the adoption of digitised
                        resources within musicology, perhaps aligning the discipline more closely
                        within digital humanities than previously noted by Döhl <ptr
                            target="#dohl_2020"/>. Many respondents reported that they expected to
                        keep some of the change that they made during the pandemic. The spread in
                        the responses is quite large; moreover, lack of change may indicate both a
                        preference for traditional work practices and a long-term adoption of
                        digital approaches.</p>
                    <p>Nearly everyone has been affected in some way by the pandemic, and in
                        academia the effects have been felt by academic staff and students alike. It
                        is therefore important to delve deeper into the experiences and insights in
                        the textual responses. In those, we observed a number of important areas of
                        change. Here we focus on three: individual changes, teaching and learning,
                        and changes in the discipline. These impacts include the topics identified
                        in this survey and have been identified across disciplines and borders.</p>
                    <p>With respect to individual changes, the tension between positive and negative experiences of using and adapting to new formats <ptr target="#oliveira_et_al_2021"/> can be seen vividly in the findings – again showing the need for reliable technology and adequate training and support. Many of us have experienced how the hybrid model has continued after the pandemic subsided <ptr target="#azevedo_et_al_2022"/>. The impact of the shift to online in collaborative music-making meant a change in approaches was needed to accommodate the difference affordances of the technology (playing in real time vs learning from recordings <ptr target="#gibson_2021"/> or synchronous and asynchronous learning <ptr target="#camlin_and_lisboa_2021"/>. The frustrations of poor connections and time lags in music performance and Skype had already been identified before the pandemic <ptr target="#joseph_et_al_2020"/>, although Skype was barely mentioned in the survey responses, Zoom and Teams being the most prevalent online conferencing software, demonstrating the fluid and fast-moving nature of the technological context. Access to collections was frequently raised, supporting Onyeji and Onyeji’s (2022) discussion of folk music materials in the Library of Folk Music of Nigeria project <ptr target="#onyeji_et_al_2022"/>. Individual changes in musicology thus seem to follow the general pattern, with the added complication of music as a collaboratively-created, highly time-sensitive medium.</p>
                    <p>Another theme centred on teaching and learning, which was rather unexpected
                        as our survey was geared towards research. As in academic global health
                        programmes <ptr target="#rose_et_al_2022"/> the pandemic had impact on
                        education, research and administration. The <quote rend="inline">digital
                            turn</quote> in music education has been documented elsewhere and the
                        distinction between <quote rend="inline">emergency remote teaching</quote>
                        and online learning <ptr target="#camlin_and_lisboa_2021"/> is highlighted by the
                        stress the pivot caused many of the participants. The shift to online
                        classes comes out very clearly in the survey results, along with limitations
                        on travel and communication impacting on research outputs and practices.
                        Analysis of this impact across academia <ptr target="#arday_2022"/> has
                        shown how widespread these shared impacts have been. The lived experience of
                        the participants in our survey highlights the personal impact of these
                        enforced changes on musicology researchers. An important finding here, in
                        terms of equity, was that while global north participants could rely to a
                        degree on the technologies which were being provided to facilitate the
                        shift, those in global south struggled <ptr target="#nyashanu_et_al_2023"/>
                        <ptr target="#sahoo_et_al_2021"/> and anticipated a reduction in access once
                        the pandemic had subsided.</p>
                    <p>Interestingly, quite a few responses reveal, implicitly or explicitly, a
                        sense that the discipline itself is changing. We focused on three dimensions
                        of change: learning new skills, equity and inclusion, and interaction. </p>
                    <p>Since early 2020, a huge amount of research has been done on a wide range of
                        aspects of Covid-19. By comparison, the number of publications that study
                        the effect of the pandemic on disciplines and researchers themselves is
                        rather low. Here we discuss a selection. The one we found that comes closest
                        to our work is Sezen‑Barrie et al. (2023), surveying 408 faculty, staff and
                        students from university in the northeast of the U.S, representing a wide
                        range of disciplines. Their study focusses on productivity and health and
                        well-being rather than on technology, but technology plays an important role
                        in the responses. Adaptations to the pandemic include use of virtual
                        communication tools such as Zoom, online teaching and conferences, increased
                        [technical] knowledge/skills, using digital collections and the pursuit of
                        new research opportunities. As one of the lessons from the pandemic, the
                        authors conclude that <quote rend="inline">digital technologies can help
                            create effective and equitable virtual teaching and research

                        <ptr target="#sezen_barrie_et_al_2023"/>. While our research supports that
                        view, our findings relating to access suggest that a longer-term approach is
                        necessary if we are to make any progress towards putting global north and
                        south on an equal footing.</p>
                    <p>Equity is a recurring concern in the literature. Presenting the outcomes of a series of workshops with Indonesian researchers in social and humanities research, <ptr target="#rifai_et_al_2021"/> conclude that, while much empirical research can be done in principle using online meeting platforms and communication apps, there are various issues in the adoption of digital research methods. Some relate to lack of direct interactions with informants; others relate to the <q>digital divide</q> restricting access to infrastructure and resources in developing countries. <ptr target="#livingston_2023"/>, in an ethnographic study of academic-community partnerships in food systems research, shows how the pandemic impacted on power relations between academics and community partners, often at the expense of the latter. Further to this, <ptr target="#hopkins_2022"/> observes that digitisation and open-access publishing have had a positive impact on equity in Digital Humanities, both for Eastern Europe and developing countries. He also connects digitisation to carbon neutrality — a minor theme in WDMDAD — and recommends (art history) journals to go fully online. He remains however a supporter of in-person conferences. <ptr target="#watkinson_2022"/> observes — from a publisher’s perspective — that infrastructure was a limiting factor in the use of eBooks worldwide. Yet online humanities conferences have caused <quote rend="inline">a flattening of the previous inequalities of participation.</quote> He also sees a change in work practices exemplified by the use of collaborative writing environments, which may lead to <quote rend="inline">more team-based humanities research.</quote></p>
                    <p>We thus find rather similar themes and observations in the literature about other disciplines. Individual responses and stories indicate that there is a large variety in the ways that researchers adapted to the pandemic and how they assessed the role of technology. The pandemic made the researchers’ physical world smaller but dramatically enlarged their digital world. This may explain why questions of in- and exclusions are so much in evidence in these publications. Hence, equity should be an important theme in shaping the development towards <q>global musicology</q> and the role of technology therein.</p>

                    <head>6. Conclusion and recommendations</head>
                    <p>The storyline that emerges from our analysis of the responses is that the
                        pandemic forced the community to attain a technical skill set that enabled
                        online communication in many forms and provided access to a wealth of
                        resources. Most notably this is true of students, who were exposed to
                        several years of mainly online teaching. These experiences may have widened
                        horizons in a variety of ways, with respect to collaboration and networking,
                        resources, tools and research topics, and finally methodological
                        reflections. Nearly all fundamental aspects of the discipline have been
                        affected in some way, and it seems safe to say that, under the influence of
                        the pandemic, the digital has become an integral part of the musicological
                        discipline.</p>
                    <p>While we derive our storyline from a bottom-up analysis of the WDMDAD survey,
                        theoretical work elsewhere in the humanities propose complementary insights.
                        That the humanities are undergoing a paradigm shift – accelerated by the
                        pandemic – is claimed by Lorella Viola (2023). She criticises the <quote
                            rend="inline">evolutionary approach to the digital</quote> of <quote
                            rend="inline">gradual adjustments</quote> by which <quote rend="inline"
                            >the existing model of knowledge creation is left essentially
                            intact</quote>
                        <ptr target="#viola_2023" loc="6"/>. Instead, she argues that the digital
                        <quote rend="inline">affects the very practices of knowledge production</quote> <ptr
                            target="#viola_2023" loc="7"/>, so that <quote rend="inline">the digital
                            is no longer contextual to knowledge creation but that knowledge is
                            created in the digital</quote>
                        <ptr target="#viola_2023" loc="9"/>. We haven’t encountered this level of
                        methodological reflection in our data, but some of the practices our
                        respondents describe suggest that this shift also affects musicological
                        knowledge production.</p>
                    <p>Further analysis of the responses may refine or question our storyline.
                        Speciality is an important viewpoint for further studying the comments
                        relating to access and method. In addition, regional and national difference
                        merit investigation. The storyline is also a prediction of future
                        developments, potentially to be tested by means of another survey in a
                        number of years. One particular point of concern is to what extent
                        technology divides the community; a next survey should therefore have a much
                        better coverage of audiences that have been underrepresented so far. A
                        comparison of the 2022 and 2014–2015 responses would provide further insight
                        in the pace of disciplinary change in the recent past.</p>
                    <p>We also believe that our work has practical implications, first for
                        musicology, but by extension for other humanities as well. Many music (and
                        humanities) researchers, especially the younger generation, now possess a
                        basic common toolset and share similar experiences with these. In Viola’s
                            words:<quote rend="inline"> As a bare minimum, for example, regardless
                            of the discipline, a post-COVID researcher is someone able to embrace a
                            broad set of digital tools effectively</quote>
                        <ptr target="#viola_2023" loc="7"/>. Post-COVID researchers in musicology
                        and elsewhere will likely shape their work practices and aims around these
                        tools and experiences, with potential consequences at all levels of the
                        discipline. At the same time there is a considerable group with limited
                        access to technology or is, for whatever reason, unwilling to use it. And
                        there is a very large disciplinary legacy that remains inaccessible
                        digitally. There is thus a looming threat of multiple digital divides. We
                        have seen above (see Section 4.c.v) that technology has the potential to
                        include as well as to exclude. This may be seen as an illustration of
                        Kranzberg’s first law of technology: technology is neither good nor bad; nor
                        is it neutral <ptr target="#kranzberg_1986"/>, the implication of which is
                        that shaping technology and its application is a profoundly human task. We
                        argue here that this shaping ought to take place not only at the individual
                        and local level, running the risk of fragmentation, but especially at the
                        level of research communities and international organisations. Many of these
                        support values such as equity, inclusion and openness. By using technology
                        to support these values (and developing policies about their proper use)
                        they can demonstrate that technologies that have regularly been described as
                            <q>disruptive</q> can be employed constructively, enhancing human
                        networks, connecting material and digital resources, and combining new and
                        traditional approaches to the full range of research topics. </p></div>

                    <p>Musicologists and other music researchers generally have been quick to adopt
                        technologies that might help them with their work. Early examples include
                        microfilm, phonograph and tape recorder. Nowadays researchers frequently
                        make use of the possibilities that mobile phones, social media, digital
                        libraries, search engines and computer software offer. But these
                        technologies do not always have a good fit with the daily work
                        practices.</p>
                    <p>We are looking at the research practices of musicologists and other music
                        researchers to gather information which can be used in the development of
                        technologies relevant to these practices. This survey will provide some
                        insights into how you have responded to the Covid-19 pandemic.</p>
                    <p> Whether you do not use much technology, or if you use it a lot, we are
                        interested in finding out your views.</p>
                    <p>This survey has 14 questions. Some questions are multiple choice. In other
                        questions we would like you to write a little about what you do, what you
                        think, and about your experiences with technology. Depending on how much
                        detail you wish to provide, we expect it will take you between 10 and 25
                        minutes to complete these questions. If you feel uncomfortable writing in
                        English, please use another language.</p>

                        time before you finish. If you take the survey we will not ask you for any
                        identifying information. Your comments are anonymous, but please do not
                        provide any information that could make you identifiable, or that you do not
                        want to be quoted in publications. At the end of the survey we ask you if
                        you wish to take part in future research – your response is stored
                        separately from your survey comments and they cannot be linked in any way.
