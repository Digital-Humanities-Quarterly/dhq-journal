           <p><name>Dylan Mulvin</name>'s <title rend="italic">Proxies: The Cultural Work of Standing In</title> (2021) argues that because proxies

      <body>
        <p>My children are sick, and we are in bed reading the funny but also very factual cartoon dinosaur book <title rend="italic">Everything Awesome 
           About Dinosaurs and Other Prehistoric Beasts</title> <ptr target="#lowery_2019"/>. One multisyllabic -odon is a carnivore, with long serrated 
           teeth for tearing flesh. A single tooth is almost a foot long! I demonstrate by holding up my own arm. The tooth of this once-living being, 
           which was unearthed and dusted off and measured — and now has been jauntily drawn — was as long as the span from my wrist to my elbow. Give or 
           take. One foot.
        </p>
        <p>How do I know how long a foot is? How do the scientists, who wielded those small brushes to dust off the teeth, know? And what does it mean to 
           apply a measurement originally built around the span of an actual human foot, to a Jurassic-era creature? My children take in my gesture of 
           measurement. They feel certain that the world rests upon clear and delineated knowledge. Readers of <name>Dylan Mulvin</name>'s extraordinary 
           monograph, <title rend="italic">Proxies: The Cultural Work of Standing In</title>, observe the work that goes in to persisting this knowledge. 
           We recognize that <quote rend="inline">... knowledge production relies on accessible representations of the world, and proxies are the people, 
           artifacts, places, and moments invested with the authority to represent the world</quote> <ptr target="#mulvin_2021" loc="4"/>. As 
           <name>Mulvin</name>, currently an Assistant Professor of Media and Communications at the <name>London School of Economics</name>, describes it, 
           proxies — and specifically the acts of delegation and representation performed through the use of proxies — demand continuous maintenance. 
           Consider what went into passing down the span of a king's foot across centuries. <name>Mulvin</name> might observe my embodied gesture and note 
           the transmission of indexical knowledge between generations, as part of the cultural and representational work that maintains communal 
           understanding of measurements, standards, and stand-ins. He might see — as I certainly see — in this gesture support for his assertion that 
           <quote rend="inline">[o]ur references shape who we are, how we think, how we communicate, and how we build shared worlds</quote> 
           <ptr target="#mulvin_2021" loc="202"/>.
        </p>
        <p>Mulvin anchors his chapters in case studies that tell the stories of proxies from the eighteenth century to the present, probing their origins 
           and the labor that maintains their fiction of representativeness. <name>Mulvin</name>'s narrative is lively and weaving, as well as laudably 
           transparent in its debt to scholars whose work both informs and undergirds his theoretical framework. Each chapter offers an opportunity to 
           delve into the distinctive set of concerns that surround particular proxies and reiterate the overarching argument of the monograph. 
           <title rend="italic">Proxies</title> invites excerpting at the chapter level; any one (or two) of these chapters would work well as a course 
           assignment or standalone reading. Published as part of MIT Press's Infrastructures Series, edited by <name>Geoffrey Bowker</name> and 
           <name>Paul Edwards</name>, <title rend="italic">Proxies</title> is available both as an open access eBook and in paperback.
        </p>
        <p>Chapter 1 introduces <name>Mulvin</name>'s argument of proxies and positions the overall work while relating the story of Urban Target 
           Complex (R-2301-West), a <name>US Marine Corps</name> training site designed in the aftermath of Mogadishu combat and intended to address the 
           need for new proxies of urban battlegrounds. Chapter 2 delves into the ritualistic maintenance of the International Prototype Kilogram (IPK), 
           looking expansively from its origins in the Enlightenment to its echoes in the data hygiene familiar to modern-day maintainers of datasets. 
           Chapters 3 and 4 offer a roughly chronological two-part scrutiny of the ubiquitous digital test image known fondly as Lena. Part One examines 
           Lena's origins as <name>Lenna Sjööblom</name>, the November 1972 <title rend="italic">Playboy</title> centerfold, and her/its evolution within 
           the larger history of test images, which were used to calibrate image technologies, techniques, and instruments. <name>Mulvin</name> 
           effectively contextualizes Lena and other test images of her era that assumed whiteness and objectified women as a prehistory of algorithmic 
           biases and racialized surveillance technologies, a continuum of the <quote rend="inline">warped representation of skin</quote> 
           <ptr target="#mulvin_2021" loc="8"/>. Part Two picks up in the 1990s with the ultimately triumphant challenges to Lena's continued use as a 
           proxy, detailing objections from both <title rend="italic">Playboy</title>, claiming copyright infringement, and those who drew a line between 
           this objectifying test image and the <quote rend="inline">abuse, violence, and mistreatment</quote> experienced by women in computer science 
           and engineering <ptr target="#mulvin_2021" loc="132"/>. Bridging out from models such as Lena, who labored as stand-ins 
           <quote rend="inline">for a world of images, faces, and skin</quote> <ptr target="#mulvin_2021" loc="143"/>, Chapter 5 turns to 
           <quote rend="inline">living proxies</quote>, the actors in standardized patient programs. Conceptualized as <quote rend="inline">human learning 
           tools</quote> or technologies <ptr target="#mulvin_2021" loc="145"/>, standardized patients are deployed in medical training programs to teach 
           and test physicians' patient interactions. Examining the work of these proxies from their origins in the 1960s leads <name>Mulvin</name> 
           through a discussion of pain and suffering, racialized violence, and the body as a controlled variable. Chapter 6 offers a methodological coda 
           that ties proxies' spectacularity and concealment more emphatically to infrastructure.
        </p>
        <p>Throughout these discussions, <name>Mulvin</name> expertly locates how proxies figure into a larger literature on measurement, standards, and 
           boundary objects. Invoking a series of what he describes as <quote rend="inline">kindred ways of understanding how surrogate logics shape and 
           bind disciplinary communities</quote>, <name>Mulvin</name> describes <name>Lorraine Daston</name> and <name>Peter Galison</name>'s 
           <quote rend="inline">working objects</quote>; <name>Thomas Kuhn</name>'s <quote rend="inline">exemplars</quote>; and <name>Michelle 
           Murphy</name>'s <quote rend="inline">phantasmograms</quote> <ptr target="#mulvin_2021" loc="8–10"/>. He issues a gentle rejoinder to these 
           works, arguing: <quote rend="block">But these concepts risk placing too much emphasis on the <quote rend="inline">objects</quote> of 
           laboratories and classrooms and not enough emphasis on the labor and affective commitments that proxies inspire. They also risk displacing the 
           ways that human bodies must carry the traces of this work, either through the repetitive use of a narrow set of exemplars or the psychological 
           and physical toll that the work might take.<ptr target="#mulvin_2021" loc="10"/></quote>Here, and throughout 
           <title rend="italic">Proxies</title>, <name>Mulvin</name>'s methodology and perspective are most clearly identified with critical 
           infrastructure studies, science and technology studies, and maintenance studies, but they are enriched by feminist and performance theory, 
           disability studies, and persistently attentive to questions of race, equity, and labor. <name>Mulvin</name> states the goals of his project 
           clearly and compellingly throughout. And while each chapter takes a particular proxy as its focus, <name>Mulvin</name>'s analytic emphasis is, 
           as his subtitle insists, on the <quote rend="inline">cultural work of standing in</quote>, shifting away from the proxy itself and towards the 
           <quote rend="inline">human bodies and human labor</quote> that sustain it <ptr target="#mulvin_2021" loc="8"/>.
        </p>
        <p><name>Mulvin</name> demonstrates methodological flexibility and creativity as he investigates proxy stories, reading technical and training 
           manuals, citation patterns for the <title rend="italic">IEEE Transactions on Image Processing</title>, and standardized patient fee schedules 
           alongside <name>Lauren Berlant</name> and <name>Bruno Latour</name>. If <title rend="italic">Proxies</title> reads as an admirably communal 
           account, with frequent expansive references to preceding scholarship, it also enacts its commitment to human bodies and labor by refusing to 
           disappear its author. The volume is charmingly illustrated with artist interpretations by <name>R. R. Mulvin</name>, which prod at the idea of 
           proxy as they recreate magazine covers, test images, and the IPK cleaning apparatus, among other subjects. <name>Mulvin</name> — or perhaps 
           his postmodern authorial proxy — appears in the narrative as well, with the effect of a backstage tour that highlights the artificiality of 
           the production and the disorienting routine of academic work, conjured in <quote rend="inline">the sad sandwich or premade burrito that we lug 
           through humid <name>Washington</name> on our way to <name>College Park</name>, or the eerie loneliness of the picnic bench at the 
           <name>National Library of Medicine</name></quote> <ptr target="#mulvin_2021" loc="199"/>. We glimpse <name>Dylan Mulvin</name> in an image in 
           the final chapter: he squats with arms extended, wielding a taut string over a length of cardboard, attempting to recreate a <name>Marcel 
           Duchamp</name> piece. This image has stayed with me, showing, as it perhaps does, a commitment to trying things out and looking at them from 
           all angles, to the embodied experiences that this volume both demands and describes.
