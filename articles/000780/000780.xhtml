                  <p>In this paper, I examine the ethics and pedagogical implications of unnaming for the
                     political project of 
                     historical recovery. Digital humanities projects on slavery often proffer the reparative
                     promise of serving as 
                     public-facing works that seek to recover enslaved people's lives from archival erasure.
                     I contend that by entwining 
                     the immaterial digital commemoration of The Unnamed Fugitive with the material monument
                     to Le Marron Inconnu, my 
                     students' interpretive choices illuminate the ways that deliberate unnaming can enact
                     a shift away from anonymity 
                     and erasure and, in turn, a move towards productive engagement with the limits of
                     knowledge and recovery in 
                     slavery's archive.

                  <div class="ptext" id="p1">In the summer of 1837, an incident in international waters set off an exchange of
                     urgent 
                     letters between the French Consul in Denmark, the French Naval Ministry, and 
                     the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Paris [<a class="ref" href="#mole1837">Molé 1837</a>, 1]. 
                     An enslaved man had been found aboard the <cite class="title italic">Neptune</cite>, a ship 
                     traveling from Martinique to the port of Le Havre. Presumably 
                     discovered as the vessel neared or reached Helsingør, a coastal town north 
                     of Copenhagen, the fugitive now appeared to be held on board by the captain 
                     as the vessel continued en route to Le Havre. What was to be done with the 
                     stowaway? Did his case for manumission come under Danish jurisdiction or rather fall
                     
                     under French law? Did he even have a case for manumission, having fled 
                     Martinique without his enslaver's accord? As the French Minister of the 
                     Navy explained to his colleagues, various legislative measures, including the law
                     of 
                     March 4, 1831, and the Royal Ordinance of April 29, 1836, laid out the conditions
                     by 
                     which an enslaved person could travel from the colonies to the metropole. The ability
                     to 
                     claim freedom upon arrival in France, he wrote, was only applicable if the 
                     enslaved person had been sent to France lawfully by his enslaver 
                     [<a class="ref" href="#duperre1837">Duperré 1837</a>, 1]. On his part, the <cite class="title italic">Neptune</cite>'s 
                     captain was adamant that he would return the fugitive to his enslaver at the first
                     
                     opportunity on his next voyage to Martinique 
                     [<a class="ref" href="#duperre1837">Duperré 1837</a>, 1]. If by stowing away on the ship, the fugitive had 
                     hoped to avail himself of the promise of liberty espoused by the Freedom Principle,
                     that 
                     hope now seemed illusory as the <cite class="title italic">Neptune</cite> sailed onward to 
                     France.<a class="noteRef" href="#d4e220">[1]</a> The 
                     <cite class="title italic">Neptune</cite>'s fugitive presented a legal conundrum for 
                     authorities in the 19th century. When undergraduate students at the University of 
                     Michigan encountered records of the fugitive's flight in the fall of 2021, they 
                     faced a different kind of conundrum, namely how to identify the fugitive and piece
                     
                     together his story. As students soon discovered, throughout the letters exchanged
                     about 
                     the fugitive, he was never once named.

                     coursework for “Mapping the French Atlantic”. Housed in the 
                     Department of Romance Languages and Literatures, “Mapping the French 
                     Atlantic” was a French course supported by a 2018 Technology Services New 
                     Initiatives/New Instruction Grant in the College of Literature, Science, and the Arts
                     at 
                     the University of Michigan. The grant aimed to foster inclusive teaching 
                     practices that made innovative use of technology and was awarded to fund two primary
                     
                     expenses required for “Mapping the French Atlantic”. The first 
                     was to engage the services of Agile Humanities Agency, a software, design, and consulting
                     
                     collective, to create a digital map of the movement of enslaved people in the 
                     Atlantic world. The second expense was travel to archives in Fort 
                     de-France, Port-au-Prince, Montreal, and New York 
                     City to digitize records about enslaved people that would serve as primary sources 
                     from which students would gather the information required to populate the digital
                     map.

                  <div class="ptext" id="p3">“Mapping the French Atlantic” sits somewhere at the 
                     intersection of digital humanities (DH), history, and literary studies. Its objective
                     was 
                     to use digital mapping methods to retrace the movements of enslaved people throughout
                     the 
                     Atlantic world as they navigated slavery, freedom, and citizenship in the 
                     18th and 19th centuries. In so doing, the course aimed to guide students in a critical
                     
                     reflection on how maps shape our understanding of the world and on what mapping movement
                     
                     might reveal about the relationship between mobility and power.<a class="noteRef" href="#d4e283">[2]</a> Course readings ranged from novels to 
                     theoretical texts to primary sources that allowed students to engage with these questions.

                        Indian Ocean Colonies</cite> (2017) provided important social and legal context needed 
                     to understand the terms of Black people's mobility in the French Atlantic. 
                     These texts showed how laws such as the 1777 <cite class="title italic">Police 
                        des noirs</cite> and the later laws evoked by the Minister of the Navy in his 
                     correspondence about the <cite class="title italic">Neptune</cite>'s fugitive constrained 
                     movement and in the process made Blackness synonymous with enslavement. Michel-Rolph 
                     Trouillot's <cite class="title italic">Silencing the Past: Power and the Production of 
                        History</cite> (1991) and Maryse Condé's <cite class="title italic">Moi, Tituba 
                        sorcière…noire de Salem</cite> (1981) offered rich material for thinking about how to 
                     tell other kinds of stories about enslaved people in ways that are cognizant of archival
                     
                     lacunae and that nonetheless work to recover narratives of their lives. Finally, articles
                     
                     by Caroline Séveno and Camille Lefebvre and Isabelle 
                     Surun laid out the politics of maps and their use in colonial conquest in 
                     Africa, while writings by Britt Rusert and Lauren F. 
                     Klein explored the ethics and stakes of digitally rendering Black lives

                     these readings over two-thirds of the semester was to lay the intellectual groundwork
                     for 
                     students' final projects.

                     This length constraint, necessitated by the small size of the tooltip that accompanies
                     
                     each geographic point on the digital map, required my students to work with an economy
                     of 
                     words. And so, in the final third of the semester, students were assigned to small
                     groups 
                     of three or four. Each group was allocated a dossier pertaining to an enslaved person
                     that 
                     contained all the records I could find about that person's life in my travels to archives
                     
                     in the Caribbean, the United States, and France. 
                     Working in their small groups, students extracted all the geographical data they could
                     
                     find and used it to plot the person's trajectory on the digital map. But, as many
                     scholars 
                     have shown, data extraction on its own can hardly tell a true, complete, or just story
                     
                     about the lives of people who were often reduced to numbers in ledgers or criminals
                     in 
                     court records.<a class="noteRef" href="#d4e347">[3]</a> Students were therefore also required to sit 
                     with these documents and work out for themselves — with guidance from our course texts
                     — 
                     how they might tell the person's story otherwise. The result, for each group, was
                     a short 
                     biographical narrative that introduces and contextualizes each person's trajectory
                     on the 
                     map.

                     projects in recovery. Their aim was to recover what fragments we could of enslaved
                     
                     people's lives, piece them together into a narrative — biographies that for many of
                     the 
                     people we studied would never be written otherwise — and in the process, learn something
                     
                     about how people who were enslaved or lived in proximity to slavery articulated ideas

                     in 
                     2018, students huddled in small groups around screens in the computer lab as they
                     entered 
                     their data into the map, and we watched in collective amazement and pride as

                     who like the <cite class="title italic">Neptune</cite>'s stowaway was enslaved in 
                     Martinique, but unlike the fugitive, managed to lay claim to freedom in 
                     France via the Ordinance of April 29, 1836; Joseph Bologne,

                     Montreal ablaze; Charles-Pierre Lambert and his descendants, 
                     whose musical talents reverberated across New Orleans, France,

                     was more debilitating for our work than we expected. From the very inception of 
                     <cite class="title italic">Mapping Marronage</cite>, it was clear that we could not design a 
                     website that would require two mandatory name fields for data entry, as the practice
                     of 
                     slavery in the Americas often involved denying enslaved people a surname in 
                     order to transform them more completely into property, to sever them from community,
                     and 
                     to render genealogy and lineage impossible.<a class="noteRef" href="#d4e464">[6]</a> On a technical and 
                     practical level, the fugitive's anonymity meant that we had no data to enter into
                     the 
                     mandatory name field that the software required to create an entry on the digital
                     map. 
                     Without at least one name to identify the man, we could not move forward. My students
                     and 
                     I considered several acts of substitution to fill in this gap presented by the documented
                     
                     disregard for the enslaved fugitive. As we brainstormed offering up an African name
                     or 
                     naming him Neptune, after the ship on which he made his escape from 
                     Martinique, it became clear that the quandary presented by the fugitive's 
                     anonymity went beyond the technical problem of data entry. Would these alternatives
                     
                     suffice for our project? What exactly was our project?

                     enslaved people sought to move themselves beyond the reach of enslavers' power. As

                     within the limits of identities crafted by white supremacy?” 
                     [<a class="ref" href="#glover2020">Glover 2020</a>, 198] Working from this expansive understanding, 
                     <cite class="title italic">Mapping Marronage</cite> visualizes fugitivity not as discrete 
                     events but as an on-going process, a relationship to space and power that is in flux
                     and 
                     constantly negotiated in slaveholding societies. The digital visualization therefore
                     
                     traces the geographic reach, crossings, and intersections of letters, testimonies,
                     and 
                     financial exchanges by people of African descent who were either enslaved or lived
                     in 
                     proximity to slavery as, for example, the freeborn children of enslaved parents. Enslaved

                     the 
                     reach of slavery's oppression. At the same time, the far-reaching power of slavery
                     meant 
                     that mobility in and of itself did not automatically constitute resistance or marronage.
                     
                     Rather, various forms of what Carole Boyce Davies and Babacar 
                     M'Bow term coerced, voluntary, and induced movement characterized the circulation 
                     of Black people living in or in proximity to slavery in the Atlantic world, 
                     thus showing conditions and experiences of bondage that widen our field of vision

                     the plantation [<a class="ref" href="#davies_etal2007">Davies and M'Bow 2007</a>]. To the extent, then, that these

                     For 
                     Saidiya Hartman, the corpus of texts about slavery in the United 
                     States constitutes an “amputated body”, which in its 
                     dismemberment “holds out the possibility of restitution” 
                     [<a class="ref" href="#hartman1997">Hartman 1997</a>, 74]. Derek Walcott imagines the fragments

                     and cultural production as an act of care. Walcott's metaphor suggests a 
                     linear temporality that moves from “recovery” of the fragments 
                     of the broken vase, to “reconstitution” of the parts into a

                     does not have “a political purpose beyond documenting black

                     [<a class="ref" href="#helton_etal2015">Helton et al. 2015</a>, 11]. Stephen Best, in turn, explores 
                     what might be productive about the refusal of recovery. He contends that the impetus
                     behind 
                     the “recovery imperative” is the idea that 
                     “recovery from the slave past rests on a recovery of it” 
                     [<a class="ref" href="#best2018">Best 2018</a>, 13]. Best is particularly critical of what he 
                     terms “melancholy historicism”, which 
                     “provides for the view that history consists in the <em class="emph">taking

                     and divestment from the lost object, melancholia maintains a steadfast attachment
                     to and 
                     identification with that which is lost [<a class="ref" href="#best2018">Best 2018</a>, 68]. The alternative 
                     to melancholy historicism that Best offers “is certainly 
                     not history writing as we know it but a writing in full awareness of the negativity

                     of recovery as a paradox, “a divergence either between the affirmation 
                     of the recovered presence of enslaved people … or the refusal of the temptations of

                     Lowe proposes “hesitation” as a stance that does 
                     not move “immediately toward recovery” 
                     [<a class="ref" href="#lowe2015b">Lowe 2015b</a>, 40]. Rather than naming the anonymous fugitive and then

                     with 
                     what might be productive about his anonymity. In this way, we might think of hesitation
                     
                     not in opposition to or as an alternative to recovery, but rather as an interruption
                     in 
                     the putatively linear progression from recovery to repair.

                  <div class="ptext" id="p21">Beyond his act of maritime marronage — what Hilary Beckles defines as 
                     “the rebellious activities of those slaves who took to the sea in 
                     flight attempting to escape fully the geographical confines of their plantation 
                     bondage” — we know very little about the enslaved person who stole onto the 
                     France-bound vessel that left Martinique in the summer of 1837. 
                     If, like the Danish and French authorities who used a network of correspondence to
                     try to 
                     solve their legal conundrum, the fugitive too made use of his own 
                     “submerged networks” — the webbed exchange of information and 
                     services that made marronage for some a collective endeavor — the letters about him
                     do not 
                     say [<a class="ref" href="#eddins2022">Eddins 2022</a>, 172]. The narrative that we do have is marked by 
                     several acts of “unnaming”, that is, moments when language undoes meaning. Of his life 
                     the official record yields the following: 
                     <blockquote>
                        <p>que le noir en

                           frauduleusement par un navire qui l'avait pris au Sénégal; que son départ de 
                           la Martinique aurait été [illisible] d'une désertion, et qu'enfin l'intention du

                           departure from Martinique would have been [illegible] of a desertion, and finally 
                           that the intention of the <cite class="title italic">Neptune</cite>'s captain, on his first voyage 
                           to Martinique, is to return this Black to the planter whose slave he is

                     </blockquote> 
                     There is some indication too that the runaway was young, as one letter describes him
                     as 
                     “le jeune noir fugitif de la 
                     Martinique” (“the young Black fugitive from 
                     Martinique”) [<a class="ref" href="#duperre1837">Duperré 1837</a>, 1]. Although, as 
                     Habiba Ibrahim compellingly demonstrates in  <cite class="title italic">Black 
                        Age</cite>, what this attribution of youth means may be less a matter of biological age 
                     and more a question of the fictions that white observers and narrators project onto
                     Black 
                     captives' bodies.

                     this official account. First the euphemism “taken in Senegal” unnames the precise
                     conditions of his bondage. Kidnapping, capture, sale, the various terrible transactions
                     that may have moved the fugitive by force from Senegal to Martinique, are politely
                     smoothed over by the verb “taken,” at once simple and capacious in its potential meanings.<a class="noteRef" href="#d4e1056">[11]</a> Second, the language of illegality unnames his flight as an act of self-liberation.
                     Because his capture in Senegal was “fraudulent” and his escape from his enslaver in
                     Martinique was an act of “desertion,” his marronage counters one form of unsanctioned,
                     illegal movement with another. Ultimately, each instance of mobility puts him outside
                     the already constrained juridical freedoms allowed Black people in France, a country
                     that both disavowed slavery on its soil and codified its practice in law. </div>

                     of black geographies… we need to consider how the unknowable figures into the production
                     of space.” I read this as a form of hesitation, sitting with the unknowable and the
                     unknown to better understand not just how Black people move through space but also
                     how that movement produces space. These contemplations can in turn productively inform
                     our understanding and rendering of space. For example, we might consider how the unnamed
                     fugitive produced a space for his clandestine flight aboard the <span class="hi italic">Neptune</span>. He may have hidden in plain sight, boldly striding across the ship's deck in sailor's
                     garb. As Julius Scott (2018, pp. 109) notes, “Even slaves without experience at sea
                     could pick up some key nautical terms or perhaps a verse or two of a popular sea shanty
                     and pass themselves off as free sailors.”<a class="noteRef" href="#d4e1067">[12]</a> Although the letters that inaugurate his entry into slavery's archive begin with
                     his capture on the <span class="hi italic">Neptune, </span>tarrying at the docks disrupts this imposed temporal origin by dwelling on the period
                     before the ship when the fugitive may have engaged in the urban marronage that brought
                     so many other runaways to Caribbean port cities (Scott, 2018, pp. 21-22). Alternatively,
                     he may quite literally have produced space by fashioning a site of concealment somewhere
                     on the ship akin to the box that transported the fugitive Henry Box Brown (Brown and
                     Ernest, 2008) as cargo to Philadelphia, or the “loophole of retreat” that allowed
                     Harriet Jacobs (Jacobs and Mitchell, 2023) to both escape the clutches of her lascivious
                     enslaver and remain close to her children. </div>

                     Studies, or from the well-traveled colonial circuit between Senegal, Martinique, and
                     France and bring the <span class="hi italic">Neptune's </span>clandestine passenger into conceptual proximity with North American fugitives. As
                     Justin Dunnavant (2020, pp. 891) reminds us, “popular abolitionists such as Henry
                     Box Brown, Frederick Douglass, and Harriet Jacobs can be read as maritime maroons
                     in the literal sense that their flight was mediated, at least in part, by marinescapes.”
                     Nor is it a stretch, for the purposes of <span class="hi italic">Mapping Marronage, </span>to expand the maroon's geography by untethering our mapped coordinates for his flight
                     from the archival record. Already in the official correspondence there were indications
                     that his geography would always exceed the named territories of Senegal, Martinique,
                     Denmark, and France, for even as government officials tried to identify the correct
                     jurisdiction for his manumission case and thereby fix the geographic coordinates of
                     his legal status, they also acknowledged that at the time of their correspondence,
                     the maroon was somewhere in the North Sea en route to Le Havre. It is there in the
                     North Sea that we lose his archival trail, unmoored from land, from the “free soil”
                     that was supposed to grant him his liberty in France. Elena Schneider (2021, pp. 497)
                     writes of similar cases of maritime marronage to Cuba: “uplifting narratives of escape
                     could devolve into ongoing, labyrinthine struggles for autonomy, property, and protection,
                     proving Neil Roberts's thesis that Black ‘freedom' is an ongoing state of marronage.”
                     Between his enslavement in Martinique and the freedom he reached for as he sought
                     out French soil was a world of experience, knowledge, strategy, desire, chance; a
                     world reached for but not yet attained as the cold paper trail obliges us to leave
                     him there, floating in the North Sea. Following Elise Mitchell's (2022, pp. 209),
                     approach that “challenges the primacy of origins and destinations and emphasizes the
                     itinerant crossings and small places between them, where the enslaved stalled, were
                     abandoned…” why not untether him even further from the confinement of the official
                     record's limited geography and consider other connections to other “small places between?”

                     victim of nefarious kidnappers flouting European legal interdictions of the slave
                     trade (abolished by Denmark in 1803 and by France in 1817 and again in 1831), or as
                     a stowaway, the imagined possibilities for appropriating and producing space to create
                     sites of marronage serve as more than a reach for the speculative to fill in gaps
                     and silences. They illustrate the process of turning a “geography of containment”
                     into a “rival geography.” Rival geography has proven to be a mobile concept. Stephanie
                     Camp (2004, pp. 7) explains that it was first “coined by Edward Said and has been
                     used by geographers to describe resistance to colonial occupation.” From her own adaptation
                     of the term to refer to “alternative ways of knowing and using plantation and southern
                     space that conflicted with planters' ideal and demands,” it finds its way here to
                     describe how an African man, forcibly taken from Senegal and enslaved in Martinique,
                     briefly turned an instrument of captivity into a vessel for freedom. The enslaved
                     man crossed the ocean at least twice, first as cargo, and then as fugitive, and while
                     the <span class="hi italic">Neptune </span>in 1837 was not a slave ship, we already know to expect that if the creaking of its
                     rigging or the groaning of its wood reminded its clandestine passenger of another
                     journey on another ship, those who wrote about him probably did not know and likely
                     would not have cared. The correspondence about him does not — cannot — speak about
                     haunting, but Laurent Dubois (2020, pp. 919) aptly describes the dual meaning that
                     vessels on Atlantic waters carried, what may have felt like haunting for a Black person
                     on a ship: “All ships in the Atlantic World were, in a sense, haunted by the slave
                     ship, which in some ways was the defining vessel of the entire system. … And yet ships
                     were also a space of movement and represented the possibility of freedom…. They were
                     a space where there was a potential for individual freedom, for being on the sea was
                     a way to escape geographies of empire and juridical systems that locked people in
                     particular kinds of status and possibility.” If we imagine this  <span class="hi italic">Neptune </span>as haunted by the other <span class="hi italic">Neptunes </span>that, between 1730 and 1750, left Nantes, La Rochelle, and Le Havre (where the fugitive
                     was now headed), to ferry African captives from Ouidah and Aného (formerly little
                     Popo) to Martinique and Saint Domingue, then for a fleeting moment, the fugitive's
                     act of maritime marronage transforms his <span class="hi italic">Neptune </span>from a space haunted by a history of containment to an instrument of liberation.<a class="noteRef" href="#d4e1097">[13]</a> Lest we read this as a triumphant story of resistance, a letter addressed from “The
                     North Sea” reminds us of the conditions of entry into the archival record. With the
                     runaway's seizure by the captain, the  <span class="hi italic">Neptune </span>is transformed again into a site of captivity.</div>

                     of a story about flight stalled in the North Sea, when an enslaved man's production
                     of space temporarily turned a ship into something other than what its captain would
                     accept. “Maritime maroons,” Kevin Dawson (2021, pp. 443) reminds us, “were humanity
                     in fluid motion, daring to paddle and swim across slave ships' wake to rechart their
                     destinies and redefine the ocean according to African valuations.” If we return to
                     the possibility that the <span class="hi italic">Neptune's </span>maroon created a space of concealment on the ship not unlike well-known North American
                     fugitives, then untethering his geography from a strictly Caribbean or francophone
                     circuit through this conceptual proximity to a seemingly unrelated place, brings us
                     closer to honoring the spirit of his flight, if not through historical accuracy, then
                     through a deliberately “unruly geography” (Dunnavant, pp. 885). This practice of counter-hegemonic
                     cartography that charts space and movement against the current of imperial circuits,
                     is akin to what Dunnavant et. al (2023, pp. 1294-1319) describe in their method of
                     using geospatial modeling to the rival ends of “counter-mapping maroon cartographies.”<a class="noteRef" href="#d4e1113">[14]</a>

                     unmentioned in official correspondence, that my students and I settled on a way to
                     identify the fugitive on the digital map. We chose to model his name on that of a
                     Haitian monument to liberty, “Le marron inconnu de Saint Domingue” (“The Unknown Maroon
                     of Saint Domingue”). The  <span class="hi italic">Neptune's</span> unwanted passenger therefore entered our <span class="hi italic">Mapping Marronage</span> database as “First name: Unnamed, Last name: Fugitive.” Like Sasha Turner (2017,
                     pp. 245), who insists in her writing about “the nameless and the forgotten” that “the
                     work of maternal grief in slavery affirms the invisible suffering of the enslaved,”
                     we tried to reach for an appellation that makes present what cannot be seen but must
                     have been there. <span class="hi italic">He must have had a name. </span>We hoped that “Unnamed Fugitive,” instead of recovering that lost name, would honor
                     his desire not to be apprehended, all the while affirming that he had once been called
                     something other than property. We imagined “Unnamed Fugitive” as a choice that refuses
                     anonymity but — in the event that the maroon declined to give his name to authorities
                     in an act of self-preservation — still “let[s] fugitives remain at large” (Childs,

                     and in proximity to monuments to Toussaint L'Ouverture, Jean Jacques Dessalines, Alexandre
                     Petion, and Henri Christophe has served as a malleable symbol of Haitian national
                     identity for several decades. Dimitri Bechaq (2007) argues that different political
                     entities have imbued the monument with various meanings over time. For the Black nationalist
                     <span class="hi italic">noiriste </span>ideology of François Duvalier, under whose brutal regime the monument was constructed
                     between 1967 and 1968, the Unknown Maroon was conscripted to symbolize an unbroken
                     line from Black fugitives in the period of slavery to Haiti's Black (as opposed to
                     mixed-race) political leadership in the 20th century. For UNESCO during the commemoration
                     of the abolition of slavery in 2004, the monument signaled Haiti's place as the cornerstone
                     of freedom and independence in the Caribbean. The Unknown Maroon stands in for the
                     many who absconded. Naming the <span class="hi italic">Neptune's </span>fugitive after this symbol of multiple flights in turn asks those many nameless maroons
                     to stand in for the one.<a class="noteRef" href="#d4e1176">[15]</a> Our choice to bring the Unnamed Fugitive into the orbit of Haitian marronage by modeling
                     his name after the Unknown Maroon also functions much like the reading of his hiding
                     spaces alongside those of Brown and Jacobs. It allows us to, if not entirely untether
                     him from the geographies inscribed in and circumscribed by official correspondence
                     (Senegal-Martinique-Denmark-France), at least expand that geography beyond the archive's
                     limits. </div>

                  <div class="ptext" id="p29">Is this expanded geography an act of repair? Or, given some of the troubling ways
                     that the historical figure of the Unknown Maroon has been recuperated for contemporary
                     political ends, “are reclamation, preservation, and remembrance merely a question
                     of re-enacting hegemony?” (McKittrick and Woods, 2007, pp. 5). McKittrick and Woods
                     again offer us a way forward when they note that “inserting black geographies into
                     our worldview” can trouble “dominant modes of geographic thought” and allow us to
                     “consider alternative ways of imagining the world” (2007, pp. 5). We might go further,
                     then, to imagine how unmooring the fugitive from the Danish site of his discovery
                     — the site at which he was most visible to the law — and bringing him into proximity
                     with other maroons in the Americas might allow us to render space differently, to
                     recreate the map entirely rather than simply inserting him into existing coordinates.
                     The Unnamed Fugitive poses a problem for mapping marronage, not because he is anonymous,
                     but because we sought to place him within the bounds of a map that cannot sufficiently
                     account for Black fugitive geographies. Perhaps then his unnaming can only be accounted
                     for, not by counter-mapping the terraqueous geography of his flight, but by unmapping
                     his marronage. </div>

                     time I have had occasions to reflect not only on what I hope my students took away
                     from the course, but also on what I learned from them and their struggles to tell
                     an “impossible story” (Hartman, 2008, 10). Because the Unnamed Fugitive's story brought
                     us to the limits of recovery and repair — he remains, after all, anonymous and I remain
                     ambivalent about what this appellation does and undoes — the lesson I have come away
                     with casts the future of <span class="hi italic">Mapping Marronage </span>in doubt. Bold lines slashing out across the ocean from one landmass to another, cannot
                     render all the ways Black people moved furtively, guided by knowledge their pursuers
                     could not access, impelled by desires their captors would not know to recognize. A
                     database is not a memorial. A map is not a commemoration. Cartography cannot represent
                     Black geographies of fugitivity unless it disrupts far more than spatial coordinates.
                     In his unraveling of our medium, then, the Unnamed Fugitive nudges us to consider
                     what it would look like to instead unmap enslaved people's mobility. In this, I am
                     guided by two digital humanities projects invested in the work of undoing.  </div>

                  <div class="ptext" id="p31">(<span class="hi italic">Un)Silencing Slavery: Remembering the Enslaved at Rose Hall Plantation, Jamaica</span> is a companion website to Celia Naylor's book <span class="hi italic">Unsilencing Slavery: Telling Truths About Rose Hall Plantation, Jamaica. </span>The website's objective “is to respectfully and lovingly remember and hold space for
                     the enslaved Africans and their enslaved African-born and Caribbean-born descendants
                     who lived and labored at Rose Hall Plantation in Jamaica.” Naylor's larger project
                     of unearthing information about the people who were enslaved on the plantation grew
                     out of her frustration that the narrative available to tourists who visited the site
                     focuses on the plantation's owners and excludes the enslaved entirely. Naylor's point
                     of departure was to undo the narrative of Rose Hall Plantation, both the fictional
                     stories told about it and the silence around enslaved people that engenders yet another
                     kind of fiction. As Naylor (2022, pp. 7) explains, her work is an exercise in “attending
                     (and tending) to the erasure and recasting of slavery and Black suffering and survival
                     in the contemporary tours at Rose Hall Great House.” Strikingly, over and over again
                     in her book, the primary manifestation of this erasure is the anonymity of the enslaved,
                     and the first step to redress, it seems, is to restore their names. Naylor (pp. 27)
                     affirms that to disrupt the official Rose Hall narrative “is to begin to name those
                     enslaved who have been unremembered and unmemorialized; it is to begin to reconstruct
                     stories buried and deemed unworthy of telling and retelling; it is to begin to reimagine
                     the struggles, suffering, and sanctity of people enslaved (though not entirely dehumanized).”
                     “Retelling, “reconstruct[ing],” but first, naming. Given my own ambivalence about
                     recovery and repair, what I find most productive about Naylor's companion website
                     is how its form works against ideas of recovery as inserting lost information back
                     into an extant historical record. In her book's opening chapters, Naylor walks readers
                     carefully through a detailed description of the archive as a physical space and material
                     object. Through words and a series of photographs, she shows how the archive is structured
                     through lists that enumerate names, births, deaths, economic value, clothing allowances.
                     In a particularly powerful and moving meditation elsewhere, Naylor (2023) has reflected
                     on the experience of seeing her own name and variations thereof — Celia and Cecelia
                     — on some of these lists. Far from an abstraction, “the archive” is a room in which
                     Naylor sits, yearning for fuller records, and where she is confronted instead with
                     the epistemic violence of witnessing people — some called by her own name — be rendered
                     as property through lists that we might understand today as early databases.  </div>

                  <div class="ptext" id="p32">And yet despite, or perhaps because of this careful attention to enumeration in her
                     book, lists themselves are not the organizing frame for the companion website. <span class="hi italic">(Un)silencing Slavery</span> does present the forgotten names of those enslaved at Rose Hall Plantation, but it
                     does so in the form of flower petals. Selecting the name of each enslaved person in
                     a list on the right-hand side of the screen illuminates a single petal of the larger
                     yellow-pink-purple hued flower, revealing a brief biography, what Naylor has gleaned
                     about that person's life. Naylor's visualization began in analog mode as a series
                     of concentric circles she drew on paper to imagine the enslaved people at Rose Hall
                     as part of a community tree. Tree rings are a historical record of the environment.
                     They tell tales about age and time, about stressors looming deep in the soil and life
                     teeming in branches above. They may be the thick etching of abundant rainfall, the
                     blackened scar of a wildfire year, or the telltale mark of how high deadly floodwaters
                     rose. But we can only read those stories after the work of sharp blade against bark
                     and xylem is done. The rings of Naylor's chopped down tree on paper are carried over
                     to the digital flower as a faint visual echo of black dots; a digital flower that
                     in its evocative and terrible beauty, leans “towards life and growth” (Gil). Naylor's
                     flower is an acknowledgement of slavery's violence, and a need to make visible too,
                     the forms of care and kinship and community that did exist among the enslaved at Rose
                     Hall. This is a project of undoing by unraveling form, refusing “the sharp edges of
                     social scientific graphic conventions” (Gil) and tending instead the fragile, rounded
                     petals of a digital rose. </div>

                     then unmapping is about unknowing and uncharting the territory.” In a course titled

                     collaboration that balances delicately between guidance and autonomy. Our work may
                     very well yield a map to nowhere at all (<span class="hi italic">tant mieux!)</span>. I do know that rather than “improving” the existing digital map, I intend to have
                     both iterations of the website — the current one that maps marronage and another that
                     unmaps it — viewable in tandem, allowing users to see not just a finished product,
                     but the process of unraveling and remaking. M. Jacqui Alexander (2005, pp. 290) writes
                     that “crossings are never undertaken all at once, and never once and for all.” It
                     is my hope that by evolving into a site that is transparently iterative, <span class="hi italic">Mapping Marronage </span>will illustrate the fits and starts of maroon journeys, and the many stops along the
                     way to freedom. </div>
