                  <p>In this paper, I examine the ethics and pedagogical implications of unnaming for the
                     political project of 
                     historical recovery. Digital humanities projects on slavery often proffer the reparative
                     promise of serving as 
                     public-facing works that seek to recover enslaved people's lives from archival erasure.
                     I contend that by entwining 
                     the immaterial digital commemoration of The Unnamed Fugitive with the material monument
                     to Le Marron Inconnu, my 
                     students' interpretive choices illuminate the ways that deliberate unnaming can enact
                     a shift away from anonymity 
                     and erasure and, in turn, a move towards productive engagement with the limits of
                     knowledge and recovery in 
                     slavery's archive.

                  <div class="ptext" id="p1">In the summer of 1837, an incident in international waters set off an exchange of
                     urgent letters between the French Consul in Denmark, the French Naval Ministry, and
                     the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Paris (Molé, 1837, pp. 1). An enslaved man had
                     been found aboard the  <span class="hi italic">Neptune</span>, a ship traveling from Martinique to the port of Le Havre. Presumably discovered
                     as the vessel neared or reached Helsingør, a coastal town north of Copenhagen, the
                     fugitive now appeared to be held on board by the captain as the vessel continued en
                     route to Le Havre. What was to be done with the stowaway? Did his case for manumission
                     come under Danish jurisdiction or rather fall under French law? Did he even have a
                     case for manumission, having fled Martinique without his enslaver's accord? As the
                     French Minister of the Navy explained to his colleagues, various legislative measures
                     including the law of March 4, 1831, and the Royal Ordinance of April 29, 1836, laid
                     out the conditions by which an enslaved person could travel from the colonies to the
                     metropole. The ability to claim freedom upon arrival in France, he wrote, was only
                     applicable if the enslaved person had been sent to France lawfully by his enslaver
                     (Duperré, 1837, pp. 1). On his part, the       <span class="hi italic">Neptune's </span>captain was adamant that he would return the fugitive to his enslaver at the first
                     opportunity on his next voyage to Martinique (Duperré, 1837, pp. 1). If by stowing
                     away on the ship, the fugitive had hoped to avail himself of the promise of liberty
                     espoused by the Freedom Principle, that hope now seemed illusory as the    <span class="hi italic">Neptune </span>sailed onward to France.<a class="noteRef" href="#d4e187">[1]</a> The <span class="hi italic">Neptune's </span>fugitive presented a legal conundrum for authorities in the 19th century. When undergraduate
                     students at the University of Michigan encountered records of his flight in the fall
                     of 2021, he presented a different kind of conundrum, this time for identifying him
                     and piecing together his story, because as students soon discovered, throughout the
                     letters exchanged about the fugitive, he was never once named!</div>
                  
                  <div class="counter"><a href="#p2">2</a></div>
                  <div class="ptext" id="p2">My students came to the scant paper trail of the fugitive's flight as part of their
                     coursework for “Mapping the French Atlantic.” Housed in the Department of Romance
                     Languages and Literatures, “Mapping the French Atlantic” was a French course supported
                     by a 2018 Technology Services New Initiatives/New Instruction Grant in the College
                     of Literature, Science, and the Arts. The grant aimed to foster inclusive teaching
                     practices that made innovative use of technology and was awarded to fund two primary
                     expenses required for “Mapping the French Atlantic.” The first was to engage the services
                     of Agile Humanities Agency, a software, design, and consulting collective, to create
                     a digital map of the movement of enslaved people in the Atlantic world. The second
                     expense was travel to archives in Fort de-France, Port-au-Prince, Montreal, and New
                     York City, to digitize records about enslaved people that would serve as primary sources
                     from which students would gather the information required to populate the digital
                     map. </div>

                  <div class="ptext" id="p3">“Mapping the French Atlantic” sits somewhere at the intersection of digital humanities,
                     history, and literary studies. Its objective was to use digital mapping methods to
                     retrace the movements of enslaved people throughout the Atlantic world as they navigated
                     slavery, freedom, and citizenship in the 18th and 19th centuries. In so doing, the
                     course aimed to guide students in a critical reflection on how maps shape our understanding
                     of the world, and on what mapping movement might reveal about the relationship between
                     mobility and power.<a class="noteRef" href="#d4e202">[2]</a> Course readings ranged from novels to theoretical texts to primary sources that allowed
                     students to engage with these questions. Sue Peabody's (1996) <span class="hi italic">There are No Slaves in France: The Political Culture of Race and Slavery in the Ancien
                        Régime </span>and <span class="hi italic">Madeleine's Children: Family, Freedom, Secrets, and Lies in France's Indian Ocean
                        Colonies </span>(2017) provided important social and legal context needed to understand the terms
                     of Black people's mobility in the French Atlantic. These texts showed how laws such
                     as the 1777 <span class="hi italic">Police des noirs</span> and the later laws evoked by the Minister of the Navy in his correspondence about
                     the <span class="hi italic">Neptune's </span>fugitive, constrained movement and in the process made Blackness synonymous with enslavement.
                     Michel-Rolph Trouillot's (1991) <span class="hi italic">Silencing the Past: Power and the Production of History </span>and Maryse Condé's (1981) <span class="hi italic">Moi, Tituba sorcière…noire de Salem </span>offered rich material for thinking about how to tell other kinds of stories about
                     enslaved people in ways that are cognizant of archival lacunae and that nonetheless
                     work to recover narratives of their lives. Finally, articles by Caroline Séveno (2008),
                     and Camille Lefebvre and Isabelle Surun (2008), laid out the politics of maps and
                     their use in colonial conquest in Africa, while writings by Britt Rusert (2017) and
                     Lauren F. Klein (2013) explored the ethics and stakes of digitally rendering Black
                     lives. The goal of our discussions of these readings over two-thirds of the semester
                     was to lay the intellectual groundwork for students' final projects.    </div>
                  
                  <div class="counter"><a href="#p4">4</a></div>
                  <div class="ptext" id="p4">The final project itself consisted of only a few lines that amount to barely a paragraph.
                     This length constraint, necessitated by the small size of the tooltip that accompanies
                     each geographic point on the digital map, required my students to work with an economy
                     of words. And so, in the final third of the semester, students were assigned to small
                     groups of three or four. Each group was allocated a dossier pertaining to an enslaved
                     person, and that contained all the records I could find about that person's life in
                     my travels to archives in the Caribbean, the United States, and France. Working in
                     their small groups, students extracted all the geographical data they could find and
                     used that to plot the person's trajectory on the digital map. But, as many scholars
                     have shown, data extraction on its own can hardly tell a true or complete or just
                     story about the lives of people who were often reduced to numbers in ledgers or criminals
                     in court records. <a class="noteRef" href="#d4e227">[3]</a> Students were therefore also required to sit with these documents and work out for
                     themselves — with guidance from our course texts — how they might tell the person's
                     story otherwise. The result, for each group, was a short biographical narrative that
                     introduces and contextualizes each person's trajectory on the map. </div>

                  <div class="ptext" id="p5">Ultimately, “Mapping the French Atlantic” as a course, and the resulting digital visualization,
                     <span class="hi italic">Mapping Marronage</span>, were projects in recovery. Their aim was to recover what fragments we could of enslaved
                     people's lives, piece them together into a narrative — biographies that for many of
                     the people we studied would never be written otherwise — and in the process, learn
                     something about how people who were enslaved or lived in proximity to slavery articulated
                     ideas about freedom and belonging through movement. In the first iteration of the
                     course in 2018, students huddled in small groups around screens in the computer lab
                     as they entered their data into the map, and we watched in collective amazement and
                     pride as <a href="http://www.mappingmarronage.com" onclick="window.open('http://www.mappingmarronage.com'); return false" class="ref">www.mappingmarronage.com</a> went live with the stories and movements of the first six people whose journeys were
                     charted on the map: Armelle Conan, the enslaved woman who bore the children of royal
                     botanist Jean-Baptiste-Christophe Fusée-Aublet; Edouard Calabar who like the <span class="hi italic">Neptune's </span>stowaway was enslaved in Martinique, but unlike the fugitive, managed to lay claim
                     to freedom in France via the Ordinance of April 29, 1836; Joseph Bologne, Chevalier
                     de Saint-Georges, who was born to an enslaved woman and whose classical music prowess
                     has gained increasing recognition in recent decades, Marie-Joseph Angélique tried
                     and executed for an alleged act of arson that set Montreal ablaze; Charles-Pierre
                     Lambert and his descendants whose musical talents reverberated from New Orleans to
                     France to Brazil to Portugal; and Pierre Toussaint, who began life in slavery in Saint
                     Domingue and became hairdresser to New York City's elite in the 19th century. </div>

                  <div class="ptext" id="p6">In the second iteration of the course in 2021, when the COVID-19 pandemic made huddling
                     around a shared computer screen a veritable health hazard, and with protests after
                     the police murders of Breonna Taylor and George Floyd lending a new sense of urgency
                     to our discussions, students found community and solidarity by collaborating online
                     to tell the stories of a new group of enslaved people. One of these was the stowaway
                     discovered aboard the  <span class="hi italic">Neptune.</span>
                     <a class="noteRef" href="#d4e247">[4]</a> Yet, as students worked to salvage biographical details to visually present the story
                     of the enslaved man's origins, capture, flight, and discovery on the digital map,
                     they found that for all they would never know about their subject, his anonymity proved
                     to be the most fundamental obstacle of all. </div>

                  <div class="ptext" id="p7">It is rare to find scholarly work on the transatlantic slave trade and slavery that
                     does not include the now-familiar lament about gaps and silences in the archives.
                     Scant documents, partial records, and deliberate distortions attest to the far-reaching
                     violence that the institution of slavery unleashed on those in bondage and continues
                     to enact on their descendants.<a class="noteRef" href="#d4e256">[5]</a> Despite embarking on the <span class="hi italic">Mapping Marronage</span> project with this anticipation of archival lacunae, the absence of the <span class="hi italic">Neptune</span> fugitive's name was more debilitating for our work than we expected. From the very
                     inception of  <span class="hi italic">Mapping Marronage</span>, it was clear that we could not design a website that would require two mandatory
                     name fields for data entry as the practice of slavery in the Americas often involved
                     denying enslaved people a patronym in order to transform them more completely into
                     property, to sever them from community, and to render genealogy and lineage impossible.<a class="noteRef" href="#d4e267">[6]</a> On a technical and practical level, the fugitive's anonymity meant that we had no
                     data to enter into the mandatory name field that the software required to create an
                     entry on the digital map. Without at least one name to identify the man, we could
                     not move forward. My students and I considered several acts of substitution to fill
                     in this gap presented by the documented disregard for the enslaved fugitive. As we
                     brainstormed offering up an African name or naming him Neptune, after the ship on
                     which he made his escape from Martinique, it became clear that the quandary presented
                     by the fugitive's anonymity went beyond the technical problem of data entry. Would
                     these alternatives suffice for our project? What exactly was our project? </div>

                     with the uncomfortable, messy, and unquantifiable,” I remain uncertain that  <span class="hi italic">Mapping Marronage </span>is able to “refuse disposability.” For this reason, and somewhat against the grain
                     of argumentation and thesis, this article reaches for the modest goal of simply documenting

                     that collectively” seek to redress or restore the loss wrought by chattel slavery,
                     if not of human lives then, at least of our knowledge about those lives now. In this
                     non-exhaustive assemblage of digital projects, recovery names various things from
                     filling in archival lacunae to telling stories that deliberately run counter to the
                     official record, from restitution to restoration to repair. </div>

                  <div class="ptext" id="p9">Scholars note that historical recovery is an urgent political imperative as “recovering
                     the histories of Africans in the Americas originally emerged as an abolitionist tool
                     in the nineteenth century and would remain inextricable from black freedom struggles
                     well into the twentieth century.” They argue too that “the violence of Atlantic slavery
                     was so great, and the limits of its archive so absolute, that no amount of historical
                     recovery could properly describe it, let alone begin to undo its damage” (Helton,
                     et al., 2015, pp. 2).  Were we then to acquiesce to the anonymity to which the historical
                     records had consigned the <span class="hi italic">Neptune's </span>clandestine passenger? At the same time, what can be recovered of and for someone
                     who cannot even be named? The fugitive's namelessness complicated our ideas about
                     recovery as a straightforward act of writing back into archival gaps and silences,
                     “a consoling filling in of blank spaces, a giving voice to the long-muted subjects
                     of history” (Christiansë, 2013, pp. 35). By locating my students' attempt to tell
                     the story of the anonymous stowaway at the site of a generative tension between the
                     imperative of recovery and its impossibility, this reflection examines how anonymity
                     brings us to the limits of historical recovery, and how those limits might suggest
                     other ways of unmapping enslaved people's mobility.  	</div>

                  <span class="hi italic">Mapping Marronage</span> is an interactive visualization of the trans-Atlantic networks that enslaved people
                  created in the 18th and 19th centuries. Marronage, as conceptualized in this project,
                  takes as its point of departure the core definition of the word in Black Atlantic
                  history to mean the process of removing oneself from slavery.<a class="noteRef" href="#d4e293">[7]</a>
                  <span class="hi italic">Mapping Marronage </span>considers this removal expansively beyond flight from plantations to mountains or
                  swamps, and considers as marronage any act by which enslaved people sought to move
                  themselves beyond the reach of slaveholders' power. As Kaiama Glover (2020, pp. 198)
                  poignantly asks, “What is <span class="hi italic">marronage</span> . . . if not the expression of selves imagined otherwise than within the limits of
                  identities crafted by white supremacy?” Working from this expansive understanding,
                  <span class="hi italic">Mapping Marronage</span> visualizes fugitivity not as discrete events but as an on-going process, a relationship
                  to space and power that is in flux and constantly negotiated in slaveholding societies.
                  The digital visualization therefore traces the geographic reach, crossings, and intersections
                  of letters, testimonies, and financial exchanges by people of African descent who
                  were either enslaved or lived in proximity to slavery as, for example, the freeborn
                  children of enslaved parents. Enslaved women, men, and children sought to move — with
                  varying degrees of success — beyond the reach of slavery's oppression. At the same
                  time, the far-reaching power of slavery meant that mobility in and of itself did not
                  automatically constitute resistance or marronage. Rather, various forms of what Carole
                  Boyce Davies and Babacar M'Bow (2007) term coerced, voluntary, and induced movement
                  characterized the circulation of Black people living in or in proximity to slavery
                  in the Atlantic world, and show conditions and experiences of bondage that widen our
                  field of vision beyond the plantation. To the extent then, that these different forms
                  of mobility recorded in advertisements for runaways, correspondence, financial remittances,
                  and court documents constituted enslaved people's self-articulations, these instances
                  of mobility form the core data for the digital map.  </div>

                  accessible than the institutional repositories across Europe and the Americas from
                  which I first obtained those records. Behind the scenes, the two cohorts of “Mapping
                  the French Atlantic” students who have contributed to the map for their final class
                  projects were charged with the mandate to “tell the life story of an enslaved person
                  that has never been told before.” In this regard, <span class="hi italic">Mapping Marronage</span> is like many other digital humanities projects that center on slavery, at whose core

                  draw attention to those about whom “we know relatively little…because so few have
                  left any records of their existence.” The <span class="hi italic">Legacy of Slavery in Maryland</span> project has nearly identical goals for a different region of the Atlantic world,
                  “to discover unknown ‘heroes' of slave flight and resistance.” Recovery serves a specific
                  purpose, to reconstitute historical fragments into a more complete story. In David
                  Eltis' discussion of the methodology used to produce the updated version of the <span class="hi italic">Slave Voyages Database</span>, the project's inclusion of the names of enslaved people “provide(s) an extraordinary
                  source for historical reconstruction of the history of the African peoples in America”
                  (Eltis, 2018). For the <span class="hi italic">Documenting Africans in Trans-Atlantic Slavery (DATAS/IASET)</span> project team, their tool for analyzing ethnonyms allows for a more effective method
                  of “reconstructing the emergence of the African diaspora.” And it is through recovery

                  of digital humanities projects about slavery and its immediate aftermath surveyed
                  above, are sometimes entwined with the language of repair. To be sure, the task of
                  coaxing fragments from unyielding archives and reconstituting them into a cohesive
                  account of the lives and experiences of the enslaved is one that is fraught with peril.
                  Régine Jean-Charles (2016, pp. 99) asks, “what and whom does the remembrance and reanimation
                  of the slave past serve?” For several digital projects that examine the history of
                  slavery in institutions such as universities and the church, the work of recovery
                  offers a direct path to some form of reparations. Users of the interactive map  <span class="hi italic">Enslaved by the Church, Sold for the Republic</span>, can toggle between historical documents that reveal the identities of those enslaved
                  on parish plantations in Réunion, and news about descendants' present-day advocacy
                  for “recognition and redress” from the Jesuits and the Catholic church. <span class="hi italic">The Georgetown Slavery Archive</span> is a direct offshoot of the Georgetown University Working Group on Slavery, Memory,
                  and Reconciliation whose website outlines the university's recent commitment to a
                  form of institutional reparations by considering applicants' status as descendants
                  of people enslaved by the Maryland Province of Jesuits, as a factor in admission.
                  Other institutions of higher education have considered modes of repair beyond college
                  admissions. <span class="hi italic">Honoring the Enslaved</span> by St. Mary's College of Maryland is a digital archive of the college's steps toward
                  “re-making our world anew” by erecting a monument at the site of enslaved people's
                  living quarters on campus. In grappling with its involvement in slavery, Villanova
                  University's <span class="hi italic">The Rooted Project </span>aims to write “a new history… to give all students, prospective students, and alumni

                  suturing severed genealogical lines, emerge too in projects that are not directly
                  tied to institutional and financial reparations. The <span class="hi italic">Enslaved: Peoples of the Historical Slave Trade </span>project frames its work as one of “reparative scholarship.” <span class="hi italic">Last Road to Freedom </span>is a digital repository of records about African Americans during the Civil War that
                  is premised on the hope that “for their descendants, paths to freedom include interpreting

                  reunite with family after emancipation, solicits testimonies from users today who

                  the most explicitly stated work of repair is the  <span class="hi italic">Slave Rebellion Reenactment, </span>a collaborative work of performance art by Dred Scott and John Akomfrah, whose companion
                  website archives snippets of a 2019 reenactment of the German Coast Uprising of 1811.

               <div class="ptext" id="p16">I gather these quotes from a broad range of digital projects because juxtaposing their
                  stated aims not only reveals the close entwinement of the language of historical recovery
                  with ideas about repair, but also shows the myriad ways in which repair is understood,
                  even when it is not explicitly defined.<a class="noteRef" href="#d4e369">[8]</a> Across these projects, financial reparations, political acknowledgement, symbolic
                  commemoration, reconnecting severed family bonds, and producing new historical accounts
                  that undo violence and erasure, all come together to offer some form of redress for
                  the losses of the past. The common language of repair that undergirds all the aforementioned
                  projects shows that when reconstituting enslaved people's histories, our desire for
                  recovery is often a desire for healing (Hartman, 2008). We recuperate the lives of
                  the enslaved by carefully reassembling the scant pieces of information strewn about
                  the archival record. That such work, invested as it is in “repair, redemption, and
                  recuperation” (Jean-Charles, 2016, pp. 88) is risky and largely impossible has been
                  amply explored in scholarship (Best, 2012). Metaphors abound for the inevitable losses,
                  absences, and silences that mark the stories salvaged from slavery's archive. For
                  Saidiya Hartman (1997, pp. 74), the corpus of texts about slavery in the United States
                  constitutes an “amputated body,” which in its dismemberment “holds out the possibility
                  of restitution.” Derek Walcott (1993) imagines the fragments of Antillean history
                  as pieces of a broken vase, the act of restoration through artistic and cultural production
                  as an act of care. Walcott's metaphor suggests a linear temporality that moves from
                  “recovery” of the fragments of the broken vase, to “reconstitution” of the parts into
                  a whole that then becomes the “repaired” object. </div>
               
               <div class="counter"><a href="#p17">17</a></div>
               <div class="ptext" id="p17">The fragmentation in the archive therefore shapes the stories that can and cannot
                  be told about the slave past. It determines the recuperative possibilities of work
                  undertaken by artists and historians.<a class="noteRef" href="#d4e374">[9]</a> We read “along the bias grain” in order to “subvert archival intent” and disrupt
                  the representational power of the enslaver's record (Fuentes, 2016, pp. 7 &amp; 44). We
                  search for ghosts, the shadowy presences that haunt the archives (Gordon, 2008). Through
                  the sieve of collective memory, we sift pieces of the past, “allowing the smaller
                  matter to go through and leaving only the larger material behind” (Jean-Charles, 2016,
                  pp. 86). We engage in “critical fabulation” to attempt the impossible, a “collective
                  biography of dead subjects” that aims to “paint as full a picture of the lives of
                  the captives as possible (Hartman, 2012, pp. 3 &amp; 11).” Taken together, these “carefully
                  devised modes of counter-reading the archive,” (Helton et al, 2015, pp. 2) both despite
                  and because of the impossibility of doing so, show the ever present but also generative
                  tension between the reality of fragmentation and our reaching for wholeness. The attempt
                  to recover something of enslaved people's stories holds out the redemptive and reparative
                  promise of locating, even if only fleetingly, their interior lives, their obscured,
                  denied subjectivity.</div>

               <div class="ptext" id="p18">When the anonymous fugitive stole away onto the <span class="hi italic">Neptune</span> in the summer of 1837, he perhaps hoped that his flight would put him beyond the
                  reach, if not of the institution of slavery, at the very least of the enslaver who
                  kept him in bondage in Martinique. When my students and I worked in the fall of 2021
                  to piece together the fragments of his life story as it unfolded across government
                  correspondence, we hoped to honor his marronage — thwarted as it had been by his discovery
                  on board the ship — by wresting his narrative from the anonymizing correspondence
                  between French and Danish officials and telling his story otherwise. Like the digital
                  humanities projects that enact an alternative end to a crushed slave uprising, or
                  that invite contemporary users to piece together severed kinship bonds by completing
                  the search for family members begun by their ancestors newly emancipated from slavery,
                  or else that ask us to not only acknowledge fugitives but to “imagine ourselves running
                  with them, tracing routes of refuge and pathways to freedom within a tragic world
                  of captivity and coercion,” (Brown) <span class="hi italic">Mapping Marronage</span> too sought to move between the fugitive's time and our own, and in so doing, restore
                  to him the autonomous mobility that he may have reached for through his escape from
                  Martinique. What my students and I were up against, then, was not solely a lack of
                  data to enter into the software but a challenge to our hopes for repair. His anonymity
                  brought us to the limits of our reparative project by raising a series of questions:
                  Is historical recovery required for repair? How do gaps and silences in slavery's
                  archive — such as the fugitive's anonymity — complicate the very idea of the reparative
                  that underlines digital projects seeking to bring past and present into closer relation?

                  <span class="hi italic">can </span>recover the histories, lives, and voices of enslaved people is a current of scholarship
                  that questions whether we <span class="hi italic">should</span>. As the authors of “The Question of Recovery: An Introduction” (Helton et. al., 2015,
                  pp. 11) note, if recovery does not have “a political purpose beyond documenting black
                  presence,” then it becomes “merely a plea for inclusion within the foundational promises
                  of liberal modernity.” Stephen Best in turn explores what might be productive about
                  the refusal of recovery. He contends that the impetus behind the “recovery imperative”
                  is the idea that “recovery from the slave past rests on a recovery of it” (Best, 2018,
                  pp. 13). Best (2018, pp. 15) is particularly critical of what he terms “melancholy
                  historicism,” which “provides for the view that history consists in the  <span class="hi italic">taking possession</span> of such grievous experience and archival loss.” In contradistinction to mourning's
                  acceptance of loss and divestment from the lost object, melancholia maintains a steadfast
                  attachment to and identification with that which is lost (Best, 2018, pp. 68). The
                  alternative to melancholy historicism that Best offers “is certainly not history writing
                  as we know it but a writing in full awareness of the negativity that labors to undo
                  any historical project” (2018, pp. 25).  </div>

               <div class="ptext" id="p20">In considering how interdisciplinary methods might prove useful for nuancing ideas
                  about recovery, I am particularly drawn to Lisa Lowe's (2015a, pp. 85) exploration
                  of the question of recovery as a paradox, “a divergence either between the affirmation
                  of the recovered presence of enslaved people … or the refusal of the temptations of
                  recovery.” In response to this paradox, Lowe proposes “hesitation” as a stance that
                  does not move “immediately toward recovery” (2015b; pp. 40).” Rather than naming the
                  anonymous fugitive and then moving on to write the rest of his recovered biography,
                  hesitation allows us to tarry with what might be productive about his anonymity. In
                  this way, we might think of hesitation not in opposition to or as an alternative to
                  recovery, but rather as an interruption in the putatively linear progression from
                  recovery to repair. </div>

                  Because the course was taught in French, a second language for nearly all the students
                  in the class, we were obliged to tarry not only in the face of recorded facts and
                  glaring omissions, but also in the presence of language. With historical dictionaries
                  in hand and Trouillot's <span class="hi italic">Silencing the Past </span>uppermost in our minds, we had to consider not only what the records say happened
                  to the <span class="hi italic">Neptune's </span>clandestine passenger, but also the <span class="hi italic">how</span> of their narration. What do we learn about how the language of the law determined
                  the possibilities of freedom for the enslaved man in flight? What might we glimpse
                  when we focus on the anonymity of the <span class="hi italic">Neptune's </span>stowaway that we would otherwise not see if we moved immediately towards trying to
                  repair the injurious loss of his name wrought by his anonymity in French government
                  correspondence? Let us linger here, with the unknown. </div>

               <div class="ptext" id="p23">Beyond his act of maritime marronage — what Hilary Beckles (1985) defines as “the
                  rebellious activities of those slaves who took to the sea in flight attempting to
                  escape fully the geographical confines of their plantation bondage” — we know very
                  little about the enslaved person who stole onto the France-bound vessel that left
                  Martinique in the summer of 1837. If, like the Danish and French authorities who used
                  a network of correspondence to try to solve their legal conundrum, the fugitive too
                  made use of his own “submerged networks” (Eddins, pp. 172) — the webbed exchange of
                  information and services that made marronage for some a collective endeavor — the
                  letters about him do not say. The narrative that we do have is marked by several acts
                  of “unnaming,” that is, moments when language undoes meaning. Of his life the official
                  record yields the following: “que le noir en question ne serait pas né à la Martinique,
                  mais y aurait été introduit frauduleusement par un navire qui l'avait pris au Sénégal ;
                  que son départ de la Martinique aurait été [illisible] d'une désertion, et qu'enfin
                  l'intention du capitaine du <span class="hi italic">Neptune </span>serait, lors de son premier voyage à la Martinique, de rendre ce noir à l'habitant
                  dont il était lesclave” (“that the Black in question was not born in Martinique but
                  was brought there fraudulently by a vessel that had taken him in Senegal; that his
                  departure from Martinique would have been [illegible] of a desertion, and finally
                  that the intention of the <span class="hi italic">Neptune's </span>captain, on his first voyage to Martinique, is to return this Black to the planter
                  whose slave he is”) (Duperré, 1837, pp. 1).<a class="noteRef" href="#d4e428">[10]</a> There is some indication too that the runaway was young, as one letter describes
                  him as “le jeune noir fugitif de la Martinique” (“the young Black fugitive from Martinique”)
                  (Duperré, 1837, pp. 1). Although, as Habiba Ibrahim (2021) compellingly demonstrates
                  in  <span class="hi italic">Black Age, </span>what this attribution of youth means may be less a matter of biological age and more
                  a question of the fictions that white observers and narrators project onto Black captives'
                  bodies.</div>

               <div class="ptext" id="p24">Dwelling on the fugitive's anonymity makes us attuned to other forms of unnaming in
                  this official account. First the euphemism “taken in Senegal” unnames the precise
                  conditions of his bondage. Kidnapping, capture, sale, the various terrible transactions
                  that may have moved the fugitive by force from Senegal to Martinique, are politely
                  smoothed over by the verb “taken,” at once simple and capacious in its potential meanings.<a class="noteRef" href="#d4e436">[11]</a> Second, the language of illegality unnames his flight as an act of self-liberation.
                  Because his capture in Senegal was “fraudulent” and his escape from his enslaver in
                  Martinique was an act of “desertion,” his marronage counters one form of unsanctioned,
                  illegal movement with another. Ultimately, each instance of mobility puts him outside
                  the already constrained juridical freedoms allowed Black people in France, a country
                  that both disavowed slavery on its soil and codified its practice in law. </div>

               <div class="ptext" id="p25">In <span class="hi italic">Black Geographies and the Politics of Place, </span>Katherine McKittrick and Clyde Woods (2007, pp. 4) assert that “to begin a discussion
                  of black geographies… we need to consider how the unknowable figures into the production
                  of space.” I read this as a form of hesitation, sitting with the unknowable and the
                  unknown to better understand not just how Black people move through space but also
                  how that movement produces space. These contemplations can in turn productively inform
                  our understanding and rendering of space. For example, we might consider how the unnamed
                  fugitive produced a space for his clandestine flight aboard the <span class="hi italic">Neptune</span>. He may have hidden in plain sight, boldly striding across the ship's deck in sailor's
                  garb. As Julius Scott (2018, pp. 109) notes, “Even slaves without experience at sea
                  could pick up some key nautical terms or perhaps a verse or two of a popular sea shanty
                  and pass themselves off as free sailors.”<a class="noteRef" href="#d4e447">[12]</a> Although the letters that inaugurate his entry into slavery's archive begin with
                  his capture on the <span class="hi italic">Neptune, </span>tarrying at the docks disrupts this imposed temporal origin by dwelling on the period
                  before the ship when the fugitive may have engaged in the urban marronage that brought
                  so many other runaways to Caribbean port cities (Scott, 2018, pp. 21-22). Alternatively,
                  he may quite literally have produced space by fashioning a site of concealment somewhere
                  on the ship akin to the box that transported the fugitive Henry Box Brown (Brown and
                  Ernest, 2008) as cargo to Philadelphia, or the “loophole of retreat” that allowed
                  Harriet Jacobs (Jacobs and Mitchell, 2023) to both escape the clutches of her lascivious
                  enslaver and remain close to her children. </div>

                  Studies, or from the well-traveled colonial circuit between Senegal, Martinique, and
                  France and bring the <span class="hi italic">Neptune's </span>clandestine passenger into conceptual proximity with North American fugitives. As
                  Justin Dunnavant (2020, pp. 891) reminds us, “popular abolitionists such as Henry
                  Box Brown, Frederick Douglass, and Harriet Jacobs can be read as maritime maroons
                  in the literal sense that their flight was mediated, at least in part, by marinescapes.”
                  Nor is it a stretch, for the purposes of <span class="hi italic">Mapping Marronage, </span>to expand the maroon's geography by untethering our mapped coordinates for his flight
                  from the archival record. Already in the official correspondence there were indications
                  that his geography would always exceed the named territories of Senegal, Martinique,
                  Denmark, and France, for even as government officials tried to identify the correct
                  jurisdiction for his manumission case and thereby fix the geographic coordinates of
                  his legal status, they also acknowledged that at the time of their correspondence,
                  the maroon was somewhere in the North Sea en route to Le Havre. It is there in the
                  North Sea that we lose his archival trail, unmoored from land, from the “free soil”
                  that was supposed to grant him his liberty in France. Elena Schneider (2021, pp. 497)
                  writes of similar cases of maritime marronage to Cuba: “uplifting narratives of escape
                  could devolve into ongoing, labyrinthine struggles for autonomy, property, and protection,
                  proving Neil Roberts's thesis that Black ‘freedom' is an ongoing state of marronage.”
                  Between his enslavement in Martinique and the freedom he reached for as he sought
                  out French soil was a world of experience, knowledge, strategy, desire, chance; a
                  world reached for but not yet attained as the cold paper trail obliges us to leave
                  him there, floating in the North Sea. Following Elise Mitchell's (2022, pp. 209),
                  approach that “challenges the primacy of origins and destinations and emphasizes the
                  itinerant crossings and small places between them, where the enslaved stalled, were
                  abandoned…” why not untether him even further from the confinement of the official
                  record's limited geography and consider other connections to other “small places between?”

               <div class="ptext" id="p27">Given the repeated illegality of his mobility, always outside the law as either the
                  victim of nefarious kidnappers flouting European legal interdictions of the slave
                  trade (abolished by Denmark in 1803 and by France in 1817 and again in 1831), or as
                  a stowaway, the imagined possibilities for appropriating and producing space to create
                  sites of marronage serve as more than a reach for the speculative to fill in gaps
                  and silences. They illustrate the process of turning a “geography of containment”
                  into a “rival geography.” Rival geography has proven to be a mobile concept. Stephanie
                  Camp (2004, pp. 7) explains that it was first “coined by Edward Said and has been
                  used by geographers to describe resistance to colonial occupation.” From her own adaptation
                  of the term to refer to “alternative ways of knowing and using plantation and southern
                  space that conflicted with planters' ideal and demands,” it finds its way here to
                  describe how an African man, forcibly taken from Senegal and enslaved in Martinique,
                  briefly turned an instrument of captivity into a vessel for freedom. The enslaved
                  man crossed the ocean at least twice, first as cargo, and then as fugitive, and while
                  the <span class="hi italic">Neptune </span>in 1837 was not a slave ship, we already know to expect that if the creaking of its
                  rigging or the groaning of its wood reminded its clandestine passenger of another
                  journey on another ship, those who wrote about him probably did not know and likely
                  would not have cared. The correspondence about him does not — cannot — speak about
                  haunting, but Laurent Dubois (2020, pp. 919) aptly describes the dual meaning that
                  vessels on Atlantic waters carried, what may have felt like haunting for a Black person
                  on a ship: “All ships in the Atlantic World were, in a sense, haunted by the slave
                  ship, which in some ways was the defining vessel of the entire system. … And yet ships
                  were also a space of movement and represented the possibility of freedom…. They were
                  a space where there was a potential for individual freedom, for being on the sea was
                  a way to escape geographies of empire and juridical systems that locked people in
                  particular kinds of status and possibility.” If we imagine this  <span class="hi italic">Neptune </span>as haunted by the other <span class="hi italic">Neptunes </span>that, between 1730 and 1750, left Nantes, La Rochelle, and Le Havre (where the fugitive
                  was now headed), to ferry African captives from Ouidah and Aného (formerly little
                  Popo) to Martinique and Saint Domingue, then for a fleeting moment, the fugitive's
                  act of maritime marronage transforms his <span class="hi italic">Neptune </span>from a space haunted by a history of containment to an instrument of liberation.<a class="noteRef" href="#d4e477">[13]</a> Lest we read this as a triumphant story of resistance, a letter addressed from “The
                  North Sea” reminds us of the conditions of entry into the archival record. With the
                  runaway's seizure by the captain, the  <span class="hi italic">Neptune </span>is transformed again into a site of captivity.</div>

                  of a story about flight stalled in the North Sea, when an enslaved man's production
                  of space temporarily turned a ship into something other than what its captain would
                  accept. “Maritime maroons,” Kevin Dawson (2021, pp. 443) reminds us, “were humanity
                  in fluid motion, daring to paddle and swim across slave ships' wake to rechart their
                  destinies and redefine the ocean according to African valuations.” If we return to
                  the possibility that the <span class="hi italic">Neptune's </span>maroon created a space of concealment on the ship not unlike well-known North American
                  fugitives, then untethering his geography from a strictly Caribbean or francophone
                  circuit through this conceptual proximity to a seemingly unrelated place, brings us
                  closer to honoring the spirit of his flight, if not through historical accuracy, then
                  through a deliberately “unruly geography” (Dunnavant, pp. 885). This practice of counter-hegemonic
                  cartography that charts space and movement against the current of imperial circuits,
                  is akin to what Dunnavant et. al (2023, pp. 1294-1319) describe in their method of
                  using geospatial modeling to the rival ends of “counter-mapping maroon cartographies.”<a class="noteRef" href="#d4e493">[14]</a>

                  identify the fugitive on the digital map. We chose to model his name on that of a
                  Haitian monument to liberty, “Le marron inconnu de Saint Domingue” (“The Unknown Maroon
                  of Saint Domingue”). The  <span class="hi italic">Neptune's</span> unwanted passenger therefore entered our <span class="hi italic">Mapping Marronage</span> database as “First name: Unnamed, Last name: Fugitive.” Like Sasha Turner (2017,
                  pp. 245), who insists in her writing about “the nameless and the forgotten” that “the
                  work of maternal grief in slavery affirms the invisible suffering of the enslaved,”
                  we tried to reach for an appellation that makes present what cannot be seen but must
                  have been there. <span class="hi italic">He must have had a name. </span>We hoped that “Unnamed Fugitive,” instead of recovering that lost name, would honor
                  his desire not to be apprehended, all the while affirming that he had once been called
                  something other than property. We imagined “Unnamed Fugitive” as a choice that refuses
                  anonymity but — in the event that the maroon declined to give his name to authorities
                  in an act of self-preservation — still “let[s] fugitives remain at large” (Childs,

                  Petion, and Henri Christophe has served as a malleable symbol of Haitian national
                  identity for several decades. Dimitri Bechaq (2007) argues that different political
                  entities have imbued the monument with various meanings over time. For the Black nationalist
                  <span class="hi italic">noiriste </span>ideology of François Duvalier, under whose brutal regime the monument was constructed
                  between 1967 and 1968, the Unknown Maroon was conscripted to symbolize an unbroken
                  line from Black fugitives in the period of slavery to Haiti's Black (as opposed to
                  mixed-race) political leadership in the 20th century. For UNESCO during the commemoration
                  of the abolition of slavery in 2004, the monument signaled Haiti's place as the cornerstone
                  of freedom and independence in the Caribbean. The Unknown Maroon stands in for the
                  many who absconded. Naming the <span class="hi italic">Neptune's </span>fugitive after this symbol of multiple flights in turn asks those many nameless maroons
                  to stand in for the one.<a class="noteRef" href="#d4e543">[15]</a> Our choice to bring the Unnamed Fugitive into the orbit of Haitian marronage by modeling
                  his name after the Unknown Maroon also functions much like the reading of his hiding

                  him from the geographies inscribed in and circumscribed by official correspondence

                  political ends, “are reclamation, preservation, and remembrance merely a question
                  of re-enacting hegemony?” (McKittrick and Woods, 2007, pp. 5). McKittrick and Woods
                  again offer us a way forward when they note that “inserting black geographies into
                  our worldview” can trouble “dominant modes of geographic thought” and allow us to
                  “consider alternative ways of imagining the world” (2007, pp. 5). We might go further,
                  then, to imagine how unmooring the fugitive from the Danish site of his discovery
                  — the site at which he was most visible to the law — and bringing him into proximity
                  with other maroons in the Americas might allow us to render space differently, to
                  recreate the map entirely rather than simply inserting him into existing coordinates.
                  The Unnamed Fugitive poses a problem for mapping marronage, not because he is anonymous,
                  but because we sought to place him within the bounds of a map that cannot sufficiently
                  account for Black fugitive geographies. Perhaps then his unnaming can only be accounted
                  for, not by counter-mapping the terraqueous geography of his flight, but by unmapping
                  his marronage. </div>

                  time I have had occasions to reflect not only on what I hope my students took away
                  from the course, but also on what I learned from them and their struggles to tell
                  an “impossible story” (Hartman, 2008, 10). Because the Unnamed Fugitive's story brought
                  us to the limits of recovery and repair — he remains, after all, anonymous and I remain
                  ambivalent about what this appellation does and undoes — the lesson I have come away
                  with casts the future of <span class="hi italic">Mapping Marronage </span>in doubt. Bold lines slashing out across the ocean from one landmass to another, cannot
                  render all the ways Black people moved furtively, guided by knowledge their pursuers
                  could not access, impelled by desires their captors would not know to recognize. A
                  database is not a memorial. A map is not a commemoration. Cartography cannot represent
                  Black geographies of fugitivity unless it disrupts far more than spatial coordinates.
                  In his unraveling of our medium, then, the Unnamed Fugitive nudges us to consider
                  what it would look like to instead unmap enslaved people's mobility. In this, I am
                  guided by two digital humanities projects invested in the work of undoing.  </div>

               <div class="ptext" id="p36"> (<span class="hi italic">Un)Silencing Slavery: Remembering the Enslaved at Rose Hall Plantation, Jamaica</span> is a companion website to Celia Naylor's book <span class="hi italic">Unsilencing Slavery: Telling Truths About Rose Hall Plantation, Jamaica. </span>The website's objective “is to respectfully and lovingly remember and hold space for
                  the enslaved Africans and their enslaved African-born and Caribbean-born descendants
                  who lived and labored at Rose Hall Plantation in Jamaica.” Naylor's larger project
                  of unearthing information about the people who were enslaved on the plantation grew
                  out of her frustration that the narrative available to tourists who visited the site
                  focuses on the plantation's owners and excludes the enslaved entirely. Naylor's point
                  of departure was to undo the narrative of Rose Hall Plantation, both the fictional
                  stories told about it and the silence around enslaved people that engenders yet another
                  kind of fiction. As Naylor (2022, pp. 7) explains, her work is an exercise in “attending
                  (and tending) to the erasure and recasting of slavery and Black suffering and survival
                  in the contemporary tours at Rose Hall Great House.” Strikingly, over and over again
                  in her book, the primary manifestation of this erasure is the anonymity of the enslaved,
                  and the first step to redress, it seems, is to restore their names. Naylor (pp. 27)
                  affirms that to disrupt the official Rose Hall narrative “is to begin to name those
                  enslaved who have been unremembered and unmemorialized; it is to begin to reconstruct
                  stories buried and deemed unworthy of telling and retelling; it is to begin to reimagine
                  the struggles, suffering, and sanctity of people enslaved (though not entirely dehumanized).”
                  “Retelling, “reconstruct[ing],” but first, naming. Given my own ambivalence about
                  recovery and repair, what I find most productive about Naylor's companion website
                  is how its form works against ideas of recovery as inserting lost information back
                  into an extant historical record. In her book's opening chapters, Naylor walks readers
                  carefully through a detailed description of the archive as a physical space and material
                  object. Through words and a series of photographs, she shows how the archive is structured
                  through lists that enumerate names, births, deaths, economic value, clothing allowances.
                  In a particularly powerful and moving meditation elsewhere, Naylor (2023) has reflected
                  on the experience of seeing her own name and variations thereof — Celia and Cecelia
                  — on some of these lists. Far from an abstraction, “the archive” is a room in which
                  Naylor sits, yearning for fuller records, and where she is confronted instead with
                  the epistemic violence of witnessing people — some called by her own name — be rendered
                  as property through lists that we might understand today as early databases.  </div>

               <div class="ptext" id="p37">And yet despite, or perhaps because of this careful attention to enumeration in her
                  book, lists themselves are not the organizing frame for the companion website. <span class="hi italic">(Un)silencing Slavery</span> does present the forgotten names of those enslaved at Rose Hall Plantation, but it
                  does so in the form of flower petals. Selecting the name of each enslaved person in
                  a list on the right-hand side of the screen illuminates a single petal of the larger
                  yellow-pink-purple hued flower, revealing a brief biography, what Naylor has gleaned
                  about that person's life. Naylor's visualization began in analog mode as a series
                  of concentric circles she drew on paper to imagine the enslaved people at Rose Hall
                  as part of a community tree. Tree rings are a historical record of the environment.
                  They tell tales about age and time, about stressors looming deep in the soil and life
                  teeming in branches above. They may be the thick etching of abundant rainfall, the
                  blackened scar of a wildfire year, or the telltale mark of how high deadly floodwaters
                  rose. But we can only read those stories after the work of sharp blade against bark
                  and xylem is done. The rings of Naylor's chopped down tree on paper are carried over
                  to the digital flower as a faint visual echo of black dots; a digital flower that
                  in its evocative and terrible beauty, leans “towards life and growth” (Gil). Naylor's
                  flower is an acknowledgement of slavery's violence, and a need to make visible too,
                  the forms of care and kinship and community that did exist among the enslaved at Rose
                  Hall. This is a project of undoing by unraveling form, refusing “the sharp edges of
                  social scientific graphic conventions” (Gil) and tending instead the fragile, rounded
                  petals of a digital rose. </div>

                  2020, pp. 2). Goffe (pp.4) defines unmapping as follows: “Unmapping as a digital praxis
                  embraces the opacity of sensory disorientation. If mapping is about knowing and surveying,
                  then unmapping is about unknowing and uncharting the territory.” In a course titled
                  “Caribbean Writing, Reggae, and Routes” that teaches students to be attuned to the
                  interpretive possibilities that sound opens up for rendering Caribbean space, Goffe
                  tasks her students with creating story maps for Jamaica, New York, Surinam, Hispaniola,
                  and Cuba.

                  would work with new primary sources, adding ever more names and itineraries to an
                  increasingly populated map. But a crisis of form is perhaps another way of saying
                  a crisis of faith, and I am no longer certain that such a project amounts to a “black

                  utterances and etchings and songs and moans by which maroons' fugitive dreams filter
                  to us in the present; and to the reefs and sandbars and shoals and terraqueous formations

                     is, “the tenet that any slave who sets foot on French soil becomes free,” (Peabody,
                     1996, pp. 145), see Koufinkana, 1992; Peabody, 1996; Pluen, 2021. On the adoption
                     and adaptation of free soil in Haiti, see for example Ferrer, 2012. On French colonial
                     regimes' distinction of metropolitan free soil from overseas colonial territory see
                     Spieler, 2009. For an examination of the largely inconsistent application of the Freedom
                     Principle in other Atlantic locales from the medieval period to the 19 th century,
                     see Peabody's and Grinberg's (2011) special issue of   <span class="hi italic">Slavery &amp; Abolition</span> 32.2.</span></div>

                     the grand marronage/petit marronage binary. Neil Roberts (2015) in turn derives the
                     theory “freedom as marronage” from paying close attention to enslaved people's flight,
                     and in their co-authored article, Justin Hosbey and J.T. Roane (2021) examine Black
