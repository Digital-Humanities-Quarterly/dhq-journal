                  <p>This study presents the results of the research project on the Ballets Espagnols de
                     Antonia Mercé La Argentina, a dance company active between 1927 and 1929 that adapted
                     the model of Diaghilev's Ballets Russes to a repertoire based on the construction
                     of
                     a national identity through the modern and avant-garde aesthetics of interwar Europe.
                     The systematisation of the preserved sources and their visualisation in interactive
                     maps permits research to be carried out on one of the most brilliant episodes in the
                     history of Spanish dance and to collaborate in the recovery of a forgotten dance
                     heritage.</p>

                  <div class="ptext" id="p1"> One of the difficulties encountered in research on Dance Studies, and especially
                     in
                     dance history, is the ephemeral condition of the object of study. Due to the
                     impossibility of direct access to the primary source, which is the original performance
                     of the dance work, it is necessary to trace its origin through the artistic, written,
                     musical or audiovisual materials that have been preserved. The study of sketches of
                     sets, costumes, scores, choreographic notation, films, sound recordings, librettos,
                     newspaper reviews and documents, among others, will show the contribution made by
                     each
                     dance work when it was premiered. This information is the primary basis on which to
                     establish the subsequent interpretive analysis. The frequent dispersion of these
                     materials, as well as their poor preservation or loss, together with a short academic
                     tradition and scarce research in certain contexts, mean that large gaps still exist
                     in
                     dance history. This is even more evident in the Spanish academic context in relation
                     to
                     dance research. Despite artistic manifestations such as flamenco, which was awarded
                     UNESCO's World Heritage status in 2010, and other dance jewels, such as the bolero
                     — a
                     dance form legacy from the eighteenth century — Dance Studies are not established
                     in the
                     university system. Besides, research in dance history is still limited and depends
                     on
                     other humanistic and artistic disciplines. Therefore, the advance in the application
                     of
                     new methods in Digital Humanities and their open access offers great potential for
                     research into the history of Spanish dance, increasing the level of interpretation
                     of
                     the preserved sources, and the possibilities of integration and impact on international
                     art history narratives, from which it has traditionally been excluded. </div>

                     Ballets Espagnols, the dance company founded by Antonia Mercé, aka La Argentina (Buenos
                     Aires, 1890-Bordeaux, 1936). This group, which was active between 1927 and 1929, was
                     the
                     first to produce a “Spanish-style” version of the model of Sergei Diaghilev's successful
                     Ballets Russes, which had dazzled Western audiences and critics since 1909 with its
                     repertoire of ballets by the most outstanding creators and intellectuals, such as
                     Igor

                  <div class="ptext" id="p3"> Diaghilev's previous success encouraged the foundation of other groups that examined
                     their respective roots and national identities in order to propose modern pieces,
                     which
                     include the Ballets Suédois, Ballets Romantiques Russes, Ballets Russes de Monte Carlo
                     and, in this case, the Ballets Espagnols. In these works, La Argentina surrounded
                     herself with outstanding Spanish musicians, painters and writers in the creation of
                     a
                     repertoire based on Spanish cultural legacies. Some of her most outstanding works
                     were
                     <cite class="title italic">El amor brujo, El fandango de candil, Au coeur de Seville (Cuadro
                        flamenco), Juerga, Sonatina</cite> and <cite class="title italic">Triana.</cite> Over the years
                     she had the support of writers such as Cipriano de Rivas Cherif, Federico García Lorca
                     and Tomás Borras; musicians such as Manuel de Falla, Ernesto Halffter, Julián Bautista,
                     Joaquín Turina and Enrique Fernández-Arbós; stage designers such as Néstor, Gustavo
                     Bacarisas, Manuel Fontanals and Mariano Andreu; and dancers such as Vicente Escudero,
                     Carmita García, Pastora Imperio and Miguel de Molina. The transcendence of these names
                     in their respective areas highlights the impact of the Russian model. Considering
                     a
                     ballet as a “total work of art” — derived from Richard Wagner's <cite class="title italic">gesamtkunswerg —</cite> different elements were entrusted to outstanding personalities
                     of their field with a certain innovative and modern outlook. Moreover, the company
                     united examples of the most outstanding contributions of the arts and literature of
                     the
                     time, in what Spanish historiography considers the so-called Generations of 1898,
                     1914
                     and 1927. These protagonists of the movement of cultural renewal would constitute
                     the
                     period know as the Silver Age, interrupted by the military uprising that started the
                     Spanish Civil War on 18 July, 1936, the same day on which Antonia Mercé La Argentina
                     died suddenly of a heart attack. </div>
                  
                  <div class="counter"><a href="#p4">4</a></div>
                  <div class="ptext" id="p4"> The Ballets Espagnols were conceived mainly for a foreign audience and the ensemble
                     never performed in Spain, making internationalisation a key element in understanding
                     the
                     acceptance of Spanish dance and its legacy in the memory of Western dance from then
                     on.
                     Despite the repercussion that both Antonia Mercé and her company had on Spanish dance,
                     no monographic study of the Ballets Espagnols existed to date. Only some studies examine
                     her biography and trajectory, and some articles and books propose readings of her
                     context. <a class="noteRef" href="#d4e276">[1]</a> Therefore, this research sought to
                     locate, analyse and interpret the Ballets Espagnols repertoire in order to assess
                     its
                     impact on the definition of Spanish imaginaries through the modern interpretation
                     of
                     interwar Europe. </div>

                  <div class="ptext" id="p5"> It was therefore essential to have a tool that would enable the systematic examination
                     of the preserved sources of diverse typology located in different countries. Besides,
                     it
                     was also possible to analyse the presence of this company in very specific sections
                     using spatiotemporal coordinates. The research project was carried out between 2018
                     and
                     2020 within the framework of the State Programme for the Promotion of Scientific and

                     and
                     which is running from 2020 to 2023. The main aim is to share the results of this study
                     in the application of Digital Humanities in dance, and specifically, for future research
                     in the rich field of Spanish dance and its various aspects including flamenco, bolero,

                     the systematisation of information by designing and creating “data models.” This is what
                     is known, generically, as the description of the “universe of discourse” or the part of
                     the real world we wish to study and represent [<a class="ref" href="#flanders2015">Flanders &amp; Jannidis, 2015</a>]. The data
                     modelling process involves identifying the most relevant entities or classes in our

                     within this spectrum, is not very different from the one usually used in computer
                     sciences. There are authors who believe that data modelling should be one of the main
                     tasks of research projects in humanities [<a class="ref" href="#jannidis2013">Jannidis &amp; Flanders, 2013</a>]. Nevertheless,
                     neither a theory nor extensive scientific literature on the subject is apparent, perhaps
                     because it is believed that there is already enough in the field of computer
                     technologies. Data modelling, in Humanities, is understood as an “interpretation” of an
                     object, both in the real and virtual world; a constructive and creative process in
                     which
                     the functions of digital technology determine which aspects should be modelled [<a class="ref" href="#flanders2015">Flanders &amp; Jannidis, 2015</a>, 14]. Nowadays, data modelling is applied more and more frequently
                     and is a prior and indispensable step in systematising information in Digital Humanities
                     projects. This is well summarised in the work of Ciula &amp; Marras (<a href="#ciula2016">2016</a>), which
                     highlights the upward trajectory of works that incorporate these technologies to develop
                     their research. Two phases must be distinguished in data modelling: on the one hand,
                     design modelling, which describes the entities from the universe of discourse with
                     which
                     we are going to work; and on the other hand, logical modelling, which is the
                     implementation of the former in a database environment. </div>

                        attached to the worldwide locations layer downloaded from Natural Earth’s ( <a href="https://www.naturalearthdata.com/" onclick="window.open('https://www.naturalearthdata.com/'); return false" class="ref">https://www.naturalearthdata.com/</a>)
                        populated places and subsequently to a country. This way the spatial component enables

                     Humanities, and specifically the Spatial Humanities, make it possible to extend and
                     amplify the interpretative level of many different historical sources scattered in
                     numerous locations. The consultation of an enormous amount of documentation, distributed
                     among institutions in different countries, has been complemented, ordered and arranged
                     for the reconstruction of the trajectories of the Ballets Espagnols de Antonia Mercé
                     La
                     Argentina, temporarily based in Paris in interwar Europe. The impact of this project
                     can
                     be seen especially in the interactive visualisation, the delimitation of the monthly
                     time periods of the company's activities over the two years and the ability to
                     distinguish between Antonia Mercé's individual recitals and the performances of the
                     whole company. Moreover, the project has provided the opportunity to assess each
                     performance in the context of the critical response and artistic production. </div>
                  
                  <div class="counter"><a href="#p35">35</a></div>
                  <div class="ptext" id="p35"> In spatial terms, the georeferenced assessment of the dancer's performances in
                     different theatres in the same city is particularly interesting, as it provides a
                     better
                     idea of the prestige that her shows were acquiring over time. The exact location of
                     each
                     performance also makes it possible to understand the type of audience that might attend
                     the shows, depending on the district where the theatre was located, the distance from
                     the city centre and the different categories of venues. Therefore, in the early days,
                     the circuits in which the Ballets Espagnols were shown were somewhat peripheral —
                     it is
                     worth noting their world premiere in the German city of Krefeld. Their first steps
                     were
                     taken in Germany and Italy, but it was not until later, when the performers were more
                     experienced on stage and familiar with a more refined repertoire, that the Ballets
                     Espagnols premiered in Paris. </div>
                  
                  <div class="counter"><a href="#p36">36</a></div>
                  <div class="ptext" id="p36"> However, it is noticeable that even Antonia Mercé did not dance on the first-class
                     stages, such as the Paris Opera, until a few months before her death in 1936, after
                     several attempts to revive her frustrated project of the Ballets Espagnols. The seasonal
                     itineraries through numerous European cities between 1927 and 1929 confirm that Antonia
                     Mercé's company had not yet achieved the prestige of other, more established
                     international dance groups, who enjoyed a more constant and prolonged presence in
                     leading cultural centres (Fig. 6). The Théâtre National de l'Opéra Comique (Paris)
                     and
                     Town Hall (New York) stand out as key centres in the dancer's career (Fig. 7). </div>

                     to
                     revive the company by touring other countries in America and Europe, including Spain.
                     In
                     this respect, it is also relevant to analyse the global dimension of the individual
                     recitals of Antonia Mercé, who, in her tours outside Europe, set a precedent for the
                     scope of Spanish dance in places such as Japan, Vietnam, the Philippines and the United

                     particular its components. Although in-depth research into the composition of the
                     corps
                     de ballet of the Ballets Espagnols in its different seasons is still lacking, this
                     qualitative approach yields some interesting indicators. Between 1927 and 1929, the
                     group had a total of 91 dancers in its various performances, which varied each season.
                     In 1927, there were 31, the following year 54 and the last season 43. Antonia Mercé
                     starred in a total of 151 performances, accompanied mainly by the three most recurrent
                     dancers: Irene Ibáñez (50 performances), Carmen Joselito (49 performances) and Carmen
                     Juárez (46 performances). In a second group, other performers stand out, such as
                     Mercedes Dalmau (39), Juan Relámpago (38), Otilio López (35), Lolita Mas (29), Blanca
                     Minondo (28), Carmen Mora (27), and Pepita López (27). We must also point out the
                     absolute prominence of Carmencita Pérez as piano accompanist (with 63 performances).

                  <div class="ptext" id="p39"> In short, the possibility of visualising all these trajectories reconstructed step
                     by
                     step on the interactive map motivates new interpretations to be made of exchanges
                     in
                     European circuits, in the relationship with the Americas, and in East-West relations.
                     Besides it proposes renewed interpretations of the role of dance as a vehicle for
                     the
                     construction and dissemination of cultural identities. Looking at Spanish dance from
                     a
                     Digital Humanities point of view helps to obtain a broader and deeper understanding
                     of
                     historical heritage and strengthen the dialogues between the virtual and the physical,
                     the permanent and the ephemeral, the past and the future. The case study of the Ballets
                     Espagnols can open the door to new ways of understanding the role of dance in the
                     mapping of identities, aesthetics and ideologies from transnational and transcultural
                     perspectives in the early 20th century.</div>
