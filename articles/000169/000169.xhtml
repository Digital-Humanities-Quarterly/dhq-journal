                  <h2>Abstract</h2>
                  <p> Internet technologies are gradually reshaping the function of traditional
                    scholarly publications. There is a growing tendency in some disciplines to
                    publish a digital paper together with supplements such as images, videos,
                    3D-models and underlying data. More information requires a better usability in
                    terms of overview and finding information, which has led to new features in
                    journals and thus to modifying and extending this genre. These so-called
                    enhanced publications or rich internet publications have various physical forms:
                    PDF documents with embedded interactive models, HTML files enriched with
                    hyperlinks to contextual information and with facilities to highlight
                    information in the text, or aggregations of documents and other resources linked
                    together through metadata which make them findable for semantic search
                    engines.</p>
                  <p>However, many of the originally print-based journals, particularly in the
                    humanities and social sciences, are still rather conservative in format and
                    offer hardly any opportunities for enhanced publishing, which leaves room for
                    some form of self-publishing, perhaps as addition to a regular journal article.
                    In this paper we introduce the Xpos’re tools for authoring and displaying an
                    interactive multimedia scholarly publication, which may be created as a digital
                    companion to a regular journal paper and published, for example, on the author
                    or institution’s website in order to share related research products and to
                    achieve greater visibility. We also report about practical experiences with this
                    software in a few research projects.</p>
                  <p>The Xpos’re software (see: <a class="ref"
                        href="http://xposre.nl/software/"
                        onclick="window.open('http://xposre.nl/software/'); return false">http://xposre.nl/software/</a>) comprises a Flash-based document reader
                    and a set of extensions (plug-ins) that extend the basic functionality of this
                    text browser. The extensions are used to display specific types of multimedia
                    that provide additional functionality, such as viewing images, videos and
                    interactive maps. The input text is XML based, which not only guarantees a
                    durable and flexible encoding of content, but also allows automatic rendering in
                    different formats according to the preferences of users and the limitations of
                    their hardware. In addition, the XML source can be easily transformed to an RDF
                    resource map to meet the requirements of the semantic web. The document reader
                    generates output in HTML, in two flavors, namely a slide based version that uses
                    JavaScript, and a plain HTML text (single page), which is most suitable for
                    printing and which can be used to create e-books. This plain HTML text can also
                    be displayed in a format similar to that of scientific journals through the
                    Xpos’re HTML Reader, which has more features than the automatically generated
                    slides and which can be highly customized by the user. </p>

                        disciplines. For a long time, the available space in a printed publication
                        and the high production costs have put restrictions on adding supplementary
                        material such as pictures, maps and fragments from historical sources. The
                        change to web publishing has taken away these material impediments, but in
                        facing new media we are inclined to recreate the old genre by new means. The
                        form and layout of online publications are in general still dominated by
                        genre conventions based on printed journals and books. The capabilities of
                        the digital channel are often underutilized, which makes that scholarly
                        communications are currently at a "horseless carriage"
                        state, that lies somewhere between the world of print and paper and the
                        world of the web and computers, with the former still exercising
                        significantly more influence than the latter [<a class="ref" href="#force11">Force 11</a>].</div>

                        scholarly communication [<a class="ref" href="#borgman2007">Borgman 2007</a>]; [<a class="ref" href="#wouters2012">Wouters 2012</a>]. Research on digital curation deliver new

                        exchange and discussion of scientific ideas, and some journals have already
                        deliberately changed track by adopting a new format with enhanced usability.
                        Moreover, scholarly blogs offer ample opportunity to experiment with new
                        media such as audio and video. These innovations are unevenly spread over
                        the scholarly landscape: most changes occur in the hard sciences,
                        particularly in physics, chemistry and the bio-medical field, while
                        humanities and social sciences are more reluctant in this respect.<a class="noteRef" href="#d3e245">[1]</a>

                     <div class="ptext" id="p3">The downside of this transition has a practical problem: the technology
                        required for the novel forms of publishing is generally not yet embedded in
                        a smooth authoring process comparable with that for printed publications.
                        Adding multimedia to a blog may not be a big problem, but a scholarly
                        journal adheres to higher standards of long-term sustainable information
                        access and aesthetic layout, which also places demands on the authoring
                        process, and, therefore, on the tools and templates which authors have at
                        their disposal. Non-printable supplements are often stored in a separate
                        section of the publisher’s website and as such are not perceived as part of
                        the discourse itself. The Xpos’re software package discussed here addresses
                        this type of problem for online publications that contain interactive
                        multimedia closely connected with the text. The pros and cons are best
                        understood after a short overview of the upcoming digital genres (section
                        1.2 through 1.4) followed by a preliminary conclusion (section 1.5)
                        explaining why new tools are needed.</div>

                     <div class="ptext" id="p4">The innovative scholarly genres can be grouped into a few, not strictly
                        defined categories: (1) enhanced publications, (2) rich internet publication
                        and (3) ebooks. These new genres still reflect many features of the old ones
                        from which they are derived, but have in common a certain integration of the
                        scholarly discourse with interactive access to research material. This
                        integration varies greatly, from linked research data and spreadsheets to
                        embedded interactive statistical charts and maps with results of analysis
                        and computation, image galleries, animated models and videos. The
                        interactivity added to the linear reading allows for diversion from the main
                        line of discourse and enables the user to select the information in which
                        (s)he is particularly interested, to choose different perspectives and to
                        explore data with new questions. </div>

                        material such as research data, models, illustrative images, or

                        publication through metadata. The data enhancements enable the replication

                        publishing process. The production system must support the enhancements in
                        storage and layout and many journals have not (yet) chosen to move into this
                        direction; the regular PDF is the ubiquitous standard. This means that
                        authors will have no free choice regarding media rich publishing. The
                        selection of a journal will be based, rather, on more ponderous reasons like
                        ranking and readership than on this presentation aspect. A double track
                        solution is feasible by doing both, publishing the article in a highly
                        ranked journal to earn credits, and providing a text with supplementary
                        material through a private or institutional website to serve the community
                        of peers and to enhance visibility. One may consider this as an alternative
                        form of co-publishing, in which the efforts rather than the expenses are
                        shared — but with which technical means, and can it be done within a
                        reasonable amount of time? An ordinary HTML page is not a good solution,
                        precisely because of all the extra material. Think of a large set of photos,
                        an interactive map for display of research data or an interactive
                        spreadsheet. One needs special components to avoid a messy layout and to
                        provide a decent reading experience, which will require more technical
                        skills than we may expect from the average author.</div>

                        which is also confirmed by a look at blogs in humanities studies. Scientific
                        blogging is often motivated by the need of sharing knowledge with a wider
                        public than the community of experts, to express opinions and start
                        discussions. Moreover, in terms of layout the blog genre is not geared to
                        extensive scientific discourse. However, the blogging software can be used
                        for other purposes as well. The popular WordPress package, which is used on
                        many blog sites, is also the basis of PressBooks<a class="noteRef" href="#d3e357">[6]</a>, a commercial website, which

                        output option. WordPress itself has also themes (i.e. layout templates)
                        suitable for scholarly publishing as well as special components for
                        multimedia [<a class="ref" href="#jankowski2009">Jankowski 2009</a>]; [<a class="ref" href="#tatum2011">Tatum 2011</a>].
                        Installation of the software does not require much technical knowledge.
                        Authoring can be done online, however, a drawback is that WordPress adds
                        additional codes to the HTML, which makes the source text less standard and
                        therefore more difficult to re-use. </div>

                        to copy and paste it from an existing source). Scalar enables users to

                        writing in a variety of ways, with minimal technical expertise required.
                        Comments and annotations are also supported. A user can easily switch
                        between different views such as text emphasis, media emphasis, metadata and
                        various visualizations. Content consists of pages and media, which can be
                        related to each other in different ways, which results in non-linear

                        such as the pyramids of Egypt in 3D, the work of Leonardo da Vinci about
                        human anatomy, and the march of the dinosaurs. Apple created a nice
                        authoring program, iBooks Author, which runs only on Apple devices, and the
                        same applies to the iBooks, which require an iPad. Conversion to PDF is
                        possible, but then all interactivity gets lost. Moreover, Apple requires
                        that iBooks files are only distributed through its own iBookstore unless the

                        highway. Most authors will either need technical assistance or have to
                        accept compromises; new, user-friendly tools are badly needed to fill the
                        gap between the low end of WYSIWYG HTML editors and blog publishing on the
                        one hand, and less flexible and less open full-fledged commercial systems on
                        the other.</div>

                        for research purposes, mainly made in Flash<a class="noteRef" href="#d3e484">[12]</a>. Just before Flash was banished from the tablet platform a wish
                        arose to make this kind of application more generic and author-friendly,
                        which resulted in the Xpos’re suite. The software does not solve all
                        problems identified above, but avoids at least most of the pitfalls
                        mentioned. Due to its background in multimedia applications the Xpos’re
                        suite allows the creation of publications with a well-structured aesthetic
                        layout. With regard to information overload: the layout concept encourages
                        (but not enforces) a style of writing that divides the text into small
                        sections, presenting essentials first followed by more detailed evidence.
                        The variety of hardware platforms and screen resolutions is addressed
                        through different output options, both fixed and more reflowable HTML
                        formats. Input and output is based on standards, XML, HTML and cascading
                        style sheets, which precludes any lock-in. </div>

                     <div class="ptext" id="p21">The main component of the Xpos’re package is a text browser, a Flash program,
                        which primarily renders the text as a set of slides (see Figure 1) and which
                        delegates the display of specific, mostly multimedia content to external
                        components, the so-called extensions, which are similar to plug-ins of a web
                        browser. These enhancements (in Flash or HTML-Javascript) may vary from
                        zoomable images, image galleries, interactive maps, and videos to
                        interactive data tables and statistical charts. The extensions are different
                        in size, are launched through special event-hyperlinks and are displayed on
                        top of the main text. The native Xpos’re Flash extensions can also interact
                        through this type of links with the main text, for example, changing the
                        slide displayed. In this way an image gallery can be used as a pictorial
                        index through goto-event links in the captions of the gallery images; by
                        clicking on the event-link a user can go to the slide where the image is
                        discussed (see Figure 2). Xpos’re has been designed to work together with
                        other web tools. Particularly the statistical market segment has companion
                        software, which is worth to be used and, depending on the application
                        interface, can also be used with Xpos’re as a less integrated extension.</div>

                     <div class="ptext" id="p22">In the basic display format the publication is a series of slides, each
                        having a fixed layout of 950 x 720 pixels, which fits most common screens in
                        landscape mode. It is not responsive, but there are options for more
                        flexible HTML output, which we shall discuss later. A slide should
                        correspond with a piece of text that is internally coherent, such as a
                        section or subsection of an article. It may contain the full text or a
                        summary, for example, if the Xpos’re publication is mainly intended to make
                        supplementary material available. For this purpose each slide can be linked
                        to the related page in the PDF file with the full text; then the linked page
                        is displayed by a button click. </div>

                     <div class="ptext" id="p23">A slide can contain one or two text columns and images. Images are displayed
                        as a list outside the text blocks, unless, like in HTML, defined through an
                            <span class="monospace">img</span> tag and thus embedded in the text itself. The number of
                        images that fit on a slide depends on the size and orientation of the image
                        list, horizontal or vertical. How physical text layout affects reading from
                        screen is a thorny debate, which has produced a large number of
                        unfortunately inconclusive and slightly contradictive studies [<a class="ref" href="#nimwegen1999">Nimwegen 1999</a>]; [<a class="ref" href="#dyson2004">Dyson 2004</a>]; [<a class="ref" href="#santosa2011">Santosa 2011</a>]. Conclusions have mostly favored short to medium
                        lines (about 60 characters per line), because longer lengths require greater
                        lateral eye movements, which makes reading more tiring [<a class="ref" href="#bernard2002">Bernard 2002</a>]. The Xpos’re slide format allows text columns in
                        this range. </div>

                        <a href="#p24">24</a>
                     </div>
                     <div class="ptext" id="p24">The limited space does not necessarily restrict the amount of information
                        that can be displayed. If a text is larger than the predefined column, it is
                        scrollable, but choosing continuation text may be more user-friendly. A
                        slide can have one continuation text of unlimited length, in the Flash
                        version displayed in a popup window and in the HTML slide version as a new
                        screen. This helps to present main things first. Usability research has
                        shown that users prefer brief information before reading a full text and
                        appreciate facilities for rapid browsing [<a class="ref" href="#dillon1989">Dillon 1989</a>].</div>

                        long period of time. It should be emphasized that no content is embedded in
                        the Flash file itself (which is still a common misunderstanding with regard
                        to Flash applications): at startup all text and images are preloaded from

                        output. The Flash text browser contains a code generator, which
                        automatically creates a look-alike HTML version of the Flash slides with
                        similar functionality to serve platforms where Flash is not supported (such
                        as the iPad). In the same way it can produce a plain HTML version with a
                        minimum of formatting suitable for printing, conversion to PDF and further
                        processing such as the creation of e-books through software as Calibre<a class="noteRef" href="#d3e562">[13]</a>

                        customizable HTML Reader, which displays this text in a three column
                        reflowable format (table of contents, main text and sidebar), similar to the
                        layout of most digital scientific journals. It has more features than the
                        automatically generated HTML slides and is particularly tablet friendly (see
                        Figure 3). An additional advantage of this reader is that it accepts also
                        other HTML texts (non-native XML) provided that basic formatting rules have
                        been followed.</div>

                        HTML slide version if Flash is not supported on a certain hardware platform.
                        Although the HTML version can handle Flash extensions, the user may select
                        the fallback option to let the web browser use the XHTML source directly

                    and the Xpos’re text browser, which shows immediately how the document rendered
                    looks. If the XML document is created on the basis of an existing publication,
                    text entry will be a matter of copy and paste. Other, more (semi‑) automated
                    workflows, which start for example from a Word text, are feasible as well. A
                    Word document saved as a (filtered) HTML text can be further cleaned by
                    conversion tools<a class="noteRef" href="#d3e614">[14]</a> and worked up to XML. This may be a more convenient way if an existing
                    text contains much mark-up (bold, italic et cetera) that is to be preserved.
                    This preprocessing stage could be more automated. A dedicated, task-oriented XML
                    editor with a word processor-like view such as XMLmind<a class="noteRef" href="#d3e623">[15]</a> could simplify the authoring and
                    tweaking for those authors who are less familiar with the nuts and bolts of

                    templates. The advantage of this template mechanism is that it allows global
                    changes for the entire text at once; modifying a template affects all the slides
                    that use it. In addition, fixed layout is not hard coded in the text itself and
                    may be even completely disregarded as, for example, with the reflowable HTML

                    template in use, in the same way as local style definitions have priority of a
                    linked style sheet in an HTML document. In this way images can also be
                        "pulled out of the list" and placed anywhere on the
                    slide. For this purpose the text reader contains a so-called measuring tool (see
                    Figure 4), a transparent rectangle which can be drawn and resized by mouse and
                    arrow keys to make positioning and resizing of text and images easy. Each time
                    when the rectangle changes, its x, y, width and height are displayed at the
                    bottom of the slide in a format that can be copied and directly pasted into the
                    XML text. Although simple, this facility proves to be an effective compensation
                    for the fact that the text editing is not WYSIWYG.</div>

                    Documents linked to the publication text through the former type of links are
                    displayed in a target window (just like in HTML), but Xpos’re can also show them
                    as an overlay on a transparent background on top of the slide, which creates a
                    sense of unity in the user interface. The second type of link is used, among
                    others, for navigation: <blockquote class="eg">
                        <pre>

                        </pre>
                     </blockquote> will display the slide with the id-attribute having
                    the value "intro". Another use is calling an extension. For example, the
                    image viewer can be activated to show a larger, zoomable version of a picture by
                    adding the tag: <blockquote class="eg">

                        </pre>
                     </blockquote> Extensions linked through event links appear as pop-ups in the
                    Flash text browser, and as overlays in the HTML look-alike. </div>

                    development of Xpos’re started as part of a larger collaboration project within
                    the Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences and got national attention in
                    the context of enhanced publications. The combination of both attracted some
                    volunteers, who wanted either to add an Xpos’re publication to an already
                    published paper or to use the package for a new, born-digital product. This
                    resulted in four "showcases" about a diversity of subjects:
                    gallows in late medieval Frisia, a textual analysis of a Dutch novel, a
                    prototype for a Berber dictionary, and a rather long text (of the size of a
                    book) about parks and country houses in the Netherlands (the products and more
                    details are on Xpos’re website<a class="noteRef" href="#d3e707">[16]</a>). In the first two cases the technical work was done by the developer of
                    Xpos’re; the Berber dictionary was implemented by a student in collaboration
                    with a computer scientist, and text about parks was converted to Xpos’re source
                    text by technical personnel of a university library, who had followed a short
                    XML course and got a workshop of two half days about Xpos’re. </div>

                    dictionary, however, used a special text font, which required recompilation of
                    the Flash text browser. During the encoding of the book about parks we offered
                    some support for minor questions about image processing and how to create the
                    best layout. Using Xpos’re for such a long text raised questions about search
                    facilities, which are currently lacking in the text browser, because it was
                    designed with texts of article size in mind. Furthermore, we could observe a
                    tendency to stick to the basics and that more advanced features, such as the
                    plugins, were not easily used.</div>

                    printed papers, even in digital form, does not suffice any longer and feel the
                    need to publish supplements to the text. This has resulted in quite different
                    digital solutions, varying from a multimedia section on a journal web site to
                    enhanced PDF documents and semantic aggregations of articles plus other
                    resources, but for most authors the way is not yet paved. Given the current
                    state of scholarly publication, rich media publishing entails a set of
                    difficulties and inconveniences that have to be dealt with:</div>

                        publishing, multimedia material is often only loosely connected with the
                        publication itself. This will not be experienced as a problem by all authors
                        and readers, but it is to be considered as an issue against the background
                        of the rapidly increasing influence of visual and audio content in our
                        culture. The recent upswing of multimedia journalism is a good example of
                        this tendency. We are now easily able to show what for centuries could only
                        be described, but in practice there are still hurdles, particularly in the
                        publishing infrastructure itself. </li>

                        room for information pull: let readers select the details they like, just as
                        we do with an extensive footnote apparatus in printed publications. This

                        more user-friendly, authors should have more global technical knowledge and

                  <div class="ptext" id="p38">The architectural concept of software has usually a much longer life than the
                    implementation, which is highly sensitive to changes in technology and market
                    positions. We all know spreadsheets, but only a few of us will remember Lotus
                    1-2-3, a highly popular spreadsheet and "killer application"
                    in the mid-1980s. Although the few pilots we did<a class="noteRef" href="#d3e771">[17]</a> showed that that the software works well without hitches, the Xpos’re
                    tools may be best evaluated on basis of the architectural concept. </div>
                  <div class="counter">
                     <a href="#p39">39</a>
                  </div>
                  <div class="ptext" id="p39">A major goal has been a good-looking layout that integrates different types of
                    content, much better than with the "content package" of the
                    enhanced publication. Aesthetically, the Flash version is often found most
                    attractive, also because the high graphic quality allows a pleasant information
                    density in a relative small screen space. In the fixed layout slides, text and
                    images can be precisely positioned. Other media types like interactive maps,
                    spreadsheets and video are so different in size that the same juxtaposition is
                    not possible as a generic solution. Extensions have been used instead, which are
                    displayed on top of the text and keep the context visible as much as possible.
                    The template mechanism encourages the predefinition of a layout model, which can
                    be both globally changed and locally overridden. </div>
                  <div class="counter">
                     <a href="#p40">40</a>
                  </div>
                  <div class="ptext" id="p40">Information overload is discouraged by a combination of several features, which
                    leads to dividing the content into layers. The first layer is the text on the
                    slide, the next one the continuation text, and, if required, a third layer in
                    the form of a PDF page linked to the slide. In the HTML Reader the sidebar can
                    be used for digressions and short introductions of related subjects and videos
                    that do not fit in the main text. </div>

                  <div class="ptext" id="p41">The variety of devices and screen resolutions has been addressed to a certain
                    extent by a fixed layout that fits normal tablets and larger screens, and by the
                    flexible layout of the HTML Reader. A future version should be more responsive,
                    but downsizing for lower resolutions has its limits; hotspots as on an
                    interactive map or timeline require a minimum size and spacing on touch
                    devices.</div>

                  <div class="ptext" id="p42">The elements of the Xpos’re XML vocabulary are not standard, but the large
                    overlap with HTML for sentence and paragraph mark-up and the ease of
                    transformation of XML content make reuse relatively simple. A drawback is the
                    basic knowledge of HTML, XML and CSS required for authoring. This may be
                    inhibiting for scholars who want to stay far away from web technology; they will
                    need some technical assistance. The barrier is not as serious as it may appear.
                    In one of our pilots a large publication was rather easily encoded in XML by two
                    persons who had only attended a short basic XML workshop and got a one-day
                    instruction in Xpos’re software.</div>

                  <div class="ptext" id="p43">The Xpos’re architectural concept can be positioned between RIPs on basis content
                    management systems as WordPress and modern e-books. Although quite different in
                    many respects, all three of them are HTML-based and can be used to create
                    publications with enhanced reading experience. Unlike WordPress Xpos’re is a
                    completely client-side solution. The optional scripting in Epub 3 makes these
                    e-books in principle more versatile and powerful (and also more complex!) than
                    Xpos’re publications with extensions only. With regard to flexibility Xpos’re
                    stands out by an easily reusable source text and a variety of output options.
