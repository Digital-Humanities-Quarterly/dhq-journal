                  <h2>Abstract</h2>
                  <p>A part of the special issue of DHQ on feminisms and digital humanities, this paper
               takes as its starting place Greg Crane’s exhortation that there is a "need to shift from lone editorials and monumental editions to
                  editors ... who coordinate contributions from many sources and oversee living
                  editions." In response to Crane, the exploration of the "living edition" detailed here examines the process of
               creating a publicly editable edition and considers what that edition, the process by
               which it was built, and the platform in which it was produced means for editions that
               support and promote gender equity. Drawing on the scholarship about the culture of
               the Wikimedia suite of projects, and the gendered trolling experienced by members of
               our team in the production of the Social Edition of the Devonshire Manuscript in
               Wikibooks, and interviews with our advisory group, we argue that while the Wikimedia
               projects are often openly hostile online spaces, the Wikimedia suite of projects are
               so important to the contemporary circulation of knowledge, that the key is to
               encourage gender equity in social behavior, credit sharing, and knowledge
               organization in Wikimedia, rather than abandon it for a more controlled collaborative
               environment for edition production and dissemination.</p>

               insult "all women" in "All women have
                  vertues noble &amp; excelent" (18v of the <cite class="title italic">Devonshire
                  Manuscript</cite>, [<a class="ref" href="#baron1994">Baron 1994</a>, 335]). The metrical lines
               praise women for their fidelity, while the new lines suggested by virgules damn all
               women, imagining each woman’s sole virtue as her ability to please her husband, a
               virtue which none possesses. It is a commonplace that this sort of easy dismissal, or
               indeed outright hostility towards women, often guised as humor, is still endemic to
               online social spaces, such as the Wikimedia foundation's suite of projects. This
               paper takes as its starting place Greg Crane’s exhortation that there is a "need to shift from lone editorials and monumental editions to
                  editors ... who coordinate contributions from many sources and oversee living
                  editions"[<a class="ref" href="#crane2010">Crane 2010</a>]. In response to Crane, the exploration of the "living edition" detailed here examines the process of
               creating a publicly editable edition and considers what that edition, the process by
               which it was built, and the platform in which it was produced means for the
               production of editions that support and promote gender equity. Our study draws on the
               scholarship about the culture of the Wikimedia suite of projects, the gendered
               trolling experienced by members of our team in the production of the <cite class="title italic">Social Edition of the Devonshire Manuscript</cite> in Wikibooks
               (see <a href="#figure01">figure 1</a>) [<a class="ref" href="#siemens2012a">Siemens et al. 2012a</a>]<a class="noteRef" href="#d4e152">[1]</a>, and interviews with our advisory group.
               Wikibooks proved a challenging environment for edition production for both cultural
               and technological reasons, reasons which might incline scholars to dispense with the
               platform. The collaborative space opened up by social media while not inherently
               feminist, and indeed often openly hostile to women is, however, one of the central
               online spaces where the public turns for information. The Wikimedia suite of projects
               are so important to the contemporary circulation of knowledge, that the key for
               feminist scholars is to encourage gender equity in social behavior, credit sharing,
               and knowledge organization in Wikimedia, rather than abandon the Wikimedia suite of
               projects in favour of more controlled collaborative environments for edition
               production and dissemination. </div>

                  digital scholarship"[<a class="ref" href="#nichols2009">Nichols 2009</a>], many electronic scholarly editions, like print
               editions, continue to exist as self-contained units that do not encourage interaction
               with other resources. Furthermore, many editions do not actively encourage or
               facilitate interaction among the communities of practice they serve, or even among
               those who have the most knowledge to bring to bear on the edition.<a class="noteRef" href="#d4e164">[2]</a> The
               scholarly community is now producing tools for crowdsourced transcription and
               annotation, but the community of users that has developed around the Wikimedia suite
               of projects has anticipated (and, we speculate, inspired) the development of these
               tools. Acknowledging the dedicated community already engaged in Wikibooks, we sought
               to discover Wikibooks’ affordances for editors, scholars, and students. As we
               investigated and participated in Wikimedia’s community, we experienced what research
               has already suggested: Wikimedia, the go-to resource for many when seeking
               information, is a disturbingly gendered space. </div>

               technological development. The content of the projects is contributed and moderated
               by volunteer editors. In order for Wikimedia projects, including Wikipedia,
               Wikiquote, Wikibooks, and Wikisource, to be feminist they need not only address
               issues of import to women (although Wikimedia’s dearth of information traditionally
               of interest to women is indeed a feminist issue), but also need to address how
               behavior and credit in online space structure the creation, design, and content of

                  <div class="ptext" id="p4">Since Wikipedia and Wikibooks are often a first, and occasionally only, stop for many
               members of the public when searching for information, it is incumbent upon scholars,
               as members of a specialist community often supported by public funds, to engage with
               the platform. In building an edition on the principles of open access and editorial
               transparency, we have integrated scholarly content into the environments maintained
               by the editorial communities already existent in the Wikimedia suite of projects,
               including Wikipedia, Wikibooks, and Wikisource. In an experimental spirit, we
               extended the editorial conversation into multiple pre-existing social media
               platforms, including blog posts; Wikibooks discussion pages; dedicated Renaissance
               and early modern online community space; Skype-enabled interviews with our advisory
               group; and Twitter. In this paper, we will introduce the<cite class="title italic">
                  Devonshire Manuscript</cite> itself and offer a brief overview of the steps that
               led up to our Wikibook instantiation of the manuscript. Drawing on Jacqueline
               Wernimont’s argument that textual content is not the only index of a feminist digital
               resource [<a class="ref" href="#wernimont2013">Wernimont 2013</a>, 10], we argue that there need not be a
               text by or about women at the center of a publicly edited edition in order for that
               edition to be feminist. A social edition’s success as a feminist text in the wiki
               environment comes from its ability to short circuit personal sexist attacks in the
               online space of the edition, avoid latent sexism in the structure of information, and
               resist the deletion of content that is either produced by women or culturally coded
               as feminine. We conclude by suggesting a method of receiving credit for Wikimedia
               contributions, which would attract editors who otherwise might be too overextended in
               the offline world to be able to contribute without getting credit. If widely adopted
               this method would lead to a more diverse group of editors with the skills and
               Wikimedia editorial credibility to respond to instances of inter-editor trolling and
               sexism in the structure of information. By encouraging the ongoing conversation
               between and across online communities rather than demanding the diminution of
               gendered markers online, the social edition process sheds light on how digital
               humanists might leverage existing online platforms to meet broadly feminist goals. </div>

                  <div class="ptext" id="p5">Feminism is understood here as the organized effort to undermine patriarchy, the
               system in which men, women, and institutions engage in the persistent valuing of
               things culturally coded as masculine and male over things coded as feminine and
               female. The burgeoning of sites that store user-generated content need feminist
               intervention, since "Web 2.0 culture, while clearly not as
                  exclusionary or hostile as the earlier mainframe and hacking cultures, remains at
                  its ideological core, a masculinist culture"[<a class="ref" href="#bury2010">Bury 2010</a>, 235]. A technofeminist approach, one which combines
               the recognition that technology comes with cultural freight including gender
               constructions, is better suited, Rhiannon Bury argues, than liberal, socialist, or
               radical feminist approaches to the persistence of patriarchal values in the Web 2.0
               context [<a class="ref" href="#bury2010">Bury 2010</a>, 235]. Taking its cue from Bury, this paper
               addresses two ways that Wikimedia projects' spaces maintain patriarchal values: via
               outright hostility to women represented by personal attack, and institutionally
               through the organization of information that devalues women’s contributions to
               knowledge production and dissemination. Personal attacks against female Wikimedia
               editors on the grounds that they are women (the very definition of prejudice:
               hostility, dismissal, or violence against an individual based on his or her belonging
               to a group) often takes the form of trolling, a form of transient, though oft
               repeated, aggression in the interest of creating a hostile environment or provoking
               an angry response. The feminist organization of knowledge, attendance to the ways
               women are represented at the level of code, and dismantling the equity barriers that
               that representation may erect, can undermine the valuing of things culturally coded
               as masculine and male over things coded as feminine and female.</div>

                  <div class="ptext" id="p6">Shifting the power away from a single editor is not an inherently feminist act.
               Conceiving of this shift, however, leads us to speculate on what a feminist method
               might look like in an open-access Web 2.0 environment. The gendered version of the
               aphorism that "on the Internet no one knows you are a dog"[<a class="ref" href="#chow-white2012">Chow-White 2012</a>, 7], "on the Internet no one
                  knows you are a woman" suggests that it might be possible to avoid sexist
               trolling and biased deletion of Wikimedia content by concealing markers of female sex
               or feminine gender in Wikimedia; however, if the goal of feminist editing is to
               undermine patriarchy on the terms listed above, then obfuscating sex and gender
               cannot be a feminist editor’s goal. As the attacks against Anita Sarkeesian on
               Wikipedia suggest (her Wikipedia page was defaced, not for her critiques of male
               gamer culture (which she had not made yet) but because she was <em class="emph">planning</em>
               to make a documentary critiquing male gamer culture [<a class="ref" href="#consalvo2012">Consalvo 2012</a>]),
               the obfuscation of sex and gender, even where possible in the case of Wikimedia
               editors is not possible in the case of Wikimedia subject matter (i.e. the page
                  <em class="emph">about</em> Anita Sarkeesian). Furthermore, beyond attacks against
               Wikimedia subjects and editors on the grounds of sex and gender, the structure of
               information is a feminist issue since those structures can perpetuate institutional
               sexism, as the quiet removal of female authors from the "American
                  Novelists" category in Wikipedia, categorizing them instead as "Women American Novelists" in 2013 attests [<a class="ref" href="#filipacchi2013">Filipacchi 2013</a>]. The problems introduced by harassment and structural
               sexism in Wikimedia projects is exacerbated by institutional sexism offline. Studies
               show that women have less spare time than men to devote to Wikimedia contributions
               and that the content that they do contribute is more likely than men’s to be deleted
               as trivial [<a class="ref" href="#eckert2013">Eckert and Steiner 2013</a>][<a class="ref" href="#lam2011">Lam et al. 2011</a>]. The social forces that exacerbate female and feminine
               people’s oppression offline, persist online — reinforcing and building on the
               behaviors and structural barriers that constitute oppression offline.</div>

               2013, the project editorial team endorses the #TooFew and #DHPoco editing drives. As
               Adeline Koh has pointed out, since the average Wikipedia editor "is a college-educated, 30 year old, computer savvy man who lives in the United
                  States or Western Europe, it is unsurprising that the online encyclopedia has its
                  own unconscious ideological leanings"[<a class="ref" href="#koh2013a">Koh 2013a</a>]. Those leanings, discussed in more detail below, contribute
               to an environment that is hostile to women resulting in lower quality of the topics
               that are culturally coded as being feminine or of interest to women [<a class="ref" href="#lam2011">Lam et al. 2011</a>][<a class="ref" href="#currie2012">Currie 2012</a>]. The edit-a-thons, organized independently and through
               THATCamp Feminisms conferences, are evidence of scholars’ recognition of the
               inequitable nature of editorial practice and knowledge organization in Wikimedia
               projects. Moreover, the edit-a-thons are proof that scholars recognize that the
               Wikimedia projects are valued by the public as sources of information and so warrant
               feminist scholars’ engagement.</div>

               privileges process over product. The expectation was that with transparency of
               workload and contribution would come a flattening of hierarchies, since, where there
               are power imbalances, the door is open to abuse, particularly of the type evinced by
               women’s higher service load both within the academy and without [<a class="ref" href="#bury2010">Bury 2010</a>]. This is not to say that where there is power imbalance
               sexism is an inevitable result, but it is certainly easier for personal and systemic

               a collaboratively edited manuscript to create a collaboratively edited edition.
               Edited and circulated by a group of women in Anne Boleyn’s court, the <cite class="title italic">Devonshire Manuscript</cite> bears traces of women’s resistance to
               Hatfield’s jest about women’s sole virtue. Compiled in the 1530s and early 1540s by
               various sixteenth-century contributors, the manuscript itself is a multi-authored
               verse miscellany. The <cite class="title italic">Social Edition of the Devonshire
                  Manuscript</cite> fills the void that Margaret Ezell notes has been left by the
                  "little effort [that] has been made to catalogue and
                  reconstruct patterns in women’s manuscript texts to provide an inclusive overview
                  of literary activities rather than isolated, individual authors"[<a class="ref" href="#ezell1999">Ezell 1999</a>, 23]. The editorial communities that have grown up
               around social media sites like Wikibooks indicate a public desire to expand our
               knowledge communities using the social technologies at our disposal. Using the <cite class="title italic">Devonshire Manuscript</cite> as a prototype, we have devised a
               method that addresses the questions that a social edition raises. In a feminist
               context, which in this case we take to mean the resistance to patriarchy’s devaluing
               of all things culturally coded as feminine or female, we must ask whether feminist
               edition production must have a text written by women at its center in order to be a
               feminist project. We argue that, while the recovery of women’s history and women’s
               contribution to literature is a feminist aim, in the context of Wikimedia edition
               production, feminist methods cannot only be indexed to content, but must instead be
               evaluated against the behavior and the organization of knowledge during the creation
               and maintenance of the edition.</div>

               hood of Wikimedia projects’ pages is a network of editor’s personal pages, talk
               pages, and edit reports which allow for the specific self-declaration of an editor’s

               computer scientist from the University of Minnesota, has noted that Wikipedia content
               that attracts male editors is of higher quality (using length as a proxy for quality)
               than the content that attracts female editors [<a class="ref" href="#lam2011">Lam et al. 2011</a>, 5].<a class="noteRef" href="#d4e311">[6]</a> He concludes that
               women are more likely to contribute to Wikipedia’s People and Arts sections than they
               are to Geography, Health, History, Science, Philosophy, and Religion. But, due to the
               relatively few female Wikipedia editors, male editors still outnumber female editors
               in the Arts and People by a ratio of ten to one [<a class="ref" href="#lam2011">Lam et al. 2011</a>, 5].<a class="noteRef" href="#d4e316">[7]</a> Lam
               attributes the gap to the culture of Wikipedia: women do not have a critical mass on
               Wikipedia, and the Wikipedia community treats them with greater hostility than it
               does men. Only 16% of new editors on Wikipedia are women, and, Lam found, new female
               editors are more likely to have their edits reverted than their male counterparts
                  [<a class="ref" href="#lam2011">Lam et al. 2011</a>, 4, 3]. Women’s hostile reception has resulted in low
               female participation in Wikipedia editing. Their underrepresentation has skewed the
               content, quality, and visibility of the subjects that, due to the enculturated
               differences between the sexes, are of interest to women. Our experience in Wikibooks

               rather than the culture of Wikimedia projects informed our choice of Wikibooks as the
               venue for initial publication. Although the manuscript has attracted scholarly
               attention as an artifact of the first sustained multi-gendered writing community in
               English, at the time of writing there had been no authoritative critical editions of

                     <a class="noteRef" href="#d4e334">[8]</a> The manuscript has, however,
               served as a source for Sir Thomas Wyatt’s poetry. His verses have been transcribed
               and published by A. K. Foxwell (1914), Kenneth Muir (1947, 1949, 1969), and Patricia
               Thomson (1969) in their respective editions of his work, but until now no scholar has
               transcribed the manuscript in its entirety. This "author-centered
                  focus," Arthur F. Marotti has argued, "distorts [the]
                  character" of the <cite class="title italic">Devonshire Manuscript</cite> in two
               ways: "first, it unjustifiably draws the work of other writers
                  into the Wyatt canon, and, second, it prevents an appreciation of the collection
                  as a document illustrating some of the uses of lyric verse within an actual social
                  environment"[<a class="ref" href="#marotti1995">Marotti 1995</a>, 40]. Scholars focused on Wyatt’s poems in the
               manuscript until the middle of the twentieth century, when Raymond Southall (1964),
               John Stevens (1961), Ethel Seaton (1956), Richard Harrier (1975), and Heale (1995)
               began to assert its value as a record of court life and of women’s editorial
               practices. These scholars acknowledged the manuscript’s significance as a product of
               multiple authors representing their private and public concerns in the social context
               of Henry VIII’s court. While the significance of the manuscript as a source of
               Wyatt’s poetry was by no means diminished by this new focus, Helen Baron’s
               identification of the hands in the <cite class="title italic">Devonshire Manuscript

               recovering women’s history via translations, treatises, diaries, memoirs, letters,
               and even crafted objects. "Women’s translations are being treated

                     by essays and books that position women writers alongside their male
                     counterparts and that incorporate women's texts into larger literary, cultural,

               a shift in scholars’ processes of canonizing writers and works. This new critical
               focus has encouraged researchers, as Sara Jayne Steen suggests, "to re-imagine a manuscript culture that included writers of both sexes"[<a class="ref" href="#steen2004">Steen 2004</a>, 147]. As this new focus of literary study drew
               scholars’ attention to the way court lyrics could reflect the interactions of poetry
               and power in early Renaissance society, enquiry began to extend beyond the
               consideration of canonical texts and privileged genres. New Historicist feminist
               scholarship reclaimed the importance of the <cite class="title italic">Devonshire

               practices, the tenants of feminist social editing cannot limit content to women’s
               history, but ought to be applicable to all editorial content. Any collaboratively

               persist in personal and systemic sexism. The question of platform and
               encoding-specific affordances was of particular interest to the DMSEG, since even
               though the edition resides in Wikibooks, it took a host of social media platforms to
               coordinate the encoding and review process. The content of stakeholder and partner
               interactions outlined below was facilitated by multiple social media platforms,
               including blog post comment threads; Wikibooks discussion pages; Iter’s dedicated
               Renaissance and early modern online community space; personal interviews via Skype;
               and Twitter conversations. We have found that each social media platform attracts
               different stakeholder groups and enables specific types of interaction. Employing and
               participating in various platforms both alerted us to different priorities across
               platforms, and forced us to think through how we might create a multispatial
               experience for safe, productive, and equitable interactions. In the interest of
               refining the process and expounding on its utility for collaborative editors in the
               Web 2.0 environment, the ETCL-based members of the team used a combination of methods
               to gather data on the social edition building process. We conducted qualitative
               interviews with advisory group members, none of whom had extensive experience editing
               in Wikimedia, to gather their perspectives on the content of our evolving and fixed
               editions, as well as on issues of credit, peer review, and collaborative editing. We
               also enumerated interaction in Wikibooks. Furthermore, we invited feedback via Iter’s
               social media space, Twitter and guest blog posts. </div>

               heart of the social edition. The transcription of the <cite class="title italic">Devonshire
                  Manuscript</cite> predates public crowdsourced transcription projects such as
                  <cite class="title italic">Transcribe Bentham</cite>. Transcription in an online space
               would have allowed interested readers to follow, or even to contribute, to the
               project and such transcriptions would have been in keeping with the ethos of the
               project. The closed transcription process does not necessarily produce a feminist
               organization of knowledge and or ethos of collaboration. At the time of
               transcription, however, the team did not have permission to post or circulate the
               manuscript facsimile, so they had to produce the transcriptions without public input.
               Two team members worked from paper copies of the <cite class="title italic">Devonshire
                  Manuscript</cite> and produced independent transcriptions. In general, their
               transcriptions were in accord with one another. To settle any conflicting
               transcriptions, Ray Siemens returned to the British Library in order to compare the
               transcriptions to the manuscript itself.</div>

               project, the team then encoded the text in TEI, the mark-up language of the Text
               Encoding Initiative. In order to keep the editorial and encoding process transparent,
               the Wikibook edition includes links to the baseline xml-encoded transcription. Thus,
               in addition to being able to use the xml for their own projects, readers can see the
               editorial choices the TEI allowed encoders to preserve. Other digital humanists may
               continue working with the TEI-encoding document, allowing the project to evolve in
               ways that could not be anticipated at the outset. With the firm foundation of
               documented encoding, all those working with the document can refer to, build on, or
               adapt the project’s foundation. </div>

               reflection especially where it may shape what edition users can, through search or
               programmatic retrieval and counting, learn about the text. While wikicode, which
               underpins Wikimedia projects, has no gendered hierarchy built into its standard tag
               set, at the time of encoding the TEI certainly did. TEI, as Laura Mandell and Melissa
               Terras have argued, with its reliance on ISO standards, relegates women to second
               standing [<a class="ref" href="#mandell2013">Mandell 2013</a>][<a class="ref" href="#terras2013">Terras 2013</a>]. ISO standards allow four values for sex: 1 - male, 2 -
               female, 0 - unknown, and 9 - not applicable. The TEI changed the standard in 2013 to
               allow for locally defined values (Simone de Beauvoir need no longer have her work
               literalized, by being represented as a member of &lt;sex value="2"&gt;, or so
               the joke goes). The encoding of the manuscript in TEI P4, which was converted to TEI
               P5 in 2007, predates the change in the values for @sex and the &lt;sex&gt; element.
               The germ of the Wikibooks edition was created by transforming the TEI into wikicode,
               which has no sexed markers, via XSLT transformation, therefore any (now outdated) use
               of @sex or &lt;sex&gt; does not appear in the code of the Wikibook’s edition of the
                  <cite class="title italic">Devonshire Manuscript</cite>. "XML and
                  SGML," Wernimont reminds us, can be read "as political
                  rather than neutral tools"[<a class="ref" href="#wernimont2013">Wernimont 2013</a>, 11]. That said, does wikicode’s avoidance of the
               ISO standard refuse to recognize the value of sexed difference or simply erase
               evidence of women’s participation? In the final analysis the information organized
               for the human reader announces the value of women’s participation in the production
               of the original manuscript, but does not let the programmatic reader algorithmically
               determine, for example, how many items in the manuscript were entered by women,
               although it does let that reader, armed with an algorithm, list, for example, all the
               poems entered in Mary Shelton’s hand, and, furthermore, which of those poems are her
               original creation. Another layer of encoding could be added to make the sex of the
               Devonshire Manuscript compilers clear in Wikibooks, but it is not clear that focusing
               on the sex of the contributors, whether they be historical or contemporary, is a
               central, or even requisite criterion of a feminist editorial methodology in
               Wikibooks.</div>

                  <div class="ptext" id="p22"> Feminist social edition building does not rely solely on thoughtful encoding of sex
               and gender; it relies on the behavior of contributors, readers, and critics in and
               around the edition. It is this behavior, rather than simply the publication of
               material by female compilers, that makes an edition a feminist work. The formation of
               the social edition’s advisory group, in particular, provided a unique opportunity to
               invite potential critics to shape the process and the products associated with the
               social edition, and to negotiate and even encode the changes that they would like to
               see as the edition evolved rather than have them critique a fixed and final edition.
               If a feminist edition is one that guards against the personal and institutional
               sexism that may (and indeed does [<a class="ref" href="#bury2010">Bury 2010</a>]) filter into the online
               world from the offline world, the members of the DMSEG working in the Electronic
               Textual Cultures Lab (ETCL) at the University of Victoria had to work out which tools
               and procedures for collaboration, credit, and social engagement would let us
               iteratively test the feminist affordances of the social edition.</div>

               wiki culture. As we traversed this new multidisciplinary ground, we sought advice and
               responses from a variety of sources. Procedurally, before moving the edition into
               Wikibooks, the ETCL team prepared a static digital edition of the manuscript. This
               static edition served as a base text, to which our international advisory group of
               early modern and Renaissance scholars could compare the Wikibooks as it evolved.
               Finally, the ETCL team moved the wikicode version of the manuscript into Wikibooks
               where any member of the DMSEG could edit it. We received feedback from the advisory
               group via Skype interviews and Iter, from the scholar and citizen community via
               Twitter and blogs, and from the Wikibooks community via Wikibooks itself. In addition
               to informing and instructing the ETCL team on the early modern content of the

               What transpired was not a clash, however, but rather an instance of trolling that is
               in keeping with reports of the sexism and drive-by trolling of open Web resources and
               comment threads. In light of our experience of the iterative production of the social

               production in order to mitigate the trolling that tends to repel female contributors,
               thus decreasing the likelihood that those resources will contain quality information

                  <div class="ptext" id="p25">The advisory group was unanimous in their assertion that the Wikibooks platform
               challenges our traditional means of assessing an edition’s authority while
               facilitating the type of conversation that peer review is meant to embody. An advisor
               remarked, "the main advantage [of an evolving edition] is the
                  openness to further corrections and improvements — of the introduction, the texts,
                  and the commentary." Not all of the advisors, however, were interested in
               opening the edition to annotations by graduate students or members of the public, no
               matter how equitable our goals. As an advisor asserted, "there
                  are very few people qualified to read this manuscript and say anything I would
                  want to read." This comment points to the divide between some academics and
               the public: the scholarly community has produced authoritative editions and other
               resources, such as the <cite class="title italic">Oxford Dictionary of National
                  Biography</cite> and <cite class="title italic">Oxford English Dictionary</cite>,
               however, the cost of accessing those authoritative resources has pushed members of
               the public to platforms that let them share and circulate knowledge for free. The
               content in Wikimedia platforms only costs time to compose and consume. The divide
               between two spheres, academic and public, who make and share knowledge within their
               own spheres, but who do not collaborate with one another in Wikimedia, is wide.
               Furthermore, both groups may not act in ways that support equity. The key is to push
               back against the definition of qualification, as we will see, in both communities to
               find out where institutional prejudice may adhere from the offline world. Within the
               scope of our study scholars did not stop or even comment on issues of trolling
               because they did not have the time to gather the expertise and wiki credibility that
               it takes to be a wiki editor. Feminist scholars would be empowered to contribute to
               Wikimedia projects by receiving credit for that work. If scholars did contribute they
               would be less likely to dismiss Wikimedia projects, however, as it stands report of
               trolling and issues of credit like the ones listed here, might simply prevent
               scholars from contributing to Wikimedia projects. Indeed, female scholars are subject
               to the same brevity of free time that is endemic for most women outside of academia,
               so, as long as scholars do not get credit for Wikimedia work and have to do it
               outside of their regular work in the knowledge sector, the less likely we are to
               close the credibility gaps that exist between Wikimedians’ editorial skill and
               scholars’ faith in Wikimedia projects’ accuracy and authority. </div>

               between the advisory and ETCL-based members of the team. The next step, however, was
               to get the advisors to trust one another, to make it clear that there were some
               people behind the edition that were "qualified to read the
                  manuscript" and contribute with authority, thereby closing the
               credibility gap that dissenting members of the advisory group brought to the process.
               Following the Skype consultations, the advisory group continued the conversation in
               Iter’s social media space — a Drupal installation that shares many features with
               Facebook. Users each have their own profile pages, and may join groups, send email,
               and blog. The asynchronous nature of the posts made it difficult to sustain a
               conversation, but in response to our group’s review Iter is redesigning how it
               notifies users of new comments. The group was collegial — there was no trace of the
               personal or institutional sexism found in the Wikimedia space. </div>

               the editorial venture was more fraught. We furthered our social media interactions
               via Twitter, where twice weekly we tweeted out poems from the <cite class="title italic">Devonshire Manuscript</cite> Wikibook.<a class="noteRef" href="#d4e503">[10]</a> We received feedback, from the ardent support of Tudor
               avatars to the more critical responses of academics. To our surprise, we found a
               thriving community of Henrician avatars on Twitter, including members of the public
               to tweet as Anne Boleyn, Thomas Wyatt, Mary Shelton, and Margaret Douglas. We thought
               that they might be interested in reading and contributing to the Wikibooks edition.
               It turned out, however, that the people behind the avatars were more interested in
               the roleplay and social interaction that Twitter makes possible than they were in
               editing. The ETCL team, via the <cite class="title italic">Devonshire Manuscript</cite>
               Twitter account was invited to join Twitter picnics in which the Henrician avatars
               met at an appointed time to tweet to one another. In this case the affordances of
               Twitter were to our advantage. The Wikibook space would not necessarily have been a
               place that supported roleplay and socializing, but Twitter offered a space for that
               type of interaction, leaving the Wikibook comment threads and talk pages free from
               the pretense of people professing to be the original contributors to the <cite class="title italic">Devonshire Manuscript</cite>. We received more constructive

               current academic environment, job promotion and security rely on tangible records of
               service. The inability to receive credit for editing in Wikibooks may deter even the
               most interested feminist scholars from contributing to Wikimedia projects. As one
               advisor noted, <blockquote>
                        <p>perhaps some day, probably in the next generation,
                  people … won’t be as worried about [credit] as we are. If it becomes a question
                  that, if it’s tenure-related, you have to prove authorship of X amount of work …
                  if that suddenly is adjusted so that tenure, peer evaluation, and peer review,
                  becomes something that it isn’t right now, something more reflective of the way
                  we’re doing our research work, then it may be that people are less concerned about
                  who gets credit for what, or how you approach the idea of collaborative research.

                     </blockquote> The more fixed structure of the academic credit system is at odds with the
               evolving frameworks of projects like the <cite class="title italic">Social Edition of the
                  Devonshire Manuscript</cite>. As one advisor remarked, "I
                  think there’s way too much focus on the end product, there’s less attention paid
                  to preserving and sharing the process that leads up to the end product. I would
                  like to see that done a bit more often." In the ongoing nature of most
               digital projects inheres a dilemma: how do we assign and receive credit for work that
               may never be completed in a traditional sense? </div>

                  <div class="ptext" id="p29">Frequent editors gain recognition for conscientious Wikimedia editing by being
               granted more administrative power within the system, power that their fellow editors
               vote to assign them. We would like to see scholars engage in this process to make
               their knowledge more readily available to the public. Members of the scholarly
               community, especially graduate students and untenured faculty, however, need to be
               able to account for their contributions. Female faculty are more likely than their
               male counterparts to engage in service work to the detriment of their academic
               careers [<a class="ref" href="#misra2012">Misra 2012</a>, 318]. It is important, therefore, to frame
               social editing as scholarship, rather than service, even if it does have a
               significant community outreach (and therefore, some might argue, service) component.
               Furthermore, we need to provide a mechanism that preserved contributors’ anonymity
               within Wikimedia, but let them point to the amount of work that they had done for the
               purpose of tenure and promotion. The Magic Circle (a visualization tool for assigning
               credit by showing contributions to every page in pie chart form) included
               contributions for the discussion pages (a space appended to each Wikibook page where
               users can discuss pending changes or revisions) (see <a href="#figure03">figure
                  3</a>). In an effort to extend methods for assigning credit, colleagues at the
               University of Alberta’s Canadian Writing Research Collaboratory and School of
               Business donated the code that underpins their Magic Circle to the social edition

               this type of visualization: "there are various ways in which
                  editors can make contributions to a wiki page, e.g., one editor may add new
                  content, another editor may reorganize the text, and a third may remove redundant
                  text to make the page flow better. We believe that a method for estimating
                  editors’ contributions should capture these various authorship categories"[<a class="ref" href="#arazy2010">Arazy et al. 2010</a>, 1167]. The Magic Circle helps make visible our

               work that extends beyond the creation of original content. Discussion and feedback
               are central to scholarly revision. A print edition, however, often only acknowledges
               these forms of labor with a line or two on the acknowledgments page. Our initial plan
               was to visualize user-defined major and minor edits, as well as contributions to the
               discussion pages. For example, the Magic Circle lets us include the tips from our
               discussion pages offered by Wikimedia editor Jomegat. Jomegat joined in the
               discussion but did not edit any of our pages directly. S/He did, however, offer
               advice on the finer points of importing content from Wikipedia pages [<a class="ref" href="#jomegat2011">Jomegat 2011</a>]. In the final analysis, we decided not to import content —
               Jomegat’s suggestions helped us to refine our own thinking, and including Jomegat’s
               contributions in the Magic Circle adds to the record of our decision-making process.
               Ideally, this record will help anyone who considers importing content into the
               edition to see how we have addressed the issue in the past. Jomegat’s intervention
               and input on this topic was very helpful and, we argue, deserves credit.</div>

               Wikimedia suite of projects, to which the members of the DMSEG were as susceptible as
               other editors. For example, in December 2011, one of the ETCL team members, editing
               under the user name Cultures4, was subject to sudden abuse on her personal discussion
               page. The trolling user, Tyrone Jones 2, made sexist comments against the member of
               our team, with an aggressive and racist tone, on both her page and on others’ talk
               pages. Nevertheless, although discussions in Wikibooks are occasionally fractious,
               the Wikibooks community remains dedicated to the site’s integrity: within a day of
               the attack on our team member, Jomegat had deleted the offending user’s Wikibooks
               account (although further investigation has shown that this user is a recurring

               As one advisor stated, in a wiki <blockquote>
                        <p>you don’t necessarily want to go

                  be able to work through it in the Talk section, and then from there … you
                  introduce yourself into the environment, you offer suggestions, you point out
                  where things may or may not gel with what you think… from that point you engage
                  with the actual editing on the page. </p>
                     </blockquote> The other advisors offered similar
               sentiments: they wanted to discuss before they revised. </div>
                  <div class="counter">
                     <a href="#p35">35</a>

                  <div class="ptext" id="p35"> We discussed the community’s talk page norms with Panic, another editor who has
               taken an interest in our edition. He told us that Wikimedia editors do not use talk
               pages in the way that our advisors wished. Panic claims, "[p]eople will only use (write) into talk pages to express discontent about
                  something, clear some controversial contribution or gather support for some major
                  change"[<a class="ref" href="#panic2012">Panic 2012</a>]. Furthermore, he says, in a sidelong critique of
               Wikimedia’s hostile environment "[o]ne thing that I always have
                  in mind is that we are all volunteers so I try to balance criticism with praise
                  for work well done"[<a class="ref" href="#panic2012">Panic 2012</a>]. In short, the Wikibooks discussion pages are comprised of
               more personal commentary than editorial suggestions. The Wikibooks discussion pages
               are predominantly venues for editors to offer one another personal support rather
               than to discuss Wikibook content. The potential for abuse, however, is high, and the
               hostile environment created by the type of trolling the DMSEG experienced may deter
               otherwise interested editors from contributing.</div>

                  <div class="ptext" id="p36">Thus, rather than relying on the discussion pages for editorial decisions, we made
               the most substantive changes in Wikibooks based on our Skype and Iter interactions
               with our advisory group. Although our hope had been to have the advisors edit
               directly in Wikibooks, some of our advisors found the technological threshold for
               contributing to Wikibooks too high and the environment too hostile. We found that it
               was more practical to have the ETCL team make the proposed changes in the Wikibook.
               We responded to the advisors’ recommendations in near-real time, adding navigation
               menus and images that the advisors suggested through our ongoing consultation. It
               happened that we needed many avenues for editorial conversation in order to foster
               the sense of a community that, as one of our advisors noted, is "virtually there, as if everyone is crowded around a page, putting their two cents
                  in on matters great and small." Multiple social media platforms facilitate
               social editing, whereas relying on one single communication platform (such as
               Wikibooks alone) may impede the success of an evolving social edition with feminist
               aims. </div>

               ambivalence about topics that are culturally coded as feminine. There are, of course,
               many women who edit in the Wikimedia suite of projects who do not identify their sex.
               Non-identification might initially seem like the solution: if women do not disclose
               their sex, they will be assumed to be male, and will benefit from the greater
               deference accorded to men online. But just as the nineteenth-century novelist who hid
               behind a male <span class="foreign i">nom de plume</span> did not directly
               challenge the assumption that women could not produce great literature, non-gendered
               interaction does nothing to improve the poor impression of the validity of knowledge
               that women share online. We propose a tiered solution: for the time being, women
               ought not feel pressure to reveal their sex online, ought to be provided with
               mechanisms for receiving credit, should have the training and status to combat sexist
               trolling (via reverting content, enforcing rules, or even deleting editor accounts)
               and, in order to foster the peer-review-as-conversation model, edition builders ought
               to use multiple online social spaces in order to build the trust and collegiality

               process in our contemporary modes of knowledge conveyance and edition building.
               Issues of authority, credit, or technological threshold are not the only reasons
               scholars resist contributing to Wikimedia projects. While it was easy to ensure
               civility (if not outright concern for gender equity) in Iter’s social space, it was
               very challenging to confront the systemic and direct sexism in Wikibooks. The wiki

               Wikimedia is not a suitable or effective response to this issue. The Wikimedia suite
