                  <p>Among the many reactions against the digital revolution is a humanitarian
                    movement toward long form online reading in collective and social networks. This
                    movement — visible in online book clubs such as "Infinite
                        Summer" and 1book140, websites such as longreads.com, and the trend
                    of blogs-to-books publication — is a reaction against superficial increasingly
                    brief headline-driven Internet news. Called to action by the threat of what
                    critic Jessica Helfand has diagnosed as digital culture’s "narrative depravation," the deep reading revival has reclaimed
                    narrative and returned it to the populace, transforming reading into an act of
                    mass collaboration on an unprecedented scale. Despite studies corroborating
                    Nicholas Carr’s claim in <cite class="title italic">The Shallows</cite> (2011) that
                    the distractions of the digital environment are anathema to immersive linear
                    deep reading, online culture has actually enhanced and accelerated the
                    appreciation of longer richer works through its support of "radial reading" as described by Jerome McGann. This essay argues
                    that while the intrinsically distracting virtual geography of the Internet has
                    threatened to diminish the role of textured narrative in our intellectual and
                    social lives, the Web has ironically provided the media for the most salient
                    movements in support of the deep reading it threatens to obliterate. </p>

                            they give us an occasion to work together to help us sustain our
                            attention, to achieve goals we might have thought too difficult to
                            attain working on our own. So let’s get going — with a chaos of

                  <div class="ptext" id="p1">A movement in long form and literary journalism is currently gaining traction on
                    the Internet, representing a revival in deep reading whose roots were barely
                    visible in Internet culture just ten years ago. The advent of platforms such as
                    Longform.org in 2010 just after the release of the iPad that same year, followed
                    by Atavist and Byliner in 2011, has inspired a host of vibrant online reading
                    communities. The collaborative mass movement seeking longer more textured
                    writing has risen in direct opposition to the shrinking attention spans
                    associated with the digital revolution that have threatened to diminish, if not
                    utterly annihilate, the status of narrative as the transmitter of core values
                    shared and contested in the culture. Ironically, this crusade to rescue
                    narrative from the distracting ecosystem of the Internet not only has adopted
                    the very medium blamed for its demise, it has done so with a robust "chaos of connections, a blizzard of studied silence, a
                            whirling vortex of intense, collective focus" [<a class="ref" href="#konstantinou2012">Konstantinou 2012</a>]. Testifying to the rich diversity of digital culture and its ubiquitous
                    reach, the Internet has provided both the setting and tools for the
                    counter-revolution to reclaim narrative from the "attention
                        economy" and the commercial distractions of its infrastructure, from
                    Google searches to social media [<a class="ref" href="#briggs2011">Briggs 2011</a>, 15].</div>

                    marginalization of print books signaled by the rapid decline since 2002 in all
                    forms of print reading, according to a 2012 Pew study, and the attendant rise of
                    online reading [<a class="ref" href="#kohut2012">Kohut 2012</a>]. The shift away from print has
                    suggested for some critics the loss of the literary mind associated with it, as
                    deep immersive reading would appear to have yielded to highly distracting
                    hyperlinked e-book alternatives and increasingly superficial online reading. But
                    deep reading and online reading are not mutually exclusive pursuits; the
                    Internet provides fertile ground for critical immersion in a wide variety of
                    media texts. Surging demand for those digital texts is buoying rather than
                    sinking the publishing industry, as sales rose to twenty-three percent of book
                    publishers’ revenue in 2012 for a six percent gain reaching $7.1 billion in
                    revenue that year [<a class="ref" href="#boynton2013">Boynton 2013</a>, 129]. </div>

                    argue, do not signal the inevitable decline and extinction of serious reflective
                    reading. Indeed, the latest wave of online reading communities has harnessed
                    hypersocial participatory Internet culture for sustained focus on long immersive
                    works. Whereas digital reading has been previously criticized for the haste and
                    superficiality it encourages, the movement toward deep reading has given rise to
                    a new premium on media products’ "stickiness," a measure
                    based on how much time a reader spends with a digital text. Platforms such as
                    Longform.org operate according to this model. In 2012, for example, sixty-five
                    percent of Longform’s readers completed every 2,000 plus-word story they read
                        [<a class="ref" href="#boynton2013">Boynton 2013</a>, 130]. Among the diverse reading
                    communities now populating the digital ecosystem from Harlequin and fantasy
                    serial fiction to classical literature groups, Longform’s young mobile and
                    well-educated readers represent a demographic Robert S. Boynton has called
                        "the envy of any advertiser," as fifty percent
                    are under 34, thirty percent read mainly on phones and tablets, and forty-two
                    percent have attended graduate school [<a class="ref" href="#boynton2013">Boynton 2013</a>, 130]. </div>

                  <div class="ptext" id="p4">This study begins by situating deep reading within the larger critical debate
                    about the impact of digital culture, followed by a segment defining deep and
                    immersive online reading practices. Focus then turns to how deep and immersive
                    reading play out in particular digital reading communities, with emphasis on the
                    signature moves that characterize their social function to support deep
                    immersive reading and foster an appreciation for narrative. Consideration then
                    turns to how such groups constitute social reading as mass collaboration, a
                    process made possible by nature of its deinstitutionalized participatory
                    culture, the subject of the next section. The conclusion argues for the crucial
                    role of narrative immersion in the formation of conscientious moral judgment. </div>

                     <div class="ptext" id="p5">If Herman Melville’s <cite class="title italic">Moby-Dick</cite> (1852) stands as
                        one of the literary world’s great monuments to narrative achievement, the
                            <cite class="title italic">Moby-Dick</cite> Marathon Reading became a major
                        occasion in popular literary culture to safeguard that achievement along
                        with its print and oratorical origins from the distractions of the digital
                        age. The annual New Bedford, Massachusetts live non-stop relay reading of
                        Melville’s novel functioned in 2009 as a "sit-in
                            protest" against electronic media saturation according to Mayor
                        Scott Lange. Although Lange accurately predicted that "You won’t hear or see a cell phone," 2009 would actually be the
                        last anti-tech year for the reading, which then transformed from a tacit
                        luddite rite to a full-blown technological feast, complete with giant
                        screens displaying texts, tweets, and forum posts from virtual participants
                        throughout the world discussing live streaming video of readers delivering
                        passages of Melville’s epic narrative [<a class="ref" href="#dowling2010">Dowling 2010</a>, 38].
                        In only one year — from 2009 to 2010 — the event went from print-only to a
                        multimedia extravaganza that ironically sacrificed nothing of its original
                        intention: to reaffirm the power of complex narrative and the sanctity of
                        the reader’s full immersion in it. Once digital, the novel’s global reach
                        expanded the reading community of an event previously limited to its live
                        participants and reported by a few bloggers and local reporters. That
                        reading community has since grown with the proliferation of social media
                        channels in each successive year. Fear of technology’s stultifying effects
                        in 2009 proved moot in 2010, as the novel would build new significance
                        through its widening readership.</div>

                     <div class="ptext" id="p6">The spread of live Melville readings online is just one of many examples of
                        the deep reading renaissance now taking place in digital culture. The now
                        thoroughly digitized literary marathon readings reveal how online
                        communities have seized the tools of social media for deep reading,
                        effectively refuting skeptics such as Nicholas Carr (2011) and Jessica Helfand (2001), who insist that new media necessarily has a
                        deleterious effect on narrative, perhaps the most crucial link to our
                        humanity. But old media do not die; they converge, according to Henry
                        Jenkins (2006). In his recent study of Melville
                        in participatory digital culture, Jenkins points out that "it is simplistic to assume that technologies can support
                            only one mindset" associated with scanning and skimming. It is
                        also "wrong-headed to assume the Internet’s intellectual
                            ethic is in direct and total opposition to that associated with
                            books" because, as the history of media suggests, "one medium does not displace another, but rather, each
                            adds a new cultural layer, supporting more diverse ways of
                            communicating, thinking, feeling, and creating than existed
                            before"
                        [<a class="ref" href="#jenkins2013">Jenkins 2013</a>, 11]. Convergence culture, therefore, is at
                        the core of the latest online movement for deep reading, as it embodies
                        media merging together in an ongoing process at the intersection of
                        technologies, industries, content, and audiences [<a class="ref" href="#jenkins2013">Jenkins 2013</a>, 13]. Indeed, the online movement in deep reading illustrates
                        precisely how communities can respond to the disruption of an old pattern of
                        consumption — the solitary reading of print — by establishing new
                        participatory cultures across media platforms. </div>

                            Digital Age." In it one study concluded that online reading
                            "privileges locating information over deciphering
                            and analyzing more complex text," necessarily making "deep and sustained reading (for work or pleasure) run
                            second to information gathering and short-term distraction"
                        [<a class="ref" href="#baron2013">Baron 2013</a>, 200]. Yet such arguments, as Jim Collins
                        notes, "remain an exercise in nostalgia, grounded in a
                            discourse of inevitable loss." The hypersocialization of online
                        readers, I concur, is not "merely a distraction"
                        but "an entryway into an endless variety of reading
                            communities," a point made stronger in light of how they engage
                        in archiving, sharing, and discussing texts, all edifying behaviors that

                        personal and absorbed mode of reading [<a class="ref" href="#carr2011">Carr 2011</a>, 128].
                        But narrative free of hypertext is not always causally linked to deep,
                        focused reading. In many instances, narrative does not require or even
                        solicit deep reading. Guy Montag’s wife Mildred in Ray Bradbury’s novel
                            <cite class="title italic">Fahrenheit 451</cite>, for example, is addicted to
                        her daytime TV series she watches on "the parlor
                            walls" precisely because it intellectually anesthetizes her,
                        providing her with a pacifying substitute for books, which her government
                        systematically suppresses by burning any volumes that leak into the culture.
                        Although free of the distractions of hyperlinked data and easy access to
                        social media, her media text is designed for passive consumption. She is
                        drawn to the linear narrative of television soap operas precisely because
                        they do not demand deep complex interpretation and/or inspire discourse with
                        her community. She is immersed, in this sense, but not engaged critically in
                        her subject in a way characterizing deep reading. Marshall McLuhan described
                        such immersion as a feature of "hot" media that
                        encourages emotional rather than intellectual — and thus potentially
                        political — engagement. A high-definition medium like the one that absorbs
                        Bradbury’s character represents McLuhan’s sense that new media technology
                        could furnish an overabundance of the imaginative stimulus (usually through
                        escapist fantasy) for the reader without challenging them to exercise their
                        own imaginations or grapple with provocative ideological scenarios and
                        propositions [<a class="ref" href="#kovarik2011">Kovarik 2011</a>, 10]
                        [<a class="ref" href="#mcluhan1965">McLuhan 1965</a>]. Thus narrative can be not only shallow, as the
                        facile episodes of electronic home entertainment in Bradbury’s dystopia
                        suggest. Narrative can also be socially corrosive since "Millie" Montag
                        has in effect substituted the fictional figures on her parlor wall for the
                        real ones who actually populate her life. </div>

                        Bradbury and McLuhan are symptomatic of a culture deprived of online social
                        media. The digital ecology has enabled immersive reading — in which the
                        consumer is fully absorbed in a work’s characters, scenes and narrative — to
                        be intellectually empowering. My use of "deep reading"
                        here denotes analysis and critique, whereas "immersion"
                        suggests a completeness of experience. Depth does not necessitate immersion;
                        deep reading can occur with simple texts and vice-versa. These are not
                        always mutually dependent categories, as many instances illustrate. Indeed,
                        what readers actually do in their participation with texts reflects an
                        expansive heterogeneous range of online practices marked by a willingness to
                        dive deeply into a wide array of texts. </div>

                        and immersion in the extreme. Internet readers of immersive narrative
                        reflect a completeness of experience that inspires rather than silences
                        discussion, draws out rather than erases the individual reading experience,
                        and socializes rather than isolates the pastime of media consumption. This
                        socializing tendency renders a morally conscientious reading experience.
                        Narrative is particularly effective in driving that social exchange of
                        analysis and critique because it humanizes online news media’s notoriously
                        brief, abstract, and impersonal standard mode of expression. Set in the
                        context of long form narrative, deep immersive reading becomes more
                        provocative for readers, inspiring more nuanced and serious consideration of
                        any given set of events or ideological circumstances superficially skimmed
                        by traditional headline-driven news. As discussed in the conclusion,

                        critical presumptions about deep and immersive reading. A key assumption in
                        Carr’s [<a class="ref" href="#carr2011">Carr 2011</a>] argument, for example, privileges linear
                        narrative of the sort associated with cause-effect realistic fiction of the
                        Victorian era, as his favorite examples in <cite class="title italic">The
                            Shallows</cite> tend to be Charles Dickens and Nathaniel Hawthorne. Yet
                        he also includes modernist James Joyce, noting that "nonlinear narrative" by writers like William Burroughs "would have been unthinkable without the artists’
                            presumption of attentive patient readers." Privileging print, he
                        argues that "when transcribed to a page, a stream of
                                consciousness becomes literary and linear" [<a class="ref" href="#carr2011">Carr 2011</a>, 76]. But Burroughs in print is just as nonlinear as Burroughs online.
                        Hypertextual links would enable rather than disable fluent readings of his
                        enigmatic and densely allusive idiosyncratic texts. Thus print does not
                        automatically make all texts more linear and thus more literary and deep.
                        Indeed, what distinguishes so many texts embraced by online reading
                        communities is precisely their nonlinearity, their narrative tendency to
                        yield to enriching diversions or downright distractions and their capacity
                        to shatter artificial distinctions between high and low cultural products.

                        Complexity in visual media trafficking in narrative has also been steadily
                        rising for the last half century. Plots of television shows have become
                        increasingly complex and demanding, not simpler, since the 1950s [<a class="ref" href="#johnson2006">Johnson 2006</a>, 27]. Because viewers are not likely to
                        grasp in one viewing the full range of critical and narrative complexity of
                        today’s television shows, viewers thus have reason to watch them again by
                        purchasing the DVD for repeated viewing. David Foster Wallace was a

                        feed into print and e-books) enriches and deepens the culture of digital
                        identity, particularly the conventions of personal expression in social
                        media. As social reading increasingly becomes a means of shaping online
                        identity, it provides a more sophisticated extension of self-presentation
                        commonly found on Facebook. The sharing of reading can raise the stakes of
                        personal profiling beyond how "social networking site
                            users typically interpret cues deposited in member profiles, such as
                            messages on Facebook 'walls' or messages or pictures
                            of member friends to make inferences about the member’s
                            character"
                        [<a class="ref" href="#papacharissi2009">Papacharissi 2009</a>, 203] [<a class="ref" href="#walther2008">Walther 2008</a>, 28–49]. So while social reading serves user demand for the
                        circulation of readings, it also has the effect of showcasing reading tastes
                        as a richer more sophisticated expression of one’s personal profile. Prior
                        to social reading the construction of identity on Facebook has been rigidly
                        confined to a set of conventions that purport to express individuality, but
                        only on a superficial and often pretentious level. Social reading,
                        furthermore, offers the online world a profile more reflective of one’s
                        bookshelf — providing a portrait through intellectual, political, and
                        aesthetic interests — reaching well beyond the limited milieu of requisite
                        photos showcasing one’s children, spouse, and vacation along with humorous
                        links or witty quotes that have become the social norm for Facebook users.
                        Recent research indicates the "most popular features of Facebook include its
                                photo-sharing abilities" [<a class="ref" href="#papacharissi2009">Papacharissi 2009</a>, 204], a feature now used for book-sharing and social reading. Indeed, the
                        development of social reading has been fueled by its adaptability to the
                        contributions of "applications that work with the open source

                        themselves well to the Internet. With its abundance of easily accessed data
                        through hyperlinks, the Internet enhances "radial
                            reading," Jerome McGann’s concept which he contrasts with "linear reading"
                        [<a class="ref" href="#mcgann1991">McGann 1991</a>, 113]. Linear reading, particularly the sort
                        that disempowers the reader as noted by Moody [<a class="ref" href="#moody2012">Moody 2012</a>], is
                        at odds with varieties of spatial and radial reading that instead are more
                        in tune with current notions of narrative characterized by fragmented
                        diverse genres alluding to and intersecting with interior consciousness of
                        self and community. McGann explains that "radial reading involves decoding one or more of the
                                contexts that interpenetrate the scripted and physical text" [<a class="ref" href="#mcgann1991">McGann 1991</a>, 113]. In this sense, "the reading eye does not move only in a linear
                                direction" [<a class="ref" href="#mcgann1991">McGann 1991</a>, 113]. Complex material encourages radial reading because it "necessitates some kind of abstraction from what appears
                            most immediately," as McGann observes [<a class="ref" href="#mcgann1991">McGann 1991</a>, 113]. "The person who temporarily stops
                                    'reading' to look up the meaning of a word is
                                properly an <em class="emph">emblem</em> of radial reading because that kind
                                of 'radial' operation is repeatedly taking place
                                even while one remains absorbed with a text" [<a class="ref" href="#mcgann1991">McGann 1991</a>, 113]. Radial reading has never been so rich and rewarding as in the
                        context of the online ecosystem, with its readily available search engines
                        and social media tools. SMS drives such radial reading in an apparent
                        paradox in which brief messaging can aid rather than truncate deep
                        understandings and experiences of longer texts, leading to further
                        interaction among readers through tools such as email that allow for longer
                        nuanced expression. </div>

                        pattern, as readers delve deep within the text while also moving outward
                        into now readily available online data networks. "Emily Dickinson tells us that 'there is no frigate like a book' in order to remind us
                                that reading sends us away from and within the books we

                        the text in order to burrow deeper into it, as McGann explains, is far more
                        critically engaged than the escapist experience of Bradbury’s Mildred Montag
                        of <cite class="title italic">Fahrenheit 451</cite>. Interestingly, Harlequin
                        romance readers, today’s corollary to Mildred, are hardly so escapist, but
                        are increasingly active in reading community forums of exchange that not
                        only invite socially and politically engaged online discussions, but also
                        encourage professional development, catering directly to this active digital
                        generation of the formerly passive audience personified by Bradbury’s
                        Mildred. Indeed, Harlequin’s "Community Home"
                        offered in early 2014 "some great reading
                            challenges" for "aspiring authors" who
                        are encouraged to utilize "the information, support, and
                            advice to be found on our writing forums." Harlequin’s
                        rebranding, "Entertain, Enrich, Inspire," is
                        consonant with the active social nature of its thriving online reading
                        community countering older tendencies toward isolation and passivity
                        associated with paperback romance consumption. The publisher encourages

                            "Any thoughts on the wedding? A romance starting
                            with a forced marriage didn’t sit well but maybe was historically
                            accurate?" to which "Sandy" replied: "Marriage is a practical solution — protects Claire [the protagonist]
                            from BJR, keeps Jamie from leading the clan. Not a traditional
                            romance." Melissa registered her disappointment, "True, but was hoping for something more romantic in a
                            romance novel. I’m enjoying their post-wedding courtship more."
                        This tweet inspired Sandy to share the link to the <cite class="title italic">Books and Writers Community</cite> forum detailing how marketing plans
                        for the book shaped its blending of genre conventions, a contextual clue
                        tapping into the book trade’s larger industrial motives as an explanation
                        for the author’s aesthetic choice. Sandy’s tweet, "Here’s an explanation from @Writer_DG on why Outlander was originally
                            marketed as a romance," offered the link to data that, Melissa

                        said, allowing that "otherwise I would have quit after

                        against the fragmentation and alienation of digital culture. His project was
                        inspired by the <cite class="title italic">New Yorker </cite>article on Gaddis by
                        Jonathan Franzen, "Mr. Difficult," which alerted
                        him to the unsalable yet brilliant 976-page narrative sprawl. Konstantinou’s

                        the novel’s value remained hidden from readers. They lacked what the
                        Internet would provide: access to each other and rich stores of data to

                        entertainment. Instead, he suggests reframing the question in a way that
                        does not pit literary reading against popular reading in an antagonist
                        relation, considering instead "how the experience of

                        community, signified by the notice at the top of the screen in red: "There are NO spoiler restrictions in this

                        spoiling the entertainment of the uninitiated, and thus could delve into the
                        full scale of interconnected scene sequences and foreshadowing in <cite class="title italic">Infinite Jest</cite>’s sophisticated narrative structure.
                        Online Wallace readers were thus not only analytically inclined on the
                        forum, their critical impulse had them thinking in terms of the book’s
                        context within the context of its convergence across multiple media
                        platforms. One of the 154 topics introduced by readers on the forum, for

                        critical discussion that ensued ranged from speculation about which
                        directors could possibly pull off such a feat — David Lynch, Terry Gilliam,
                        and the Coen Brothers topped the list — in terms of the resonance of their
                        aesthetic with that of Wallace’s, a concern problematized by the translation
                        of his seemingly unfilmable and unwieldy narrative into a motion picture.
                        The difficulty of such a project raised the question of what specifically in
                        Wallace’s novel could speak to its essence on film, releasing a tide of
                        suggestions on which parts of the novel were indispensible and which could
                        be omitted. Indeed, the seemingly profound and intractable incompatibility
                        between Wallace’s work and the medium of film presented readers with a
                        conceptual challenge they embraced as an occasion to immerse themselves in

                        through a truncated medium like Twitter would appear to defeat the purpose.
                        Yet Twitter is just one step in an elaborate transmedia chain in which
                            "bookies"
                        "copy passages off their iPads, Nooks and Kindles

                        deep reading and long form texts paradoxically "is well-integrated in the postmodern trends that
                                provide ideological justification for undermining rigid, modernist

                        roots movement like those defined in Clay Shirky’s defense of the Internet’s
                        democratic function to offer a space for organization without the hegemonic
                        bureaucratic features of formal organizations [<a class="ref" href="#shirky2009">Shirky 2009</a>].
                        The movement away from institutionalization, he argues, has enabled a
                        greater degree of such mass collaboration in which "we can do things for strangers who do things for us
                                at low enough cost to make that kind of behavior attractive" [<a class="ref" href="#shirky2009">Shirky 2009</a>, 127]. Jurgen Habermas’s comments are helpful here in describing the
                        processes of deinstitutionalization, which help explain this as a type of
                        romantic reaction against the development of capitalism. Indeed, the
                        proliferation of online commerce has accelerated, reduced, and dehumanized
                        interpersonal communication during the digital revolution, just as the
                        mechanization of culture during the nineteenth century increasingly
                        calibrated and automated everyday labor and leisure life. Romantic thinkers
                        such as Ralph Waldo Emerson and Thomas Carlyle rebelled against the
                        mechanization of culture to defend and retrieve humanity they felt was lost
                        in rigid Lockean rationality. Habermas argues that the public sphere is
                        incapable of providing meaningful concrete confirmation of social structures
                        and their subjective identities within them [<a class="ref" href="#habermas1974">Habermas 1974</a>].
                        The anthropological protest against modernity is inclined toward that which
                        is presumably more real. For Andrew Jackson, this was specie, or hard
                        currency. For Ralph Waldo Emerson, this was intuition and nature. For the
                        rising mass of online deep readers, this is textured narrative. </div>

                        occurs when normative codes for social behavior lose their plausibility [<a class="ref" href="#turner2001">Turner 2001</a>, 95]. We are in an era in which the
                        conventions of online communication are no longer agreeable with a populace
                        demanding more sophisticated material. This brings the taken-for-granted
                        background structure into the foreground, where institutions are
                        self-consciously rearranged. Nineteenth century collectives such as Brook
                        Farm represented precisely such a gesture, in which normative codes of
                        acquisitive behavior were radically reconceived in communal living. Emerson
                        did the same with conventional codes of vocational expectations. Today, the
                        online collectivization of intellectuals offers an escape from the shallows
                        of Internet culture. Gehlen identifies a salient feature of modernity in
                        that the foreground of choice is growing, while the background pattern of
                        stable, reliable institutions diminishes [<a class="ref" href="#turner2001">Turner 2001</a>, 95]. The Internet — with its unlimited number of reading communities now
                        making themselves known to each other — has radically proliferated choice
                        and in the process has unleashed the culture from the institutions that
                        formerly regulated intellectual exchange. </div>

                        Google, describing it as "a faith-based technocapitalist
                            entry," a point Carr also expands on convincingly, Harkaway
                        concludes that we are responsible for the world that technology helps us
                        create: technology is an instrument, not an agent. The enemy, he assures us,
                        is our ignorance, not software. Harkaway is particularly critical, however,
                        of Google’s insistence on digitizing the world’s books, a concern which
                        intersects significantly with the pattern of the Internet’s development into
                        the medium that subsumes all other media [<a class="ref" href="#harkaway2012">Harkaway 2012</a>]. The effect on books, once

                        Once digitized, books become subjected to "Collage,

                        pressure of the changing media climate, the books and their libraries will
                        survive. Before them, Washington Irving makes precisely this claim in "The Mutability of Literature," a story in his
                        famous <cite class="title italic">Sketch Book</cite> published in 1820 in which
                        the protagonist snooping through a library of dusty old tomes is accosted by
                        one particular volume that speaks back to him. The book tells of his concern
                        for being lost into obsolescence at the hands of the popular presses and
                        cheap literature at the dawning of the dime novel and the penny press in
                        publishing history. In Borges’s "Library of
                            Babel," books are lost in their exponential proliferation in an
                        endless archive; in Ray Bradbury’s <cite class="title italic">Fahrenheit

                        to Rick Moody, "the passive recipient of some narrative
                            bludgeoning," making devices such as the Kindle "seem as heart-warming as an electro-stimulator"
                        because they disincline users from moving back and forth through the text
                            [<a class="ref" href="#moody2012">Moody 2012</a>]. The print book, he contends, instead
                        radically empowers the reader because it constitutes "a physical object you can come at in completely
                                different ways" [<a class="ref" href="#moody2012">Moody 2012</a>]. Similarly, Ted Striphas rejects the argument that print books are
                        anachronistic artifacts "whose longevity only hampers our achieving a divine

                        not replace old media but coalesce with and interdepend on them, print books
                            "hold a deep and abiding history that belong in and
                            to our own age" every bit as much as "so-called cutting edge technologies" such as iPad and Kindle

                        publishing industry is undergoing an e-revolution, but the question of its
                        effect on narrative and reading experience is subject to debate. If "it will do society little good to waste time

                        just technological, but a very human movement to recapture what the digital
                        age has threatened to rob readers of: the power of the immersive deep
                        reading in long form narrative. Because its dialectic is rich enough to
                        accommodate such a humanitarian movement, the Internet can provide the

                            Reader," a 2010 personal essay in the <cite class="title italic">Morning News</cite>, laments the deterioration of deep reading in our
                        culture. He particularly regrets the moral detachment that comes of brief,
                        quick-hitting news stories, which for him developed into a malaise of civic
                        apathy. He finds a remedy for this moral conundrum of consuming news in vast
                        quantities but so superficially and quickly as to inspire apathy rather than
                        compassion and civic activism. Immersion in longer works made Chee [<a class="ref" href="#chee2010">Chee 2010</a>], as it does for many others now visible online,

                        encourages has indeed been a source of motivation behind the movement for
                        longer and more sophisticated material on the Internet. Carr’s measure of
                        the maladies brought by Internet culture serves as a method of understanding
                        the source of discontent with superficial content that has sparked the
                        current deep reading movement. McGann’s more nuanced sense of reading proves
                        a digital humanities culture is indeed viable. But if the message shapes the
                        medium, radial reading online must necessarily be different from its print
                        counterpart. If so, then how has narrative changed in this new media
                        environment? Has digital deep reading altered narrative as we know it? The
                        online revolt against narrative depravation had been brewing since 2001,
                        roughly five years after the Internet rose to prominence. At that stage,
                        long reading online itself was entirely nascent or embryonic at best, as
                        early signs of backlash and sharp criticism prevailed ahead of the concerted
                        mass collaborative social reading movements currently under way. Like most
                        social movements, its beginnings were marked by protest and followed by
                        organization and mobilization. Among the first questions raised at this time
                        addressed the fate of narrative in the digital age. Design critic Jessica
                        Helfand, for example, asked, "what happens when a story
                            becomes infinitely changeable?" How can "we design for such perpetual unpredictable
                                interruption in a culture in which linear parameters are
                                gone?" [<a class="ref" href="#helfand2001">Helfand and Maeda 2001</a>, 122]. If, as McGann has argued, the reading of poetry and literary prose
                        has always been radial rather than linear long before the Internet, it
                        certainly has become more externally referential and polyvalent through
                        online hypertext. We see this not only in literary texts, but also in
                        mainstream popular fiction, music, gaming, film, and graphic novel forums on
                        the Internet. Television shows, like <cite class="title italic">American

                     <div class="ptext" id="p37">When the Internet was in its infancy in 2001, there was concern that computer
                        culture would disenfranchise not only written but visual narrative. The
                        advent of the consumer electronics industry, Helfand argued, led to a
                        neglect of "filmic storytelling" and the "power of visual narrative," which had yielded to an
                            "interactive screen-based media"
                        characterized by a "reductive pictorial syntax"
                        [<a class="ref" href="#helfand2001">Helfand and Maeda 2001</a>, 120]. Such compromised syntax hampered the
                        storytelling power that Michael S. Malone now promotes as the engine of
                        success in the era of new media. "The edge will go to
                            those institutions," he argues, "that can
                            effectively employ imagination, metaphor, and most of all,
                            storytelling"
                        [<a class="ref" href="#malone2012">Malone 2012</a>]. This is not storytelling in the sense of
                        creative writing, although his purview is inclusive of that form, but "Twenty-first century story telling: multimedia,
                                mass customizable, portable and scalable, drawing upon the myths and
                                archetypes of the ancient world, on ethics, and upon a deep
                                understanding of human nature and even religious faith" [<a class="ref" href="#malone2012">Malone 2012</a>]. Helfand similarly understood that successful "interaction design is not only information
                                design" [<a class="ref" href="#helfand2001">Helfand and Maeda 2001</a>, 121]. Writing in 2001, she accurately predicted more than a decade ago
                        that "as richer more complex content finds its way into
                            the electronic sphere" design will demand "more comprehensive thinking that involves
                                cognitive, spatial, and ergonomic considerations" [<a class="ref" href="#helfand2001">Helfand and Maeda 2001</a>, 121]. But even beyond more attention to graphic and directional clarity,
                        the demand will only truly be met through the force of narrative. "Like the filmic model," according to Helfand,
                            "successful visual communication will become
                            critically dependent on our understanding of narrative, of audience, and
                            of drama"
                        [<a class="ref" href="#helfand2001">Helfand and Maeda 2001</a>, 121]. Eleven years later Malone would draw
                        precisely the same conclusion. "The demand" for
                        narrative excellence is there, but the "question is
                            whether the traditional humanities can furnish the supply," he
                        urges, invoking the economic forces driving this current trend [<a class="ref" href="#malone2012">Malone 2012</a>]. As code writing and hardware engineering become
                        more insular and less accessible, the challenge now lies in making a
                        product’s storytelling capacity robust and indispensible. As Steven Jobs
                        remarked, "It is in Apple’s DNA that technology alone is not
                                enough — it’s technology married with liberal arts, married with the
                                humanities, that yields us the result that makes our heart

                        Conversely, can this pattern be understood as enriching diversification, an
                        opening of the process of production of mass media to the populace? Instead
                        of lamenting "the emergence of a kind of shared
                            authorship in which the linear parameters of classical narrative
                            structure no longer apply" [<a class="ref" href="#helfand2001">Helfand and Maeda 2001</a>, 122],
                        an opportunity for a narrative renaissance has been seized and is currently
                        under way. Indeed, this is an opportunity to transform the benefits of
                        radial reading into a richer more immersive experience. The challenge is to
                        devise new methods for "visualizing stories in multiple
                            layers, for designing with multiple points of entry" [<a class="ref" href="#helfand2001">Helfand and Maeda 2001</a>, 123]. For film, that challenge has been met
                        by such companies as Media Storm, Brian Storm’s platform for multimedia long

                        provide the means of support for a thriving narrative culture. According to
                        Henry Jenkins’s formulation, "participatory culture is one where there are
                                relatively low barriers to artistic expression and civic engagement,
                                where there is strong support for creating and sharing one’s
                                creations with others, where there is some form of informal
                                mentorship whereby what is known by experienced community members is
                                passed on to novices" [<a class="ref" href="#jenkins2010">Jenkins 2010</a>, 98], a feature typical of the best and most vibrant online social
                        dynamics. At its most powerful, participatory culture is one in which "each member believes their contributions matter"
                        making "each member feel some degree of social
                            connection to each other" [<a class="ref" href="#jenkins2010">Jenkins 2010</a>, 98].
                        Indeed, this online environment encourages commentary from readers who do
                        not belittle or abridge narratives such as Wallace’s <cite class="title italic">Infinite Jest</cite> and Gaddis’s <cite class="title italic">J.R.</cite>
                        but diversify and democratize them. Longer works are enjoying a resurgence
                        of interest precisely because readers are now more capable than ever to
                        participate in the narratives themselves by demonstrating through online
                        social reading culture precisely how they intersect with and make meaning of
                        their own life stories. Of course, this is no utopia, and strands of the
                        coarse underside of such unrestrained access remain in those who indulge in
                        an "ill-defined, anything goes expressionism," as
                        Helfand describes it, "messy and myopic, part stand-up
                            comedy and part soapbox-proselytizing"
                        [<a class="ref" href="#helfand2001">Helfand and Maeda 2001</a>, 91]. But most online readers, whether
                        formally assembled in an announced discussion of one text, or informally
                        engaging in an organic exchange over a long narrative work, are not merely
                        solipsistic and ignorant of public issues. To the contrary, there is a
                        considerable standard for accuracy and mutual support in the social matrix
                        of online reading discussion. Any "outpouring of
                            unedited thoughts" in serious long form online discussions tends
                        to receive direction support and focus from others [<a class="ref" href="#helfand2001">Helfand and Maeda 2001</a>, 92]

                        have been greatly exaggerated. Witness Carr’s apocalyptic bent that fears a
                            "narrowing of expressiveness and a loss of
                            eloquence" due to "our indulgence in the
                            pleasures of informality and immediacy" with the replacement of
                        the formal letter with email and Twitter [<a class="ref" href="#carr2011">Carr 2011</a>, 108]. Writing in advance of the deep reading counter-revolution illustrated by
                        1book140 and Infinite Summer, his rhetoric is unremittingly bleak. He fears
                        the cost of digitization will be "a further weakening,
                            if not a final severing, of the intimate intellectual attachment between
                            the lone writer and the lone reader"
                        [<a class="ref" href="#carr2011">Carr 2011</a>, 108]. Reading, as recent digital book clubs
                        have dramatically demonstrated, has never been more social, convivial, and
                        intellectually vibrant. Serious readers have never been content to remain
                        solitary and silent in their reading practice, but historically have sought
                        out each other by first forming informal circles, then coteries and clubs,
                        before finally becoming institutionalized in colleges of higher education.
                        Margaret Fuller, for example, spearheaded a series of literary
                            "conversations" in the Boston bookshop with her
                        friend Elizabeth Peabody in the 1830s to provide the outlet for discussion
                        craved by the followers of Emersonian transcendentalism. They would have
                        certainly made use of online media if it were available at the time, given
                        Fuller’s belief in the powers of mass communication, the most potent of
                        which during the antebellum era was the periodical press which she promoted
                        as "the only efficient instrument for the education of
                            the people"
                        [<a class="ref" href="#caneandalves2001">Cane and Alves 2001</a>]. Thus Carr’s nostalgia for isolated
                        reading and isolated authorship appears suspect to harkening back to a
                        golden age of print culture that never really existed. His indictment of
                        online book clubs complains that they are merely symptoms of "the Web’s tendency to turn all media into social
                            media" [<a class="ref" href="#carr2011">Carr 2011</a>, 106]. He mistakenly assumes
                        that online book clubs make "social concerns override
                            literary ones" in which "writing becomes a
                            means of recording chatter." To the contrary, such groups
                        typically reveal an astonishing depth of immersion of a collective whole
                        that can number in the thousands, a remarkable feat in intellectual history
                        that was never remotely possible before 1995. Carr fears writing will be
                        shaped by the ever-present social buzz of email, texting, Twitter, and
                        Facebook to the extent that it will betray a "groupiness," as Caleb Crain describes it, all but suffocating

                        will be cast aside and relegated to living on the margins like Bradbury’s

                            increasingly arcane hobby" [<a class="ref" href="#griswoldetal2005">Griswold et al. 2005</a>, 137]. The "reading class" has emerged from the
                        shadows and onto the Internet, where the media now serves to bring them
                        together more efficiently and in greater numbers than ever. Bradbury’s
                        renegade outlaw readers have found one another through the Web and are
                        expanding their ranks as the appetite for serious reading surges into a
                        large and vigorous mass. This is hardly the dwindling marginalized offspring
                        of a superannuated pastime, but the forefront of a renaissance that is
                        taking on all the features of a religious revival. Sustained intense reading
                        is possible and indeed flourishing in the online environment, which has
                        proven electronic media fertile rather than sterile. Such a movement toward
                        online group readings calls into question the anxiety over digital media’s
                        isolating effects. But with GPS regularly in use during the 1book140
                        readings to locate and bring readers together in physical space, and with
                        events such as the <cite class="title italic">Moby-Dick </cite>Marathon readings
                        that have recently spread in popularity from New Bedford and Mystic to
                        Nantucket and Manhattan, there is abundant evidence of the Web’s use as a
                        conduit for collegiality and association. Of course there are cases where
                        individuals hide behind their screen identities and squander their lives in
                        online gaming or chat rooms as detailed by Turkle [<a class="ref" href="#turkle2011">Turkle 2011</a>]. But the characterization of online use as exclusively isolating and
                        socially alienating breaks down in light of the millions currently
                        discovering new likeminded readers they would never have known prior to the
                        digital revolution. </div>

                     <div class="ptext" id="p42">If journalism has begun to collapse under what is now "an
                            Internet age, a headline age," and the "the

                            banished"
                        [<a class="ref" href="#carr2011">Carr 2011</a>, 95], its long form offspring are thriving.
                        The culture has rediscovered a world beyond the easy-to-browse blurbs and
                        captions that have come to dominate magazine and newspaper formatting. Now
                        that consumers can talk back to the performances they witness through online
                        media, they can also consume products of intellectual culture, readings that
                        inspire not superficial but profound commentary, in this same dialogic way.
                        The conversation has grown, as the design of electronic products beyond long
                        form written works now encourages social networking. The Blu-ray version of
                        Disney’s <cite class="title italic">Snow White</cite> enables viewers to chat
                        with each other while watching the film. The <cite class="title italic">Watchmen</cite> disc links directly to Facebook to allow live
                        commentary on friends’ pages. Film aficionados now have the equivalent
                        social viewing experience of the "bookies." Novels, as
                        Clay Shirky contends, may have been "a side effect of
                            living in an environment of impoverished access" when they came
                        into popularity with the rise of the middle class at the dawn of the
                        industrial revolution [<a class="ref" href="#shirky2009">Shirky 2009</a>, 111]. But now, in the
                        twenty-first century, at the apex of the digital revolution, the revival of
                        demanding and deep long form works have left us with an embarrassment of
                        riches not only in data, but more importantly, the richness of contact with
                        each other. McGann had the foresight in 2001 to observe that digital
                        technology is a boon to the humanities and the richness of deep narrative
                        reading, warning that "the general field of humanities
                            education and scholarship will not take the use of digital technology
                            seriously until one demonstrates how its tools improve the ways we
                            explore and explain aesthetic works"
                        [<a class="ref" href="#mcgann2001">McGann 2001</a>, xii]. As Douglas Rushkoff reminds us in the
                        coda of <cite class="title italic">Digital Nation</cite>, technology "challenges us to serve our human values, but we must first
                            learn what those values are"
                        [<a class="ref" href="#dretzin2010">Dretzin 2010</a>]. As the online deep reading revival has shown,
                        narrative — and all its media manifestations — continues to be the vehicle
