                  <p> Over the past decades the advancement of technology and its subsequent
                     introduction to the Humanities has led to the development of several
                     applications that enhance study and research in disciplines such as Classics,
                     archaeology, epigraphy, and linguistics. The focus of Digital Humanists and
                     other Humanities scholars has turned to the efficient storage of information
                     that facilitates search, comparative studies, accessibility, and consequently
                     research. The common point of reference for the aforementioned applications is
                     that they do not involve the need for the scholar to
                     “physically” be in a virtual space. In areas, such as
                     archaeology and epigraphy, the creation of projects that provide access to 3D
                     models of the artifacts as well as to virtual replications of ancient sites has
                     resulted in the opening of new areas of research and reconsideration of
                     traditional research issues. Also, [<a class="ref" href="#forte1997">Forte et al. 1997</a>] argue that digital
                     visualizations may make the ancient world more accessible to a larger audience.
                     One may comprehend the structure of a vase and analyze its artistic patterns by
                     zooming and relighting it. A problem that is yet to be considered, though, is
                     how a scholar and a student are to perceive Classical Drama, the theatrical
                     space, the distances between the actors, the chorus, and the audience, the
                     logistics of the performance, and the cultural aspects at play. This paper
                     discusses the importance of experiential learning and the use of virtual reality
                     as a means of promoting traditional edification methods, virtually recreating
                     the actuality of the stage, and presents the Magic Mirror Theater, a web
                     application designed to facilitate the study of Classical Drama.

                     discussing staging issues. Mary-Kay Gamel through the Ajax project in 2011, one

                     reviews various projects in the reconstruction and study of ancient theaters

                     studies are enveloped within a concept of contemporization of drama and
                     contextualization within modern society. [<a class="ref" href="#hartigan1995">Hartigan 1995</a>] discusses
                     Greek Drama on the American stage. [<a class="ref" href="#michelakis2010">Michelakis 2010</a>] expands the
                     parameters and studies the socio-political forces that drive modern
                     reconstructions, and [<a class="ref" href="#slater2015">Slater 2015</a>] discusses a performance of
                     Trojan Women on the American stage against a contemporary backdrop. The above
                     brief survey indicates that unlike other literary genres, Classical Drama
                     requires a two-pronged approach — a theoretical one that encompasses literary
                     and socio-political attributes of the plays and a dramaturgical one that is
                     meant to comprehend the practical aspects of works that were meant to be
                     performed and not simply read. Therefore, when one teaches Classical Drama, the
                     literary analyses overshadow a pivotal aspect of those works. Bibliographical
                     surveys of modern performances, even though they start from the dramaturgical
                     premise, provide the readers with a different yet still literary discussion of a
                     performance, with the reader missing the dramatic component. Furthermore,
                     digital reconstructions of ancient venues and/or performances forego a vital
                     constituent that is the individual and his/her sense of space. Therefore, it
                     seems that the only all-inclusive solution that will lend itself to traditional
                     courses is the creation of a mixed-reality environment, which will allow the
                     user to “be” in the theatrical space, experience the
                     performance, and attempt different staging possibilities in a more realistic
                     manner, incorporating enhanced synaesthetic approaches and constituting for the
                     participant the foundation of constructivism learning that can only be achieved
                     through experiential learning practices.

                  <div class="ptext" id="p3">The advantages of experiential learning have been apprehended very early on.
                     Dewey, an American philosopher, psychologist, and educational reformer in the
                     late 19th–early 20th century, first suggested and implemented the paradigm of
                     effective teaching that combines traditional methodologies with real-life
                     experiences so as to achieve the most effective and truly pedagogical
                     experiences. He first tested this reconsideration of traditional teaching in his
                     experimental Laboratory School in Chicago and in 1896 published his book <cite class="title italic">The School and Society</cite> in which he explicates his
                     rationale, methods, methodology, and the practical results.<a class="noteRef" href="#d4e236">[3]</a> According to Dewey, experiential learning is developed by and
                     based on the following three “unities”:
                     
                     <ol class="list">
                        <li class="item">the unity of abstract knowledge and doing in the real world</li>
                        <li class="item">the unity of action and reflection and</li>
                        <li class="item">the unity of the individual with the community</li>
                     </ol>

                  <div class="counter"><a href="#p4">4</a></div>
                  <div class="ptext" id="p4"> The aforementioned three aspects of experiential learning are on par with the
                     precepts of digital humanities and pedagogy.<a class="noteRef" href="#d4e265">[4]</a> More specifically,
                     there is a concatenated reality of the interwoven existence of knowledge, the
                     individual, the environment (which could either be further knowledge or other
                     people), and finally the overarching reality of perception of all the above that
                     has prompted the birth of digital humanities. Therefore, since this initial
                     appreciation of experiential learning by Dewey, there have been extensive
                     studies on the pivotal role of digital pedagogy that may include teaching of new
                     technologies or digital critical thinking to reconsider traditional research
                     questions [<a class="ref" href="#barmpoutis2014">Barmpoutis et al. 2014</a>]. [<a class="ref" href="#hirsch2012">Hirsch 2012</a>] assembled
                     a voluminous work on digital humanities pedagogy that aims at (re)defining
                     pedagogy. The contributors argue that new technologies, digital interactions
                     with traditional research topics, and the collaborative spirit of such
                     trajectories enhance critical thinking that only stems from new technologies but
                     is not dependent upon them. [<a class="ref" href="#mccarty2012">McCarty 2012</a>, 46] presents the
                     Ph.D. in Digital Humanities as “not
                     just a framework for research…but is itself empirical research into the best
                     framework with which to further develop the intellectual culture of digital
                     humanities.”

                     “the knowledge gained is
                     transient.”
                     “Thinking skills are the most important

                     methodologies. In the areas of classical studies, the significance of teaching
                     via digital methods and against the backdrop of digital methodologies is
                     extensively discussed in [<a class="ref" href="#bodard2016">Bodard et al. 2016</a>]. Finally, in a broader

                     actors), the members of the chorus (12-15 in tragic plays, 24 in comic plays),
                     the fact that orchestras traditionally were circular (with the exception of the
                     theater of Thorikos, where it is rectangular), and the diameter of the orchestra
                     in the theater of Epidaurus (20m). However, how feasible is it for them to apply
                     this knowledge to the real world, and, more specifically, is it possible to
                     truly comprehend the movements of the limited number of actors when they need to
                     leave the stage, change costumes in order to impersonate another character, and
                     then return while the chorus is singing for 150 lines? Also, can modern
                     audiences really understand the performance of female roles by male actors?
                     Finally, is the overall perception of ancient productions possible when one is
                     not given the opportunity to actually walk in the theater, feel the connection,
                     both physical and dramatic, between actors and audience, and also
                     “experience” the performance in its actual natural
                     surroundings?<a class="noteRef" href="#d4e312">[5]</a></div>

                  <div class="ptext" id="p7">Theater is the <span class="foreign i">par excellence</span> space that
                     necessitates and effectuates the confluence of several parameters — stage as a
                     construction, people both as actors and viewers, and the cultural ambience of
                     the play itself as well as of the time when the performance takes place. Absence
                     of any of the above not only sullies the equilibrium, but it also denotes utter
                     failure of the endeavor. The place, the individual as an actor or viewer within
                     that place, and the cultural context within which plays were written and
                     performed in the ancient world need to be recaptured so as to acquire a
                     historical, cultural, and theatrical situatedness, thus procuring a notional
                     space for the theatrical performance. 3D models of theatrical venues can easily
                     be constructed, and individuals who reenact plays can also act within any place.
                     So arguably the missing component is the intangible, namely the co-existence of
                     space and actors as well as the cultural aura. Virtual reality and the creation
                     of immersive virtual worlds can effectuate tangibility of what thus far has been
                     considered intangible cultural heritage.<a class="noteRef" href="#d4e333">[6]</a> Therefore, as theater presents a
                     unique concatenation of tangible cultural heritage — theatrical construction —
                     and intangible cultural heritage — the plays, the actors, and the props — the
                     only feasible way to re-experience all the above as participants ourselves is
                     the creation of a mixed-reality virtual environment.<a class="noteRef" href="#d4e338">[7]</a>

                        limited either by the modality of the content or by the delivery mechanism
                        of the educational material. Additionally, they all lack the synaesthetic

                        pre-recorded videos. Flynn actually criticizes the lifelessness of 3D

                        extensive discussion on the lack of embodiment that results in lack of

                        the student of Classical Drama can be approached and perhaps answered via
                        the design of this mixed-reality environment in which the users can view

                     secondary bibliography that provides information regarding the circumstances of
                     performance based on archaeological and literary evidence. This method of

                     for subjective, or even incorrect interpretations, especially when
                     spatiotemporal interactions of the portrayed characters play a significant role
                     in the study of the original text. Questions such as “how many dancers in

                     methodologies in the humanities. To find the answers to such questions, one
                     needs to combine archaeological, historical, topographical knowledge, and

                     users’ own avatars is achieved so that the level of understanding is effectively
                     increased. More specifically, the conception of place can be grasped as the user
                     gets to be the avatar walking in the tridimensional space, and the usage of
                     props enhances the apprehension of historical situatedness, as the users can
                     navigate a space imbued with images and the culture of the past. Admittedly this
                     is a component that is still lacking in games. [<a class="ref" href="#friedman1995">Friedman 1995</a>]
                     states that “there could never be an
                     ‘objective’ simulation free from
                     ‘bias’. Computer programs, like all texts, will
                     always be ideological constructions.” Similarly [<a class="ref" href="#fleckenstein2005">Fleckenstein 2005</a>, 164] maintains that “place is neither an imprint of our discursive
                     regimes nor an impervious container that shapes our identities without being
                     shaped in return. Rather, place is the product and the producer of a dynamic
                     fusion of sign system, physical reality and interpretant.” So the
                     Magic Mirror Theater system intends to utilize the above parameters rather than
                     consider them reductive by immersing the user as an avatar into the exact
                     replicas of ancient theaters, thus procuring a conceptually productive
                     co-existence of user, actual physical environment, and theatrical venue.

                     USB web-camera. Such depth cameras are available from many companies that
                     produce devices for natural user interaction, such as gaming engines (Microsoft

                     many others starting from $69 (retail price).<a class="noteRef" href="#d4e717">[19]</a> One of the key advantages of these devices is that they do not
                     require any technological skill by the users; on the contrary, the users can use
                     their natural body motion and everyday life gestures to give instructions to the
                     computer. Scholars and students are found to be familiar with natural user
                     interface platforms that already exist in the majority of households due to
                     their affordable price range, according to national reports [<a class="ref" href="#pew2008">Pew Report 2008</a>]. This prototype system uses the information acquired
                     from the depth sensor to instantly reconstruct the 3D body image of the user,
                     which is displayed as a real-time 3D holographic video stream in the middle of
                     the virtual theater. The camera follows the motion of the users, who can move,
                     walk, act, dance as the corresponding motion is instantly transferred to their
                     3D holographic image in the virtual scene. The prototype system was built as an
                     HTML5 application using webGL for the rendering of the 3D content (avatars and
                     theater) and webSockets for communicating in real-time with the depth sensor.
                     The depth sensor tracked in real-time the body motion of the users by fitting a
                     25-joint skeletal model to their 3D silhouette using the J4K (Java for Kinect)
                     library that was originally developed for real-time 3D body reconstruction and

                     time one visits a new space [<a class="ref" href="#glenberg2008">Glenberg et al. 2008</a>]. The users can also

                     multiple times in the virtual space in various arrangements. The latter is a
                     useful feature, as it facilitates the understanding of those parts that involve
                     the members of the chorus (dancers), whose number varies across authors and
                     plays. The Magic Mirror Theater educational system covers cross-disciplinary
                     material on Classical Drama, and its implementation is based on archaeological
                     evidence on the number of actors and choristers, their gender restrictions
                     (actors in Classical Greece were exclusively male), the theater in which it was
                     originally performed, the season and time of the performance (relative to the
                     sunrise or the sunset), the structure of the theater (type, size, auxiliary
                     rooms available, etc.), as well as information about costumes and mechanical
                     devices used during the performances. The material is presented to the users
                     through an experiential-learning environment that can be used either by the
                     instructor as a novel teaching tool, or by the scholar of Classical Drama who
                     will ultimately understand better the circumstances of performance in the
                     Greco-Roman world by personally interacting with the aforementioned virtual
                     objects. The ultimate goal is to recreate not only the place itself but the
                     ambience of that place as well.

                     representations of literary and historical 3D-DGBL is perhaps the most
                     difficult task facing designers. Creating a more subjective experience by
                     collapsing the distance between the real and the virtual, the Self and the
                     Other, through a first-person point of view emphasizes the transparent
                     immediacy of the game space.” The Magic Mirror Theater enables you to
                     find yourself in the virtual environment and be in a position to decide which is
                     the role that the Self wishes to assume, while also embedding the Self in the
                     space of the Other.

                     performed in order to quantitatively evaluate the prototype software as an
                     educational tool. The user testing was performed with the students of an
                     undergraduate Greek Drama class (CLT 3291) in the Fall of 2013 in the regular
                     classroom environment, in which a Kinect sensor was installed and the Magic
                     Mirror Theater software was projected using the classroom’s projector. The
                     number of students who participated in this study was 25. Although the sample
                     size of this preliminary test was limited, and therefore its results are not
                     conclusive, they clearly indicate a notable increase in the students' level of
                     comprehension. Furthermore, in order to further objectify these inferences, the
                     initial experiments were conducted on quantifiable questions pertaining to the
                     size and space of the ancient theater of Epidaurus.

                  <div class="ptext" id="p36"> The experiment was designed using photographs and a 3D model of the ancient
                     theater of Epidaurus. The goal of the experiment was to test whether the
                     students understand better the tridimensional structure of the theater using
                     traditional teaching methodologies, such as photographs in a slideshow, or using
                     the prototype interactive software. The first fundamental element of
                     tridimensional topology that one could test is the perception of the scale,
                     which was the key question in the test, and it was also used as a metric for
                     quantitative analysis. In general, the perception of the scale is associated
                     with the human ability to compare the size of an unknown object with the size of
                     a known reference, such as own body. This relative comparison generates the
                     perception of scale. In order to avoid any potential biasing related to the
                     missing of a scale reference, the experiment was designed in such a way so that
                     both modalities (i.e. the 2D images and the 3D interactive scene) had the same
                     reference of scale, which was achieved by the presence of human bodies in both
                     modalities.

                     observed in the case of the proposed system, which suggests that the 3D

                     robust “gaussfit” tool in the mathematical software Matlab. This tool
                     computes the mean of the fitted probability model as well as the standard
                     deviation (spread). The mean corresponds to the average response to each
                     question and is depicted in the above plot as a vertical line (dotted line for
                     the 2D slideshow case, and dashed line for the 3D interactive system case). By
                     observing the results, it is clear that the average response in the case of the
                     proposed system is twice as close to the correct answer compared to the
                     responses from the 2D slide show. This improvement is quantitatively evaluated
                     using three different metrics: a) absolute mean error, b) absolute median error,
                     and c) standard deviation, which corresponds to the certainty, and the results

                     and virtual reality clearly suggest that in areas of research, such as
                     archaeology and theater, spatiotemporal information is crucial for our
                     comprehension. The Magic Mirror Theater enables the users to virtually
                     “find” themselves in Ancient theatrical venues,
                     experience the scale, perform, use props, and ultimately be able to reconstruct
                     the circumstances of performance in the Classical world.

                     developed to include more theatrical venues from the ancient world so that the
                     users may have the possibility to choose. The project will be enhanced by the
                     addition of masks, attire, and other props and stage material, which the users
                     will be able to select and appear to be holding on the screen. A fully
                     functioning version of the project with the aforementioned features will allow
                     further user testing using more complex hypotheses that will assess the
                     long-term learning curve of the students as a semester-long experience and
                     assessment, which is the primary future goal of this project. Finally, more
                     advanced modalities will be incorporated, including the option to select the
                     position of the user’s avatar in the theater as well as the usage of more than
                     one Kinect sensor that will allow for more users, hence actors.
