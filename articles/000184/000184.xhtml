                  <h2>Abstract</h2>
                
                  <p>For digital humanists planning to build tools for cyberinfrastructure several
                    variables ought to be defined for each project. Pay close attention to the
                    balance of traditional methods and new ways of conducting research. When
                    gathering resources to do the job, seek contributions of different domain
                    experts. Also, careful consideration of a tool’s intended scope will help refine
                    the required resources needed to complete a project. This case study illustrates
                    how one project, the Social Networks and Archival Context Project (SNAC), has
                    defined these variables. The process of building a new tool also benefits from
                    an awareness of older infrastructure that has come before it. SNAC illustrates
                    this awareness in the way it has taken advantage of previously existing
                    infrastructure, both cyber and not, by extending its purpose and building new
                    features on top of it.</p>
               </div>

               <div class="ptext" id="p1">When speculating about the future of scholarship, it seems certain that research and
                teaching will continue to be affected by the evolution of traditional infrastructure
                into digital forms. This is as true for the humanities as it is for other
                disciplines and digital humanists in particular should have an important role to
                play in shaping the infrastructure for their domains. Digital humanists, who can
                both identify the needs of mainstream humanities scholars and suggest acceptable
                computational solutions to those needs [<a class="ref" href="#joula2008">Juola 2008</a>], are essential
                participants in the development of a new digital cyberinfrastructure for humanities
                research. </div>

               <div class="ptext" id="p2">The American Council of Learned Societies (ACLS) report on cyberinfrastructure
                defines cyberinfrastructure as <blockquote>
                     <p>
                    the layer of information, expertise, standards, policies,
                        tools, and services that are shared broadly across communities of inquiry
                        but developed for specific scholarly purposes: cyberinfrastructure is
                        something more specific than the network itself, but it is something more
                        general than a tool or a resource developed for a particular project, a
                        range of projects, or, even more broadly, for a particular
                        discipline.
                     [<a class="ref" href="#acls2006">ACLS 2006</a>]
                </p>
                  </blockquote>This definition leaves a lot of room to imagine the technological future of
                the humanities, allowing researchers and educators to decide for themselves the
                appropriate tools and services that will meet their needs. While the report states
                that cyberinfrastructure is something more general than a tool or resource, tools
                will be a necessary component. For digital humanists planning to build tools for
                cyberinfrastructure, it is helpful to pay close attention to the balance of
                traditional methods and new ways of conducting research, and to the contributions of
                different domain experts, when gathering resources to do the job. Careful
                consideration of a tool’s intended scope will also help refine the required
                resources needed to complete a project. The following case study will illustrate how
                one project has successfully balanced these variables and it may serve as a model
                for designing others. I will discuss each of these variables more, but I also want
                to introduce the idea of an infrastructure stack on top of which a successful
                cyberinfrastructure tool rests. The stack serves as a foundation for the new
                technology by linking it to the past. The sense of the word "stack" I use is
                the one that refers to a pile of objects, one on top of the other. In this case the
                stacked objects are abstract systems and technologies. The oldest technology rests
                at the bottom and newer technologies pile up to the top. If you remove one from the
                stack, the objects above it and supported by it could not exist without the missing
                foundation. To illustrate this concept and elaborate on the balancing act of tool
                design, I offer a case study of The Social Networks and Archival Context (SNAC)
                Project, which is an emerging example of cyberinfrastructure. SNAC serves this
                purpose by demonstrating the ability to balance many of the variables necessary for
                cyberinfrastructure and the project is built upon an easily definable infrastructure
                stack. I will begin this case study with a description of SNAC and its prototype
                user interface. </div>

                  <div class="ptext" id="p3">The SNAC project aims to provide scholars with improved access to distributed
                    historical records with new discovery tools. The heart of the project is a very
                    large (and still growing) dataset of archival creator descriptions expressed in
                    the international metadata standard Encoded Archival Context-Corporate Bodies,
                    Persons, and Families (EAC-CPF). The records describe people and corporate
                    bodies who are the creators of primary humanities resources that have been
                    collected into archives and libraries around the world. The descriptions contain
                    biographical data, lists of associated resources, and lists of associations with
                    other people. This curated set of data enables SNAC to build new discovery tools
                    for researchers. SNAC’s goal is to provide improved access to the resources that
                    document the lives, work, and events surrounding historical persons, and provide
                    unprecedented access to the biographical-historical contexts of the people
                    documented in the resources, including the social-professional networks within
                    which they lived and worked [<a class="ref" href="#IATHb">IATH n.d. b</a>].</div>

                  <div class="ptext" id="p4">SNAC’s emphasis on social networks is, of course, no accident. Social networks
                    are a hot topic. However, social networks have been around far longer than
                    Facebook. Simply put, a network is a set of relations between objects; a social
                    network the set of relations between people. Kadushin describes social networks
                    as having been <blockquote>
                        <p>
                        at the core of human society since we were hunters and
                            gatherers. People were tied together through their relations with one
                            another and their dependence on one another…Kinship and family relations
                            are social networks. Neighbors, villages, and cities are crisscrossed
                            with networks of obligations and relationships.
                         [<a class="ref" href="#kadushin2012">Kadushin 2012</a>]
                    </p>
                     </blockquote> What is relatively new, Kadushin continues, are "systematic ways of talking about social networks, depicting them, analyzing
                        them, and showing how they are related to more formal social arrangements
                        such as organizations and governments."</div>

                  </div>
                  <div class="ptext" id="p5"> From Facebook to Flickr, Twitter to Tumblr, the social networking concept is
                    embodied everywhere online through many widely used Web applications. Taking
                    advantage of the relationships captured in its dataset, SNAC has developed a
                    social network web application that has helped the project earn the nickname
                        "Facebook for the dead"
                    [<a class="ref" href="#seal2012">Seal 2012</a>]. The comparison with the ubiquitous social networking
                    site is not without some utility. Social networking sites like Facebook enable
                    users to articulate and make visible their social networks [<a class="ref" href="#boydellison2008">Boyd and Ellison 2008</a>], which is the organizing principle for SNAC’s
                    data. Boyd &amp; Ellison define social network sites as web-based services that
                    allow individuals to construct a profile within a bounded system, articulate a
                    list of other users with whom they share a connection, and view and traverse
                    their list of connections and those made by others within the system. In its own
                    way, SNAC provides these same features for historical figures. </div>

                    one for J. Robert Oppenheimer. The profile contains descriptive metadata such as
                    life dates, occupations, subjects to which the person is related, alternative
                    forms of their name, and a biographical history. To the right of the metadata is
                    the Related Entries section, where lists of connections from the personal
                    profile to archival collections, other people, corporate bodies, and resources
                    are articulated as well as providing links to traverse the connections. For
                    example, Oppenheimer is listed as the creator of his own collection of papers
                    housed at the Library of Congress in addition to being referenced in 14 other
                    archival collections. In all cases, SNAC provides links to the online finding
                    aids describing these collections, which are outside of the SNAC prototype and
                    on the archives’ own Web sites. Oppenheimer is also listed as the creator of 85
                    resources, such as books, sound recordings, and other material, for which SNAC
                    provides links to entries in WorldCat, the online catalog of the world’s largest
                    network of library content and services [<a class="ref" href="#worldcat">WorldCat n.d.</a>]. In addition
                    to these external links, SNAC also links internally to the profiles of other
                    people and corporate bodies that share a connection to a given profile.
                    Oppenheimer, for example, is listed as having been associated with or
                    corresponded with 63 other people and seven corporate bodies, all of which have
                    a profile in SNAC. </div>

                    resources are not created manually by experts. Another characteristic SNAC
                    shares with social networking sites is the bottom-up, rather than top-down,
                    approach to organizing its content. Individuals in the online community define
                    the content and structure of a typical social network site instead of
                    professional information providers [<a class="ref" href="#kolbitschmaurer2006">Kolbitsch and Maurer 2006</a>]. SNAC
                    allows the properties of its data (such as the names, dates, correspondence
                    relationships, and creator attributions captured in the EAC-CPF records) to
                    self-organize the information presented in the system. </div>

                    ACLS report quoted above (information, expertise, standards, etc.). Alongside
                    discussing SNAC specifically, I will address cyberinfrastructure more generally
                    by defining a set of variables to consider when approaching the design of a new
                    tool. When reviewing the existing literature about humanities
                    cyberinfrastructure a picture emerges that helps define these variables. Imagine
                    a three-dimensional graph where examples of cyberinfrastructure technology could
                    be plotted. The three axes of the graph represent the following opposing

                        development of cyberinfrastructure often requires collaboration between
                        humanists and non-humanists. First and foremost, scholars of the humanities
                        must lead the development of their own cyberinfrastructure, despite the fact
                        that tool development is not yet rewarded on par with more traditional
                        scholarly outputs [<a class="ref" href="#schreibmanhanlon2010">Schreibman and Hanlon 2010</a>]. They alone can
                        accomplish the intellectual task of modeling scholarship for new digital
                        environments (Drucker, 2009). They alone can judge its usefulness and assure
                        that the technology will serve their needs [<a class="ref" href="#huntetal2011">Hunt et al. 2011</a>].
                        However, few individual humanities experts (let alone any expert) will have
                        the range of expertise required to build cyberinfrastructure, so librarians,
                        archivists, programmers, and computer scientists will bring essential
                        complementary skills to the task [<a class="ref" href="#borgman2009">Borgman 2009</a>]. Technology
                        developers and humanities researchers working alongside each other are
                        likely to push both the technical and the intellectual boundaries farther,
                        yielding greater innovation [<a class="ref" href="#collinsetal2012">Collins et al. 2012</a>]. Casting the
                        net even wider, the ACLS report, which lists collaboration as a necessary
                        characteristic of cyberinfrastructure, calls for "cooperation with librarians, curators, and
                                archivists; the involvement of experts in the sciences, law,
                                business, and entertainment; and active participation from and

                             [<a class="ref" href="#acls2006">ACLS 2006</a>]. However, it should be noted that, while necessary, collaboration is
                        itself a challenge that requires careful resolution of methodological
                        differences and regular communication about each collaborators’ perspective

                        the scale of cyberinfrastructure research is large, the goals are many and
                        multi-faceted, and the aim is to serve a large audience. However, attempting
                        to do too much, to make a technology useful for everyone in the humanities,
                        risks the possibility of making it useful for nobody, because a tool with a
                        very broad audience in mind is unlikely to meet the requirements of
                        specialized fields [<a class="ref" href="#huntetal2011">Hunt et al. 2011</a>]. At the other end of the
                        scale, cyberinfrastructure of the past decade has led humanities researchers
                        to create smaller, isolated projects, the contents of which cannot be easily
                        combined for analysis without the development of a more robust
                        infrastructure to link them together [<a class="ref" href="#blackwellcrane2009">Blackwell and Crane 2009</a>]

                        other systems to support some unimagined uses by unanticipated users. A
                        successful cyberinfrastructure of the future will likely consist of multiple
                        systems that exist to support the specialized needs of each discipline, yet

                        restrict the size of the project. SNAC is poised to expand widely within a
                        certain band of information, specifically the description of primary

                        to extend its functionality. For example, SNAC does not intend to collect
                        digitized primary resources or provide direct access to such resources, but
                        rather prefers to leverage existing cyberinfrastructure by providing links

                        Therefore, to build such systems there is a need to utilize methods and
                        technologies that go beyond the traditional tools of the humanities.
                        Traditional humanities infrastructure includes intellectual categories such

                        in some way. The example in Figure 3 shows "Oppenheimer, J. Robert" as
                        the central node with lines extending out to the names of all the other
                        people and organizations he had been associated with in his lifetime. In
                        addition to the lines drawn between the central node in the network and all
                        the other surrounding nodes, relationships between the surrounding nodes in
                        the circle are also indicated with a line. The visualization enables further

                        redrawing the visualization to include the immediate social network of the

                        the public interface to (and a product of) a variety of innovative, yet
                        practical research agendas tackled by the SNAC project. The research never
                        sought to build and explore technologies just for the sake of creating new
                        technologies, nor did it adopt any existing technology without a plan to
                        apply its use to the current needs of SNAC’s target user group. SNAC
                        balances the utility of traditional methods that existing infrastructure
                        enable with the exciting, but unproven potential of new technologies. It
                        does so through the use of advanced technology to accelerate and extend
                        traditional methods in new ways. While researchers may have always wanted to
                        search for every occurrence of an individual’s name in the archives, it has
                        previously been impossible due to a lack of funding and time [<a class="ref" href="#collinsjubb2012">Collins and Jubb 2012</a>]. However, as some historians have already
                        observed, a year’s worth of work using the current infrastructure combined
                        with a great deal of serendipity and persistence can be replaced by the data
                        in a single SNAC record [<a class="ref" href="#IATHb">IATH n.d. b</a>]. Through this dramatic

                        infrastructure may reward planners with insights such as knowing the gaps in
                        existing service that a new one may fill, discovering ways to save

                        that have come before it. SNAC is built on top of a long-standing
                        infrastructure stack that has served the scholarly community in a reciprocal
                        relationship, where it has been shaped and honed by scholarly use and in
                        turn has also shaped how scholars do their research. Any attempt to build
                        cyberinfrastructure ought to include a process of looking back while moving
                        forward. Which facets of prior infrastructure continue to be important
                        today? How can new technology be used to augment and extend those facets to
                        create a new layer of the infrastructure stack? Of course, some may ask, is
                        it even worth building? Certainly there are some who will have doubts about
                        the value of cyberinfrastructure and this points to the importance of the
                        Z-axis of the evaluation criteria. Cyberinfrastructure will not emerge
                        unless it is designed in a way that balances traditional research methods
                        along with the pursuit of advanced technology. One way to design technology
                        that respects the traditions of the past is to look back at the
                        infrastructure stack upon which the new technology is being built and not
                        neglect the scholarly activity it supports. If one can build a technology
                        that eliminates artificial or unnecessary restrictions on scholarly
                        activity, freeing scholars to do what they really want to do — read, write,
                        analyze, produce knowledge, and distribute it — then that technology will be
                        successful [<a class="ref" href="#joula2008">Juola 2008</a>]. What follows is a discussion of

                        for and about humans is the practice of naming people and their
                        organizations. The abstract appellation is a shorthand way of referencing a
                        whole person in narratives, news, rumors, documents, and data systems like
                        SNAC. Look back at Figures 3 and 4 in this article and notice the primacy of
                        names in SNAC's radial graph. Figure 5 shows a portion of the SNAC
                        prototype's home page where a searchable list of names provides access to
                        data contained in SNAC. The history of naming is long, but is perhaps most
                        significantly related to SNAC in the way personal names reflect the growing
                        complexity of society. For example, the legal and judicial systems of
                        expanding towns in medieval Europe needed to identify individuals clearly in
                        order to attach them to property, to tax and recruit them, and to prosecute
                        them, eventually leading to compulsory naming in the modern era for these
                        reasons (Wilson, 1998). All human organizations now have some bureaucratic
                        interest in names and the official records of many institutions, from
                        churches to governments to corporations and beyond, can end up residing in
                        the next level of the infrastructure stack, the archive. </div>

                        the creator through the performance of those functions [<a class="ref" href="#pitti2006">Pitti 2006</a>]. The finding aids provide context to archival

                        system. Archivists initially developed specialized local practices for
                        describing their collections, believing their collections to be too unique
                        to employ standardized practices. However, over time, archivists came to

                        properties, characteristics, and needs of these collections are not [<a class="ref" href="#theimer2011">Theimer 2011</a>]. This realization, combined with the energy

                        explore different ways of presenting finding aid content online [<a class="ref" href="#dainesnimer2012">Daines and Nimer 2012</a>]. Archivists themselves increasingly
                        recognize that the structure of the traditional finding aid, which is
                        embodied in EAD, is inflexible and inefficient when dealing with complex,
                        interrelated records [<a class="ref" href="#pitti2004">Pitti 2004</a>]. The next level up in the
                        infrastructure stack, the aforementioned EAC-CPF, provides the key to
                        revolutionizing archival description and online access. However, before I
                        address that, there’s one more part of the stack that bears mentioning. </div>

                        step to library infrastructure is necessary. An authority record is "a tool used by librarians to establish forms of
                                names (for persons, places, meetings, and organizations), titles,
                                and subjects used on bibliographic records"
                             [<a class="ref" href="#loc2011b">Library of Congress 2011 b</a>]. Of particular interest to SNAC are the collection of authorized
                        names (such as "Twain, Mark, 1835-1910") and the list of
                        cross-references that lead to the authorized names (such as "Snodgrass,
                            Quintus Curtius, 1835-1910" and "Clemens, Samuel Langhorne,
                            1835-1910"). For reasons that will be described shortly, SNAC relies
                        on authority files to flesh out the biographical descriptions of people and
                        organizations in its data. </div>

                        is the top of the infrastructure stack that supports SNAC. EAC-CPF Schema is
                        a standard for encoding contextual information about persons, corporate
                        bodies, and families related to archival materials using XML [<a class="ref" href="#berlin">Staatsbibliothek zu Berlin, n.d.</a>]. EAC-CPF solves a problem inherent in traditional
                        finding aids and EAD, that is the difficultly of representing complex
                        records with a single document. Archival records are often of mixed
                        provenance or the records of the same provenance can be dispersed over
                        numerous archives. This situation causes unnecessary redundancy and
                        duplication of effort [<a class="ref" href="#pitti2004">Pitti 2004</a>]. EAC-CPF solves this
                        problem by enabling the separation of creator description from record
                        description. Maintaining a unique, centralized creator record not only
                        reduces redundancy and duplication of effort, but also provides an efficient
                        means of linking creators to the functions and activities carried out by
                        them, to the dispersed records they created or to which they are related,
                        and to other related creators [<a class="ref" href="#pitti2006">Pitti 2006</a>]. </div>

                     <div class="ptext" id="p28"> As I mentioned before, one of SNAC’s primary objectives is the creation of a
                        large (and growing) collection of EAC-CPF records that power its prototype
                        access system. As its original National Endowment for the Humanities (NEH)
                        proposal describes, SNAC takes three steps to generate creator descriptions
                        in EAC-CPF [<a class="ref" href="#IATHa">IATH n.d. a</a>]. First, preliminary EAC-CPF records are
                        derived from name and biographical components of EAD. The structured nature
                        of the EAD records enables information to be migrated directly into the
                        EAC-CPF format through automated EXtensible Style Sheet Transformations
                        (XSLT). A less simple part of this first step is the extraction of names
                        from semi-structured and free form text fields that require natural language
                        processing techniques. </div>
                    <div class="counter">
                        <a href="#p29">29</a>
                     </div>
                     <div class="ptext" id="p29"> In the second step, duplicate EAC-CPF records that describe the same person,
                        family, or corporate body are automatically matched and merged into a single
                        record. This process presents a challenge for SNAC. It’s not unusual for
                        people and corporate bodies to use different names and leave records behind
                        under those various names. Additionally, the EAD records, while structured,
                        often contain text data created manually by humans. Consequently, names may
                        contain misspellings or the same name may be entered in a variety of ways,
                        such as "Twain, Mark, 1835-1910,"
                        "Twain, Mark,"
                        "Mark Twain," or "M. Twain." For more information on this step and
                        further technical details about the entire SNAC project, see Larson &amp;
                        Janakiraman [<a class="ref" href="#larsonjanakiraman2011">Larson and Janakiraman 2011</a>]. </div>

                     </div>
                     <div class="ptext" id="p30"> The third step involves matching the set of EAC-CPF records against
                        authority records from the Library of Congress Name Authority File (LCNAF)
                        and the Getty Vocabulary Program Union List of Artists’ Names (ULAN). Doing
                        so will enable the project to set the authoritative form of a name as the
                        primary name in the EAC-CPF record as well as incorporating a list of
                        alternative forms. Also, biographical/historical data found in the ULAN
                        files will be added to the data in the EAC-CPF record to form a more
                        complete description of the person, family, or corporate body. </div>

                     <div class="ptext" id="p31"> As of April 15, 2012, SNAC has derived 175,637 EAC-CPF records by extracting
                        data from 30,496 finding aids obtained from the Library of Congress,
                        Northwest Digital Archive, Online Archive of California, and Virginia

                        EAC-CPF records (IATH, 2012). This standardized dataset is at the top of the
                        stack, supporting new cyberinfrastructure tools that are just beginning to
                        emerge. SNAC’s prototype access system and the radial graph visualization
                        tool are the current examples, but more may be developed. Perhaps, in time,
                        such tools will come to be considered as essential to humanities research

                        level of building tools to enhance research. I used SNAC as an example
                        because it allowed me to illustrate several variables that ought to be
                        considered when designing a research tool for humanities
                        cyberinfrastructure: size and scope of the project, members of the project’s
                        team, and choice of technologies. SNAC aims to be a project of great size
                        focused on a narrow mission — creating a network of archival data. To meet
                        the specific research needs of its anticipated community of users SNAC will
                        leverage the power of its data to provide access to research materials
                        through integration with existing infrastructure. This goal could not be
                        achieved without a diverse group of collaborators, from technology
                        specialists to humanists, each representing the various domains of expertise
                        that contribute to the project. This variety of influence on SNAC’s design
                        contributes to decision-making that weighs the merits of traditional
                        infrastructure and advanced cyberinfrastructure. SNAC adopts and develops
                        technologies that best meet the needs of humanities researchers while
                        pushing the limits of what is possible. One key way designers of SNAC ensure
                        that the needs of current scholars are met is to heed the heritage of the
                        project’s infrastructure stack. The creators of SNAC have understood the
                        infrastructure of the past and present, identified what has served users
                        well and which aspects need improvement, and thought creatively about how to
                        augment existing services and solve current problems. Further examples of
                        new cyberinfrastructure are likely to evolve naturally from the layers of
                        existing infrastructure in this way as opportunities to build new layers are
                        realized in the future, just as the infrastructure layers of the past were
                        once new solutions to old research challenges. Research infrastructure both
                        reflects and inspires humanities thinking and methods. As old obstacles to
                        research crumble through the development of new infrastructure, new methods
                        evolve and generate new challenges to bedevil researchers. The developers of
                        infrastructure respond with technology and ingenuity, creating new services
                        to meet these challenges. The cycle continues to this day, where digital
                        technologies are inspiring new methods of research and new tools are being
                        designed to facilitate, enhance, and accelerate those methods while
                        eventually setting the stage for the next evolution in humanities thinking. </div>

                     <div class="ptext" id="p33">While I have discussed mainly tool building, cyberinfrastructure is much more
                        than that. Cyberinfrastructure is the digital manifestation of a research
                        culture. However, even while designing cyberinfrastructure at this grand
                        scale, some of the variables that contribute to the success of a single tool
                        may also contribute to successful shaping of a digital culture. SNAC can
                        serve as an illustrative example in this regard, too. To better serve the
                        entire research community SNAC intends to grow from the size of a research
                        project to a self-sustaining national program. The Institute for Museum and
                        Library Services (IMLS) has funded a project named Building a National
                        Archival Authorities Infrastructure to help meet this goal. A proper mix of
                        collaborators that represent the breadth of the project’s stakeholders is
                        essential to bring this plan to fruition. The IMLS funding will support a
                        meeting of leaders in the archive, library, museum, scholarly, and funding
                        communities to determine the requirements of building a sustainable National
                        Archival Authorities Cooperative (NAAC) [<a class="ref" href="#IATHd">IATH n.d. d</a>]. This
                        cooperative would go far beyond SNAC in scale, but share the same narrow
                        scope as SNAC. It intends to do a few things very well, but at a national
                        scale: provide integrated access to the records held in government,
                        business, and research archives across the United States as well as access
                        to the social networks of the people whose lives are documented in those
                        records. At this level of cyberinfrastructure building, researching new
                        technology plays less of a role than developing new policy recommendations
                        for the business, governing, and technical requirements for NAAC. However, a
                        great deal of emphasis is placed on the top of SNAC’s infrastructure stack,
                        the EAC-CPF standard [<a class="ref" href="#IATHe">IATH n.d. e</a>]. Writing about EAC-CPF several
                        years ago, Pitti (2004) predicted that this "standard for creator description will facilitate
                                building international, national, regional, and institutional
                                biographical and historical databases that can serve as
                                resources"
                             [<a class="ref" href="#pitti2004">Pitti 2004</a>]. To that end, the IMLS funding will also support workshops and
                        scholarships to attend them in which EAC-CPF will be taught to increase
                        understanding and expertise in archival authority control. Broad adoption of
                        this standard by the archival community is a necessary component to building
                        the immense collection of data which tools like those developed in the SNAC
                        project require in order to become a major contribution to
                        cyberinfrastructure. </div>
