                  <p>Of all narrative textual forms, the motion picture screenplay may be the most
                    perfectly pre-disposed for computational analysis. Screenplays contain
                    capitalized character names, indented dialogue, and other formatting conventions
                    that enable an algorithmic approach to analyzing and visualizing film
                    narratives. In this article, the authors introduce their new tool, ScripThreads,
                    which parses screenplays, outputs statistical values which can be analyzed, and
                    offers four different types of visualization, each with its own utility. The
                    visualizations represent character interactions across time as a single 3D or 2D
                    graph. The authors model the utility of the tool for the close analysis of a
                    single film (Lawrence Kasdan’s <cite class="title italic">Grand Canyon</cite>
                    [1991]). They also model how the tool can be used for "distant reading" by identifying patterns of character presence
                    across a dataset of 674 screenplays.</p>

                  <div class="ptext" id="p1">In November 2009, the website xkcd.com published a series of info-graphics that
                    visualized character interactions in movies such as the <cite class="title italic">Lord of the Rings </cite>trilogy (2001-2003), the <cite class="title italic">Star Wars </cite>trilogy (1977-1983), and <cite class="title italic">Jurassic
                        Park </cite>(1993). Exhibiting both attention to detail and a nice sense of
                    humor, the xkcd charts allowed time to play out across the x-axis and showed how
                    the characters exist in different spaces within the narrative world (the
                    difference between storylines occurring on the Death Star and Tatooine, in the
                        <cite class="title italic">Star Wars</cite> example). These info-graphics became
                    the motivation for Tanahasi and Ma’s "Design Considerations
                        for Optimizing Storyline Visualizations," a computer science paper
                    published in <cite class="title italic">IEEE Transactions on Visualization and
                        Computer Graphics </cite>(2012). Tanahasi and Ma propose an algorithmic
                    approach to generating the design of these types of visualizations. While these
                    types of visualizations were of interest to scholars and researchers, they came
                    with several short-comings, most notably that all of the information that was to
                    be visualized needed to be gathered externally. This meant that a human would
                    need to watch a film and manually fill in information as to when and where
                    certain characters appeared and interacted. It greatly diminished the utility of
                    these visualizations as a tool of data exploration; the analysis more or less
                    needed to be completed before the tool could be used.</div>

                    with other characters, and absences) as it changes over time — along with our
                    shared interests in the Digital Humanities and our more singular scholarly
                    focuses on cinema and television (Hoyt), visualization and storytelling (Roy),
                    and computational approaches (Ponto) — spurred us to develop a tool that
                    algorithmically analyzes and visualizes screenplays. In building a tool to aid
                    Humanists, we sought to heed Abello, Broadwell, and Tanghrelini’s call for
                    computational approaches that "combine distant reading and
                        close reading"
                    [<a class="ref" href="#abello2012">Abello, Broadwell, and Tangherlini 2012</a>]. One appeal of a fully algorithmic approach is that
                    it scales nicely — enabling the "distant reading"
                    that Franco Moretti first proposed and, in our case, allowing a researcher to
                    study 1,000 screenplays rather than 10 or 20 [<a class="ref" href="#moretti2000">Moretti 2000</a>].
                    Keeping in mind the value of close reading, though, we also sought to create a
                    narrative analysis tool that offered direct access to every line of a screenplay
                    — similar to the "Reading View" window in the
                    Watching the Script software prototype developed for the visualization of
                    theatrical text [<a class="ref" href="#roberts-smith2013">Roberts-Smith et al. 2013</a>]. In our case, we wanted to
                    connect this "Reading View" window that displays
                    lines from the screenplay to a series of visualizations that account for scenes,
                    pacing, and character interactions. Rather than reducing a screenplay simply to
                    statistical aggregates, we wanted to map the way a screenplay unfolds as it
                    moves from page to page. From generating several hundred of these narrative
                    profiles, we can compare and contrast large numbers of screenplays across
                    decades, by author, by genre, by narrative structure and more. </div>

                    initial research findings from using ScripThreads to analyze and visualize
                    hundreds of screenplays from the American Film Scripts Online collection. We
                    model how the tool can be productively used in film analysis as a tool for close
                    reading by analyzing and comparing two screenplays co-written and directed by
                    Lawrence Kasdan, <cite class="title italic">The Big Chill</cite> (1983) and <cite class="title italic">Grand Canyon</cite> (1991). We also model how the tool can be
                    used for distant reading by searching across hundreds of screenplays for the
                    pattern of the "hyper-present protagonist" — movies that
                    place a main character in every scene or nearly every scene. </div>

                  <div class="ptext" id="p4">In the process of building the tool’s prototype and writing this article, we have
                    come to appreciate the many ways that a computer reads a screenplay differently
                    from you or me. Humans gather insight from watching and experiencing the
                    emotion, tension, and dynamics of a movie or screenplay. Rather than attempting
                    to train a computer to understand a film in the exact same way we do, we would
                    prefer to ask a computer to do tasks that it is designed to do well and that we
                    humans struggle with. Humans have memory limitations when it comes to matters of
                    sequential timing and the entrances and exits of dozens of characters. In
                    contrast, computers are excellent at gathering and recording these sorts of
                    details from structured texts. Lev Manovich has suggested that one of the most
                    valuable things that comes from combining computational analysis and the
                    visualization of vast amounts of information in a single image is that it
                    defamiliarizes our understanding of the works that we study in the Humanities
                        [<a class="ref" href="#manovich2012">Manovich 2012</a>]. As we hope to demonstrate, ScripThreads is a
                    powerful framework for defamiliarization, provoking new questions, and producing
                    new answers through the combined strengths of the human analyst and the
                    computer.</div>

                    Reddington explain, "a filmscript is a semi-structured
                        textual document in that it is subdivided into scenes and sometimes other
                        structural units. Both character dialog and also descriptive and background
                        metadata is provided in a filmscript. The metadata is partially
                        formalized"
                    [<a class="ref" href="#murtagh2011">Murtagh, Ganz, and Reddington 2011</a>]. As semi-structured documents with formatting
                    conventions analogous to a metadata schema, screenplays are ideally suited for
                    automated computer parsing. There is no need for laborious TEI encoding to
                    detect character dialogue exchanges and interactions. When a character speaks,
                    his or her name is capitalized and centered on the page. The character’s
                    dialogue generally appears one line below. As we discuss below, there are
                    variations within this general format that create parsing challenges.
                    Nevertheless, the extraction of character interactions in a screenplay is far
                    easier to automate than in a novel or epic poem.</div>

                    research about screenwriting history, form, theory, and practice. As a
                    discipline, Film Studies has long lived in the shadow of the "auteur theory," which views the director as the author
                    of a film. Film scholars and critics seem unable to let go of an "auteur desire," in the words of Dana Polan [<a class="ref" href="#polan2001">Polan 2001</a>]. Even scholars who acknowledge that film is a highly
                    collaborative medium will refer to "Scorsese’s <cite class="title italic">Taxi Driver</cite>" — elevating the director to
                    the status of author rather than the studio (Columbia Pictures), screenwriter
                    (Paul Schrader), or cinematographer (Michael Chapman). Over the last decade,
                    however, screenwriting studies has emerged as its own sub-field within the
                    discipline of film and media studies. The Screenwriting Research Network held
                    its first conference in 2008; the <cite class="title italic">Journal of
                        Screenwriting</cite> published its first issue in 2010. </div>

                    [<a class="ref" href="#murtagh2011">Murtagh, Ganz, and Reddington 2011</a>]. The 2013 launch of Samuel Marinov and Brock
                    Stitts’ Screenplay Owl analysis tool marked an especially exciting development.
                    With its emphasis on dialogic exchange frequencies, Screenplay Owl differs
                    significantly from ScripThreads. However, both ScripThreads and Screenplay Owl
                    show that the initial speculations about computational screenplay analysis are
                    becoming realities. As we worked on revising this article for <cite class="title italic">DHQ </cite>in early-2014, we witnessed the launch of another
                    promising screenwriting analytics tool: ScriptFAQ, developed by Stewart McKie.
                    McKie’s tool is designed for practicing screenwriters who want to ask questions
                    about a screenplay they are working on (for example, how many scenes is one
                    character in compared to another?). For ScriptFAQ to answer these questions, the
                    screenplay must be imported in the XML-based Final Draft file format and the
                    user must enter a substantial number of additional metadata fields, which
                    require detailed knowledge of the screenplay. For a writer working on a
                    screenplay, these metadata fields are quite easy to complete and the results are
                    well worth the effort. For a researcher wanting to quickly compare hundreds of
                    screenplays across history, however, the need for many additional metadata,
                    prior knowledge about each screenplay, and the Final Draft file format (which
                    most older screenplays aren’t readily available in) make ScripThreads better
                    suited than ScriptFAQ for distant reading. Ultimately, for a researcher
                    interested in computer-enhanced close reading, we believe the combination of
                    analyzing a screenplay in ScripThreads, ScreenplayOwl, and ScriptFAQ may
                    generate the richest results of all. </div>

                  <div class="ptext" id="p8">Regardless of the software platform, there are some inherent limitations to an
                    automated approach to screenplay analysis. First, a screenplay nearly always
                    differs to some degree from the completed film version, which may include
                    improvised dialogue from the film’s production or lack scenes or characters that
                    were cut in post-production. Screenplay analysis requires us to qualify
                    arguments we may want to make about the entire film. Another major challenge to
                    this line of research is access — specifically, digital access to the
                    authoritative versions of screenplays. There are several websites offering free,
                    downloadable screenplays of contemporary Hollywood movies. The provenance,
                    authoritativeness, and legal status of these screenplays, though, are not clear.
                    Moreover, these websites generally have very few screenplays for movies produced
                    prior to the 1980s. </div>

                  <div class="ptext" id="p9"> American Film Scripts Online (AFSO) is the digital resource that we believe
                    provides access to the largest number of authoritative, digitized screenplays.
                    The resource’s creator, Alexander Street Press, licensed 1,009 screenplays from
                    Warner Bros., Universal, and a number of other rights holders. Roughly half of
                    the screenplays are available as PDF facsimiles of the original documents, and
                    all of the screenplays are available as HTML documents, which have been
                    re-keyed, eliminating most of the problems that come from uncorrected OCR text.
                    The HTML mark-up is not consistently or semantically structured, but this
                    productively forced us to code ScripThreads’s parsing algorithm so that it could
                    handle a wider variety of screenplays and not depend on rigid mark-up standards.
                    As for AFSO’s selection of screenplays, the collection is stronger in some areas
                    than others. Over half of the 1,009 screenplays derive from 1930s and 1940s
                    Hollywood movies — primarily, productions from Warner Bros., RKO, and MGM (it’s
                    no coincidence that Time Warner holds the rights to all three of these studio
                    film libraries). AFSO is well suited, then, for research questions focusing on
                    Hollywood’s "Golden Age." Other strength areas of
                    AFSO include 1990s American films (both studio and independent) and large script
                    collections from certain contemporary screenwriters, including Paul Schrader,
                    Lawrence Kasdan, and John Sayles. As a result, AFSO is also well suited for
                    researching questions involving screenplay authorship, a topic we explore later
                    in this essay.</div>

                    full capitalization before each paragraph of dialogue, the number of spaces this
                    indentation took varied greatly between different works. Furthermore, some
                    authors used indentation and capitalization to indicate other screenplay

                    a screenplay. In the first pass, each line was analyzed to determine if it was
                    potentially the indication of a character. Lines which were considered
                    candidates were pushed to a list. After the first pass, the list was analyzed to
                    determine the most likely amount of indentation before a character name. For
                    instance, a given screenplay may have 12 spaces of indentation before a
                    character name with the spoken lines included in the paragraph below.</div>

                    gathered from the first pass. Additional names could also be entered by the
                    user. Scenes were determined by looking for a user defined set of keywords, such
                    as "int." or "ext.". In practice, it was determined that a list of
                    10-12 keywords well captured scene changes. Finally, meta-information data, such
                    as page numbers, were found using simple matching techniques.</div>

                  <div class="ptext" id="p15">After the characters are detected, ScripThreads applies the framework of network
                    theory by drawing a relationship (edge) between characters (nodes) who share the
                    same scene. Force directed graphs are a common method visualizing this type of
                    information. Digital Humanities scholars have used force directed graphs to
                    represent networks of characters, literary authors, and topics [<a class="ref" href="#simeone2012">Simeone 2012</a>]. In a force directed graph, edges are represented as
                    virtual springs and nodes are represented as virtual masses. During runtime, a
                    virtual physics simulation is run which attempts to find an equilibrium position
                    for all nodes. <a href="#figure03">Figure 3</a> is an example of a typical
                    force directed graph. In this case, we used Gephi to graph the network of

                    information, and is not designed for a time-based approach. One approach to
                    encode temporal information along with connectivity information is to treat each
                    time-step as an individual force directed graph. These graphs can then be
                    converted into a 3D data structure which can be analyzed from arbitrary
                    positions. The limitation of this approach on its own is that each time-step is
                    handled on an individual basis; there is no guarantee that the nodes will appear
                    as temporally connected threads.</div>

                  <div class="ptext" id="p17">To overcome this limitation, ScripThreads accounts for the temporal dimension
                    through use of a single 3D data structure. Each node is placed on a series of
                    time-step planes on the z-axis and are not only connected to the other relevant
                    nodes in their time-step, but are also connected to the previous and future
                    states. This enables each character to be viewed as a virtual thread that can
                    become entangled in other threads when relationships occur. An added value to
                    the vertical alignment of character threads, as opposed to the horizontal
                    arrangement of the xkcd examples, is that the entire script is visible and able
                    to be scrolled alongside the visualization — enabling the integrated close and
                    distant reading noted in the introduction. The rendering system also simulates
                    the idea of a virtual thread, by rendering each character as a continuous
                    character thread — thick when the character is active, thin when not active.
                    This enables unbiased color blending to occur on a model level, often referred
                    to as "color weaving"
                    [<a class="ref" href="#hagh-shenas2007">Hagh-Shenas et al. 2007</a>]. Lines of dialogue between the characters can
                    be seen as interconnects between the thread with the color representing the
                    speaker.</div>

                  <div class="ptext" id="p18">The force directed visualizations reveal insights into a screenplay’s narrative
                    structure, especially for films featuring episodic segments or parallel
                    narratives, parallel protagonists, or parallel lines of action. In screenwriting
                    manuals, "narrative structure" is often synonymous with "three act
                        structure" and the goal-oriented protagonist whose pursuit of some goal
                    pushes the story from one act to the next. The goal-oriented protagonist is
                    fundamental to Hollywood storytelling, and we acknowledge that ScripThreads does
                    not capture this important dimension of screenplay structure.<a class="noteRef" href="#d3e453">[1]</a> However, we would also argue
                    that there is more to narrative structure than simply the pursuit of goals
                    across three acts. Supporting characters will be introduced along the way, but
                    will they return and, if so, how and when? Are there parallel lines of action as
                    other characters pursue their own goals or serve as thematic foils for the
                    protagonist? The force directed graph of Paul Schrader’s <cite class="title italic">Mishima: A Life in Four Chapters</cite> (1985) clearly captures the
                    specific character threads contained in four sections of the script (see <a href="#figure04">Figure 4</a>). Similar visual patterns in other force
                    directed graphs would suggest the screenplay may be episodic in its overall
                    structure and the way in which it uses supporting characters. </div>

                    together in the same spaces and scenes throughout the movie (<a href="#figure06">Figure 6</a>). The narrative of <cite class="title italic">The Big Chill</cite>, directed by Lawrence Kasdan and written by Kasdan
                    and Barbara Benedek, centers on a group of seven college friends who reunite
                    after a shared friend, Alex, dies. Most of the film’s action occurs after the
                    funeral at a spacious vacation house — a setting that facilitates many different
                    types of character interactions, ranging from two characters speaking privately
                    to scenes that bring the entire group together. The frequency of these
                    interactions between the same group of characters is visibly evident in the
                    tight clustering of the threads colored red (Sam), pink (Harold), orange
                    (Michael), light orange (Nick), green (Meg), and light green (Sarah) toward the
                    center of the force directed graph. The character whose thread veers in the
                    largest arc from the central group is Chloe, Alex’s girlfriend who did not
                    attend college with the rest of the group and speaks far less than the other

                    can be read like a bus map: characters run parallel routes when they both appear
                    in a scene. When a character is not in a scene, his or her bus route splits off.

                    purple thread’s wide arcs reveal, Richard is absent for most of the film.

                    rooted in the network theory. Perhaps for this reason, though, we’ve found that

                    present in a scene, then his or her colored thread vertically increases. If a

                    screenplay. Slightly less present are Michael and Nick (orange and light
                    orange), who also appear roughly equally, and they, in turn, are followed very
                    closely by Meg and Sarah (green and light green). The increasing graph
                    reinforces our earlier observation that the male characters play active roles in

                    movies, the story centers on the goals of one or two protagonists. These
                    protagonists — antiheroes, in the case of the neo-noir <cite class="title italic">Body
                        Heat</cite> — are the red and pink threads. The orange threads in <cite class="title italic">Body Heat</cite> and <cite class="title italic">Silverado

                    second act to increase conflict and complicate the protagonist’s pursuit of his
                    goals. Interestingly, and fittingly for the western and crime noir genres,
                    Kasdan made this character an authority figure in both screenplays: the sheriff
                    in <cite class="title italic">Silverado</cite> and the district attorney

                    significantly different from <cite class="title italic">The Big Chill</cite> (1983).
                    The wider thread arcs and non-intersecting threads of <cite class="title italic">Grand

                        11</a>) show that there are characters who appear numerous times in the
                    film but never share the same scene. Davis (green thread) and Deborah (purple
                    thread), for example, are never present in the same scene. Other characters,
                    such as Dee (light green) and Claire (pink), are only present once in the same
                    scene. Whereas <cite class="title italic">The Big Chill</cite> is about a network of
                    old friends who physically reunite in the same space, <cite class="title italic">Grand
                        Canyon</cite> is an example of what some film scholars have referred to as
                    a "network narrative" — a multi-protagonist film that
                    follows numerous characters whose lives intersect at different moments [<a class="ref" href="#bordwell2006">Bordwell 2006</a>, 94–103]. Of course, one does not need a
                    computer visualization to recognize this difference between <cite class="title italic">Grand Canyon</cite> and <cite class="title italic">The Big Chill</cite>. From
                    viewing both films, the difference between the characters gathered spatially in
                        <cite class="title italic">The Big Chill</cite>’s house and the characters
                    dispersed across the city of Los Angeles in <cite class="title italic">Grand Canyon
                    </cite>is quite apparent. The racially diverse cast of <cite class="title italic">Grand Canyon</cite> and the film’s overriding interests in relations
                    across race and social class are also starkly different from <cite class="title italic">The Big Chill</cite>, a film in which no non-white character
                    holds narrative significance. So, the question remains — what does ScripThreads
                    offer that simply viewing the films does not? </div>

                        <p>
                        In Lawrence Kasdan’s <span class="hi italic">Grand Canyon</span>
                            (1991), the married couple Mack and Claire and the brother-sister pair
                            of Simon and [Deborah] are given roughly equal emphasis… other plotlines
                            show Mack’s son falling in love with a girl he meets at camp,
                            [Deborah]’s son being alienated, and Mack’s friend Davis vowing to stop
                            making ultraviolent movies. The subsidiary characters don’t encounter
                            all the customary obstacles and setbacks, yet their wants are developed
                            beyond the limits of a traditional subplot, providing thematic echoes or
                            counterpoints.

                        Canyon</span>, it is striking to note how uneven the distribution of character
                    presence is across the film (see <a href="#figure12">Figure 12</a>). The
                    Kevin Kline character of Mack (red thread) appears in 50% more scenes than any
                    other character. The next two most active threads are those of Mack’s wife,
                    Claire (pink), and Simon (orange), the tow truck driver who helps Mack after a
                    car breakdown in one of L.A.’s worst neighborhoods. Simon’s sister, Deborah
                    (purple), appears as one of many of the subsidiary characters clustered toward
                    the bottom. She is present in fewer scenes than either Davis (green) or Mack’s
                    son Roberto (light orange).</div>

                  <div class="ptext" id="p34"> Does this mean that David Bordwell’s analysis of the film is incorrect? No.
                    Bordwell never claims that Mack, Claire, Simon, and Deborah are given equal
                    screen time. Instead, he’s suggesting that the storytelling techniques invite
                    the audience to think of the characters as equally important. In fact,
                    Bordwell’s book offers insights that explain the discrepancy between Mack’s
                    on-screen involvement and the audience’s understanding of Mack as one of
                    multiple roughly equal characters. Bordwell describes <cite class="title italic">Grand
                        Canyon</cite> in the context of contemporary "ensemble
                        films" in which "several protagonists are given
                        equal emphasis, based on screen time, star wattage, control over events, or
                        other spotlighting maneuvers." The star wattage and spotlighting
                    maneuvers are especially significant to our interpretation of <cite class="title italic">Grand Canyon</cite> as an ensemble drama. As already
                    discussed, the film’s marketing emphasized the ensemble of actors. In terms of
                    star power, Danny Glover and Steve Martin had both headlined more commercially
                    successful movies than Kevin Kline prior to the movie’s release. </div>
                  <div class="counter">
                     <a href="#p35">35</a>
                  </div>
                  <div class="ptext" id="p35"> The screenplay’s two major spotlighting maneuvers, which occur at the beginning
                    and end, further encourage us to perceive Mack (Kevin Kline) and Simon (Danny
                    Glover) as equal in narrative importance. The script’s most important
                    spotlighting maneuver occurs from pages 6 to 16: the white lawyer Mack’s car
                    breaks down at night in South Central Los Angeles; armed young black men
                    approach him and tell him to get out of the car; Simon, a black tow truck
                    driver, pulls up, tells the armed men that Mack is his responsibility, and takes
                    Mack back to his house in an affluent neighborhood. The screenplay interweaves
                    scenes of Mack waiting for the tow truck and scenes of his family back in
                    Brentwood. When Simon and Mack are leaving South Central, Simon’s line, "My sister and her kids live near here," motivates a
                    transition to a scene that introduces Simon’s sister and her troubled son. The
                    Mack and Simon characters are contrasted by their race and social class, yet
                    treated as equals through the attention to each one’s family and their shared
                    sense that, in the words of Simon, "the world ain't supposed
                        to work like this... Everything's supposed to be different than it
                        is." This loss of faith in the social and moral order —
                    counterbalanced by the possibility for human kindness, growth, and, even,
                    miracles — provides the thematic glue for the entire film. The final scene of
                    Mack, Simon, and their loved ones gazing in wonder at the Grand Canyon
                    reestablishes our understanding of the narrative parity between the lives of
                    Mack and Simon. Simon’s question, "What do you
                        think?" and Mack’s response, "I think… it’s not
                        all bad. Not at all," provides an affirmative, glass-half-full answer
                    to the existential questions that have run throughout the 136-page screenplay. </div>

                  <div class="ptext" id="p36"> The many scenes that occur between the car breakdown and visit to the Grand
                    Canyon further encourage the audience to think of "the
                        married couple Mack and Claire and the brother-sister pair of Simon and
                        [Deborah]" as "roughly equal [in] emphasis"
                         [<a class="ref" href="#bordwell2006">Bordwell 2006</a>]. Bordwell points out that “their lines of action follow Thompson’s
                    four-part template,” referring to the four act structure that Kristin Thompson
                    identifies as running through most Hollywood movies, including films with
                    multiple protagonists [<a class="ref" href="#thompson1999">Thompson 1999</a>]. In <cite class="title italic">Grand Canyon</cite>, Mack and Simon both move through the four act cycle
                    of setup, complicating action, development, and climax and epilogue. As Thompson
                    argues, it is characters in pursuit of goals that defines classical Hollywood
                    storytelling more than any other feature. The goals often change, and characters
                    generally have both long-term and short-term goals. Mack and Simon are both
                    seeking to restore their faith in the universe and humanity. Yet there are a
                    series of more concrete short-term goals (Mack wanting to return a favor to
                    Simon), appointments (Simon’s date with Jane), and deadlines (Mack and Claire’s
                    need to make a decision about the baby) that move these characters through the
                    four act structure and make <cite class="title italic">Grand Canyon</cite> a
                    Hollywood film rather than one of the existential dramas of Ingmar Bergman. </div>

                    and practitioners better appreciate how storytelling techniques shape the
                    audience’s perception of a narrative. In the case of <cite class="title italic">Grand
                        Canyon</cite>, the force directed graph (<a href="#figure11">Figure
                        11</a>) offers an additional insight: the character of Mack functions
                    structurally as the film’s key bridge node. Mack (red thread) is active in
                    scenes with nearly all the major characters. He introduces Simon (orange thread)
                    to Jane (blue thread), with whom Simon becomes romantically linked. More
                    importantly, Mack motivates our introductions to his co-worker and one-time
                    lover Dee (light green thread) and movie producer friend Davis (green thread).
                    Searching for happiness and answers in their own lives, Dee and Davis advance
                    the central themes of the film. Yet unlike some modern films, these thematically
                    linked storylines do not occur in isolation to one another. Mack motivates our
                    introductions to these characters and appears in subsequent scenes with them.
                    When Mack visits the wounded Davis, the focus is squarely on Davis and his
                    storyline — encouraging us to think of it as Davis’s scene, despite Mack’s
                    presence, and furthering the overall notion of <cite class="title italic">Grand Canyon
                    </cite>as an ensemble film. The ScripThreads force directed graph is useful,
                    then, for reminding us that Mack, as a bridge node, is still vital to the
                    structuring of multiple storylines that are not his own.</div>

                    and a clear process for gathering evidence. But as Sinclair, Ruecker, and
                    Radzikowska suggest, another important task for the Humanities is "to locate (or discover) new material, with no prior
                            knowledge of the kinds of details used for retrieval"
                         [<a class="ref" href="#sinclair2013">Sinclair, Ruecker, and Radzikowska 2013</a>]. In our case, we tested out the distant reading possibilities of
                    ScripThreads by using the tool’s “Automate” function to export four types of
                    graphs (force directed, absence, presence and increasing) and the statistical
                    CSV files for the screenplays in the corpus that were produced between 1930 to
                    2006. We then looked at the graph images for patterns that stood out visually
                    across numerous screenplays. The first pattern that came to our attention was a
                    sub-group of increasing graphs in which the red thread moves diagonally at a
                    straight line, advancing higher and straighter than any other thread line (<a href="#figure13">Figure 13</a>). These graphs pointed us toward the
                    storytelling pattern of what we call the "hyper-present
                        protagonist" — screenplays featuring a main character who appears

                    simple algorithm that targeted the exported Character Stats CSV files and
                    extracted information on the character from each screenplay with the highest
                    percentage of involvement. ScripThreads’ Character Stats function calculates the
                    percentage of character involvement by: A) identifying whether a character
                    appears in a scene — yes or no; B) calculating how much of the screenplay any
                    given scene takes up as a percentage; C) adding all of the percentage points for
                    the instances when a character is present. In conducting this analysis, roughly
                    one quarter of the 935 screenplays did not parse properly and we chose to
                    disregard their results. We could have opted to use ScripThreads’ Advanced
                    Settings and gone one-by-one through the screenplays that returned inaccurate
                    results, adjusting the settings to more clearly identify the way a particular
                    screenplay notes characters and scene breaks. And if we were using ScripThreads

                    wanted to test how the ScripThreads prototype performed at scale, we moved
                    forward in analyzing the reduced corpus of 674 screenplays. As we continue to

                    the 1930s that we analyzed, we found only two that clearly featured a

                    Warner Bros. during the pre-Production Code era. Both screenplays are also set
                    in prison contexts and co-written by Brown Holmes, a point we will return to in
                    our discussion of authorship. Our historical analysis suggests that the
                    hyper-present protagonist grew far more common in Hollywood movies produced
                    during and after World War II. Our findings confirm David Bordwell’s argument
                    that Hollywood writers, directors, and producers innovated new storytelling
                    techniques during the 1940s that filmmakers have used ever since [<a class="ref" href="#bordwell2006">Bordwell 2006</a>]
                    [<a class="ref" href="#bordwell2013">Bordwell 2013</a>]. Historically, this rise can be understood as part
                    of the effort of filmmakers and writers during the 1940s to produce films of
                    greater psychological realism, moral ambiguity, and experimentation in
                    storytelling. </div>

                    confirmed what the leading historians of film style and narrative have argued.
                    But as Matthew Jockers points out, we should not expect distant reading and
                    computational literary analysis to always overturn previous understandings.
                    There is value to "bring[ing] a new type of evidence and a new perspective

                         [<a class="ref" href="#jockers2014">Jockers 2014</a>]. Additionally, in this case, our analysis also suggests something

                    American South. Few would dispute that this film was unusual for its day, with
                    its strong social critique and bleak ending. Our analysis suggests yet another
                    unusual element that contributes to the film’s power — the protagonist (played
                    by Paul Muni) is in nearly every scene, increasing the film’s psychological

                    storytelling and challenged others. Screenwriting guidebooks generally discuss
                    the detective movie as the genre most likely to be presented as a "closed story," a storytelling strategy that keeps the
                    audience aligned with the protagonist’s point of view and reveals information to
                    the audience only at the moments when information is revealed to the
                    protagonist. In contrast, an "open story" is one in
                    which the audience learns information that the character does not know [<a class="ref" href="#field2009">Field 2009</a>]
                    [<a class="ref" href="#hunter2004">Hunter 2004</a>]. As we expected, several examples of the
                    hyper-present protagonist were detective films, such as <cite class="title italic">Murder, My Sweet </cite>(1942), <cite class="title italic">On Dangerous
                        Ground</cite> (1952), and <cite class="title italic">8MM</cite> (1999). Our
                    analysis turned up other examples of films that were essentially detective
                    stories, even though the protagonist was not officially a detective, such as
                        <cite class="title italic">Across the Pacific</cite> (1942). And, in the case of
                        <cite class="title italic">The Siege</cite> (1998), our analysis allowed us to
                    more clearly see the film’s lead investigator character and detective structure,
                    even though the film was marketed on the basis of its action sequences and
                    premise (What if the U.S. responded to a terrorist attack by placing New York
                    City under martial law?). </div>

                  <div class="ptext" id="p45"> Interestingly, though, most of the hyper-present protagonist films we found did
                    not belong to the detective genre. Numerous dramas used the "closed story" and hyper-present protagonist technique to place the
                    audience firmly in the perspective of a main character and amplify the film’s
                    psychological intensity (examples include <cite class="title italic">Now
                        Voyager</cite> [1942], <cite class="title italic">Light Sleeper</cite> [1992],
                        <cite class="title italic">Pi</cite> [1998], and the previously mentioned <cite class="title italic">I Am a Fugitive from a Chain Gang</cite> [1932]). We also
                    found dramas that were "open stories" yet still
                    featured the protagonist in nearly every scene. To provide an example familiar
                    to many readers, the character of George Bailey in <cite class="title italic">It’s a
                        Wonderful Life</cite> (1946) appears in nearly every scene of the film.
                    When he goes absent, though, the audience learns vital information that creates
                    a sense of dramatic irony (for example, only the audience and Mr. Potter know
                    that Uncle Billy accidentally put the bank deposit in Potter’s lap). Moreover,
                    the first half of the film contains a great deal of voice-over narration that
                    provides information that George doesn’t know — not the least of which being
                    that angels in heaven are discussing his plight and reviewing his life. Yet the
                    film also pivots to a "closed" storytelling mode as we learn
                    dramatic news at the same as George, such as the stroke suffered by George’s
                    father or the community’s run on the bank. Our distant reading analysis of genre
                    helped us distinguish between the presence of a hyper-present protagonist and
                    the question of how a story conveys information. Additionally, the analysis
                    reveals how films can move much more fluidly between "open"
                    and "closed" modes than most screenwriting manuals would
                    suggest. </div>

                  <div class="ptext" id="p46"> If the detective genre is especially fertile ground for the hyper-present
                    protagonist, then are there other genres in which such a character is rarely
                    found? We have yet to find any occurrences in the romantic comedy or musical (a
                    genre that frequently sets a romantic comedy story to song). The romantic
                    comedy, by its nature, depends on multiple characters and obstacles to delay
                    their happy union until their end. These conflicts and obstacles are often
                    rooted in misunderstandings, which require the audience to know information that
                    one of the characters does not know. Beyond the romantic comedy, we found that
                    comedy screenplays, in general, almost never feature a hyper-present
                    protagonist. One explanation might be that writers depend on the protagonist’s
                    absence to create situations that serve as set-ups for the jokes later delivered
                    verbally or physically by the protagonist. The very title of <cite class="title italic">A Night at the Opera</cite> (1935), one of the comedy
                    screenplays in our dataset, is premised on the incongruity between the
                    high-class form of the opera and the low-class antics of its stars, the Marx
                    Brothers. Numerous sequences are structured to play up this incongruity — moving
                    between scenes in which the brothers are absent to set up our expectations,
                    followed by one or more of the brothers entering to disrupt the status quo and
                    deliver the joke. </div>

                    This outlier was the Jim Carrey comedy <cite class="title italic">Liar Liar</cite>
                    (1997), an example of what is known in contemporary Hollywood as “high concept”
                    (a movie with a story that can be distilled and marketed to audiences in 25
                    words or less). In the case of <cite class="title italic">Liar Liar</cite>, the high
                    concept is, "What if a hotshot lawyer could not tell a lie
                        for 24 hours due to his son’s birthday wish?" The premise enables
                    screenwriters Paul Guay and Stephen Mazur to generate nearly all the jokes with
                    the protagonist present. This comedy depends on incongruity, but it’s different
                    than the incongruity derived from placing the Marx Brothers at fancy restaurants
                    and the opera. Instead, the incongruity comes from the difference between
                    Fletcher’s (Jim Carrey’s) compulsive lying before his son’s wish and how he must
                    adapt after he can no longer tell a lie. This example demonstrates that a film’s
                    concept (and perhaps the desire of producers to fully capitalize on their highly
                    paid star) can override the pattern of character presence typical for a
                    particular genre. </div>

                    protagonist’s presence. Do some screenwriters have a tendency to write films
                    that focus on one protagonist and place that character in nearly every scene?
                    The answer, we found, was yes. As noted earlier, screenwriter Brown Holmes
                    co-wrote the two outliers we identified from the 1930s, <cite class="title italic">I
                        Am a Fugitive from a Chain Gang</cite> and <cite class="title italic">20,000

                    an especially important role in dramatically structuring and writing the two
                    films, despite working as a contract writer for Warner Bros. and sharing the
                    writing credit with co-authors on both screenplays. As we continue our research,
                    we plan to integrate ScripThreads with other modes of computational analysis and
                    examine more co-authored Warner Bros. screenplays from the 1930s and 40s. We
                    believe the result might offer a better sense of the individual contributions of
                    creative artists on the highly collaborative medium of film. We may find that
                    some writers contributed especially strongly to a film’s dialogue, while others,

                    that were either written or co-written by Paul Schrader, who is best known for
                    writing and directing dark, character-oriented dramas, such as <cite class="title italic">American Gigolo</cite> (1980) and <cite class="title italic">Affliction </cite>(1997), and writing some of the best films directed by

                  <div class="ptext" id="p51"> In some ways, <a href="#figure14">Figure 14</a> provides an illustration
                    for what film critics and scholars already assume about Schrader: he is a
                    filmmaker who writes character studies about men who are psychologically and/or
                    existentially anguished. <cite class="title italic">American Gigolo</cite> (1980),
                        <cite class="title italic">Light Sleeper</cite> (1992), and <cite class="title italic">Affliction</cite> (1997) are all films that Schrader wrote and directed
                    that fit this paradigm. Schrader calls his protagonists "existential
                        heroes" and, in a widely quoted interview with Garry Wills,
                    remarked, "all my life has been dedicated to the existential
                        hero, and the existential hero seems to have come to the end of his path,
                        replaced by the ironic hero"
                    [<a class="ref" href="#schrader2006">Schrader and Wills 2006</a>]. However, there is no inherent reason why an
                    existential hero needs to appear in nearly every single scene of a movie. As
                    noted earlier, Lawrence Kasdan’s <cite class="title italic">Grand Canyon </cite>keeps
                    its existential protagonist, Mack, absent for numerous scenes, even though he
                    appears in far more scenes than any other character. Similarly, the existential
                    heroes in films directed by Ingmar Bergman and Woody Allen generally exist
                    within an ensemble of characters. In Bergman and Allen films, the protagonist
                    will go absent to facilitate scenes focusing on supporting characters, who may
                    serve as foils to the existential hero, address the story’s major themes, and/or
                    advance the plot. There is a long history of this practice in literature, as
                    well. Tolstoy’s <cite class="title italic">Anna Karenina</cite> would have far less
                    to say about love, society, politics, and life’s meaning without the narrative
                    of Levin and Kitty playing out in parallel to Anna’s story. The ScripThreads’
                    increasing graph visualizations of Scharder’s work reveal that a defining
                    characteristic of Schrader’s existential hero is his hyper-presence. The
                    audience stays with the existential hero throughout the entire film. Ingmar
                    Bergman makes films that address the existential themes of Sartre and Camus, but
                    Schrader is the filmmaker who structures his narratives more similarly to their
                    novels — following the "closed story" model that
                    keeps the audience aligned with the protagonist’s point-of-view. </div>

                  <div class="ptext" id="p52"> Schrader’s best known screenplays follow the hyper-present, existential
                    protagonist model we have described. However, a more heterogeneous portrait of
                    Schrader as an author emerges when we examine his twelve unproduced screenplays
                    in the AFSO corpus. To be clear, these are screenplays written by Schrader that
                    were never made into films. <a href="#figure16">Figure 16</a> shows the
                    superimposed increasing graphs of these 12 screenplays. This group of
                    screenplays includes four hyper-present protagonist scripts: three
                    music-oriented biopics (<cite class="title italic">Dream Lover: The Bobby Darin
                        Story</cite>, <cite class="title italic">Eight Scenes from the Life of Hank
                        Williams</cite>, and <cite class="title italic">Gershwin</cite>); and one
                    detective film (<cite class="title italic">The Investigator</cite>), a genre that we
                    know is comparatively likely to have a hyper-present protagonist. What is more
                    surprising is that seven out of the twelve unproduced screenplays place the
                    protagonist in less than 80% of the script. And three screenplays make the
                    protagonist present in less than 70% (Schrader’s two produced outliers, <cite class="title italic">Obsession </cite>and <cite class="title italic">Blue
                    Collar</cite>, are both higher at 72% and 75% respectively). </div>

                    stories override a screenwriter’s established narrative techniques? Finally, how
                    do industrial and cultural assumptions about a particular screenwriter shape the
                    types of projects the writer is offered and that make it into production? By
                    examining Schrader’s unproduced works at a distance, we can speculate that
                    industry assumptions about what constitutes a "Paul Schrader
                        film" — namely, a dark, existential character study — may have
                    made studios and financiers more reluctant to produce screenplays by Schrader

                        Canyon</cite>) and analyzing a much larger group of screenplays to look for
                    a pattern. ScripThreads parses screenplays and extracts data about character
                    presence and interactions, then offers users statistical CSV files and a series
                    of 3D and 2D visualizations that present the data in a time-based manner. The
                    tool is not without its limitations. ScripThreads does not visualize act breaks,
                    shifts in spatial location, or a protagonist’s journey toward a particular goal.
                    Yet the data the tool offers can be quite telling. It can reveal details of
                    character presence and character co-occurrences that humans are prone to forget
                    or never remember in the first place. </div>

                    differences between the viewer’s perception and the computer’s visualizations is
                    a powerful starting point for uncovering storytelling techniques and better
                    understanding cognitive reception. In using ScripThreads to analyze a large
                    group of screenplays, the visualizations and CSV output files allow researchers
                    to recognize patterns without having prior knowledge of the films. To draw
                    accurate and meaningful conclusions, though, some domain expertise in film
                    history is essential (just as a researcher would want some knowledge of 19<span class="hi superscript">th</span>-century literature before making arguments about
                    the century based on topic modeling 100 Victorian novels). Whether applied
                    toward close ready or distant reading, ScripThreads is meant to help researchers
                    gain a richer understanding of the text or texts they are studying. This is a
                    tool to aid Humanities scholars in analysis and interpretation, not a substitute
                    for screenwriting and criticism. </div>

                  <div class="ptext" id="p57"> ScripThreads offers one additional affordance — the ability to quickly visualize
                    the narrative structure of an unproduced screenplay. Films and television
                    programs play out their stories visually in sequences of photographed and edited
                    action; a produced screenplay has already been visualized for the screen.
                    However, due to the difficulty and expense of making a film, the vast majority
                    of screenplays are never produced, never visualized in this fashion. The
                    increasing graphs of Schrader’s unproduced screenplays (<a href="#figure16">Figure 16</a>) provide what may be the first transformative
                    visualizations of these twelve works. The graphs allow us to quickly recognize
                    one way (the protagonist’s level of presence) that some of these stories differ
                    from Schrader’s better known screenplays. What if we could apply a similar
                    analysis to the screenplay libraries of Hollywood’s studios, producers, and
                    talent agencies? The results would yield not simply graphs of character
                    presences, co-occurrences, and absences, but transformative renderings of
                    thousands of stories that have remained absent from audiences. We would no
                    longer be visualizing American film history; we would be visualizing a history
                    that might have been.</div>
