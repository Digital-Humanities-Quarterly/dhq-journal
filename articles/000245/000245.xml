                <p> This paper presents a joint project of the Humboldt Chair of Digital Humanities
                    at the University of Leipzig, the Perseus Digital Library at Tufts University,
                    and the Harvard Center for Hellenic Studies to produce a new open series of
                    Greek and Latin fragmentary authors. Such authors are lost and their works are
                    preserved only thorugh quotations and text reuses by later texts. The project is
                    undertaking two tasks: 1) the digitization of paper editions of fragmentary
                    works linking them to the source texts from which the fragments have been
                    excerpted; 2) the production of born-digital editions of fragmentary works. The
                    ultimate goals are the creation of open, linked, machine-actionable texts for
                    the study and advancement of the Classical textual fragmentary heritage and the
                    development of a collaborative environment for crowdsourced annotations.</p>

            <p>The <title rend="italic">Leipzig Open Fragmentary Texts Series</title> (LOFTS) is a
                new effort within the Open Philology Project of the Alexander von Humboldt Chair of
                Digital Humanities at the University of Leipzig.<note>
                    <ref target="http://www.dh.uni-leipzig.de/wo/lofts/"
                        >http://www.dh.uni-leipzig.de/wo/lofts/</ref></note> The project is
                developed in collaboration with the Perseus Digital Library at Tufts University and
                Harvard’s Center for Hellenic Studies. The goal of LOFTS is to establish open
                editions of classical works that survive only through quotations and text reuses in
                later texts. The project is undertaking two tasks: digitize paper editions of
                fragmentary works and link them to the source texts from which the fragments have
                been collected, and produce new digital editions of fragmentary works. LOFTS has
                four interconnected subprojects: 1) a fragmentary texts editor within the Perseids
                platform, 2) the <title rend="italic">Digital Fragmenta Historicorum
                    Graecorum</title> (DFHG), 3) the <title rend="italic">Digital Athenaeus</title>,
                and 4) the <title rend="italic">Digital Marmor Parium</title>. </p>

                <head>The Leipzig Open Fragmentary Texts Series (LOFTS)</head>
                <p>In the field of textual evidence, fragments are not portions of an original
                    larger whole, but the result of a work of interpretation conducted by scholars
                    who extract and collect information pertaining to lost works embedded in other
                    surviving texts. These fragments include a great variety of formats that range
                    from verbatim quotations to vague allusions and translations, which are only a
                    more or less shadowy image of the original according to their closer or further
                    distance from a literal citation <ptr target="#berti2012"/>
                    <ptr target="#berti2013"/>.</p>
                <p>Print editions of fragmentary works include excerpts extracted from their
                    contexts and from the textual data about those contexts. The result is that they
                    produce annotated indices in the sources that they cite.<note> For an overview
                        on characteristics, advantages, and limits of print editions of fragmentary
                        authors, see <ref target="http://demo.fragmentarytexts.org/en/istros.html"
                            >http://demo.fragmentarytexts.org/en/istros.html</ref> (with examples
                        from <ptr target="#berti2009a"/>.</note> Moreover, editions of fragmentary
                    works are fundamentally hypertexts and the goal of this project is to produce a
                    dynamic infrastructure for a full representation of relationships between
                    sources, citations, and annotations about them. In a true digital edition,
                    fragments are not only linked directly to the source text from which they are
                    drawn, but can also be precisely aligned to multiple editions <ptr
                        target="#berti2009b"/>. Accordingly, digital fragments are contextualized
                    annotations about reused authors and works <ptr target="#almas-berti2013"/>
                    <ptr target="#berti2014"/>. As new versions of (or scholarship on) the source
                    text emerge in a standard, machine-actionable form, these new findings are
                    automatically linked to the digital fragments.</p>
                <p>LOFTS has two main goals: 1) digitize paper editions of fragmentary works and
                    link them to source texts; 2) produce new digital editions of fragmentary
                    authors. In order to achieve these goals, LOFTS editions primarily consist of:
                        <list type="unordered">
                        <item>TEI XML versions of paper editions of fragmentary works. The project
                            is currently encoding the five volumes of the <title rend="italic"
                                >Fragmenta Historicorum Graecorum</title> by Karl Müller (1841-1870)
                            and has been developing guidelines for marking up the text (see
                            below).</item>
                        <item>Dynamic excerpts from source texts. Digitized paper editions of
                            fragmentary works are linked to the source texts that they cite and
                            their metadata are annotated in the source texts. At the same time, when
                            producing a new digital edition, quotations and text reuses are directly
                            annotated in the source text in which they are preserved. In both cases,
                            the result is the production of dynamic excerpts that can be extracted
                            from source texts, thus allowing multiple searches and the creation of
                            many different types of collections of fragmentary texts (by author,
                            work, topic, etc.).</item>
                        <item>Multiple alignments with multiple editions. Digitized paper editions
                            of fragmentary works are aligned with the source editions they use and
                            with other editions of the same source texts.</item>
                        <item>Contextualized annotations about fragmentary authors and works. LOFTS
                            editors of fragments directly annotate the source texts. These
                            annotations mark all those elements of the source text that reveal the
                            presence of a quotation or reuse of another text (e.g., names of
                            fragmentary authors, titles or descriptions of the content of
                            fragmentary works, <foreign xml:lang="la">verba dicendi</foreign>,
                            etc.).</item>
                        <item>Standard textual annotations. These include not only variants in the
                            source text but also morpho-syntactic analyses and named entities. Where
                            these annotations are not already available for the source text, the
                            fragmentary text provides them for the sections that it cites. Where
                            these are available, the fragmentary text may suggest alternate
                            interpretations (e.g., selecting a different reading, an alternate
                            morpho-syntactic analysis or prosopographic judgment).</item>
                        <item>Syntactic reuse analysis. Text reuse works not only at a word level,
                            but also at a syntactic one, because reusing a text means not only
                            quoting and readapting words in a new context, but also reproducing
                            syntactic features. Treebank grammar techniques are used to annotate the
                            syntactic structure of sources that preserve quotations of lost texts in
                            order to detect possible syntactic reuses.<note> On the Ancient Greek
                                and Latin Dependency Treebank 2.0, see <ref
                                    target="http://www.dh.uni-leipzig.de/wo/projects/ancient-greek-and-latin-dependency-treebank-2-0/"

                        <item>Alignments with extant sources. Where one work quotes another existing
                            work (e.g., Athenaeus quoting Homer), word-level alignments between the
                            two sources are provided. Such alignments check reliability and
                            precision of quotations produced by ancient authors. This model assumes
                            also that a work that paraphrases, cites or quotes an existing work may
                            preserve independent and superior data not available in the transmission
                            of the quoted work. Arabic translations of Greek authors, for example,
                            can depend, and shed light, upon lost versions of Greek surviving
                            texts.</item>
                        <item>Metadata on each word that is, or is judged to be, either a direct

                        <item>Translations of lost works. Where a text only survives because it has
                            been translated into another language (e.g., a Greek text translated
                            into Arabic) and where we have comparable translations (e.g., other
                            Greek texts by the same author translated into Arabic), we use the
                            translations of the surviving works to show what original words could
                            lie behind the translation of the lost text. Syntactic annotations may
                            also help reconstruct the syntax of the original lost text, as it
                            happens in Arabic and Syriac sources that preserve the syntax of the
                            original Greek text.<note> An interesting example is offered by the
                                Syriac collection of the so called laments of the philosophers at
                                the tomb of Alexander. In this case the Greek text is lost, but the
                                Syriac translation still preserves the Greek syntax of the original
                                text <ptr target="#brock1970"/>. Monica Berti and Ute Pietruschka
                                have been working on the Syriac text producing syntactic annotations
                                of the laments and trying to reconstruct the Greek original text. A

                            </note> OGL aims to provide (1) a TEI XML transcript of the
                            reconstructed text, (2) a transcript of the textual notes with minimal
                            TEI encoding, and (3) a page image of the original source text. All OGL
                            texts are designed to be available as Linked Open Data, with CTS/CITE

                        <item>Reconstructed texts that are in the public domain. German copyright
                            law protects scholarly editions for 25 years after publication. The
                            European Union recommended copyright protection of up to 30 years for
                            scholarly editions. The argument has been made, however, that this
                            limited copyright covers only the reconstructed text and that ancillary
                            materials (such as textual notes on the bottom of the page) are distinct
                            creative works protected by the life of the author + 70 year rule. In
                            this case, OGL aims to provide (1) a TEI XML transcript of the
                            reconstructed text, (2) an index of the variants cited on any given page
                            of an edition (but not the textual notes themselves), (3) an image of

                            the textual notes or other elements that are claimed not to fall under

                            that are open. The index allows readers to assess how, how often and
                            where restricted texts differ from open texts. The index includes both
                            editorial choices in the reconstructed texts and variants in the textual
                            notes. The model in this case would be extensive reviews of new editions
                            that set out to list their distinct editorial choices.</item>
                    </list></p>
                <p>Where OGL has not yet provided the necessary textual data, LOFTS editors will
                    provide the textual data that they feel is necessary. In practice, this may lead
                    to editions that look, in sections, very much like traditional editions of
                    fragmentary authors. The excerpts that LOFTS editors create are available as
                    open data and as part of an extensible authoring environment, where others can
                    extend the LOFTS beginning and develop comprehensive coverage for works or

                    In developing features of the Perseids Platform to support encoding of text
                    reuses and lost authors, we are focusing first and foremost on the data. We
                    expect that techniques for visually representing digital editions will change
                    rapidly with technology. So, while our work includes demonstration presentation
                    formats, our first priority is to enable scholars to create data about the
                    authors, texts and related commentaries, annotations, links, translations, etc.
                    in a way that encourages and facilitates its preservation and reuse. To this
                    end, we have identified the following core data requirements: <list
                        type="unordered">
                        <item>The ability to represent the texts themselves, links between them, and

                <head>2. Digital Fragmenta Historicorum Graecorum (DFHG)</head>
                <p>As a first step within LOFTS, the Humboldt Chair of Digital Humanities at the
                    University of Leipzig is developing the <title rend="italic">Digital Fragmenta
                        Historicorum Graecorum</title> (DFHG) Project, whose goal is to create a
                    digital edition of the five volumes of Karl Müller’s <title rend="italic"
                        >Fragmenta Historicorum Graecorum</title> (FHG) (1841-1870).<note>
                        <ref target="http://www.dh.uni-leipzig.de/wo/dfhg/"

                    </note></p>
                <p>Karl Müller’s FHG consists of a survey of excerpts from many different sources
                    pertaining to more than 600 fragmentary authors. Excluding the first volume,
                    these authors are chronologically distributed and cover a very long period (from
                    the 6th century BC down to the 7th century CE). Fragments are numbered
                    sequentially and arranged according to works and book numbers (when such
                    information is available). Every fragment is translated into Latin. The first
                    volume includes also the text of the <title rend="italic">Marmor Parium</title>
                    – with Latin translation, chronological table, and commentary – and the Greek
                    text of the Rosetta Stone (<title rend="italic">Rosettanum</title>) – with a
                    French literal translation as well as a critical, historical and archaeological
                    commentary. The fifth volume includes a section with fragments of Greek and
                    Syriac historians preserved in Armenian sources (in French translation).</p>
                <p>While produced two centuries ago and superseded by the monumental edition of
                    Felix Jacoby (<title rend="italic">Die Fragmente der griechischen
                        Historiker</title>), Müller’s FHG is still a fundamental contribution to
                    Greek fragmentary historiography.<note> On the collection edited by Felix
                        Jacoby, see <ref

                    In particular, it is very suitable for providing rapid, broad coverage and an
                    extensive foundation upon which a new generation of born-digital editions of
                    fragmentary texts can build.</p>
                <p>Müller’s five volumes have been transcribed into a simple text format and are
                    being converted into a TEI XML edition, where the excerpts become
                    machine-actionable quotations that can be automatically aligned not only to the
                    original source editions from which Müller drew but also to any other open
                    editions.</p>
                <p>As part of LOFTS, the DFHG Project uses the EpiDoc subset of the Text Encoding
                    Initiative as its XML tagset. The original pages of Müller’s FHG will be
                    displayed to visualize the original layout. Digital Edition Guidelines (1.0) are
                    publicly available and are contributing to the development of the guidelines of
                    the EpiDoc community.<note> The link is available at <ref

                <p>A catalog of all the fragmentary authors edited by Müller is being provided with
                    Perseus Catalog Record Canonical URIs and detailed information about the

                <head>3. Digital Athenaeus</head>
                <p>The <title rend="italic">Digital Athenaeus</title> project is producing a digital
                    edition of the <title rend="italic">Deipnosophists</title> of Athenaeus of
                    Naucratis with multiple versions of the work and translations in multiple languages.<note>
                        <ref target="http://www.dh.uni-leipzig.de/wo/digital-athenaeus/"
                            >http://www.dh.uni-leipzig.de/wo/digital-athenaeus/</ref></note></p>
                <p>The <title rend="italic">Deipnosophists</title> (Δειπνοσοφισταί, or <title
                        rend="italic">Sophists at Dinner</title>, in fifteen books), written by
                    Athenaeus of Naucratis in the early 3rd century CE, is the fictitious account of
                    several banquet conversations on food, literature, and arts held in Rome by
                    twenty-two learned men. This complex and fascinating work is not only an erudite
                    and literary encyclopedia of a myriad of curiosities about classical antiquity,
                    but also an invaluable collection of quotations of ancient authors, ranging from
                    Homer to tragic and comic poets and lost historians. Since the large majority of
                    the works cited by Athenaeus is lost, this compilation can be considered a
                    reference tool for scholars of Greek theater, poetry, historiography, botany,
                    zoology, and many other disciplines.</p>
                <p>Despite the importance of the <title rend="italic">Deipnosophists</title>, we
                    still lack a comprehensive survey of Athenaeus’ citations, and many classicists
                    have expressed the need for such a resource <ptr target="#zecchini1989"/>
                    <ptr target="#braund-wilkins2000"/>
                    <ptr target="#canfora2001"/>
                    <ptr target="#lenfant2007"/>
                    <ptr target="#jacob2013"/>. The results of this investigation will not only
                    allow us to better understand the modes of transmission of ancient literature at
                    the time of Athenaeus, but also to generate a comprehensive list of authors and
                    works mentioned by him, concurrently drawing a complete collection of citation
                    schemes adopted in the stratified and multiform architecture of the <title
                        rend="italic">Deipnosophists</title>.</p>
                <p>The primary goal of this project is to analyze the quotations of the learned
                    banqueters with a twofold purpose: 1) provide an inventory of all authors and
                    works cited in the <title rend="italic">Deipnosophists</title>; 2) build a
                    repository of quotation schemes used by Athenaeus when alluding to his sources
                    of information. To this end, the first step of the project is to edit and
                    annotate the TEI XML version of the <title rend="italic">Deipnosophists</title>
                    already available in the Perseus Digital Library (ed. Kaibel).</p>
                <p>Given that the <title rend="italic">Deipnosophists</title> is a gold mine of
                    citations (the exact number remains uncertain), the secondary aim of this
                    project is to provide a case study for drawing a spectrum of quoting habits of
                    classical authors and  their attitude to text reuse <ptr target="#olson2006"/>.
                    Athenaeus, in fact, shapes a library of forgotten authors, which goes beyond the
                    limits of a physical building and becomes an intellectual space of human
                    knowledge. By doing so, he is both a witness of the Hellenistic bibliographical
                    methods and a forerunner of the modern concept of hypertext, where sequential
                    reading is substituted by hierarchical and logical connections among words and
                    fragments of texts <ptr target="#genette1997"/>
                    <ptr target="#landow1997"/>
                    <ptr target="#bolter2001"/>.</p>
                <p>The quantity, variety, and precision of Athenaeus’ citations make the <title
                        rend="italic">Deipnosophists</title> an excellent training ground for the
                    development of a digital system of reference linking for primary sources. In
                    this sense, this project is consistent with the work that is currently being
                    developed by the CTS/CITE Architecture, which proposes a machine-actionable but
                    technologically independent notation for citing texts <ptr target="#smith2009"/>
                    <ptr target="#smith-blackwell2012"/>
                    <ptr target="#tiepmar2014"/>. In particular, the project is experimenting with
                    the development of citable analyses for the annotation of quotations and text
                    reuses in the text of Athenaeus using the CTS/CITE Architecture. A first set of
                    citable analyses has been conducted on Homeric reuses in the <title
                        rend="italic">Deipnosophists</title> in collaboration with scholars and
                    students at Furman University.<note> See <ref
                            target="http://digitalathenaeus.github.io/"
                            >http://digitalathenaeus.github.io/</ref>. Citable analyses of the text
                        of Athenaeus are collected in the GitHub repository of the project: <ref
                            target="https://github.com/DigitalAthenaeus"
                            >https://github.com/DigitalAthenaeus</ref>.</note></p>
                <p>Athenaeus’ standard citation includes (a) the name of the author with additional
                    information like ethnic origin and literary category, (b) the title of the work,
                    and (c) the book number (e.g, <title rend="italic">Deipn</title>. 2.71b). He
                    often remembers the number of papyrus scrolls of monumental works (e.g.,
                    6.229d-e; 6.249a), while distinguishing various editions of the same comedy
                    (e.g., 1.29a; 4.171c; 6.247c; 7.299b; 9.367f) and different titles of the same
                    work (e.g., 1.4e). He also adds biographical information to identify homonymous
                    authors and to classify them according to literary genres, intellectual
                    disciplines as well as schools (e.g., 1.13b; 6.234f; 9.387b). He provides
                    chronological and historical pointers, which help to date authors (e.g.,
                    10.453c; 13.599c), and he often copies the first lines of a work following a
                    method that probably dates back to the <title rend="italic">Pinakes</title> of
                    Callimachus (e.g., 1.4e; 3.85f; 8.342d; 5.209f; 13.573f-574a).</p>
                <p>Last but not least, the study of Athenaeus’ <soCalled>citation system</soCalled>
                    is also a great methodological contribution to the domain of fragmentary
                    literature, since one of the main concerns in this field is the relation between
                    the fragment and its context of transmission. With this goal in mind, the
                    textual analysis of the <title rend="italic">Deipnosophists</title> will make it
                    possible to enumerate a series of recurring patterns, including a wide typology
                    of textual reproductions and linguistic features, which are instrumental to the
                    identification and classification of hidden quotations of lost authors.</p>
                <p>The work on the <title rend="italic">Digital Athenaeus</title> is therefore

                    document is due to the fact that it preserves a Greek chronology (1581/80-299/98
                    BC) with a list of kings and archons accompanied by short references to
                    historical events mainly based on the Athenian history. The project team is
                    producing a new XML edition of the text according to the EpiDoc Guidelines, is
                    encoding all the named entities mentioned in the inscription, including the
                    place names, and is producing a timeline visualization of the chronological
                    information preserved on the stone <ptr target="#berti-stoyanova2014"/>.</p>
                <p>The <title rend="italic">Marmor Parium</title> is the earliest example of this
                    kind of document and it is a very valuable piece of evidence under many
                    respects. It is not only a chronological record of Greek history, but it is also
                    the result of a selection of events made by its compiler, whose name is
                    unfortunately lost (ll. 1-3). The importance of the text from a
                    historiographical point of view is shown by the fact that the document is part
                    of the <title rend="italic">Fragmenta Historicorum Graecorum</title> by Karl
                    Müller (<title rend="italic">FHG</title> 1, 533-590) and of <title rend="italic"
                        >Die Fragmente der Griechischen Historiker</title> by Felix Jacoby (<title
                        rend="italic">FGrHist</title> 239; Jacoby, 1904). In this sense, this
                    evidence is a perfect example of a fragmentary author whose work is not
                    preserved through quotations in later texts, but in a fragmented original form.
                    Accordingly, the <title rend="italic">Digital Marmor Parium</title> is part of
                        the <title rend="italic">Digital Fragmenta Historicorum Graecorum</title>
                    (DFHG) project developed by the Humboldt Chair of Digital Humanities at the
                    University of Leipzig.</p>

                <head>Conclusion</head>
                <p>LOFTS aims not only at producing an open series of Greek and Latin fragmentary
                    authors, but also at building a new model for representing quotations and text
                    reuses of lost works in a digital world <ptr target="#berti2014"/>. The ultimate
                    goal is to produce dynamic excerpts from source texts and build an environment
                    where fragments become multi-layered annotations of information concerning
                    fragmentary authors and reuses of their lost works. These dynamic excerpts
                    contribute to the production of a real multitext, where each version of the same
                    text embodies a different step in its transmission and a reconstruction of
                    philological conjectures <ptr target="#blackwell-crane2009"/>, and to the
                    development of a collaborative environment for crowdsourced annotations that
                    involve both scholars and students.</p>
