                  <p>The project Untangling the cordel (2020-2024) aims at studying and promoting a collection
                     					of 19th-century Spanish chapbooks via a digital library (DL). This resource is
                     composed of
                     					digital scholarly editions of chapbooks and of a catalogue of woodcuts, which
                     decorate the
                     					first page of almost all the documents. In this paper, after presenting the project’s
                     					editorial workflow, we focus our attention of the way we design the interface
                     of this DL
                     					to represent the different facets of chapbooks (document, text and illustrations).
                     For
                     					that, we have chosen to follow a method, proposed by Andrews and van Zundert
                     in 2018, that
                     					consider an interface as an argument editors made about their data and their
                     digital
                     					editions. Through this case study, we demonstrate the feasibility of this approach,
                     where
                     					each component of an interface contributes to the scientific discourse a project
                     made
                     					about its goals and its perception of digital editing. We also stress the impact
                     of this
                     					method on user experience and on a project itself, as another way to see data
                     and their
                     					modelling. </p>

                     <div class="ptext" id="p1">In a recent article, Claire Warwick compares digital interfaces of digital humanities
                        						(DH) projects to dust jackets of books or to picture frames, i.e. functional
                        objects
                        						that can be easily discarded in the first case, or that we cease to see in the
                        second
                        						case, as they fade behind the picture they are framing [<a class="ref" href="#warwick2020">Warwick 2020</a>, 944]. The same can be said about digital interfaces. They are so present that
                        						they become transparent to users. They appear as a decorative and convenient
                        support
                        						for data, but are not considered as a topic for research. Yet, interfaces say
                        						something about the data they present, and how the project perceives them. They
                        “dictat[e] not only how a digital resource looks but also how it works,
                        						and how information may be accessed and comprehended by users” [<a class="ref" href="#warwick2020">Warwick 2020</a>, 964]. For these reasons, Warwick calls to take into consideration interface
                        						design during the analysis of a project and to preserve the different versions
                        of an
                        						interface. Indeed, interfaces attest of the intentions and the context of creation
                        of
                        						a project over time, just as dust jackets contain valuable information about
                        						commercial strategies, or readers’ tastes at different time. Therefore, we must
                        “look at the interface, not simply through it” [<a class="ref" href="#warwick2020">Warwick 2020</a>, 964] <span class="hi italic">ibid.</span>).</div>

                     <div class="ptext" id="p3">Two important facts appear here. Firstly, each interface communicates with its users
                        						through a set of colours, signs, and symbols, that forms a “semiotic environment” [<a class="ref" href="#andrews_zundert2018">Andrews and  Zundert 2018</a>, 11]. Secondly, interfaces are not neutral. Even if they seem
                        						transparent and opaque to the users, they are nonetheless a rhetoric discourse
                        about
                        						the data. They are also dependent on their context of creation, and of the background
                        						of their designers, whether it is cultural, identitary, scientific, or political.
                        They
                        						are “means of communication of scholarly arguments” [<a class="ref" href="#andrews_zundert2018">Andrews and  Zundert 2018</a>, 30], that must be considered by their makers. Thus, their study
                        						and long-term preservation matter to understand not only the position of a project
                        						towards its data and field of research, but also what strategies projects have
                        adopted
                        						over time [<a class="ref" href="#warwick2020">Warwick 2020</a>, 968]. Therefore, an interface is not just a nice-looking box. Its design must be
                        						seen as a heuristic process that represents a theoretical model, as well as
                        a central
                        						step in the life of a project.</div>

                     <div class="ptext" id="p4">In this paper, we propose an application of these considerations about interface design
                        						as an argument and a witness of projects’ intentions, with a case study: the

                        library

                        						low-quality paper and sold in the streets by peddlers, for a modest sum. In

                        						attention on chapbooks as documents rather than on texts or on illustrations,

                        						an interface, i.e. if it follows ergonomic criteria and offers a suitable user
                        						experience, which indicates a good understanding of its users’ needs from a
                        project [<a class="ref" href="#andrews_zundert2018">Andrews and  Zundert 2018</a>, 28]. The second level is a <em class="emph">conceptual level</em>, which offers a
                        						discourse about DSE itself. For instance, some projects might choose to put
                        texts
                        						first and provide reading editions, with few functionalities to explore them.
                        In
                        						contrast, other projects might prefer DSEs that look like toolboxes, with numerous
                        						services to interact with texts [<a class="ref" href="#andrews_zundert2018">Andrews and  Zundert 2018</a>, 29]. In both cases, projects will say something about their
                        						conception of DSEs as interfaces. Finally, the third one is <em class="emph">a data level,</em> which
                        						“pertains to what the edition conveys about its specific text” and the way editors
                        						interpret it [<a class="ref" href="#andrews_zundert2018">Andrews and  Zundert 2018</a>, 29]. These levels have originally been thought for DSEs, but
                        						they can be transposed to the context of a DL.</div>

                     <div class="ptext" id="p16">It is not always easy to make a distinction between a DSE and a DL. We could say that
                        a
                        						DL is dedicated to “digitized editions” [<a class="ref" href="#sahle2016">Sahle, 2016</a>, 27] and to the modelling of an object, whereas a DSE is focused on a work and
                        						expresses a specific point of view about it [<a class="ref" href="#pierazzo2015">Pierazzo 2015</a>, 45]. However, in our context, we decided to consider the project as a DL. Even
                        						if we offer DSEs of each chapbook, this is not the only component of our project.
                        						Indeed, the catalogue of woodcuts is not a side functionality that complements
                        the
                        						editions, but an essential element of our project, which then cannot be seen

                        						a DSE. With these different types of data, we could refer to our project as
                        a hub or a
                        						portal. Yet, we found these terms less convenient, as they are typically used
                        to name
                        						data aggregators. Besides, as our project is based on the content of the University
                        						Library of Geneva, it seems more consistent to us to refer to the project as

                           							narrowed by brands, colours, sizes, prices, etc. But it has also been demonstrated
                           							that facets can reproduce the practices of today’s readers in physical libraries.
                           							Indeed, when readers look for a specific book in a library, they will often
                           look
                           							at the other books on the surrounding shelves. This phenomenon has been called
                           the
                           							“neighbour effect” [<a class="ref" href="#mckay_etal2014">Mckay et. al 2014</a>]; [<a class="ref" href="#mckay_etal2015">Mckay et. al 2015</a>]. It encourages the
                           							discovery of unexpected books, also known as serendipity, which can be about
                           							subjects other that the ones readers were looking for in the first place. In
                           a DL,
                           							filters can play the role of a physical library’s shelves by suggesting users

                           							of its first page (Figure 1). This information is extracted from the XML-TEI
                           files

                           							specificities. First, woodcuts can help dating chapbooks, by observing traces
                           of
                           							degradation from one woodcut to another, or by looking at the date of printing
                           of
                           							the chapbooks, where there is one. Therefore, for the chapbook from which the
                           							woodcut has been extracted, and for the similar woodcuts, we add the date of
                           							printing. At first glance, users can make a hypothesis about the period during
                           							which a specific woodcut has been used. Then, by comparing the similar items,
                           they
                           							might be able to narrow this hypothesis. For that, users can click on the button
                           							“Compare”, that opens a new window with an implementation of the image comparison
                           							application VDIFF<a class="noteRef" href="#d4e759">[14]</a>. It provides an interface to compare the differences between two
                           							images through different visualizations (image superposition, side-by-side

                           and
                           							of the subjects with which an illustration is most often used. For instance,
                           in
                           							our example (Figure 5), the illustration of this woman is associated with stories
                           							about royal families. Considering the type of text, it is mostly used with
                           <span class="hi italic">romances</span> <a class="noteRef" href="#d4e770">[15]</a>, a very popular

                        <div class="ptext" id="p35">The presence of the title of the originator chapbook is also a way to stress the
                           							link between text and images. Indeed, as we explained previously, the first
                           thing
                           							bystanders saw on chapbooks kiosks was the first page, and with it the
                           							illustrations. But the first thing they heard and their first contact with
                           the
                           							content were titles, as peddlers were declaiming them in the streets [<a class="ref" href="#catedra2002">Cátedra 2002</a>]; [<a class="ref" href="#castellano2016">Castellano 2016</a>]. Then, by putting these two pieces of information side by
                           							side, the interface stresses the close connection that exists between
                           							illustrations and titles, which form a semantic block. It is a valued information
                           							to understand chapbooks and the way they were conceived by printers.</div>

                        <div class="ptext" id="p36">Finally, users have the possibility to navigate from the notice of a woodcut to the
                           							edition of the text, and vice versa. By looking at the whole chapbook, they
                           can
                           							study the position of an illustration on the page, as well as the possible
                           other
                           							illustrations it is used with to form a scene. If we go back to our example,
                           in
                           							our corpus, this lady is always used on the front page with woodcuts representing

                           							of these other illustrations (Figure 4)<a class="noteRef" href="#d4e798">[16]</a>.</div>

                           							look at the representation of specific patterns, or to study woodcut techniques

                        						of <span class="hi italic">DiScholEd</span> argues for a hub that contains several DSEs of

                        that,
                        						regarding the presentation of the documents, each project has adopted different
                        						perspectives. While, as we saw previously, <span class="hi italic">Untangling the
                           						cordel</span> offers reading editions, <span class="hi italic">Antonomaz</span> chooses to

                     <div class="ptext" id="p40">These different representations of DSEs are possible because of the way <span class="hi italic">TEI-Publisher</span> works. Indeed, one of key-concepts of this software
                        						is the one of web-components<a class="noteRef" href="#d4e894">[17]</a>. They can be considered as blocks, each one
                        						corresponding to a functionality. For example, there is a web-component for
                        displaying
                        						facsimiles, another for creating a map, and another for adding a simple search
                        						bar<a class="noteRef" href="#d4e896">[18]</a>. These blocks can be combined with each other to build an
                        						interface: even if they share a common look, the way they are laid out on a
                        page is
                        						specific to each project. Like TEI, <span class="hi italic">TEI-Publisher</span> is a modular
                        						and flexible tool that allows editors and designers to represent a DSE in different
                        						ways. It provides a framework to help them make their own “rhetorical argument”
                        						(Andrews and van Zundert 2018, 8) about their data and their conception of a
                        DL and
                        						DSEs.</div>

                     <div class="ptext" id="p41">Finally, our experience with <span class="hi italic">TEI-Publisher</span> leads us to consider
                        						that it does not only influence the design of our website, but also our data
                        model.
                        						Usually, a clear distinction is made between content and its form
                        						(Andrews
                        						and van Zundert 2018, 8): when we work with XML, we start by examining the meaning
                        of
                        						the data, then think about their visualisation with scripts and stylesheets.
                        However,
                        						in this case, some of our editing choices have been determined by the way the
                        tool
                        						functions. For instance, the way we display facsimiles does not follow the
                        						prescriptions made by the XML-TEI community but simplifies them.</div>

                        a
                        						DSE. On one hand, the interface argues that our DL follows the model of a physical
                        						library. It reuses concepts and practices common to analogue libraries, such
                        as the
                        						way users select their books, and can thus be perceived as their extension.
                        On the
                        						other hand, it argues that our DSEs are reading editions, favourable to a “solitary

                        						(Andrews

                        Spanish
                        						chapbooks. By offering various levels of analysis, it allows to study components
