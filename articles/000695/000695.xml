            <p>The project Untangling the cordel (2020-2024) aims at studying and promoting a
               collection of 19th-century Spanish chapbooks via a digital library (DL). This
               resource is composed of digital scholarly editions of chapbooks and of a catalogue of
               woodcuts, which decorate the first page of almost all the documents. In this paper,
               after presenting the project’s editorial workflow, we focus our attention of the way
               we design the interface of this DL to represent the different facets of chapbooks
               (document, text and illustrations). For that, we have chosen to follow a method,
               proposed by Andrews and van Zundert in 2018, that consider an interface as an
               argument editors made about their data and their digital editions. Through this case
               study, we demonstrate the feasibility of this approach, where each component of an
               interface contributes to the scientific discourse a project made about its goals and
               its perception of digital editing. We also stress the impact of this method on user
               experience and on a project itself, as another way to see data and their modelling.

               <p>In a recent article, Claire Warwick compares digital interfaces of digital
                  humanities (DH) projects to dust jackets of books or to picture frames, i.e.
                  functional objects that can be easily discarded in the first case, or that we
                  cease to see in the second case, as they fade behind the picture they are framing

                  2020, 944). The same can be said about digital interfaces. They are so present
                  that they become transparent to users. They appear as a decorative and convenient
                  support for data, but are not considered as a topic for research. Yet, interfaces
                  say something about the data they present, and how the project perceives them.
                  They <quote rend="inline">dictat[e] not only how a digital resource looks but also

                  2020, 946). For these reasons, Warwick calls to take into consideration interface
                  design during the analysis of a project and to preserve the different versions of
                  an interface. Indeed, interfaces attest of the intentions and the context of
                  creation of a project over time, just as dust jackets contain valuable information
                  about commercial strategies, or readers’ tastes at different time. Therefore, we
                  must <quote rend="inline">look at the interface, not simply through it</quote>
                     (<hi rend="italic">ibid.</hi>).</p>
               <p>These considerations echo the ones made by Ruecker and Galey in 2010, or by
                  Andrews and van Zundert in 2018, about interfaces of digital scholarly editions
                  (DSE). In their respective papers, they consider interfaces as an argument a
                  project makes about its edition.</p>
               <quote rend="block">User interfaces are […] a language through which arguments are
                  made, even when the makers of these interfaces are not conscious of the language
                  they are using. As such, they reflect the interpretations of the materials they
                  are supposed to represent as well as the culture, the politics, and the motives of
                  their designers.

               <p>Two important facts appear here. Firstly, each interface communicates with its

                  and van Zundert 2018, 11). Secondly, interfaces are not neutral. Even if they seem
                  transparent and opaque to the users, they are nonetheless a rhetoric discourse
                  about the data. They are also dependent on their context of creation, and of the
                  background of their designers, whether it is cultural, identitary, scientific, or
                  political. They are <quote rend="inline">means of communication of scholarly

                  study and long-term preservation matter to understand not only the position of a
                  project towards its data and field of research, but also what strategies projects
                  have adopted over time
                  <?biblio ADDIN ZOTERO_ITEM CSL_CITATION {"citationID":"yAWsAhBR","properties":{"formattedCitation":"(Warwick 2020, 968)","plainCitation":"(Warwick 2020, 968)","noteIndex":0},"citationItems":[{"id":1071,"uris":["http://zotero.org/users/2779164/items/56W9W8I8"],"itemData":{"id":1071,"type":"article-journal","container-title":"Digital Scholarship in the Humanities","DOI":"10.1093/llc/fqz081","ISSN":"2055-7671, 2055-768X","issue":"4","language":"en","page":"944-971","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Interfaces, ephemera, and identity: A study of the historical presentation of digital humanities resources","title-short":"Interfaces, ephemera, and identity","volume":"35","author":[{"family":"Warwick","given":"Claire"}],"issued":{"date-parts":[["2020"]]}},"locator":"968","label":"page"}],"schema":"https://github.com/citation-style-language/schema/raw/master/csl-citation.json"}?>(Warwick
                  2020, 968). Therefore, an interface is not just a nice-looking box. Its design
                  must be seen as a heuristic process that represents a theoretical model, as well
                  as a central step in the life of a project.</p>
               <p>In this paper, we propose an application of these considerations about interface
                  design as an argument and a witness of projects’ intentions, with a case study:

                  interface and the scholarly arguments behind our design choices with different
                  examples of pages. Through this case study, in turn, we would like to stress the
                  importance of taking the interfaces into account in the scientific discourse of a
                  project. We also aim to demonstrate the feasibility of this approach, as well as

                  still published in some Ibero-American countries such as Brazil. These documents
                  were printed in mass on a low-quality paper and sold in the streets by peddlers,
                  for a modest sum. In verse or prose, they relate fictitious stories and real
                  events, share songs, poems and plays, or copy prayers and other religious
                  writings, amongst other contents

               <p>Chapbooks are complex documents. They are both written and oral, constant in their
                  appearance but heterogeneous in their content, and at the frontier between popular
                  and scholarly literature, between books and archives

               <p>However, over the last decades, with a renewed interest for this peddler
                  literature and the emergence of digital tools, several projects have been launched
                  to highlight this type of documents. Spanish chapbooks can not only be found among
                  the larger collections of national or academic digital libraries<note> We can name
                     the Cambridge University Digital Library (CUDL), the Digital National Library
                     of Chile with its collection “<hi rend="italic">Literatura oral y Tradiciones
                        populares</hi>”, the Digital Library of the Chile University with its
                     collection “<hi rend="italic">Lira popular</hi>”, or the library <hi
                        rend="italic">Calaix</hi> of the Generalitat de Catalunya.</note>, but also
                  in portals and libraries dedicated to them<note> We can think about the <hi
                        rend="italic">Catálogo y biblioteca Digital de Relaciones de Sucesos</hi>
                     (CBDRS), the portal <hi rend="italic">Mapping Pliegos</hi>, and the projects
                        <hi rend="italic">Comedias Sueltas USA</hi>, <hi rend="italic">Literatura de
                        cordel y teatro en España</hi>, <hi rend="italic">Impresos Populares
                        Iberoamericanos</hi> (IPI) or <hi rend="italic">Biblioteca Virtual
                        Cordel</hi>.</note>. The study of these projects stresses that even if there
                  is no consensus on the way to describe this type of content, they tend to focus
                  their attention on chapbooks as documents rather than on texts or on
                  illustrations, by offering metadata and services related to their editorial
                  process (printers, sellers, prices, etc.) and their material aspects. This
                  tendency can be explained by the relative homogeneity of the format of chapbooks,
                  which constitute a publishing genre, whereas texts and illustrations are subject
                  to a great diversity in their topic and their type<note> The projects that offer
                     services dedicated to the content of texts are mainly focused on a specific
                     type of Spanish chapbooks, like the project <hi rend="italic">Literatura de
                        cordel y teatro en España</hi> interested in chapbooks with
                  plays.</note>.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Untangling the cordel</hi> is in line with this movement of
                  digital promotion of Spanish chapbooks. It aims at studying (1) documents from a
                  bibliographical and sociological point of view, as they witness printers’ works
                  and what people liked, (2) texts with a literary approach (rewritings, medieval
                  patterns, narration of real or fictional events, etc.), and (3) woodcuts and their
                  uses within and out of our corpus. To achieve these objectives and by following
                  the model chosen by similar projects, the project has developed a DL. However, <hi
                     rend="italic">Untangling the cordel</hi> stands out by offering services that
                  are mainly focused on texts and illustrations through digital scholarly editions
                  and a catalogue of woodcuts, and by using XML-TEI to sustain the library and its
                  functionalities, instead of relational databases and librarian formats such as
                  UNIMARC or MARC-XML.</p>

                  errors and word additions are encoded as well and signalled on the interface with
                  different colours and positions. While page breaks and line breaks are consistent
                  with the original print, we decided to not consider column breaks as well as the
                  position of stanzas and paragraphs on the page, except for the titles and
                  colophons which are automatically centred. It was not relevant for our purposes to
                  reproduce the layout of the page to that extent. As we mainly focus our attention
                  on texts, we choose to indicate information about columns and other page features
                  in the descriptive metadata of each edition.</p>
               <p>This editorial workflow centred on text has been the basis for the development of
                  a woodcut catalogue. Indeed, during the automatic transcription of the corpus,
                  automatic transcription tools allowed us not only to detect lines and characters,
                  but also illustrations. We could then know which documents contained illustrations
                  and on which page, as well as the coordinates of their position on an image. This
                  information was centralized in a spreadsheet and enriched with keywords about the
                  elements being represented (women, men, clothing, animals, places, etc.). Finally,
                  as the woodcuts in our corpus can and do appear in different chapbooks, we used
                  the software VISE<note> The VISE software (<hi rend="italic">VGG Image Search

The paper describes the DTS API specifications by means of real-world examples, discusses the key design choices that were made, and concludes by providing a list of existing repositories and libraries that support DTS.","source":"HAL Archives Ouvertes","title":"Distributed Text Services (DTS): a Community-built API to Publish and Consume Text Collections as Linked Data","title-short":"Distributed Text Services (DTS)","URL":"https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-03183886","author":[{"family":"Almas","given":"Bridget"},{"family":"Clérice","given":"Thibault"},{"family":"Cayless","given":"Hugh"},{"family":"Jolivet","given":"Vincent"},{"family":"Liuzzo","given":"Pietro Maria"},{"family":"Romanello","given":"Matteo"},{"family":"Robie","given":"Jonathan"},{"family":"Scott","given":"Ian W."}],"accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",8,12]]},"issued":{"date-parts":[["2021",3]]}}}],"schema":"https://github.com/citation-style-language/schema/raw/master/csl-citation.json"}?>(Almas

               <p>These services propose several levels of analysis, by taking separately each
                  component of a chapbook or by relating them to each other. They echo the three
                  main axes that structure the research on Spanish chapbooks: (1) a librarian axis,
                  which consists of cataloguing and examining chapbooks from a critical perspective;
                  (2) a literary axis pertaining to the analysis of the content of chapbooks and of
                  their intertextuality or “intermediality” with the interconnections between text
                  and woodcuts; and, (3) a bibliographical axis interested in chapbooks as an
                  editorial format, i.e. in its production, its selling or its reception

               <p>In their demonstration, Andrews and van Zundert distinguish three levels of
                  arguments that an interface might convey. The first level is related to the
                  general usability of an interface, i.e. if it follows ergonomic criteria and
                  offers a suitable user experience, which indicates a good understanding of its
                  users’ needs from a project

                  discourse about DSE itself. For instance, some projects might choose to put texts
                  first and provide reading editions, with few functionalities to explore them. In
                  contrast, other projects might prefer DSEs that look like toolboxes, with numerous
                  services to interact with texts

                  conception of DSEs as interfaces. Finally, the third one is a data level, which
                  “pertains to what the edition conveys about its specific text” and the way editors
                  interpret it

                  2015, 45). However, in our context, we decided to consider the project as a DL.
                  Even if we offer DSEs of each chapbook, this is not the only component of our
                  project. Indeed, the catalogue of woodcuts is not a side functionality that
                  complements the editions, but an essential element of our project, which then
                  cannot be seen solely as a DSE. With these different types of data, we could refer
                  to our project as a hub or a portal. Yet, we found these terms less convenient, as
                  they are typically used to name data aggregators. Besides, as our project is based
                  on the content of the University Library of Geneva, it seems more consistent to us
                  to refer to the project as a <hi rend="italic">digital</hi> library.</p>
               <p>Therefore, if we apply the arguments defined by Andrews and van Zundert to a
                  project such as ours, the second argument would also be related to the type of our
                  DL, and the third one not only to the text, but also to other types of data, such
                  as the woodcuts in our case. In the following examples, we will present the way
                  these different levels of argument occur in our interface, as well as the way they
                  have guided our design choices.</p>

                  <head>The list of chapbooks</head>
                  <p>From a general perspective, we have chosen a minimal design, with a hint of
                     pastel and green colours to give a dynamic and refreshing look to the
                        website<note> Indeed, there could be a gap between what we want to convey or
                        not about our project and data, and what users will see on the interface.
                        For instance, someone could argue that this choice of colours would rather
                        reflect the feminine and young team behind the project.</note> (Figure 1).
                     The menu bar insists firstly on the scientific aspects of the project, with
                     general information about its objectives, the presentation of the editorial
                     principles followed during the editing of the texts, as well as the project’s
                     bibliography. Thus, from the menu bar, the interface argues for a transparency
                     of the project to reassure its users about the reliability and quality of its
                     data. Indeed, just like with analogue content, users are sensitive to the
                     origin of the data, and to the scholarly rigour with which they have been
                     structured and displayed online. The more a project gives details about its
                     elaboration, the more users will be encouraged to continue their navigation and
                     use of the DL

Dans la plupart des cas, en effet, les services entourant les bibliothèques numériques sont construits à partir des exigences de leurs créateurs, et en fonction des besoins présumés des utilisateurs ; lesquels utilisateurs ne sont rien d’autre que la projection des besoins et des caractéristiques des créateurs eux-mêmes. Cette stratégie a montré ses limites et une approche basée sur les besoins des utilisateurs finaux est encore marginale.La question des utilisateurs se pose d’autant plus dans le cadre du développement de services participatifs, qui reprennent les codes du Web Social et font passer les utilisateurs de consommateurs à acteurs. Dans le domaine des bibliothèques numériques patrimoniales et scientifiques, l’étude des services participatifs du point de vue de l’utilisateur est encore rare et peu spécifique, alors même que ce type de services soulève la question de la place des utilisateurs dans ce type de ressources numériques, et semble remettre en question le métier et les missions des bibliothécaires.Dans ce contexte, cette thèse définit une méthode de conception centrée utilisateur appliquée au cas d’une bibliothèque numérique participative et scientifique. Nous mettons plus particulièrement l’accent sur l’étape de modélisation et de maquettage des services, en tant que processus heuristiques qui visent à donner corps à un modèle théorique et qui ont une fonction centrale dans le cycle de vie d’un projet et dans son workflow. À travers cette méthode et le cas de Fonte Gaia, nous proposons une étude des services participatifs d’une bibliothèque numérique basée sur le public engagement, un modèle participatif encore peu présent dans le monde du patrimoine et des humanités numériques, mais qui permettrait de définir des services en accord avec les besoins des utilisateurs et les missions des bibliothécaires. Cette étude des services sous l’angle du public engagement nous a permis de démontrer le bien-fondé d’une distinction stricte entre services coopératifs et services collaboratifs, qui n’impliquent pas les mêmes publics et qui ne sont pas représentés de la même façon au sein d’une bibliothèque numérique.Cette thèse étudie ainsi à la fois une interaction, celle entre les services et leurs utilisateurs ; un modèle, celui du public engagement ; et une méthode, celle de la conception centrée utilisateur appliquée aux bibliothèques numériques patrimoniales. Ces différents aspects sont étroitement liés : le public engagement constitue un type d’interaction particulier entre un utilisateur et un service. Il nous permet de pousser l’engagement des utilisateurs avec le patrimoine écrit à son extrême et de définir différents degrés de participation. Cela est rendu possible par la modélisation d’une bibliothèque participative via la conception centrée utilisateur. Cette dernière est non seulement notre méthode d’étude des services et du public engagement, en ayant recours à des questionnaires, des entretiens, des ateliers de maquettage participatif et un hackathon ; mais également un objet de recherche en lui-même, en tant que méthode peu employée en bibliothèque numérique patrimoniale. Ces différents éléments de notre thèse nous permettent d’analyser une bibliothèque numérique sous un angle nouveau, en dépassant l’image d’une bibliothèque fournisseur de données pour celle d’une bibliothèque tournée vers ses utilisateurs et encourageant leur engagement avec le patrimoine écrit.","genre":"These de doctorat","license":"Licence Etalab","publisher":"Université Grenoble Alpes (ComUE)","source":"theses.fr","title":"Bibliothèques numériques enrichies et participatives : Utilisateurs, Services, Interfaces","title-short":"Bibliothèques numériques enrichies et participatives","URL":"http://theses.fr/2019GREAL017","author":[{"family":"Leblanc","given":"Elina"}],"contributor":[{"family":"Pierazzo","given":"Elena"},{"family":"Blanchon","given":"Hervé"}],"accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",6,14]]},"issued":{"date-parts":[["2019"]]}},"locator":"122","label":"page"}],"schema":"https://github.com/citation-style-language/schema/raw/master/csl-citation.json"}?>(Leblanc

                  <p>To complete facets and help users in their discovery and selection of
                     chapbooks, we chose to present each item in the list with preliminary metadata
                     and a thumbnail of its first page (Figure 1). This information is extracted
                     from the XML-TEI files and, for the thumbnails, generated with IIIF. The
                     benefit of producing these data to users before they even click on an item is
                     to distinguish one document from another. Indeed, it is common for chapbooks in
                     our collection to have similar or identical titles. It can be the result of
                     different printings of the same text, or different texts with the same title
                     (Figure 2). Giving the title and the list of content (chapters, poems, songs,
                     acts) is not enough, because different printings of the same text can have
                     different layouts or woodcuts (Figure 3).</p>
                  <figure>

                     with that information, users will not have to multiply clicks to know what is
                     behind a title. They can distinguish, at a glance, different printings of the
                     same text from different texts with the same title.</p>
                  <p>However, the presence of thumbnails is not just a matter of disambiguation of
                     chapbooks or an aesthetic choice. As a metaphor of the <hi rend="italic"
                        >cordel</hi>, they reproduce the way Spanish chapbooks were sold and
                     presented to 19th-century readers. Indeed, to be sold, chapbooks were hung with
                     clothespins on strings. The first thing bystanders saw was the first page,
                     whose purpose was to attract them with catchy woodcuts and titles. With the
                     thumbnails, we aim at offering a similar experience to our users without
                     sacrificing the legibility or usability of our interface.</p>
                  <p>Finally, as with facets, thumbnails are also a way to reproduce today’s
                     readers’ practices. Indeed, to choose a document in a physical library, each
                     user has her own strategies and criteria such as the cover, the length and
                     thickness of a document, the themes or the presence of illustrations

In Emotional Design, cognitive scientist Don Norman shows how the principles of human psychology apply to the invention and design of new technologies and products. In The Design of Everyday Things, Norman made the definitive case for human-centered design, showing that good design demanded that the user's must take precedence over a designer's aesthetic if anything, from light switches to airplanes, was going to work as the user needed. In this book, he takes his thinking several steps farther, showing that successful design must incorporate not just what users need, but must address our minds by attending to our visceral reactions, to our behavioral choices, and to the stories we want the things in our lives to tell others about ourselves. Good human-centered design isn't just about making effective tools that are straightforward to use; it's about making affective tools that mesh well with our emotions and help us express our identities and support our social lives. From roller coasters to robots, sports cars to smart phones, attractive things work better. Whether designer or consumer, user or inventor, this book is the definitive guide to making Norman's insights work for you.","ISBN":"978-0-465-00417-1","language":"en","note":"Google-Books-ID: UYU5DgAAQBAJ","number-of-pages":"232","publisher":"Hachette UK","source":"Google Books","title":"Emotional Design: Why We Love (or Hate) Everyday Things","title-short":"Emotional Design","author":[{"family":"Norman","given":"Don"}],"issued":{"date-parts":[["2007",3,20]]}}}],"schema":"https://github.com/citation-style-language/schema/raw/master/csl-citation.json"}?>(Norman

                     users with a scholarly background, and (3) the appearance of chapbooks is a
                     major component in their production and sale.</p>
                  <p>After several months of use we implemented a new version of this interface, due
                     to technical issues which became apparent at usage (Figure 4). Between the
                     first and the second version of this interface, the conceptual and data
                     arguments remain the same. Indeed, even with this new look, the facets still
                     follow the concepts explained above. However, their usability has been improved
                     toward a more minimalist design and more control over the interface for the
                     users.</p>
                  <p>Previously, facets followed the default behaviour of <hi rend="italic"
                        >TEI-Publisher</hi>, which regenerates the list of documents when a facet is
                     selected. Therefore, users were unable to select several facets at once, as the
                     choice of a facet immediately triggered a request. We changed this default
                     behaviour to let users select several keywords in different categories and
                     submit their own request through a new button. This makes this interface more
                     controllable, by allowing to easily do and undo requests (Nielsen 1994). Users
                     also have access to a help documentation that describes the different ways to
                     search within the corpus.</p>
                  <p>Another change was the use of collapsible categories to reduce the facets list
                     so that users can see all of them at once. Finally, we made the navigation bar
                     clearer and more explicit. The corpus, which is at the heart of the project,
                     now appears first. It is followed by a “Results” tab containing the project’s
                     productions, and the “About” tab, that now also contains the explanation of the
                     project’s goals and of the editorial process. This new menu bar inscribes the
                     project within an academic orientation and maintains its transparency.</p>

                     another visualisation tool, called <hi rend="italic">Mirador</hi>. Through the
                     availability of two visualisation tools, the interface gives several levels of
                     reading: a simple reading with the native tool provided by <hi rend="italic"

                        >Mirador</hi>, which resembles a virtual workspace. Indeed, with this tool,
                     users can add as many documents as they want in the same space to compare them,
                     or to modify their appearance with image filters (opacity, contrast, etc.). The
                     interface targets different user profiles: from a passer-by reader who wants to
                     collect information quickly and easily without spending too much time on the
                     interface, to a reader-user, interested in online reading, to an expert user,

Dans la plupart des cas, en effet, les services entourant les bibliothèques numériques sont construits à partir des exigences de leurs créateurs, et en fonction des besoins présumés des utilisateurs ; lesquels utilisateurs ne sont rien d’autre que la projection des besoins et des caractéristiques des créateurs eux-mêmes. Cette stratégie a montré ses limites et une approche basée sur les besoins des utilisateurs finaux est encore marginale.La question des utilisateurs se pose d’autant plus dans le cadre du développement de services participatifs, qui reprennent les codes du Web Social et font passer les utilisateurs de consommateurs à acteurs. Dans le domaine des bibliothèques numériques patrimoniales et scientifiques, l’étude des services participatifs du point de vue de l’utilisateur est encore rare et peu spécifique, alors même que ce type de services soulève la question de la place des utilisateurs dans ce type de ressources numériques, et semble remettre en question le métier et les missions des bibliothécaires.Dans ce contexte, cette thèse définit une méthode de conception centrée utilisateur appliquée au cas d’une bibliothèque numérique participative et scientifique. Nous mettons plus particulièrement l’accent sur l’étape de modélisation et de maquettage des services, en tant que processus heuristiques qui visent à donner corps à un modèle théorique et qui ont une fonction centrale dans le cycle de vie d’un projet et dans son workflow. À travers cette méthode et le cas de Fonte Gaia, nous proposons une étude des services participatifs d’une bibliothèque numérique basée sur le public engagement, un modèle participatif encore peu présent dans le monde du patrimoine et des humanités numériques, mais qui permettrait de définir des services en accord avec les besoins des utilisateurs et les missions des bibliothécaires. Cette étude des services sous l’angle du public engagement nous a permis de démontrer le bien-fondé d’une distinction stricte entre services coopératifs et services collaboratifs, qui n’impliquent pas les mêmes publics et qui ne sont pas représentés de la même façon au sein d’une bibliothèque numérique.Cette thèse étudie ainsi à la fois une interaction, celle entre les services et leurs utilisateurs ; un modèle, celui du public engagement ; et une méthode, celle de la conception centrée utilisateur appliquée aux bibliothèques numériques patrimoniales. Ces différents aspects sont étroitement liés : le public engagement constitue un type d’interaction particulier entre un utilisateur et un service. Il nous permet de pousser l’engagement des utilisateurs avec le patrimoine écrit à son extrême et de définir différents degrés de participation. Cela est rendu possible par la modélisation d’une bibliothèque participative via la conception centrée utilisateur. Cette dernière est non seulement notre méthode d’étude des services et du public engagement, en ayant recours à des questionnaires, des entretiens, des ateliers de maquettage participatif et un hackathon ; mais également un objet de recherche en lui-même, en tant que méthode peu employée en bibliothèque numérique patrimoniale. Ces différents éléments de notre thèse nous permettent d’analyser une bibliothèque numérique sous un angle nouveau, en dépassant l’image d’une bibliothèque fournisseur de données pour celle d’une bibliothèque tournée vers ses utilisateurs et encourageant leur engagement avec le patrimoine écrit.","genre":"These de doctorat","license":"Licence Etalab","publisher":"Université Grenoble Alpes (ComUE)","source":"theses.fr","title":"Bibliothèques numériques enrichies et participatives : Utilisateurs, Services, Interfaces","title-short":"Bibliothèques numériques enrichies et participatives","URL":"http://theses.fr/2019GREAL017","author":[{"family":"Leblanc","given":"Elina"}],"contributor":[{"family":"Pierazzo","given":"Elena"},{"family":"Blanchon","given":"Hervé"}],"accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",6,14]]},"issued":{"date-parts":[["2019"]]}},"locator":"214-215","label":"page"}],"schema":"https://github.com/citation-style-language/schema/raw/master/csl-citation.json"}?>(Rasmussen

                  <p>The model of the interface we propose (Figure 6) highlights some of these
                     specificities. First, woodcuts can help dating chapbooks, by observing traces
                     of degradation from one woodcut to another, or by looking at the date of
                     printing of the chapbooks, where there is one. Therefore, for the chapbook from
                     which the woodcut has been extracted, and for the similar woodcuts, we add the
                     date of printing. At first glance, users can make a hypothesis about the period
                     during which a specific woodcut has been used. Then, by comparing the similar
                     items, they might be able to narrow this hypothesis. For that, users can click
                     on the button “Compare”, that opens a new window with an implementation of the
                     image comparison application VDIFF<note> VDIFF is a JavaScript application,

                  <p>The metadata also specify the title of the chapbooks where an illustration can
                     be found. That gives an idea of the type of text, often indicated in the title,
                     and of the subjects with which an illustration is most often used. For
                     instance, in our example (Figure 5), the illustration of this woman is
                     associated with stories about royal families. Considering the type of text, it

                     by side, the interface stresses the close connection that exists between
                     illustrations and titles, which form a semantic block. It is a valued
                     information to understand chapbooks and the way they were conceived by
                     printers.</p>
                  <p>Finally, users have the possibility to navigate from the notice of a woodcut to
                     the edition of the text, and vice versa. By looking at the whole chapbook, they
                     can study the position of an illustration on the page, as well as the possible
                     other illustrations it is used with to form a scene. If we go back to our
                     example, in our corpus, this lady is always used on the front page with
                     woodcuts representing kings and soldiers. From there, we could navigate from
                     the edition to the notice of these other illustrations (Figure 4)<note> We are
                        currently devising a way to ease the study of the scenes, which now supposes
                        multiple clicks and a good control of the interface.</note>.</p>
                  <p>Again, the way we organise the information on the page allows several levels of
                     interpretation. Users could analyse the illustration for itself, for example to
                     look at the representation of specific patterns, or to study woodcut techniques
                     in 19th-century Spain. They could also explore the links between different
                     illustrations, the similar ones, and the ones that form a scene on a specific
                     chapbook. Lastly, they could investigate its connections with text – through
                     the titles and the whole text, as DSE and woodcuts are interconnected.</p>

               <head>Influence of the tools on the design of an interface</head>
               <p>The choice of a backbone software is guided by a project’s needs and objectives,
                  but in return, this software might open new design perspectives through the
                  functionalities it offers and the way it works. Undoubtedly, the appearance of our
                  interface and its services have been influenced by the tool we used to develop
                  them, the web application <hi rend="italic">TEI-Publisher</hi>. If we compare our
                  interface with some other <hi rend="italic">TEI-Publisher</hi>-based projects,
                  such as <hi rend="italic">Antonomaz</hi> or <hi rend="italic">DiScholEd</hi>
                  (Figure 7), we can find common design patterns that inscribe these projects in the
                  same community of practices — for instance, the composition of the menu bar, the
                  presence of filters, the position of the facets on the page or the search bar.</p>

               <p>Without knowing anything about <hi rend="italic">TEI-Publisher</hi>, a user could
                  easily see that <hi rend="italic">Untangling the cordel</hi> shares something in
                  common with these two projects, just by observing the way the three of them are
                  organized. Some elements are indeed predefined by the software and cannot be
                  overridden without editing the core code of <hi rend="italic">TEI-Publisher</hi>,
                  which would go against its purposes in terms of sustainability
                  <?biblio ADDIN ZOTERO_ITEM CSL_CITATION {"citationID":"Nh10hUWA","properties":{"formattedCitation":"(e-editiones n.d.)","plainCitation":"(e-editiones n.d.)","noteIndex":0},"citationItems":[{"id":1237,"uris":["http://zotero.org/users/2779164/items/PRVCDZED"],"itemData":{"id":1237,"type":"document","title":"Best Practice Recommandations - TEI Publisher's Documentation","URL":"https://teipublisher.com/exist/apps/tei-publisher/doc/documentation.xml?odd=docbook.odd&id=customization-best-practice&root=3.39","author":[{"literal":"e-editiones"}],"accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",3,28]]}}}],"schema":"https://github.com/citation-style-language/schema/raw/master/csl-citation.json"}?>(e-editiones
                  n.d.). One could argue that this software leads to an uniformization of the DSEs’
                  interfaces, but what makes each project unique and specific is the meaning it puts
                  into each of the components of its interface, a meaning that is induced by its
                  objectives and its data. For instance, the interfaces of <hi rend="italic"
                     >Untangling the cordel</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Antonomaz</hi> are similar
                  because their data and their objectives are similar: both aim at studying and
                  promoting ephemera, respectively in 19th-century Spain and in 17th-century France.
                  However, the interface of <hi rend="italic">DiScholEd</hi> argues for a hub that
                  contains several DSEs of correspondences. If we go further in the interface of
                  these projects, we observe that, regarding the presentation of the documents, each
                  project has adopted different perspectives. While, as we saw previously, <hi
                     rend="italic">Untangling the cordel</hi> offers reading editions, <hi
                     rend="italic">Antonomaz</hi> chooses to highlight the facsimile. As for <hi
                     rend="italic">DiShcolEd</hi>, it provides a synoptic edition that allows users
                  to see varied information at once (Figure 8).</p>
               <figure>

               </figure>
               <p>These different representations of DSEs are possible because of the way <hi
                     rend="italic">TEI-Publisher</hi> works. Indeed, one of key-concepts of this
                  software is the one of web-components<note> Web-components are a W3C standard.
                     They can be seen as blocks that contain the HTML code, the CSS and the
                     Javascript needed by a specific functionality to function.</note>. They can be
                  considered as blocks, each one corresponding to a functionality. For example,
                  there is a web-component for displaying facsimiles, another for creating a map,
                  and another for adding a simple search bar<note> A list of the <hi rend="italic"
                        >TEI-Publisher</hi>’s web-components can be found through an API: <ref
                        target="https://unpkg.com/@teipublisher/pb-components@1.30.3/dist/api.html"

                     [Accessed 28 march 2023].</note>. These blocks can be combined with each other
                  to build an interface: even if they share a common look, the way they are laid out
                  on a page is specific to each project. Like TEI, <hi rend="italic"
                     >TEI-Publisher</hi> is a modular and flexible tool that allows editors and
                  designers to represent a DSE in different ways. It provides a framework to help
                  them make their own “rhetorical argument” (Andrews and van Zundert 2018, 8) about
                  their data and their conception of a DL and DSEs.</p>
               <p>Finally, our experience with <hi rend="italic">TEI-Publisher</hi> leads us to
                  consider that it does not only influence the design of our website, but also our
                  data model. Usually, a clear distinction is made between content and its form
                  <?biblio ADDIN ZOTERO_ITEM CSL_CITATION {"citationID":"RBZwvwCf","properties":{"formattedCitation":"(Andrews and van Zundert 2018, 8)","plainCitation":"(Andrews and van Zundert 2018, 8)","noteIndex":0},"citationItems":[{"id":1073,"uris":["http://zotero.org/users/2779164/items/PSWPRTWX"],"itemData":{"id":1073,"type":"chapter","container-title":"Scholarly Digital Editions as Interfaces","event-place":"Norderstedt","ISBN":"978-3-7481-0925-9","language":"en","note":"Google-Books-ID: etB6DwAAQBAJ","page":"3-33","publisher":"BoD – Books on Demand","publisher-place":"Norderstedt","source":"Google Books","title":"What Are You Trying to Say?

                  and van Zundert 2018, 8): when we work with XML, we start by examining the meaning
                  of the data, then think about their visualisation with scripts and stylesheets.
                  However, in this case, some of our editing choices have been determined by the way
                  the tool functions. For instance, the way we display facsimiles does not follow
                  the prescriptions made by the XML-TEI community but simplifies them.</p>
               <p>No project operates in isolation. It is influenced by the design of other
                  projects, by the expectations of their scientific communities, by the type of
                  digital edition chosen or by the tools used, whether software (<hi rend="italic"
                     >eXist-DB</hi>, <hi rend="italic">TEI-Publisher</hi>, <hi rend="italic"
                     >EVT</hi>) or libraries (<hi rend="italic">Bootstrap</hi>). In the last case,
                  the choice of standard technologies argues for the awareness of a project about
                  interoperability and sustainability issues, and about what is advised and
                  acknowledged by its scientific community.</p>

               <head>Conclusions</head>
               <p>The design of our interface relies on ergonomic and scholarly considerations, that
                  reflects the nature of our corpus and our goals. If we return to the three levels
                  of arguments defined by Andrews and van Zundert, from a usability perspective, the
                  interface of <hi rend="italic">Untangling the cordel</hi> argues for a minimalist
                  design, that leaves space for data and personalisation. Whether it is with the
                  list of chapbooks or their notice, it does not impose a predefined way to interact
                  with data, but let users decide which functionalities or information they want to
                  display.</p>
               <p>The conceptual level of our interface is related both to the model of a DL and of
                  a DSE. On one hand, the interface argues that our DL follows the model of a
                  physical library. It reuses concepts and practices common to analogue libraries,
                  such as the way users select their books, and can thus be perceived as their
                  extension. On the other hand, it argues that our DSEs are reading editions,
                  favourable to a “solitary concentration”
                  <?biblio ADDIN ZOTERO_ITEM CSL_CITATION {"citationID":"u2DLssg9","properties":{"formattedCitation":"(Andrews and van Zundert 2018, 16)","plainCitation":"(Andrews and van Zundert 2018, 16)","noteIndex":0},"citationItems":[{"id":1073,"uris":["http://zotero.org/users/2779164/items/PSWPRTWX"],"itemData":{"id":1073,"type":"chapter","container-title":"Scholarly Digital Editions as Interfaces","event-place":"Norderstedt","ISBN":"978-3-7481-0925-9","language":"en","note":"Google-Books-ID: etB6DwAAQBAJ","page":"3-33","publisher":"BoD – Books on Demand","publisher-place":"Norderstedt","source":"Google Books","title":"What Are You Trying to Say?

                  and van Zundert 2018, 16), by according a central place to text and
                  facsimiles.</p>
               <p>Finally, regarding the third level and what the DL and DSEs say about our data,
                  the layout of the interface underlines the intertextuality or “intermediality” of
                  Spanish chapbooks. By offering various levels of analysis, it allows to study
                  components of a chapbook separately (document, text, or woodcuts) or in relation
                  with each other.</p>
               <p>In conclusion, working with the levels of arguments proposed by Andrews and van
                  Zundert helped us in the creation of our interface by providing us a frame and a
                  better perception of the meaning we put in each component and design choices. We
                  believe that following this method is a way to encourage the study of interfaces
                  and their long-term preservation, thus joining the recommendations made by Claire
                  Warwick in her recent paper.</p>
               <p>No interface is neutral: deliberately or not, it tells something about a project
                  at a given moment, its values, or its perceptions of a specific subject. When it
                  comes to the development of a digital interface, it is important to keep in mind
                  that designing is not just about the way an interface looks like (the <hi
                     rend="italic">dessin</hi> in French), but also about its intention and meaning
                  (the <hi rend="italic">dessein</hi>).</p>
