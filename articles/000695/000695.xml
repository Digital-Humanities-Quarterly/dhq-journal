				<p>The project Untangling the cordel (2020-2024) aims at studying and promoting a collection
					of 19th-century Spanish chapbooks via a digital library (DL). This resource is composed of
					digital scholarly editions of chapbooks and of a catalogue of woodcuts, which decorate the
					first page of almost all the documents. In this paper, after presenting the project’s
					editorial workflow, we focus our attention of the way we design the interface of this DL
					to represent the different facets of chapbooks (document, text and illustrations). For
					that, we have chosen to follow a method, proposed by Andrews and van Zundert in 2018, that
					consider an interface as an argument editors made about their data and their digital
					editions. Through this case study, we demonstrate the feasibility of this approach, where
					each component of an interface contributes to the scientific discourse a project made
					about its goals and its perception of digital editing. We also stress the impact of this
					method on user experience and on a project itself, as another way to see data and their
					modelling. </p>

					<head>Introduction</head>
					<p>In a recent article, Claire Warwick compares digital interfaces of digital humanities
						(DH) projects to dust jackets of books or to picture frames, i.e. functional objects
						that can be easily discarded in the first case, or that we cease to see in the second
						case, as they fade behind the picture they are framing <ptr target="#warwick2020" loc="944"/>. The same can be said about digital interfaces. They are so present that
						they become transparent to users. They appear as a decorative and convenient support
						for data, but are not considered as a topic for research. Yet, interfaces say
						something about the data they present, and how the project perceives them. They <quote
						rend="inline">dictat[e] not only how a digital resource looks but also how it works,
						and how information may be accessed and comprehended by users</quote> <ptr target="#warwick2020" loc="964"/>. For these reasons, Warwick calls to take into consideration interface
						design during the analysis of a project and to preserve the different versions of an
						interface. Indeed, interfaces attest of the intentions and the context of creation of
						a project over time, just as dust jackets contain valuable information about
						commercial strategies, or readers’ tastes at different time. Therefore, we must <quote
							rend="inline">look at the interface, not simply through it</quote> <ptr target="#warwick2020" loc="964"/> <hi rend="italic"
						>ibid.</hi>).</p>
					
					<p>These considerations echo the ones made by Ruecker and Galey in 2010, or by Andrews and
						van Zundert in 2018, about interfaces of digital scholarly editions (DSE). In their
						respective papers, they consider interfaces as an argument a project makes about its
						edition.</p>
					
					<quote rend="block"><emph>User interfaces are […] a language</emph> through which arguments are made,
						even when the makers of these interfaces are not conscious of the language they are
						using. As such, <emph>they reflect the interpretations of the materials</emph> they are supposed to
						represent as well as the culture, the politics, and the motives of their designers. <ptr target="#andrews_zundert2018" loc="6"/></quote>
					
					<p>Two important facts appear here. Firstly, each interface communicates with its users
						through a set of colours, signs, and symbols, that forms a <quote rend="inline"
							>semiotic environment</quote> <ptr target="#andrews_zundert2018" loc="11"/>. Secondly, interfaces are not neutral. Even if they seem
						transparent and opaque to the users, they are nonetheless a rhetoric discourse about
						the data. They are also dependent on their context of creation, and of the background
						of their designers, whether it is cultural, identitary, scientific, or political. They
						are <quote rend="inline">means of communication of scholarly arguments</quote> <ptr target="#andrews_zundert2018" loc="30"/>, that must be considered by their makers. Thus, their study
						and long-term preservation matter to understand not only the position of a project
						towards its data and field of research, but also what strategies projects have adopted
						over time <ptr target="#warwick2020" loc="968"/>. Therefore, an interface is not just a nice-looking box. Its design must be
						seen as a heuristic process that represents a theoretical model, as well as a central
						step in the life of a project.</p>
					
					<p>In this paper, we propose an application of these considerations about interface design
						as an argument and a witness of projects’ intentions, with a case study: the digital
						library (DL) <hi rend="italic">Untangling the cordel</hi> <note> This project is led
						by the professor Constance Carta (University of Geneva), with the support of the <hi
						rend="italic">Philanthropic Monique de Meuron Family Foundation</hi>. The digital
						library is available at <ref
						target="https://desenrollandoelcordel.unige.ch/inicio.html"
						>https://desenrollandoelcordel.unige.ch/inicio.html</ref> &amp;lt;Consulted the
						03/05/2023&amp;gt;.</note>, dedicated to Spanish peddler literature. After a presentation
						of the project and its editorial workflow, we will analyse its interface and the
						scholarly arguments behind our design choices with different examples of pages.
						Through this case study, in turn, we would like to stress the importance of taking the
						interfaces into account in the scientific discourse of a project. We also aim to
						demonstrate the feasibility of this approach, as well as its contribution to user
						navigation and to the project itself, as another way to see data and their
						modelling.</p>

					<head>The project Untangling the cordel: corpus and objectives</head>
					
					<p>The project <hi rend="italic">Untangling the cordel</hi> (2020-2024) is dedicated to a
						collection of almost 900 19th-century Spanish chapbooks hold by the University library
						of Geneva. Spanish chapbooks, also known as <hi rend="italic">pliegos de cordel</hi>,
						have existed since the beginning of printing, and are still published in some
						Ibero-American countries such as Brazil. These documents were printed in mass on a
						low-quality paper and sold in the streets by peddlers, for a modest sum. In verse or
						prose, they relate fictitious stories and real events, share songs, poems and plays,
						or copy prayers and other religious writings, amongst other contents <ptr target="#gomis_botrel2019" loc="127–28"/>. Their format is consistent and almost independent of the
						type of text they contained: they are made of a few pages and share a common layout,
						with a text usually displayed on two columns, and one or several woodcuts on the front
						page <ptr target="#botrel2001"/>.</p>
					
					<p>Chapbooks are complex documents. They are both written and oral, constant in their
						appearance but heterogeneous in their content, and at the frontier between popular and
						scholarly literature, between books and archives <ptr target="#botrel2000"/>; <ptr target="#botrel2001" loc="125"/>. From a librarian and bibliographical perspective, these documents
						are difficult to classify and to describe with tools and standards that have primarily
						been thought for books. These impediments lead to an invisibility of chapbooks in
						libraries’ catalogues, as they are often stored in boxes <ptr target="#nieto2015"/>; <ptr target="#lambert2015"/></p>
					
					<p>However, over the last decades, with a renewed interest for this peddler literature and
						the emergence of digital tools, several projects have been launched to highlight this
						type of documents. Spanish chapbooks can not only be found among the larger
						collections of national or academic digital libraries<note> We can name the Cambridge
						University Digital Library (CUDL), the Digital National Library of Chile with its
						collection <hi rend="italic">Literatura oral y Tradiciones populares</hi>, the
						Digital Library of the Chile University with its collection <hi rend="italic">Lira
						popular</hi>, or the library <hi rend="italic">Calaix</hi> of the Generalitat de
						Catalunya.</note>, but also in portals and libraries dedicated to them<note> We can
						think about the <hi rend="italic">Catálogo y biblioteca Digital de Relaciones de
						Sucesos</hi> (CBDRS), the portal <hi rend="italic">Mapping Pliegos</hi>, and the
						projects <hi rend="italic">Comedias Sueltas USA</hi>, <hi rend="italic">Literatura de
						cordel y teatro en España</hi>, <hi rend="italic">Impresos Populares
						Iberoamericanos</hi> (IPI) or <hi rend="italic">Biblioteca Virtual
						Cordel</hi>.</note>. The study of these projects stresses that even if there is no
						consensus on the way to describe this type of content, they tend to focus their
						attention on chapbooks as documents rather than on texts or on illustrations, by
						offering metadata and services related to their editorial process (printers, sellers,
						prices, etc.) and their material aspects. This tendency can be explained by the
						relative homogeneity of the format of chapbooks, which constitute a publishing genre,
						whereas texts and illustrations are subject to a great diversity in their topic and
						their type<note> The projects that offer services dedicated to the content of texts
						are mainly focused on a specific type of Spanish chapbooks, like the project <hi
						rend="italic">Literatura de cordel y teatro en España</hi> interested in chapbooks
						with plays.</note>.</p>
					
					<p> <hi rend="italic">Untangling the cordel</hi> is in line with this movement of digital
						promotion of Spanish chapbooks. It aims at studying (1) <emph>documents</emph> from a
						bibliographical and sociological point of view, as they witness printers’ works and
						what people liked, (2) <emph>texts</emph> with a literary approach (rewritings, medieval patterns,
						narration of real or fictional events, etc.), and (3) <emph>woodcuts</emph> and their uses within
						and out of our corpus. To achieve these objectives and by following the model chosen
						by similar projects, the project has developed a DL. However, <hi rend="italic"
						>Untangling the cordel</hi> stands out by offering services that are mainly focused on
						texts and illustrations through digital scholarly editions and a catalogue of
						woodcuts, and by using XML-TEI to sustain the library and its functionalities, instead
						of relational databases and librarian formats such as UNIMARC or MARC-XML.</p>
				</div>
				
				
				<div>
					
					<head>From diplomatic digital editions to a catalogue of woodcuts: description of the
						workflow</head>
					
					<p>As the backbone for our document representation, we have chosen the XML-TEI standard as
						the core element of our editorial workflow. In a first step, we focused our attention
						on the textual and material aspects of chapbooks. We began with their transcription by
						using different automatic transcription tools<note> At the beginning of the project,
							we used <hi rend="italic">Transkribus</hi> <ptr target="#kahle_etal2017"/>, due to its ease of installation and use. However, after one year of the
						project, an HTR platform called FoNDUE, based on the HTR tool <hi rend="italic"
							>eScriptorium</hi> <ptr target="#kiessling_etal2019"/>, had been developed at the University of Geneva. We became beta-testers
						of this new infrastructure, which explains the change of tool during the
						project.</note>. The results were exported in XML formats<note> With <hi rend="italic"
						>Transkribus</hi>, we exported the HTR predictions in PAGE-XML. With FoNDUE, we
						exported the results in Alto-XML to respect its recommendations and its
						pipeline.</note> and transformed in XML-TEI, through a XSLT transformation sheet. The
						obtained digital editions were then enriched manually. Finally, they were displayed
						online with the web application <hi rend="italic">TEI-Publisher</hi>, side-by-side
						with their digitisations stored in the IIIF (<hi rend="italic">International Image
						Interoperability Framework</hi>) server of the University of Geneva.</p>
					
					<p>These editions are diplomatic. They preserve the original punctuation, words spelling
						(<hi rend="italic">muger</hi>, <hi rend="italic">mujer</hi>), and accentuation (<hi
						rend="italic">José</hi>, <hi rend="italic">Josè</hi>). Printing errors and word
						additions are encoded as well and signalled on the interface with different colours
						and positions. While page breaks and line breaks are consistent with the original
						print, we decided to not consider column breaks as well as the position of stanzas and
						paragraphs on the page, except for the titles and colophons which are automatically
						centred. It was not relevant for our purposes to reproduce the layout of the page to
						that extent. As we mainly focus our attention on texts, we choose to indicate
						information about columns and other page features in the descriptive metadata of each
						edition.</p>
					
					<p>This editorial workflow centred on text has been the basis for the development of a
						woodcut catalogue. Indeed, during the automatic transcription of the corpus, automatic
						transcription tools allowed us not only to detect lines and characters, but also
						illustrations. We could then know which documents contained illustrations and on which
						page, as well as the coordinates of their position on an image. This information was
						centralized in a spreadsheet and enriched with keywords about the elements being
						represented (women, men, clothing, animals, places, etc.). Finally, as the woodcuts in
						our corpus can and do appear in different chapbooks, we used the software VISE<note>
						The VISE software (<hi rend="italic">VGG Image Search Engine</hi>), maintained and
						developed by the Department of Engineering Science of the Oxford University, enables
						the search of images or portions of images in large corpora <ptr target="#dutta_etal2021"/>.</note> to detect similar items. The results have also been
						recorded in the spreadsheet.</p>
					
					<p>To create our catalogue and display it with <hi rend="italic">TEI-Publisher</hi> <ptr target="#e-editiones2021"/>, we developed a script that transforms each line of the spreadsheet into an
						XML-TEI file. As for the digital editions, the image of a woodcut is presented
						alongside its descriptive metadata (keywords, title and date of the chapbook it comes
						from, list of similar or quasi-identical woodcuts). To do so, we add the illustration
						coordinates given by the automatic transcription tools to the IIIF URI of a page.
						Thus, we merely display the portion of the digitized page that corresponds to a
						woodcut, without duplicating the images on the IIIF server.</p>
					
					<p>This workflow allows us to elaborate three types of services that highlight the
						different components of a chapbook, i.e. document, text and illustrations:</p>
					<list type="unordered">
						<item><emph>Search </emph>services: full-text search (with words in context), text browsing with
							filters (publishers, places, dates, type and nature of text), woodcuts browsing by
							keywords (types of characters, clothes, attitudes, places, etc.).</item>
						<item><emph>Reading </emph>services: parallel display of texts and facsimiles, linking between
							chapbooks and illustrations, comparison of chapbooks.</item>
						<item><emph>Sharing</emph> services: export of texts and images, sharing of images (IIIF) and texts
							(DTS — <hi rend="italic">Distributed Text Services</hi> <note> DTS is an API
							Specification that aims at facilitating the navigation in text collections, their
							manipulation, and their citation by relying on Linked Open Data <ptr target="#almas_etal2021"/>.</note>) with other projects.</item>
					</list>
					
					<p>These services propose several levels of analysis, by taking separately each component
						of a chapbook or by relating them to each other. They echo the three main axes that
						structure the research on Spanish chapbooks: (1) a <emph>librarian axis</emph>, which consists of
						cataloguing and examining chapbooks from a critical perspective; (2) a <emph>literary axis</emph>
						pertaining to the analysis of the content of chapbooks and of their intertextuality or
						<q>intermediality </q>with the interconnections between text and woodcuts; and, (3) a
						<emph>bibliographical axis</emph> interested in chapbooks as an editorial format, i.e. in its
						production, its selling or its reception <ptr target="#gomis_botrel2019" loc="130–31"/>. Each axis can be studied with one or several services and is
						therefore reflected in the interface itself.</p>
				</div>
				
				
				<div>
					
					<head>Design of the interface</head>
					
					<p>In their demonstration, Andrews and van Zundert distinguish three levels of arguments
						that an interface might convey. The first level is related to the <emph>general usability</emph> of
						an interface, i.e. if it follows ergonomic criteria and offers a suitable user
						experience, which indicates a good understanding of its users’ needs from a project <ptr target="#andrews_zundert2018" loc="28"/>. The second level is a <emph>conceptual level</emph>, which offers a
						discourse about DSE itself. For instance, some projects might choose to put texts
						first and provide reading editions, with few functionalities to explore them. In
						contrast, other projects might prefer DSEs that look like toolboxes, with numerous
						services to interact with texts <ptr target="#andrews_zundert2018" loc="29"/>. In both cases, projects will say something about their
						conception of DSEs as interfaces. Finally, the third one is <emph>a data level,</emph> which
						“pertains to what the edition conveys about its specific text” and the way editors
						interpret it <ptr target="#andrews_zundert2018" loc="29"/>. These levels have originally been thought for DSEs, but
						they can be transposed to the context of a DL.</p>
					
					<p>It is not always easy to make a distinction between a DSE and a DL. We could say that a
						DL is dedicated to <quote rend="inline">digitized editions</quote> <ptr target="#sahle2016" loc="27"/> and to the modelling of an object, whereas a DSE is focused on a work and
						expresses a specific point of view about it <ptr target="#pierazzo2015" loc="45"/>. However, in our context, we decided to consider the project as a DL. Even
						if we offer DSEs of each chapbook, this is not the only component of our project.
						Indeed, the catalogue of woodcuts is not a side functionality that complements the
						editions, but an essential element of our project, which then cannot be seen solely as
						a DSE. With these different types of data, we could refer to our project as a hub or a
						portal. Yet, we found these terms less convenient, as they are typically used to name
						data aggregators. Besides, as our project is based on the content of the University
						Library of Geneva, it seems more consistent to us to refer to the project as a <hi
						rend="italic">digital</hi> library.</p>
					
					<p>Therefore, if we apply the arguments defined by Andrews and van Zundert to a project
						such as ours, the second argument would also be related to the type of our DL, and the
						third one not only to the text, but also to other types of data, such as the woodcuts
						in our case. In the following examples, we will present the way these different levels
						of argument occur in our interface, as well as the way they have guided our design
						choices.</p>
					
					
					<div>
						
						<head>The list of chapbooks</head>
						
						<p>From a general perspective, we have chosen a minimal design, with a hint of pastel
							and green colours to give a dynamic and refreshing look to the website<note>
							Indeed, there could be a gap between what we want to convey or not about our
							project and data, and what users will see on the interface. For instance, someone
							could argue that this choice of colours would rather reflect the feminine and
							young team behind the project.</note> (Figure 1). The menu bar insists firstly on
							the scientific aspects of the project, with general information about its
							objectives, the presentation of the editorial principles followed during the
							editing of the texts, as well as the project’s bibliography. Thus, from the menu
							bar, the interface argues for a transparency of the project to reassure its users
							about the reliability and quality of its data. Indeed, just like with analogue
							content, users are sensitive to the origin of the data, and to the scholarly
							rigour with which they have been structured and displayed online. The more a
							project gives details about its elaboration, the more users will be encouraged to
							continue their navigation and use of the DL <ptr target="#warwick_etal2008" loc="29"/>; <ptr target="#warwick2012" loc="13"/>. The <q>About</q> tab goes in the same way by
							providing information about the tools used to prepare the data.</p>
						
						<figure>
							<head>Figure 1: List of chapbooks</head>
							<graphic url="resources/images/figure01.png"/>
						</figure>
						
						<p>From the <q>Collection</q> tab, users access the list of chapbooks (Figure 1), where
							they can narrow it down by using facets. These allow them to freely browse the
							collections of the DL, without resorting to paths that have been predefined by the
							designers. They also give them an idea of the way the collections have been
							conceived by their creators, and of the vocabulary used to describe the content <ptr target="#leblanc2019" loc="122"/>.</p>
						
						<p>Users are usually familiar with the concept of faceted search as they have likely
							experienced it in other contexts. It allows us to create a familiar environment
							<quote rend="inline">that feels intuitive</quote> <ptr target="#nielsen1994"/>. This is analogous to commercial websites whose lists of products may be
							narrowed by brands, colours, sizes, prices, etc. But it has also been demonstrated
							that facets can reproduce the practices of today’s readers in physical libraries.
							Indeed, when readers look for a specific book in a library, they will often look
							at the other books on the surrounding shelves. This phenomenon has been called the
							<quote rend="inline">neighbour effect</quote> <ptr target="#mckay_etal2014"/>; <ptr target="#mckay_etal2015"/>. It encourages the
							discovery of unexpected books, also known as serendipity, which can be about
							subjects other that the ones readers were looking for in the first place. In a DL,
							filters can play the role of a physical library’s shelves by suggesting users
							other topics or content that fall within the scope of their interests – for
							instance, someone interested in <hi rend="italic">coplas</hi> might also be
							interested in <hi rend="italic">trovos</hi> or <hi rend="italic">décimas</hi>
							<note> <hi rend="italic">Coplas</hi>, <hi rend="italic">trovos</hi> and <hi
							rend="italic">décimas</hi> refer to different metrical forms in Spanish
							poetry.</note> – or belong to a different genre <ptr target="#mckay_etal2014"/>; <ptr target="#mckay_etal2015"/>.</p>
						
						<p>To complete facets and help users in their discovery and selection of chapbooks, we
							chose to present each item in the list with preliminary metadata and a thumbnail
							of its first page (Figure 1). This information is extracted from the XML-TEI files
							and, for the thumbnails, generated with IIIF. The benefit of producing these data
							to users before they even click on an item is to distinguish one document from
							another. Indeed, it is common for chapbooks in our collection to have similar or
							identical titles. It can be the result of different printings of the same text, or
							different texts with the same title (Figure 2). Giving the title and the list of
							content (chapters, poems, songs, acts) is not enough, because different printings
							of the same text can have different layouts or woodcuts (Figure 3).</p>

							<head>Figure 2: Example of chapbooks with the same title: The first two documents
								(José María Moreno ed., s.d.) are different printings of the same text. The

						<p>Therefore, to facilitate search for our users, we choose to also add a thumbnail of
							the first page and the imprint (Figure 1). Following the usability guidelines
							defined by <ptr target="#nielsen2001"/>,
							with that information, users will not have to multiply clicks to know what is
							behind a title. They can distinguish, at a glance, different printings of the same
							text from different texts with the same title.</p>
						
						<p>However, the presence of thumbnails is not just a matter of disambiguation of
							chapbooks or an aesthetic choice. As a metaphor of the <hi rend="italic"
							>cordel</hi>, they reproduce the way Spanish chapbooks were sold and presented to
							19th-century readers. Indeed, to be sold, chapbooks were hung with clothespins on
							strings. The first thing bystanders saw was the first page, whose purpose was to
							attract them with catchy woodcuts and titles. With the thumbnails, we aim at
							offering a similar experience to our users without sacrificing the legibility or
							usability of our interface.</p>
						
						<p>Finally, as with facets, thumbnails are also a way to reproduce today’s readers’
							practices. Indeed, to choose a document in a physical library, each user has her
							own strategies and criteria such as the cover, the length and thickness of a
							document, the themes or the presence of illustrations <ptr target="#hinze_etal2012"/>; <ptr target="#mckay_etal2014"/>. To recreate a part of these practices
							and render an idea of the materiality of the documents, we decided to highlight
							the first page of chapbooks, and to give information about the number of pages and
							about the content inside.</p>
						
						<p>Thus, the design of this interface unites various uses acquired elsewhere, and the
							context of production and sale of chapbooks. An element can be chosen for reasons
							related to several levels of arguments. For instance, thumbnails can argue that
							(1) we use images as a powerful way to engage users with our interface <ptr target="#norman2007"/>; (2) our DL follows the practices in physical libraries and is aimed at
							users with a scholarly background, and (3) the appearance of chapbooks is a major
							component in their production and sale.</p>
						
						<p>After several months of use we implemented a new version of this interface, due to
							technical issues which became apparent at usage (Figure 4). Between the first and
							the second version of this interface, the conceptual and data arguments remain the
							same. Indeed, even with this new look, the facets still follow the concepts
							explained above. However, their usability has been improved toward a more
							minimalist design and more control over the interface for the users.</p>
						
						<p>Previously, facets followed the default behaviour of <hi rend="italic"
							>TEI-Publisher</hi>, which regenerates the list of documents when a facet is
							selected. Therefore, users were unable to select several facets at once, as the
							choice of a facet immediately triggered a request. We changed this default
							behaviour to let users select several keywords in different categories and submit
							their own request through a new button. This makes this interface more
							controllable, by allowing to easily do and undo requests <ptr target="#nielsen1994"/>. Users
							also have access to a help documentation that describes the different ways to
							search within the corpus.</p>
						
						<p>Another change was the use of collapsible categories to reduce the facets list so
							that users can see all of them at once. Finally, we made the navigation bar
							clearer and more explicit. The corpus, which is at the heart of the project, now
							appears first. It is followed by a <q>Results</q> tab containing the project’s
							productions, and the <q>About</q> tab, that now also contains the explanation of the
							project’s goals and of the editorial process. This new menu bar inscribes the
							project within an academic orientation and maintains its transparency.</p>

						<head>The interface of a digital edition</head>
						
						<p>When users click on an item in the list, they access a new page that presents the
							digital edition of the selected chapbook (Figure 5). The interface follows the
							tradition of digital diplomatic editions, by presenting the text and the facsimile
							side by side <ptr target="#sutherland_pierazzo2012" loc="200"/>; <ptr target="#pierazzo2017" loc="2"/>. Being unobtrusive, it fades behind the
							chapbook, which occupies a central place, and encourages its reading. Our goal is
							to <quote rend="inline">minimize the [users] memory</quote> <ptr target="#nielsen1994"/> and to reduce their mental load when they discover a page. If they want
							detailed information about the chapbook, they can display it with a set of
							buttons, that target different aspects of this type of content. For instance, the
							<q>Metadata</q> button provides bibliographical information about the document
							(dimensions, material, other prints, etc.), while the <q>Content</q> button gives an
							overview of the different parts that might compose the text (chapters, poems,
							songs, etc.).</p>
						
						<figure>
							<head>Figure 5: Notice of a chapbook (<hi rend="italic">Belardo y Lucinda</hi>, José María Moreno ed.,

								because there were no major changes. The first version of the website is
								available at <ref target="https://zenodo.org/record/7889635">https://zenodo.org/record/7889635</ref>(Consulted the
								03/05/2023).</note></head>
							<graphic url="resources/images/figure05.png"></graphic>
						</figure>
						
						<p>For expert users, the interface allows to go beyond the reading of the text. They
							can download the data in different formats (PDF, ePub, XML-TEI) and reuse them
							elsewhere<note> Providing different formats of our data is, for us, a way to
							ensure the transparency and reliability of our project, by enabling our users to
							see our raw data.</note>. They can also compare facsimiles using another
							visualisation tool, called <hi rend="italic">Mirador</hi>. Through the
							availability of two visualisation tools, the interface gives several levels of
							reading: a simple reading with the native tool provided by <hi rend="italic"
							>TEI-Publisher</hi>, and an advanced reading with <hi rend="italic">Mirador</hi>,
							which resembles a virtual workspace. Indeed, with this tool, users can add as many
							documents as they want in the same space to compare them, or to modify their
							appearance with image filters (opacity, contrast, etc.). The interface targets
							different user profiles: from a <hi rend="bold">passer-by reader</hi> who wants to collect information
							quickly and easily without spending too much time on the interface, to a
							<hi rend="bold">reader-user</hi>, interested in online reading, to an <hi rend="bold">expert user</hi>, looking for advanced
							functionalities and online analyses of text and document <ptr target="#rasmussen2016" loc="126–28"/>; <ptr target="#leblanc2019" loc="214–15"/>.</p>
						<p>The offer of these buttons and tools is in line with the usability recommendations
							for a flexible and personalized interface <ptr target="#nielsen1994"/>. It is also a reference to the literary axis of Spanish chapbooks studies,
							which is interested in <quote rend="inline">intertextual relationships between different items</quote> <ptr target="#gomis_botrel2019" loc="130–31"/>. Finally, this interface argues for the study of the
							<quote rend="inline">intermediality</quote> of chapbooks with the <quote rend="inline">Illustrations</quote> button. It lists the
							woodcuts present in the document and refers users to their respective notices, so
							they can analyze the relationship between a woodcut and a text, as well as the
							woodcut itself.</p>
					</div>
					
					
					<div>
						
						<head>The notice of a woodcut</head>
						
						<p>The notice of a woodcut follows the same structure as that of a DSE, with an image
							of the woodcut and its metadata side by side (Figure 6). Woodcuts are not often
							highlighted in other digital projects dedicated to Spanish chapbooks. Most of the
							time, these projects only state their presence, but without any other
							information<note> To our knowledge, only two projects offer a space dedicated to
							Spanish chapbook woodcuts: <hi rend="italic">Mapping Pliegos</hi> which uses
							Pinterest and its imageboards to classify woodcuts by topic, and <hi rend="italic"
							>Comedias Sueltas USA</hi> which is currently developing a catalogue dedicated to
							ornaments. Regarding English chapbooks, however, the project <hi rend="italic"
							>Broadside Ballads Online</hi> has adopted an approach like ours by proposing an
							image search engine to detect similar patterns in their corpus of
							illustrations.</note>. Yet, woodcuts play a central role in the characterisation
							of Spanish chapbooks as an editorial format and the understanding of popular
							culture. They are present on the first page of almost all documents. At first
							glance, they offer an anterior and parallel reading of the text, by giving readers
							some clues about its topics and its type <ptr target="#botrel2001"/>; <ptr target="#botrel2014" loc="1"/>. They also manifest the way printers’ shops operated and were
							organized <ptr target="#bozalfernandez1979"/>; <ptr target="#vivas2010"/>; <ptr target="#garcia2018"/>. Indeed, some woodcuts were used several
							times not only by a same printer on different chapbooks, but also by different
							printers across Spain: some stocks of woodcuts might have been bought or inherited
							by another printers; others might be copies of a preexisting woodcut <ptr target="#portus2000"/>.</p>
						
						<figure>
							<head>Figure 6: Notice of a woodcut (extracted from the chapbook <hi rend="italic">Pasillo de las
								Amazonas</hi>, José María Moreno, 1859)</head>
							<graphic url="resources/images/figure06.png"/>
						</figure>
						
						<p>The model of the interface we propose (Figure 6) highlights some of these
							specificities. First, woodcuts can help dating chapbooks, by observing traces of
							degradation from one woodcut to another, or by looking at the date of printing of
							the chapbooks, where there is one. Therefore, for the chapbook from which the
							woodcut has been extracted, and for the similar woodcuts, we add the date of
							printing. At first glance, users can make a hypothesis about the period during
							which a specific woodcut has been used. Then, by comparing the similar items, they
							might be able to narrow this hypothesis. For that, users can click on the button
							<q>Compare</q>, that opens a new window with an implementation of the image comparison
							application VDIFF<note> VDIFF is a JavaScript application, developed and
							maintained by the Center for Open Data in the Humanities (CODH) of the University
							of Tokyo <ptr target="#homma2022"/>.</note>. It provides an interface to compare the differences between two
							images through different visualizations (image superposition, side-by-side view,
							etc.).</p>
						
						<p>The metadata also specify the title of the chapbooks where an illustration can be
							found. That gives an idea of the type of text, often indicated in the title, and
							of the subjects with which an illustration is most often used. For instance, in
							our example (Figure 5), the illustration of this woman is associated with stories
							about royal families. Considering the type of text, it is mostly used with <hi
							rend="italic">romances</hi> <note> The word <hi rend="italic">romance</hi> has not
							to be confused with its equivalent in English. In Spain, it <quote rend="inline">refers to the meter
							that has been most popular since medieval times, consisting of octosyllabic lines
							of verse with assonant rhymes in even lines</quote> <ptr target="#gomis_botrel2019" loc="128"/>. As numerous Spanish chapbooks used this type of
							versification, the word <hi rend="italic">romance</hi> has come to define the
							“printed material” itself (<hi rend="italic">ibid.</hi>).</note>, a very popular
							genre in Spanish chapbooks.</p>
						
						<p>The presence of the title of the originator chapbook is also a way to stress the
							link between text and images. Indeed, as we explained previously, the first thing
							bystanders saw on chapbooks kiosks was the first page, and with it the
							illustrations. But the first thing they heard and their first contact with the
							content were titles, as peddlers were declaiming them in the streets <ptr target="#catedra2002"/>; <ptr target="#castellano2016"/>. Then, by putting these two pieces of information side by
							side, the interface stresses the close connection that exists between
							illustrations and titles, which form a semantic block. It is a valued information
							to understand chapbooks and the way they were conceived by printers.</p>
						
						<p>Finally, users have the possibility to navigate from the notice of a woodcut to the
							edition of the text, and vice versa. By looking at the whole chapbook, they can
							study the position of an illustration on the page, as well as the possible other
							illustrations it is used with to form a scene. If we go back to our example, in
							our corpus, this lady is always used on the front page with woodcuts representing
							kings and soldiers. From there, we could navigate from the edition to the notice
							of these other illustrations (Figure 4)<note> We are currently devising a way to
							ease the study of the scenes, which now supposes multiple clicks and a good
							control of the interface.</note>.</p>
						
						<p>Again, the way we organise the information on the page allows several levels of
							interpretation. Users could analyse the illustration for itself, for example to
							look at the representation of specific patterns, or to study woodcut techniques in
							19th-century Spain. They could also explore the links between different
							illustrations, the similar ones, and the ones that form a scene on a specific
							chapbook. Lastly, they could investigate its connections with text – through the
							titles and the whole text, as DSE and woodcuts are interconnected.</p>

					<head>Influence of the tools on the design of an interface</head>
					
					<p>The choice of a backbone software is guided by a project’s needs and objectives, but in
						return, this software might open new design perspectives through the functionalities
						it offers and the way it works. Undoubtedly, the appearance of our interface and its
						services have been influenced by the tool we used to develop them, the web application
						<hi rend="italic">TEI-Publisher</hi>. If we compare our interface with some other <hi
						rend="italic">TEI-Publisher</hi>-based projects, such as <hi rend="italic"
						>Antonomaz</hi> or <hi rend="italic">DiScholEd</hi> (Figure 7), we can find common
						design patterns that inscribe these projects in the same community of practices — for
						instance, the composition of the menu bar, the presence of filters, the position of
						the facets on the page or the search bar.</p>
					
					<figure>
						<head>Figure 7: Homepages of the projects <hi rend="italic">Antonomaz</hi> and <hi rend="italic">DiScholEd</hi></head>
						<graphic url="resources/images/figure07.jpg"/>
					</figure>
					
					<p>Without knowing anything about <hi rend="italic">TEI-Publisher</hi>, a user could
						easily see that <hi rend="italic">Untangling the cordel</hi> shares something in
						common with these two projects, just by observing the way the three of them are
						organized. Some elements are indeed predefined by the software and cannot be
						overridden without editing the core code of <hi rend="italic">TEI-Publisher</hi>,
						which would go against its purposes in terms of sustainability <ptr target="#e-editiones_n.d."/>. One could argue that this software leads to an uniformization of the DSEs’
						interfaces, but what makes each project unique and specific is the meaning it puts
						into each of the components of its interface, a meaning that is induced by its
						objectives and its data. For instance, the interfaces of <hi rend="italic">Untangling
						the cordel</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Antonomaz</hi> are similar because their data
						and their objectives are similar: both aim at studying and promoting ephemera,
						respectively in 19th-century Spain and in 17th-century France. However, the interface
						of <hi rend="italic">DiScholEd</hi> argues for a hub that contains several DSEs of
						correspondences. If we go further in the interface of these projects, we observe that,
						regarding the presentation of the documents, each project has adopted different
						perspectives. While, as we saw previously, <hi rend="italic">Untangling the
						cordel</hi> offers reading editions, <hi rend="italic">Antonomaz</hi> chooses to
						highlight the facsimile. As for <hi rend="italic">DiShcolEd</hi>, it provides a
						synoptic edition that allows users to see varied information at once (Figure 8).</p>
					
					<figure>
						<head>Figure 8: Examples of a digital edition of a notice on the project <hi rend="italic">Antonomaz</hi>
							<ref target="https://antonomaz.huma-num.fr/exist/apps/Antonomaz/corpus/Moreau52_GBOOKS.xml">(https://antonomaz.huma-num.fr/exist/apps/Antonomaz/corpus/Moreau52_GBOOKS.xml)</ref>
							and of a letter on the project DiScholEd
							<ref target="https://discholed.huma-num.fr/exist/apps/discholed/pec/corpus/Lettre0001_15aout1914.xml">(https://discholed.huma-num.fr/exist/apps/discholed/pec/corpus/Lettre0001_15aout1914.xml)</ref></head>
						<graphic url="resources/images/figure08.jpg"/>
					</figure>
					
					<p>These different representations of DSEs are possible because of the way <hi
						rend="italic">TEI-Publisher</hi> works. Indeed, one of key-concepts of this software
						is the one of web-components<note> Web-components are a W3C standard. They can be seen
						as blocks that contain the HTML code, the CSS and the Javascript needed by a specific
						functionality to function.</note>. They can be considered as blocks, each one
						corresponding to a functionality. For example, there is a web-component for displaying
						facsimiles, another for creating a map, and another for adding a simple search
						bar<note> A list of the <hi rend="italic">TEI-Publisher</hi>’s web-components can be
						found through an API: <ref
						target="https://unpkg.com/@teipublisher/pb-components@1.30.3/dist/api.html"
						>https://unpkg.com/@teipublisher/pb-components@1.30.3/dist/api.html</ref> [Accessed 28
						march 2023].</note>. These blocks can be combined with each other to build an
						interface: even if they share a common look, the way they are laid out on a page is
						specific to each project. Like TEI, <hi rend="italic">TEI-Publisher</hi> is a modular
						and flexible tool that allows editors and designers to represent a DSE in different
						ways. It provides a framework to help them make their own <quote rend="inline">rhetorical argumen</quote>t
						(Andrews and van Zundert 2018, 8) about their data and their conception of a DL and
						DSEs.</p>
					
					<p>Finally, our experience with <hi rend="italic">TEI-Publisher</hi> leads us to consider
						that it does not only influence the design of our website, but also our data model.
						Usually, a clear distinction is made between content and its form <ptr target="#andrews_zundert2018" loc="8"></ptr>: when we work with XML, we start by examining the meaning of
						the data, then think about their visualisation with scripts and stylesheets. However,
						in this case, some of our editing choices have been determined by the way the tool
						functions. For instance, the way we display facsimiles does not follow the
						prescriptions made by the XML-TEI community but simplifies them.</p>
					
					<p>No project operates in isolation. It is influenced by the design of other projects, by
						the expectations of their scientific communities, by the type of digital edition
						chosen or by the tools used, whether software (<hi rend="italic">eXist-DB</hi>, <hi
						rend="italic">TEI-Publisher</hi>, <hi rend="italic">EVT</hi>) or libraries (<hi
						rend="italic">Bootstrap</hi>). In the last case, the choice of standard technologies
						argues for the awareness of a project about interoperability and sustainability
						issues, and about what is advised and acknowledged by its scientific community.</p>
				</div>
				
				
				<div>
					
					<head>Conclusions</head>
					
					<p>The design of our interface relies on ergonomic and scholarly considerations, that
						reflects the nature of our corpus and our goals. If we return to the three levels of
						arguments defined by Andrews and van Zundert, from a usability perspective, the
						interface of <hi rend="italic">Untangling the cordel</hi> argues for a minimalist
						design, that leaves space for data and personalisation. Whether it is with the list of
						chapbooks or their notice, it does not impose a predefined way to interact with data,
						but let users decide which functionalities or information they want to display.</p>
					<p>The conceptual level of our interface is related both to the model of a DL and of a
						DSE. On one hand, the interface argues that our DL follows the model of a physical
						library. It reuses concepts and practices common to analogue libraries, such as the
						way users select their books, and can thus be perceived as their extension. On the
						other hand, it argues that our DSEs are reading editions, favourable to a “solitary
						concentration”
						<?biblio ADDIN ZOTERO_ITEM CSL_CITATION {"citationID":"u2DLssg9","properties":{"formattedCitation":"(Andrews and van Zundert 2018, 16)","plainCitation":"(Andrews and van Zundert 2018, 16)","noteIndex":0},"citationItems":[{"id":1073,"uris":["http://zotero.org/users/2779164/items/PSWPRTWX"],"itemData":{"id":1073,"type":"chapter","container-title":"Scholarly Digital Editions as Interfaces","event-place":"Norderstedt","ISBN":"978-3-7481-0925-9","language":"en","note":"Google-Books-ID: etB6DwAAQBAJ","page":"3-33","publisher":"BoD – Books on Demand","publisher-place":"Norderstedt","source":"Google Books","title":"What Are You Trying to Say?

						and van Zundert 2018, 16), by according a central place to text and facsimiles.</p>
					<p>Finally, regarding the third level and what the DL and DSEs say about our data, the
						layout of the interface underlines the intertextuality or “intermediality” of Spanish
						chapbooks. By offering various levels of analysis, it allows to study components of a
						chapbook separately (document, text, or woodcuts) or in relation with each other.</p>
					<p>In conclusion, working with the levels of arguments proposed by Andrews and van Zundert
						helped us in the creation of our interface by providing us a frame and a better
						perception of the meaning we put in each component and design choices. We believe that
						following this method is a way to encourage the study of interfaces and their
						long-term preservation, thus joining the recommendations made by Claire Warwick in her
						recent paper.</p>
					<p>No interface is neutral: deliberately or not, it tells something about a project at a
						given moment, its values, or its perceptions of a specific subject. When it comes to
						the development of a digital interface, it is important to keep in mind that designing
						is not just about the way an interface looks like (the <hi rend="italic">dessin</hi>
						in French), but also about its intention and meaning (the <hi rend="italic"
						>dessein</hi>).</p>
