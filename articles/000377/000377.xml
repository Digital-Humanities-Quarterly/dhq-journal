                <p> Digital humanities have a long tradition of using advanced computational
                    techniques and machine learning to aid humanistic enquiry. In this paper, we
                    concentrate on a specific subfield of machine learning called predictive
                    analytics and its use in digital humanities. Predictive analytics has evolved
                    from descriptive analytics, which creates summaries of data, while predictive
                    analytics predicts relationships within the data that also help to explain new
                    data. Predictive analytics uses machine learning techniques but also traditional
                    statistical methods. It uses properties (or features) of the data to predict
                    another target feature in the data. Machine learning is used by predictive
                    analytics to establish the rules that given a certain combination of features
                    make the target more or less likely. Predictive analytics can thus be considered
                    to be a technique to machine-read data. The paper discusses the background of
                    predictive analytics, its use for predicting the past and finally presents a
                    case study in predicting past gender relations in a historical dataset.
                    Predicting the past is introduced as a method to explore relationships in past
                    data.</p>

                <p>Digital humanities have a long tradition of using advanced computational
                    techniques and machine learning to aid humanistic enquiry <ptr target="#juola2008"/>
                    <ptr target="#jockers2010"/>
                    <ptr target="#rohle2012"/>. <ptr target="#blanke2013"/> have shown how machine
                    learning has become part of the scholarly infrastructure of digital humanities
                    while <ptr target="#anderson2010"/> place it firmly within the methodology
                    commons of digital humanities. Beyond machine learning’s application in academic
                    research in the digital humanities, several initiatives have explored the
                    relationship of machine learning to cultural heritage institutions. The British
                    Library, for instance, has developed a machine learning experiment <ptr target="#britishlibrary2015"/> to engage computer science students with
                    digital heritage collections. While this experiment works with images, most
                    digital humanities and machine learning approaches use textual data <ptr target="#argamon2009"/>, exploiting text mining techniques such as
                    clustering or topic modelling.</p>
                <p>With recent advances, machine learning has led to several new application areas.
                    In this paper, we concentrate on predictive analytics for digital humanities, as
                    it has evolved from descriptive analytics <ptr target="#abbott2014"/>.
                    Descriptive analytics creates summaries of data, while predictive analytics
                    predicts relationships within data that also help to explain new data.
                    Predictive analytics employs both machine learning techniques and traditional
                    statistical methods. It uses properties (or features) of the data to predict
                    another target feature in the data. Machine learning helps establish the rules
                    that given a certain combination of features make the target more or less
                    likely. Predictive analytics can thus be considered to be a technique to
                    machine-read data <ptr target="#abbott2014"/>.</p>
                <p>In the perception of the public, predictive analytics has been linked to
                    predicting the future <ptr target="#anadiotis2016"/>. However, the academic
                    literature has a more varied view on predictive analytics. The ideas of
                    predicting the future are expanded to the art of the predicting the present <ptr target="#choi2012"/> and also the <soCalled>past</soCalled>
                    <ptr target="#schutt2013"/>. Google’s chief economist, Hal Varian, contends that
                    queries that users enter into Google’s search engine describe how they feel and
                    act in <soCalled>real time</soCalled>
                    <ptr target="#choi2012"/>. Alongside predicting the future and the present,
                        <soCalled>predicting the past</soCalled> is the maybe counter-intuitive
                    prediction of past performance by joining historical datasets. In criminology,
                    for instance, predicting the past could lead to <cit>
                        <quote rend="inline" source="#wang2013">more precise attribution of past crimes, and the
                            apprehension of suspects</quote>
                        <ptr target="#wang2013" loc="515"/>
                    </cit>. </p>
                <p>Predicting the past creates new relations between datasets rather than
                    anticipating the future. In this paper, we discuss predictive analytics as a
                    method to understand relations of the past and proceed by exploring the
                    prediction of genders in an example dataset. Predicting the past is introduced
                    as a method examining datasets about the past using machine learning.</p>

                <head>Background and Methodology</head>
                <p>Computational prediction has attracted much interest recently as part of the new
                    field called <soCalled>predictive analytics</soCalled>. Abbott is one of the
                    most famous practitioners in the field <ptr target="#abbott2014"/>. For him,
                    predictive analytics work on <cit>
                        <quote rend="inline" source="#abbott2014">discovering interesting and meaningful patterns in
                            data. It draws from several related disciplines, some of which have been
                            used to discover patterns in data for more than 100 years, including
                            pattern recognition, statistics, machine learning, artificial
                            intelligence, and data mining.</quote>
                        <ptr target="#abbott2014" loc="29"/>
                    </cit>. Predictive analytics brings together all these traditions, but is
                    commonly misunderstood and reduced to attempts to predicting the future. Fear
                    and critique of computational prediction is often linked to a dystopian future
                    where the movie <title rend="italic">Minority Report</title> comes to life and
                    all our existence is pre-determined and governed by analytics. However,
                    predictive analytics, as this paper will show, is a much more diversified
                    discipline and offers digital humanities researchers exciting opportunities to
                    read their data. </p>
                <p>Predictive analytics is about developing meaningful relationships in any data,
                    machine-reading it and making sense of it. Compared to traditional analytics,
                    predictive analytics is driven by the data under observation rather than
                    primarily by human assumptions of the data. It strives to automate modelling and
                    finding patterns as far as this is possible. But in principle <cit>
                        <quote rend="inline" source="#abbott2014">predictive analytics doesn’t do anything that any
                            analyst couldn’t accomplish with pencil and paper or a spreadsheet if
                            given enough time; (…).</quote>
                        <ptr target="#abbott2014" loc="30"/>
                    </cit>.</p>
                <p>Most attention in predictive analytics has been given to predicting the future
                    and present. Schutt and O'Neil, however, also offer a new idea of predicting the
                    past <ptr target="#schutt2013"/>. In 2007, new large amounts of electronic
                    health records (EHR) and related data allowed the Federal Drug Agency (FDA) to
                    set up new monitoring programmes for drugs. Among the new programmes, the
                    Sentinel project worked on large-scale data integration. For Schutt and O'Neil,
                    these integrated datasets were the foundation of novel research attempts to
                    predict the past. They cite the <soCalled>Observational Medical Outcomes
                        Partnership (OMOP)</soCalled> in the US that investigates how good we are at
                    predicting what we already know about drug performance in health using past
                    datasets. Once OMOP had integrated data from heterogeneous sources, it began to
                    consider predicting the past of old drug cases and how effective their
                    treatments were. </p>
                <p>In this sense, predicting the past tries to understand how <cit>
                        <quote rend="inline" source="#schutt2013">well the current methods do on predicting things we
                            actually already know</quote>
                        <ptr target="#schutt2013"/>
                    </cit>. Rather than targeting new knowledge on the past directly, predicting the
                    past is here understood as a means of evaluating existing methods. An existing
                    example that implies predicting past events by joining historical datasets, is
                    the identification of historical spatio-temporal patterns of IED usage by the
                    Provisional Irish Republican Army during <q>The Troubles</q>, used to attribute
                        <q>historical behaviour of terrorism</q>
                    <ptr target="#tench2016"/> . Analysing predictive policing, Aradau and Blanke
                    demonstrate how past joined-up datasets are already used to develop profiles of
                    suspects <ptr target="#aradau2016"/>. The authors also present a methodology how
                    to criticise predictions techniques and their abstracted similarities. Katz,
                    Bommarito et al. offer a <q>generalized, and fully predictive model of Supreme
                        Court voting behavior</q>’ in the United States <ptr target="#katz2014"/>.</p>
                <p>For the study of the past, Weisskopf states the general interest in predicting
                    the past: <cit>
                        <quote rend="inline" source="#weisskopf1984">There is also such a thing as a prediction of the past,
                            "retrodiction," when conclusions are drawn with regard to the yet
                            unexplored previous history of a given set of objects.</quote>
                        <ptr target="#weisskopf1984"/>
                    </cit>. There remain, however, concerns in the humanities with regard to the
                    predictability of the human condition. Firat captures this sentiment, when he
                    questions the value of these approaches for understanding the nuances humanities
                    research is interested in: <cit>
                        <quote rend="inline" source="#firat1987">This is exactly why [statistical] approaches of this
                            kind are antithetical to both explanation and understanding. They can
                            predict, but since the techniques used lack information on or evidence
                            of underlying characteristics, they cannot provide the answer to why the
                            central tendency in one variable is related to the central tendency in
                            another.</quote>
                        <ptr target="#firat1987"/>
                    </cit>. Popper’s rejection of prediction in the human sciences as pseudo-science
                        <ptr target="#popper1974"/> is often referred to in this context in order to
                    underline the impossibility of prediction in the humanities. The study of
                    cultural phenomena is too complex and different to be predicted in terms of
                    statistical aggregates. Digital humanities are able to avoid such criticisms and
                    engage with prediction by staying close to datasets, as we will demonstrate.
                    Then, prediction does not have to be about grand explanations of history that
                    Popper’s critique targets. It rather is about the distant reading of these
                    datasets. </p>
                <p>Digital humanities have started to engage with predictive analytics as a method
                    of reading past data rather than as a way to find regularities and laws in human
                    history. Manovich, for instance, explains the theoretical and conceptual
                    background of predictive analytics as well as its applications in art history
                        <ptr target="#manovich2015"/>. Several archaeological studies have used
                    predictive techniques to explore datasets about ancient societies <ptr target="#gaffney2008"/>
                    <ptr target="#stanley2012"/>. However, these studies are often focussed on
                    archaeological data only and remain theoretical investigations <ptr target="#jasinski2017"/>. Lincoln goes furthest in investigating predictive
                    analytics for the humanities and presents a case study on predicting the past in
                    the context of art history <ptr target="#lincoln2017"/>. He is a data scientist

                    </cit>. Working for Getty, Lincoln’s predictive analysis investigates historical
                    patterns of artwork sales rather than understanding the composition of scholarly
                    concepts. Nevertheless, he provides a good overview of the steps and benefits
                    involved in the use of predictive analytics. </p>
                <p>This paper brings together Lincoln’s and others ideas about predicting the past
                    in digital humanities with the suggestions of Schutt and O'Neil to use the
                    approach to test existing models with past datasets <ptr target="#schutt2013"/>.
                    We are concerned both with the exploratory power of models to understand past
                    relations in data and with the methodological innovation and evaluation of
                    existing models. Thus, we compare a traditional model of predicting past data
                    using dictionaries with machine learning strategies. First, a classification
                    algorithm is discussed and then three different rule-based learners are
                    introduced. We can demonstrate how these rule-based learners are an effective
                    alternative to the dictionary-based method and partly outperform it. As they
                    perform at least as well as the traditional method, we propose that the machine
                    learning approaches can be an alternative for digital humanities. </p>
                <p>The second objective of this paper is to introduce the <soCalled>predicting the
                        past</soCalled> methodology by means of an example dataset to predict gender
                    relationships. We demonstrate how predicting the past can complement and enhance
                    existing work in digital humanities. Any predictive analytics model works from
                    available observations to predict so-called target values. These targets need to
                    be extracted from the existing dataset. Labels are features to be predicted
                    based on features that are chosen as predictors. Once we have a target, we need
                    to understand which parts of the observations or features can be used to derive
                    the target labels. Often the features have to be modified to improve the
                    predictive performance. We will, for instance, merge various time-based features
                    for our case study. This feature extraction and engineering is a very
                    labour-intensive process. </p>
                <p>The most important consideration in predictive analytics is to derive a model
                    that generalises to new cases <ptr target="#bowles2015" loc="59"/>. Our aim is
                    to predict past data. Thus, we do not have any new data but set aside data from
                    the existing set to test how the prediction performs. We will indicate exactly
                    which proportion of the data we hold out to test the performance of the model.
                    In addition, we employ <soCalled>cross-validation</soCalled> to avoid
                    overfitting the data, one of the main risks in predictive models. An
                    ‘overfitting’ model is one that models existing training data too closely, which
                    negatively impacts its ability to generalize to new cases. Cross-validation uses
                    different partitions of the data into training and test data and creates a set
                    of subsamples and thus helps avoid overfitting <ptr target="#schutt2013"/>. The
                    training subset uses all-but-one subsample, while the model is validated on the
                    remaining subsample that functions as a test subset. The final performance is
                    then based on the average performance of all these different training and test
                    partitions. </p>
                <p>Overall, predicting the past borrows from predictive analytics the following
                    first steps:</p>
                <list type="ordered">
                    <item>Engineering the necessary features and predictors</item>
                    <item>Defining the training targets</item>
                    <item>Training a model</item>
                    <item>Evaluating the model performance with test data to eliminate
                        underperforming models. </item>
                </list>
                <p>However, predicting the past is also different from other predictive analytics
                    approaches, as the model is not prepared to understand new observations but to
                    analyse the relationships between existing ones, as outlined by Schutt and
                    O'Neil. The aim is to understand which (minimal) set of features makes it likely
                    that observation x includes target feature y. In our, case we would like to
                    understand which combination of features make it likely that a historical person
                    is of gender female, male or unknown. </p>
                <p>The next step in our methodology is therefore to apply the best performing models
                    to the whole dataset again rather than to the test data only, as it is standard
                    practice in predictive analytics. The model then reveals the rules that govern
                    the determination of gender, but also cases that should interest us further such
                    as misclassifications or disagreements. This analysis is the main objective of
                    our method. For instance, we investigate in detail which features contribute
                    most to the performance of our prediction. Does an English location, for
                    instance, make it more likely that the target gender is female or male or
                    unknown? An increase in performance of the prediction indicates that the added
                    features contain useful information to determine gender. Finally and following
                    Schutt and O'Neil, we compare a number of prediction methods to find the one
                    that is most reliable and useful for our analysis <ptr target="#schutt2013"/>.
                    Predicting the past can thus be understood as a <soCalled>spam filter</soCalled>
                    for various methods that could be used to predict historical categories in a
                    dataset Schutt and O'Neil. Once we have achieved the optimal models even
                    prediction errors will help us understand the relationships in the underlying
                    data, as we will describe. These errors can be as significant as successful
                    classifications for understanding relationships in the data. </p>

                <p>Before we can proceed with the predictive analytics, we need to unlock the data
                    to get an understanding of how we can work with it. In particular, we work
                    through a series of exploratory steps to prepare the predictive analytics. We
                    will first get an overview of the cases and observations as well as the features
                    that are used to describe each observation. Here, it is particularly important
                    that we relate the number of observations to the number of features as only with
                    the right amount of observations we have enough combinations of features that
                    will allow us to build the right predictive model. Models need to have far fewer
                    features (also called degrees of freedom) than observations. Secondly, we
                    determine how many categorical and numerical features we will work with.
                    Thirdly, we develop a strategy how to work with missing values, which are very
                    common in historical datasets. Finally and in order to understand a possible
                    direction of travel for the predictive analytics, summary statistics and plots
                    are deployed. </p>
                <p>In order to experiment with predictive analytics and demonstrate our approach, we
                    decided on modelling gender predictions following on to the pioneering work by
                    Blevins and Mullen <ptr target="#blevins2015"/>. We try to understand which
                    algorithmic gender prediction technique could identify genders best. Please note
                    that we do not make claims about the possibilities to predict the actual genders
                    but the genders as expressed in the data. Any underlying gender issues in the
                    datasets will be reproduced and at no point do we claim that our algorithm
                    understands gender better than what is in the data. As described, predicting the
                    past does not mean to develop meta-theory of the past but to closely describe
                    the data.</p>
                <p>In order to facilitate reuse of datasets and future integration, humanities data
                    journals have started to appear that offer an opportunity to publish and receive
                    recognition for research data outputs. One of the first humanities data journals
                    in Europe is the <title rend="italic">Journal of Open Humanities Data</title><note>
                        <ref target="http://openhumanitiesdata.metajnl.com/">http://openhumanitiesdata.metajnl.com/</ref></note> published by
                    Ubiquity Press. The first dataset published by the journal was <title rend="quotes">Vagrant Lives: 14,789 Vagrants Processed by the County of
                        Middlesex, 1777–1786</title> by Adam Crymble, Louise Falcini and Tim
                    Hitchcock <ptr target="#crymble2015"/>. We have chosen <soCalled>Vagrant
                        Lives</soCalled> as an example dataset, as it is currently the best we can
                    expect from data research output in data journals. It contains the well-curated
                    records of vagrant removals in the 18th century. At the time of writing, it
                    includes 14,789 records about vagrant incidences that happened between 1777 and
                    1786. </p>
                <p>The dataset was produced as part of the <title rend="quotes">Vagrant
                        Lives</title> project <ptr target="#crymble2015"/> and captures the work of
                    Henry Adams, the vagrant contractor for the UK county of Middlesex: <cit>
                        <quote rend="inline" source="#crymble2015">Eight times per year at each Middlesex Session of the
                            Peace, Adams submitted lists of moved vagrants to receive
                            remuneration</quote>
                        <ptr target="#crymble2015"/>
                    </cit>. Parts of these records are, however, missing, as it is typical for
                    historical datasets <ptr target="#anderson2010"/>. Rather than leaving missing
                    records empty, the creators of the dataset have helpfully indicated that the
                    records are missing from the original rather than being left out in the
                    transcription by adding specific values for the missing records. The entry
                        <soCalled>[unknown]</soCalled> designates a missing record for the vagrants.
                    Introducing an extra entry value for unknown records, should be seen as good
                    practice for humanities data, as otherwise we do not know whether the records
                    were incomplete in the first place. A predicting the past approach should
                    reproduce these unknowns, as they correspond to the data and not outside
                    background knowledge such as dictionaries of first names that determine their
                    gender. </p>
                <p>Next we explore the data using the Python programming language and in particular
                    the PANDAS environment and MatPlot toolkit <ptr target="#raschka2015"/>. A
                    typical entry in the dataset looks like:</p>
                <figure xml:id="figure01">
                    <head>Example Dataset in the PANDAS environment using the MatPlot toolkit</head>
                    <graphic url="resources/images/figure01.png"/>
                </figure>
                <p>As we can see, the dataset does not contain a direct gender feature, but the
                    gender of the vagrant is relatively easy to derive. The <soCalled>Gender of Lead
                        Vagrant</soCalled> is recorded as is the <soCalled>Relationship to the Lead
                        Vagrant</soCalled>. The latter is a categorical feature containing a limited
                    number of different types of entries. If it states <soCalled>[lead
                        vagrant]</soCalled> we can presume that the gender is identical to
                        <soCalled>Gender of Lead Vagrant</soCalled>. Otherwise, the
                        <soCalled>Relationship to the Lead Vagrant</soCalled> can be family
                    relationships such as <soCalled>wife</soCalled>, <soCalled>son</soCalled>, etc.,
                    which again allow us to derive the gender. In the few remaining cases (often
                    undefined children), we cannot conclude anything and declare the gender to be
                        <soCalled>unknown</soCalled>. The column <soCalled>Person Type</soCalled>
                    contains at first sight promising knowledge, too. It has values such as
                        <soCalled>Solo Male</soCalled> or <soCalled>Solo Female</soCalled>. But it
                    also contains not useful entries such as <soCalled>Dependant</soCalled> or
                        <soCalled>Group Leader</soCalled>. So, we decided to rely on
                        <soCalled>Gender of Lead Vagrant</soCalled> and <soCalled>Relationship to
                        the Lead Vagrant</soCalled> to derive the gender but will use
                        <soCalled>Person Type</soCalled> later to check whether our gender
                    derivations were correct. We arrived at the following gender distribution, which
                    we added to the vagrant dataset:</p>
                <figure xml:id="figure02">
                    <head>Genders in Vagrant Lives</head>
                    <graphic url="resources/images/figure02.png"/>
                </figure>
                <p>In order to confirm that gender can be derived from the two features gender of
                    the lead vagrant and relationship to the lead vagrant, we compare the feature
                        <soCalled>Person Type</soCalled> with the newly derived gender feature.
                    Table 1 shows that dependents dominate the list of unknown genders, while there
                    are two single females that are recorded as having unknown gender. Apart from
                    these two records, however, the dataset looks consistent. We have shown that our
                    derivation of genders from two features is consistent with a third feature
                        <soCalled>Person Type</soCalled> and that our target feature is consistent
                    with the data.</p>

                <p>Having gained an overview of the dataset’s features and having defined the target
                    feature gender, we can now start controlling the predictors and target features.
                    In predictive analytics, predictors are those features that a model uses to
                    predict a target feature, which is in our case the gender. The dataset is
                    relatively large for a historical dataset with over 14,000 entries. Despite this
                    large amount of data, prediction is made difficult by the fact that the data
                    contains a lot features (29 in total). The prediction space is thus sparse,
                    which is an obstacle to predictive analytics, because it is based on distances
                    of data points in the feature space <ptr target="#aradau2016"/>. <cit>
                        <quote rend="inline" source="#abbott2014">A]s the number of inputs increases, the number of data
                            points needed to fill the space comparably increases
                            exponentially.</quote>
                        <ptr target="#abbott2014" loc="153"/>
                    </cit>. With increasing numbers of features, the prediction performance first
                    increases but then rapidly decreases.</p>
                <p>Our feature density is clearly not high enough. As the reader might not be
                    familiar with the consequences, let us discuss briefly a simple example of 2
                    features having on average 5 different values each. This means we have 5x5 or 25
                    individual possible data points. Let us furthermore expand our existing vagrant
                    dataset a bit and assume we have 15,000 observations. With 15,000/25=600 we have
                    more than enough data (600) to cover every single possible case. With 29
                    features, however, we need 1.86e+20(=5 to the power of 29) observations to cover
                    all possible data points. This calculation is additionally based on the
                    simplified assumption that all 29 features have 5 different values each, while
                    many features in the Vagrant dataset contain more. Because most prediction work
                    is grounded in the reorganisation of these kind of data spaces and thinking
                    about how to bring the various observations together <ptr target="#aradau2016"/>, historical predictions are generally challenged by sparse data. To organise
                    the predictor features, the number of overall features has to be reduced.
                    Klingenstein, Hitchcock et al., for instance, demonstrate how this so-called
                        <soCalled>curse of dimensionality</soCalled> can be addressed in text
                    analytics by using a historical thesaurus to limit the vocabulary <ptr target="#klingenstein2014"/>.</p>
                <p>We must reduce the feature set and transform feature values into entities a
                    prediction model can work with. In our dataset, we can first remove all the
                    geo-references, as they are redundantly encoded in other columns such as
                        <soCalled>Taken from</soCalled> and <soCalled>Conveyed To</soCalled>. On the
                    other hand, because we would like to explore temporal relationships, we keep all
                    the relevant time features. But we can also reduce features here and merge all
                    the Session Start and Session End columns into one POSIX date column. The
                    Portable Operating System Interface (POSIX) is a way to standardize dates. Doing
                    so, we not only reduce the number of features but also enable a whole set of
                    data exploration techniques. <ref target="#figure03">Figure 3</ref>, for
                    instance, shows when new magistrates first appear in the dataset. As the Figure
                    clearly includes various local maxima and is overall skewed to the right, the
                    data is unevenly composed, either because of a relevant trend we should
                    investigate further or, as it is more likely in this case, because records
                    contain missing values for the earlier dates. Finally, we transformed the newly
                    created POSIX date features ‘Session Start’ and ‘Session End’ into absolute
                    differences in seconds from a cut-off date. This quantification will help with
                    our machine-learning approaches.</p>
                <figure xml:id="figure03">
                    <head>New magistrates in Vagrant Lives</head>
                    <graphic url="resources/images/figure03.png"/>
                </figure>
                <p>For the rest of the features we factorized (value-indexed) the 9 categorical
                    features and added them to the remaining 3 numerical columns that measure
                    temporal relationships. In total, we therefore considered 12 features instead of
                    29; still too many for the size of the dataset but a much better foundation.
                    Later on, we will work on the further reduction by using feature selection
                    techniques and will be able to reduce the overall number of significant features
                    to 5. </p>
                <p>As described above, our exploratory analysis concludes with summary plots of the
                    data in order to better understand potential relationships the predictive
                    analysis could target. Typical graphical techniques explore the connection
                    between two features and provide new viewpoints on the data. A grouping by the
                        <soCalled>Taken From</soCalled> feature, for instance, reveals that most
                    vagrants were taken from their house without further location specification.
                    This has twice the number of entries compared to the next place
                        <soCalled>Clerkenwell</soCalled>.</p>

                </figure>
                <p>Similarly, we can determine that the most active magistrate is Richard Clark.</p>

                </figure>
                <p>However, data exploration has clear limitations when it comes to a larger number
                    of (non-numerical) features, as they are common in the digital humanities. An
                    exploration of two features and their relationship fits easily with the
                    two-dimensional layout of paper, but for three features we already need a
                    combination of graphs and axes to make the visualisation work. <ref target="#figure06">Figure 6</ref> shows how three perspectives on the
                    timeline of events can be integrated. We can identify the uneven distribution of
                    the data, but also that most cases were recorded in the second half of the year.
                    Beyond three features the visual representation becomes more and more
                    complicated in an two-dimensional layout. Predictive analytics allows for a
                    higher number of features to be integrated than possible for a typical
                    exploratory analysis that targets plots.</p>

                    <head>Three-dimensional comparison of session times</head>
                    <graphic url="resources/images/figure06.png"/>
                </figure>
                <p>Finally, it is difficult to represent in plots the non-numerical, categorical
                    data that dominates the humanities. The mosaic plot <ptr target="#schutt2013"/>
                    is an example that is popular to present the relationship between categorical
                    features, but its exact proportions are often difficult to decipher. It is,
                    therefore, no wonder that visualisations in the digital humanities commonly
                    exploit continuous features such as timelines or word counts <ptr target="#janicke2015"/>. Predicting the past on the other hand would be able
                    to exploit methods that could work with categorical data more effectively than
                    visualisations, but that also often means we work with complex and therefore
                    opaque models, which need to be analysed carefully <ptr target="#aradau2016"/>. </p>
                <p>Shmueli asks whether <q>To Explain or to Predict?</q>' and presents both as
                    necessary for developing insights but from a different viewpoint on the
                    underlying data. For data exploration, <cit>

                    </cit>. Typical operations for explanatory modelling include statistical tests
                    to ensure that the observations support an assumed theoretical relationship –
                    often expressed as a curve <ptr target="#schutt2013"/>. Furthermore, where the
                    theory is not directly observable, observations are linked to theoretical
                    concepts. This step includes the use of established theories and knowledge to
                    link concepts and observations. If exploration is about the further development
                    of existing theories, a model is predictive and about new insights and
                    generalisations from known insights to new ones. According to Abbott, prediction
                    is about systematically determining the relationship between features beyond
                    data visualisation and is itself embedded in iterative improvements of the
                    developed model, which provide new insights at each step <ptr target="#abbott2014"/>. </p>
                <p>In the following sections, we explore the predicting the past approach further by
                    comparing different models to predict genders in Vagrant Lives. The first one
                    uses a <soCalled>theory</soCalled> and history of first names and their
                    relationships with genders. This approach is common in the digital humanities
                    and can be seen as a baseline to compare other predictive analytics approaches.
                    All these methods can help on the one hand side explain how historical decisions
                    are divided according to genders and on the other hand side they have a very
                    practical application as the imputation of missing values in historical
                    datasets. As imputation is trying to derive missing values, it can be considered
                    to be a (simple) prediction technique.</p>

                <p>Blevins and Mullen provide an explanation as to why digital humanities should be
                    interested in predicting genders. Gender values are often missing from datasets
                    and need to be imputed <ptr target="#blevins2015"/>. As humanities data will
                    contain many empty records <ptr target="#anderson2012"/>, understanding
                    imputation is fundamental to digital humanities. In this section, we will
                    compare two methods based on the ideas in <ptr target="#blevins2015"/> to impute
                    missing values of genders. Both presented methods assign a gender to a vagrant
                    using the given name. The first one uses a single dictionary of names with many
                    international names, while the second one employs a dictionary, which is split
                    according to time periods but always from English-speaking communities. Blevins
                    and Mullen present an ensemble approach that is based on collecting many given
                    names' dictionaries into an R script, which takes a vote count of all the
                    different dictionaries on whether a given name is more likely to be male or
                    female <ptr target="#blevins2015"/>. </p>
                <p>Dictionaries are used in many prediction scenarios and help not just to read
                    first names but also determine sentiments <ptr target="#grimmer2013"/> – among
                    other things. For gender predictions using dictionaries, Blevins and Mullen
                    discuss the many issues linked to such an approach <ptr target="#blevins2015"/>.
                    Firstly, names might change over time their gender. Leslie, for instance,
                    changed from being a male name to a mainly a female name in the English-speaking
                    world. There are secondly, however, even more serious issues with
                    dictionary-based prediction, which could heavily influence our understanding of
                    the underlying data. Dictionary approaches assume that the data is completely
                    missing at random and that we are speaking about missing or wrongly assigned
                    data and want to impute it with the correct data. The algorithm then determines
                    the <soCalled>correct</soCalled> value of the gender by guessing it from the
                    most common association with the name. But data can also be missing not at
                    random, because, for instance, the way the data was gathered had issues. Missing
                    out on genders can be a simple mistake but might also point to the impossibility
                    to determine — in this case — gender at the point of gathering the data. Maybe
                    the question of gender was simply impossible to answer for a certain vagrant,
                    which would probably also be the most interesting cases. Recognising this, the
                    creators of the vagrant dataset have included the class [unknown] for gender. It
                    is the assumption of this article that a critical (computer) reading of data
                    would require us to keep being aware of the critical distinction of why values
                    are missing and not equate to <soCalled>incorrect</soCalled> entries.</p>

                    </note> As can be seen in the confusion matrix, the algorithm predicts known
                    genders very well. The matrix shows the predicted genders in the horizontal axis
                    and the gender in the vertical ones. Each cell describes a combination of gender
                    and predicted gender. For the recorded male and female genders, the algorithm
                    predicts the correct gender. There are only very few inaccuracies such as 8
                    females that were predicted to be male. Not surprisingly, for the unknown
                    genders there are more errors. The dictionary is based on contemporary names and
                    predicts an unknown gender for 832 vagrants that are either male of female
                    (~21%). The kappa score is 0.911. A kappa statistic considers the possibility of
                    randomly correct predictions, which is something we want to exclude. It measures
                    the observed level of agreement between prediction and actual gender compared to
                    the expected one if the two gender-assignments were totally independent <ptr target="#pmean2008"/>. A kappa value of 1 indicates a best agreement and 0
                    the worst. 0.91 can be seen as excellent. The dictionary-based method thus shows
                    great promise, as Blevins and Mullen have also demonstrated <ptr target="#blevins2015"/>. </p>
                <p>In a second dictionary-based approach, we tried to add a historical focus and
                    downloaded the dataset from <ptr target="#ssa2017"/> focussing on historical
                    names. We chose a subset of names that were prominent in the 19th century. As
                    far as we understand Blevins and Mullen, this is the simplified version
                    of their own approach, but using Python instead of R and employing no ensemble
                    method. Results were worse than the generic dictionary-based model. Overall
                    2,084 gender records were assigned wrongly, which corresponds to a kappa value
                    of 0.79. While this might seem at first disappointing, there are several reasons
                    why the performance might be worse. Either some of the more modern names in <ptr target="#ssa2017"/> were not as modern as we anticipated or, which is also
                    likely for vagrants, some of the names in the datasets did not originate in the
                    English-language world. A dictionary-based approach will not only be dependent
                    on the historical use of words but also on the language used. </p>
                <p>Overall, however, this does not change the result that the dictionary-based
                    approach delivers excellent results. We could easily address the worse
                    performance in the second approach by adding additional dictionaries, as Blevins
                    and Mullen have done <ptr target="#blevins2015"/>. If one is willing to
                    put in the additional work, at some point one will have a perfect combination of
                    dictionaries predicting gender with a very high accuracy. However, this also
                    requires a lot of manual effort creating these dictionaries for various
                    languages and cultures and for different time periods.</p>
                <p>Let us take a closer look at the detailed results of the first dictionary-based
                    algorithm and any inconsistencies that might reveal interesting relations.
                    Vagrant 7980.1.1 is called <soCalled>Jesse Paine</soCalled> and considered
                    female in the dataset. Jesse, however, is historically the father of King David
                    in the Old Testament and therefore the algorithm assigned a male gender. So,
                    this is either a recording mistake or a historically unique Jesse. In total 5
                    Edwards, Williams and James are also recorded as females, which indicate that
                    these historical male names of English kings have been given to females. On the
                    other hand, vagrant 3849.1 is called <soCalled>Uphan McGregory</soCalled>, which
                    the dictionary-based algorithm fails to assign a gender value.</p>
                <p><ref target="#figure08">Figure 8</ref> presents the most commonly misclassified
                    'female' names according to the first dictionary-based method. We will discuss
                    the misclassified names later in more detail when we compare the results with
                    other algorithms. </p>

                <head>Prediction using data-driven techniques: classification and rule-based</head>
                <p>In many ways, the dictionary-based approach follows traditional work in the
                    humanities. Computers are faster at looking up items in a dictionary but
                    fundamentally there is no difference here between how a human might approach
                    this problem and a computer. The dictionary approach imitates human techniques
                    to predict the right gender value and is an established method in the digital
                    humanities. Thus, we can use it as a baseline to test predictive analysis of the
                    past with two approaches using machine learning. Regression and rule-based
                    classification are among the best performing models for high-dimensional data
                    according to the empirical evaluation by Caruana, Karampatziakis et al.,
                    which is why we have chosen them for this example <ptr target="#caruana2008"/>.
                    Since 2008, neural networks have become an attractive alternative for
                    high-dimensional data, as a more recent evaluation by <ptr target="#zekicsusac2014"/> shows. However, the performance difference of
                    neural nets and decision trees was not necessarily significant in their
                    experiments, and neural networks have the disadvantage that they are more
                    difficult to interpret and therefore not immediately useful for a predicting the
                    past approach. Therefore, we will use regression and rule-based classifications.
                    We apply the same dataset first to optimised logistic regression and afterwards
                    to several rule-based systems using rule learners and decision trees. Following
                    our methodology, we first determine the best performing model for each approach
                    using standard predictive analytics steps before we apply this model to the
                    gender analysis of the whole dataset to determine the gender relationships, as
                    the computer sees them.</p>

                <head>Classification</head>
                <p>In this section, we discuss logistic regression for predicting the past <ptr target="#raschka2015"/>. First all features are included to understand which
                    are the most important ones. Afterwards, various feature selection techniques
                    are used to reduce the dimensionality of the feature space. We also applied a
                    brute-force grid search of all hyperparameters in the model and found the best
                    performance for a L1 regularization with a C=100.0 <ptr target="#raschka2015"/>. </p>
                <p>Based on a 75-25% training and test split of the vagrant dataset with
                    stratification, we achieved a 76% prediction accuracy on the test dataset for
                    the above configuration of logistic regression: </p>
                <list type="simple">
                    <item>Training accuracy: 0.756</item>
                    <item>Test accuracy: 0.759</item>
                </list>
                <p>As training and test accuracy are close, the algorithm seems to generalise well.
                    Precision and recall show similar levels of performance in this simple
                    classification model with nearly 0.8 for both:</p>
                <list type="simple">
                    <item>Precision: 0.790</item>
                    <item>Recall: 0.793</item>
                </list>
                <p>3596 vagrants were misclassified, which leads to a kappa value of 0.62. Despite
                    the good precision and recall values the model significantly underperforms
                    compared to the dictionary-based one. The confusion matrix below shows that
                    logistic regression performed best for unknown genders but confused the
                    assignments of known male and female genders frequently. Let us see why this is
                    the case by investigating which features constitute similarity for logistic
                    regression. </p>
                <figure xml:id="figure09">
                    <head>Confusion matrix logistic regression</head>
                    <graphic url="resources/images/figure09.png"/>
                </figure>
                <p>We apply Sequential Backward Selection (SBS) and Recursive Feature Elimination
                    (RFE) to determine the feature evidence, which contributes most to determining
                    the gender <ptr target="#raschka2015"/>. Both algorithms iteratively remove the
                    worst-performing features until an optimum minimal set is reached. The selected
                    top for SBS are: <soCalled>Relationship to Lead Vagrant</soCalled>,
                        <soCalled>Settlement Country</soCalled>, <soCalled>Given Names</soCalled>,
                        <soCalled>Number of People in Group</soCalled> and
                        <soCalled>SessionStart</soCalled>. For RFE, the following top 5 features
                    were selected: <soCalled>Number of People in Group</soCalled>,
                        <soCalled>SessionStart</soCalled>, <soCalled>Given Names</soCalled>,
                        <soCalled>Relationship to Lead Vagrant</soCalled> and <soCalled>Settlement
                        Country</soCalled>. This means both algorithms agree on the most important
                    features that determine a vagrant's gender. We immediately notice that
                        <soCalled>Given Names</soCalled> - so important for the dictionary-based
                    method - seems to contribute less to the gender decision than other features for
                    both SBS and RFE, which makes us suspect that either there is a strong unknown
                    relationship in the data or logistic regression does not optimise the selection
                    well. </p>
                <p>The following table compares the performance of the full feature set with the top
                    5 features selected by SBS and RFE respectively:</p>

                </table>
                <p>The good news therefore is that the reduction of the number of features and thus
                    a reduction of the problem of sparse data does not significantly influence the
                    performance of the classification. Overall, however, the performance of this
                    classification algorithm is not satisfactory in comparison to the
                    dictionary-based one. It falls short when trying to decide the difference
                    between male and female genders compared with the traditional approach to
                    predicting genders based on first names. As the feature selection discussion
                    demonstrates the algorithm is not able to determine the most important feature,
                    which is the given name. </p>

                    regression, which shows that the performance does not improve with additional

                <p>Learning curves help us determine whether we have enough data for the number of

                    issues with the approach, which leads to the comparably worse performance. A
                    standard classification approach is not good enough for predicting the past of
                    genders even if we add more training samples.</p>

                <head>Rule-based algorithms</head>
                <p>Next in our series of experiments with predictive analytics are so-called rule
                    learners – the second class of best performing models. These represent knowledge
                    as a set of rules or logical if-else statements; described by the antecedent and
                    the consequence <ptr target="#lantz2013" loc="142"/>. So, a simple rule in our
                    case would be <soCalled>If the given name is Anne then it is a
                    female</soCalled>. For machine learning, this means that the if-statement
                    consists of a logical combination of features (predictors), while the result is
                    a decision on the gender of the vagrant under observation (target). We could
                    therefore use the antecedent to understand the conditions and characteristics
                    that define decisions on vagrants – in our case in terms of gender. These rule
                    learners have the additional advantage that they behave well with nominal
                    features and identify uncommon observations <ptr target="#lantz2013" loc="142"/>. Finally, they are relatively easy to interpret. All of these characteristics
                    should make rule learners interesting to digital humanities. </p>
                <p>All rule-based learners work by splitting up the data into smaller and smaller
                    groups, which finally can be formulated by a particular rule. The first
                    algorithm we tested was Weka's OneRule <ptr target="#holte1993"/>. The Waikato
                    Environment for Knowledge Analysis (Weka) is a machine learning platform,
                    developed at the University of Waikato, New Zealand.<note>
                        <ref target="https://www.cs.waikato.ac.nz/ml/weka/">https://www.cs.waikato.ac.nz/ml/weka/</ref>
                    </note> OneR (short for OneRule) generates one rule for each predictor, then
                    selects the rule with the best performance towards the target as the
                        <soCalled>one rule</soCalled>. We ran this directly in Weka, as we did not
                    have to reuse the results. We only present the first couple of rows of the
                    output:</p>
                <p>Given Names:</p>
                <list type="simple">
                    <item> &lt; 1.5 -&gt; F</item>
                    <item> &lt; 4.5 -&gt; M</item>
                    <item> &lt; 5.5 -&gt; F</item>
                </list>
                <p>This output might look strange at first sight, but it simply says that the
                    vagrants below the second given name is female (indexes in alphabetic order
                    smaller than 1.5), then everything until the fifth name is male, then we find
                    another female and so on. OneR thus learned without prior knowledge that genders
                    are best determined by the given names. This is not surprising as it operates
                    similarly to the method described in Blevins and Mullen 2015 but by learning the
                    relationship from the dataset <ptr target="#blevins2015"/>. If the dataset
                    contains given names with several gender associations, OneR considers the most
                    commonly appearing one as the right decision. Please note that the datasets were
                    shuffled before applying OneR to randomize the input. It is only the output of
                    OneR that is sorted. </p>
                <p>The OneR learner also outperforms the classification algorithm with a kappa
                    statistic of 0.98 and is thus better than the traditional method using the
                    dictionaries. While OneR therefore is excellent at deriving gender by mainly
                    outperforming the traditional approaches in terms of the unknown gender
                    assignments, we do not learn very much from the rules it has come up with. But
                    compared to logistic regression, the OneR learner has identified the most
                    important feature to learn about vagrants' genders without any background
                    knowledge. </p>
                <p>The Ripper algorithm <ptr target="#cohen1995"/> in Weka is an improvement on the
                    OneR learners, as it can consider multiple features. Ripper is based on a
                    complex set of heuristics. We can therefore hope to learn more from it about our
                    data’s composition. The Weka version of Ripper learns overall 40 rules from our
                    data. Examples include:</p>
                <list type="unordered">
                    <item>'(Given Names &gt;= 435) =&gt; Gender=[unknown]' is similar to the OneR
                        algorithm result in so far as the rule is using the single most important
                        feature and determines given names with an index larger-equal to 435 as of
                        unknown gender. These values include '[illegible]', ' [none given]' or
                        '[omitted]'.</item>
                    <item>However, the algorithm also learns the rule that should the observed
                        person be a child of a lead vagrant and we do not know anything else about
                        it, its gender should be unknown: Relationship to Lead Vagrant &lt;= 0 =&gt;
                        Gender=[unknown]. 0 is the label the child relationship in that
                        feature.</item>
                    <item>Finally, Ripper delivers more complex rules like (Settlement Country &gt;=
                        7) and (Number of People in Group &lt;= 1) and (Given Names &gt;= 182) and
                        (Given Names &lt;= 196) =&gt; Gender=M, which describe special cases where
                        in addition to the given name (in this case Harold, Henry, etc.) we have
                        further information to determine the gender such as that the settlement
                        country is Barbados.</item>
                </list>
                <p>Again, kappa is 0.98 for Ripper, which shows that the algorithm performs very
                    well. We have, however, also learned additional characteristics that decide the
                    genders of vagrants and could use in a historical analysis to investigate
                    inconsistencies further. Is there, e.g., a reason why Barbados plays a role in
                    the gender of vagrants or is this just noise?</p>
                <p>Next, we work through a decision tree analysis of the Vagrant data, which is the
                    most popular rule-based machine learner <ptr target="#raschka2015"/>. In a
                    decision tree, we follow the path from the root of the tree to its leaves. Each
                    turn describes one decision or rule. In terms of deriving gender, suppose we
                    would (hypothetically) say that the first (root) decision would be whether
                    vagrants were judged by Magistrate Clark. If that were the case, the next
                    decision were whether the session took place before June. If both would be the
                    case, we would assume that the vagrant was female and otherwise we need to
                    follow a different path. Each time we make a decision based on one feature and
                    then work ourselves down the tree to come to a conclusion. The decision tree can
                    learn therefore a much more complicated system of rules than the previous two
                    rule learners.</p>
                <p>Next we work through our predicting the past methodology again, starting with the
                    standard predictive analytics steps. Brute-force testing the hyperparameters
                    first, we can see a very good performance as we increase the depth but also the
                    danger of overfitting the tree to the particular dataset. We use a

                <p>We train the tree on a 75%-25% training and test split with stratification. The
                    learned model is then used to predict all genders. The result is the confusion
                    matrix in <ref target="#figure11">Figure 11</ref>, which presents an excellent
                    performance. The algorithm only misses out on 187 vagrants (or about 1% of the
                    whole). Compared to the dictionary-based method, wrong predictions are
                    relatively evenly distributed among male, female and unknown genders but there
                    are more mistakes for known males and females. </p>

                    features contributes to the gender prediction of each vagrant and how well the

                </figure>
                <p>With these results, we can conclude that names, relationships as well as the
                    number of people in a group as a proxy to the family status determine gender,
                    while magistrate, timing as well as places seem to have had a negligible
                    influence. This means that the magistrates did not judge per gender and that
                    there is also no season for males or females. Overall this result from the
                    RandomForest largely confirms what we found for the SBS as well as RFE
                    algorithms above, but this time given names are clearly the most important
                    feature. </p>

                <p>The kappa score is 0.98, similar to the other rule learners and much better than
                    the dictionary-based models. Compared to these, the decision tree is much better
                    at predicting unknown female and male genders but worse at predicting known
                    female and male genders. Decision trees are obviously able to learn unknown
                    relationships in the data, which the dictionary does not contain. Our decision
                    tree has learned to interpret <soCalled>[Wife]</soCalled> as a female given
                    name. For instance, for vagrant 5999.2.2, the name is recorded as
                        <soCalled>[Wife] Young</soCalled> and the gender as female. While the
                    dictionary-based method does not assign a value, the decision tree has learned
                    that this is a female. The dictionary-based method on the other hand leads to a
                    large number instances like this, where an unknown gender was predicted while
                    the actual gender was female. This could of course be easily corrected in the
                    dictionary-based algorithm by adding a dedicated rule for
                        <soCalled>[Wife]</soCalled> but it does demonstrate that decision trees have
                    learned from the available data. The dictionary-based gender assessment, on the
                    other hand, relies on existing background knowledge and theories. </p>
                <p>Compared to the dictionary-based method, the decision tree has learned that
                    vagrant 10436.1.3 called Auquin Jeffs is a male, which was unknown to the
                    dictionary. On the other hand, the decision tree did not learn that Ave Smith is
                    a male. Possibly because there is only one vagrant named Ave in the whole
                    dataset and all the given names in its tree-neighbourhood like Archibald,
                    Arnold, Arthur, etc. were male. This led to Ave being added to a male leaf in
                    the decision tree. Both dictionary-based method and decision tree struggled with
                    typical male names such as Edward, which were recorded for female vagrants like
                    vagrant 10018.1.1. The decision tree assigns a female gender in only one such
                    case: vagrant 382.1.2 called William Bourne. But at least the decision tree
                    learned this specific case compared to the dictionary-based method. Finally,
                    there are many cases where a decision tree had learned the same gender for a
                    given name as the one that is recorded in the dictionary but the record showed
                        <soCalled>unknown</soCalled> gender. Vagrant 6396.1.1 called Din Foley is an
                    example. </p>
                <p>Compared to the dictionary-based methods the decision tree relatively evenly
                    misses out on either female or male genders. A comparison of the top 20 female
                    names, the decision tree misclassifies, can be seen in <ref target="#figure14">Figure 14</ref>.</p>
                <figure xml:id="figure14">
                    <head>Decision tree female misclassifications</head>
                    <graphic url="resources/images/figure14.png"/>
                </figure>
                <p>As seen above in <ref target="#figure08">Figure 8</ref>, Jemima as well as
                    Harriott seem to be not known to the dictionary-based method. The decision-tree
                    prediction model, on the other hand, predicts these correctly as female. With
                    predictive analytics, we have thus achieved a new perspective on the gender
                    target that allows for insights going beyond established additional knowledge as
                    encoded in the dictionary. On the other hand, the decision tree misses out on
                    Phebe and Betty, which could be female names. It does not have enough training
                    data to know them. </p>
                <p>The dictionary-based method is better at discriminating those vagrants where the
                    gender is known to be either female or male. It hardly makes any mistakes here.
                    But it fails to deal with any unknown relationship such as the fact that
                        <soCalled>[wife]</soCalled> is female. Compared to the other rule learners
                    the decision tree rules are much more complex. Looking at the rules the decision
                    tree learned, the root of the tree assigns an unknown gender to all children,
                    whose relationship to the lead vagrant is not specified. This is similar to the
                    second rule cited above for the Ripper learner. Then, the decision tree mainly
                    uses a long chain of conditions on the feature <soCalled>Given Names</soCalled>
                    to walk down the tree to assign the gender. But contrary to the simple rule
                    learner, it also employs other features to control the gender. So, for instance,
                    there is a classification of vagrants as female based on their given name,
                    unless they were dealt with by magistrate <soCalled>Benj Cheny</soCalled> and
                    some of his related colleagues. </p>
                <p>In conclusion, decision trees (and other rule-based learners) work where existing
                    theories on the relationship between a given name and gender contradict the
                    underlying information, because the rule-based learners are working close to the
                    data. Here, predictive analytics targeting the past opens cases that should be
                    relevant to the digital humanities, as data contradicts existing historical
                    ideas. From a conceptual point of view, we could develop new ideas about the use
                    of female names; thereby also probably improving the theory of the link between
                    given names and genders. In terms of data practices, we could use our predictive
                    insights to enhance the dictionary of names. Shmueli speaks of the
                    possibility through prediction to provide a <soCalled>reality-check</soCalled>
                    for theories and how far they differ from what can be observed <ptr target="#shmueli2010"/>. In our case, we reality-check how modern theories
                    of names' genders correspond to past ones. The approach also works for specific
                    societies and language spaces, for which we have no dictionaries. Finally,
                    prediction allows to understand its own limits by drawing attention to the fact
                    that not all things in life can be predicted. Not all <soCalled>James</soCalled>
                    are male, which decision trees can tell us by going through a detailed analysis
                    of their errors.</p>

                <head>Conclusion</head>
                <p>In this paper, we discussed a digital humanities approach inspired by predictive
                    analytics, which we called predicting the past. We introduced the background of
                    this approach and recent discussions in predictive analytics that develop it to
                    investigate existing methods against integrated new datasets. Afterwards we
                    performed a study how to predict past genders using the Vagrant Lives dataset.
                    The high-dimensionality of the data, typical to the humanities, makes it
                    especially suitable for a predictive investigation. </p>
                <p>Predictive analytics need models to demonstrate relationships between the
                    features we investigate. These models are learned against the training data.
                    Otherwise, gender prediction in the digital humanities uses predefined gender
                    dictionaries of first names and then matches the gender of individuals against
                    this dictionary. This has firstly the problem that these dictionaries are
                    heavily dependent on culture and language they relate to. But this is not the
                    only issue, as dictionary-based approaches secondly also assume that errors are
                    randomly distributed. Gender trouble is simply a problem of not recording the
                    right gender in the data. Our predictive analytics approach on the other hand
                    does not make this assumption in advance and judges gender purely based on the
                    existing data. In our case, this meant that unknown genders are kept unknown if
                    there is not enough evidence to the contrary and even if the first name was
                    seemingly about a particular gender. Maybe the original assignment of an unknown
                    gender to James was not an error but rather an indicator that the gender was
                    difficult to determine. </p>
                <p>The dictionary-based approach is an accepted methodology in the digital
                    humanities to derive genders in datasets. It could thus provide us with a
                    baseline to compare the performance of advanced machine learning approaches for
                    predictive analytics. In the words of Schutt and O'Neil, we used the
                    dictionary-based approach to fine-tune our <q>spam filter</q> of models and
                    understand what performance level predicting the past models had to reach to be
                    taken seriously for gender prediction <ptr target="#schutt2013"/>. We considered
                    only predictive analytics models known to perform well in supervised
                    machine-learning and experimented first with classification algorithms, which
                    did not have a satisfactory performance. Afterwards, we used rule-based
                    learners, which matched the dictionary-based models and sometimes surpassed
                    their performance, while they did not have the requirement that dictionaries are
                    created beforehand. They learned how to learn about genders from the data in all
                    its categories of male, female and unknown.</p>
                <p>Dictionary-based methods remain clearly one of the best ways to determine the
                    correct genders if we suspect that there are many recording and data entry
                    mistakes for these. Correcting genders then can lead to more consistent
                    follow-on investigations, as Blevins and Mullen have demonstrated <ptr target="#blevins2015"/>. But they are only possible if we have high-quality
                    records of given names and their gender, not just for a particular language but
                    also for a certain culture and time period. If that is not the case, this paper
                    has demonstrated that we have machine learning alternatives at hand from the
                    world of predictive analytics that show an equivalent performance. </p>
                <p>If we are concerned not just with determining the correct gender but
                    understanding the rules that governed gender composition in a dataset then
                    predictive analytics approaches can offer genuine new insights. Predicting the
                    past can be an interesting toolkit for the digital humanities; working with
                    non-textual data just like distant-reading works for texts. It depends, however,
                    on the existence of high-quality datasets such as Vagrant Lives and the ability
                    to integrate them. With the automation of machine learning processing and the
                    availability of Weka, R and Python toolkits to interface with advanced machine
                    learning algorithms, predicting the past can become part of a future day-to-day
                    research in digital humanities. It does currently depend on some programming
                    knowledge but far less so than it did only a couple of years ago. In the future,
                    technical knowledge will count less than the ability to read the results of
                    machine learning processes and to situate them within their data. All this makes
                    predicting the past an exciting new approach to explore in the digital
                    humanities.</p>
