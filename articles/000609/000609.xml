            <!--Include a brief abstract of the article-->
            <p>This article sheds light on the methods and meaning of W. E. B. Du Bois’s 1899 study
               of the everyday lives of Black residents of Philadelphia’s Seventh Ward. It does so
               by juxtaposing the way Du Bois conducted his research with our contemporary efforts
               to recover, recreate, and preserve <title rend="italic">The Philadelphia
                  Negro</title> using digital and geospatial technologies to document historical and
               contemporary patterns relating to race and class. Beginning with an exploration of
               primary source documents that provide new details about how Du Bois went about his
               original research, we focus on the humanities and social science research methods
               that he employed. Of note is the color-coded parcel-level map Du Bois created to
               illustrate Black social class status, which reflected both the influence of the
               Social Survey Movement and Du Bois’s efforts to present a new understanding of the
               color line. His findings were groundbreaking, considering that most white scientists
               of his time assumed Blacks to be biologically inferior and socially homogeneous.
               Instead, he documented the variability and social stratification within
               Philadelphia’s Black population and the systematic exclusion they faced because of
               anti-Black racism. Our ongoing project—<title rend="italic">The WARD: Race and Class
                  in Du Bois’s Seventh Ward</title>, which seeks to recreate Du Bois’s study —
               includes new technologies and participatory research methods that engage high school
               and college students. In-depth, intergenerational oral histories conducted with
               students also add a new dimension to this work and complement our high school
               curriculum, which incorporates online mapping, documentaries, a board game, a walking
               tour, and a mural to engage others to create their own primary sources. This research
               provides a historical context for today’s racial tensions as we seek new ways to
               address the 21st century color line.</p>

         <head>INTRODUCTION</head>
         <p>Responding to a telegram invitation from the University of Pennsylvania, an ambitious
            28-year old Harvard-trained scholar brought his new bride to Philadelphia in 1896 to
            answer questions posed by the white women of the College Settlement Association: Why are
            the Black residents of Philadelphia not doing better economically and what is the
            solution to this <q>Negro Problem</q>? <ptr target="#philadelphiapress1896"/>. He
            was able to set aside the patronizing nature of the prompt—he was sure that the women
            already had their answer to that question; the indignity of being named an “assistant”
            in the sociology department rather than an instructor; the fact that he would not have
            an office; and the overall lack of official recognition — and accepted the invitation
            [Lewis 1993]. This ambitious and talented scholar, none other than W. E. B. Du Bois,
            methodically collected and analyzed data through surveys, interviews, and observations
            along with a review of archival sources, census data, local government reports, and the
            press, ultimately reframing the idea of the “Negro problem.” </p>
         <p>Rather than focusing on Black residents as a problem, he transformed the phrase to mean
            the distinct problems of a group of people who faced systematic racial discrimination in
            the primary domains of their lives, including health, occupation and employment,
            education and literacy, housing and the environment, voting, and institutional life.
            That is racism, not Black pathology, explained the poverty and crime the women of the
            College Settlement Association lamented. In making this argument, Du Bois set himself
            apart from most other scholars and Americans at the turn of the 20th century. Today,
            that argument is central to Critical Race Theory (CRT) and the #BlackLivesMatter
            movement, and nearly half of all Americans acknowledge that Black people face “a lot” of
            discrimination [Daniller 2021]. </p>
         <p>This article examines Du Bois’s 1899 study of the everyday lives of Black residents of
            Philadelphia’s Seventh Ward by juxtaposing his research methods with our contemporary
            efforts to recover, recreate, and preserve <hi rend="italic">The Philadelphia Negro: A
               Social Study </hi>(hereafter, <hi rend="italic">The Philadelphia Negro</hi>) using
            digital and geospatial technologies. Here, we explore the primary source documents,
            mining them for new details of how Du Bois conducted his research, and focus on the
            humanities and social science research methods he employed. In particular, this article
            focuses on Du Bois’s survey techniques and the color-coded parcel-level map that he
            created of Black social class status, reflecting the influence of the Social Survey
            movement and his efforts to present a new understanding of the color line [Du Bois
            1903]. The range of methods he used to analyze a wide array of primary and secondary
            data was essential to his groundbreaking findings. Disavowing the view of most social
            scientists of his time that Blacks were (a) biologically inferior and (b) socially
            homogeneous, Du Bois documented both the variability and social stratification within
            Philadelphia’s Black population. With this careful empirical investigation, he pointed
            to the need to recognize the full humanity of Black people and address what today we
            call anti-Black racism in order to solve this “Negro Problem” [Du Bois 1899, p. 386].
            This study continues Du Bois’s work by using what Gallon, writing within the field of
            Black digital humanities, calls the “technology of recovery, characterized by efforts to
            bring forth the full humanity of marginalized peoples through the use of digital
            platforms and tools” [Gallon 2016, p. 44].</p>
         <p>More than one hundred years after the publication of Du Bois’s seminal work, society is
            still plagued with the same problems of individual prejudice and structural racism,
            which have been reinvented, reshaped, and reinforced. Our ongoing project, <hi
               rend="italic">The WARD: Race and Class in Du Bois’s Seventh Ward</hi>, employs both
            old and new technologies to recreate Du Bois’s study and advance research on the state
            of America’s race problem. A property-level historical geographic information system
            (GIS) of Du Bois’s Seventh Ward forms the foundation of our contemporary research and
            our teaching and public history project based on <hi rend="italic">The Philadelphia
               Negro</hi>. Like Du Bois, we use interviews and observation, archival research,
            census data, local government reports, directories, the press, and mapping. We depart
            from Du Bois’s study, however, by using new technologies and participatory research
            methods that engage high school and college students as part of the research process
            [Ammon 2018]. While Du Bois wrote primarily for an audience of elite white leaders, our
            project seeks to make the lives of Seventh Ward residents accessible to young people
            across race, class, and gender. The in-depth, intergenerational oral histories conducted
            with students add a new dimension to this research; these histories also complement our
            high school curriculum’s interactive mapping, documentaries, board game, walking tour,
            and mural. These curriculum tools allow students to become co-researchers. Much like Du
            Bois’ later research during his time at Atlanta University, our process engages students
            to help to create visualizations [Mansky 2018]. </p>
         <p>Our project extends Du Bois’s original work through the use of both old new
            technologies, amplifying his central argument that whites of that era were unwilling to
            embrace the full humanity of their Black neighbors. Whites typically viewed Black people
            as an inferior race at the time of his study, understood in today’s language as white
            supremacy and anti-Black racism. This manifested in material subordination, structural
            forms of exclusion, and individual prejudice, all techniques used by whites to keep most
            Blacks from the significant economic advancement that they had anticipated when they
            migrated to the North [Loughran 2015]. We revisit Du Bois’s work by focusing on the
            stories and experiences of the Black residents he studied, as well as subsequent
            generations of Black residents who have lived in and around the Seventh Ward. We also
            directly engage youth of color and their white peers in the recreation, examination, and
            expansion of Du Bois’s seminal work. In so doing, we highlight ways to examine the
            contemporary challenges of the color line — gentrification, housing discrimination,
            racial profiling, and mass incarceration — that we and our young people face. This
            research also provides historical context for today’s racial unrest and persistent
            racial inequities. </p>
         <p>The Influence of the Social Survey Movement and Social Work</p>
         <p>Too often, scholars understand Du Bois’s approach to studying the Black population of
            Philadelphia’s Seventh Ward exclusively within academic sociology rather than seeing
            connections to applied sociology, social work, philanthropy, and the Social Survey
            Movement. Concentrated in England and the United States between 1880 and 1920, the
            Social Survey Movement produced numerous empirical studies concerning the realities of
            urban life for immigrants and the poor [Bulmer et al. 1992; Lewis 1993]. Charles Booth,
            the wealthy British merchant, launched the movement with a scientific investigation in
            the 1880s to assess the level and nature of poverty in London. Booth employed an army of
            women to make house calls and register children for school; he then cross-checked the
            data they collected with information from philanthropists, social workers, policemen,
            and other sources [Englander and O’Day 2015]. Booth’s great multi-volume work, <hi
               rend="italic">Life and Labor of the People of London</hi> [1899], detailed the social
            classes, patterns of income, employment, and forms of labor in several thousand pages of
            text. A series of block-level color-coded maps, depicting the spatial nature of poverty
            in 19th century London, provided a compelling summary of the overwhelming data which
            proved critical for Booth’s call to move from debate to action [Kimball 2006].</p>
         <p>The female sociologists and social workers of that time were exemplary practitioners of
            applied sociology and welcomed Du Bois into their circle [Deegan 1988]. Hull-House
            Settlement founder Jane Addams and social reformer Florence Kelly produced the <hi
               rend="italic">Hull-House Maps and Papers </hi>in 1895. Like Booth’s efforts, they
            used community-based research involving extensive field work and interviews to produce a
            series of color-coded maps of nationalities and wages of residents by household [Deegan
            2013]. This work also included empirical studies of immigrants, working conditions,
            specific laborers, labor unions, social settlements, and the function of art in the
            community, in addition to a critique of social services. Influenced by their scholarship
            and activism, Du Bois joined forces with these pioneers, who were largely marginalized
            by the male-dominated academy. They shared the dual goals of documenting social
            conditions and using their research to fight the inequality of Jim Crow segregationist
            and discriminatory policies and practices [Deegan 1988, 309]. Booth and the women of
            Hull House served as models for Du Bois’ work in Philadelphia in their methods and
            commitment to documenting poor social conditions to inspire social change [O’Connor
            2009; Zuberi 2004; Du Bois 1899]. </p>
         <p>Du Bois’s Invitation to Philadelphia</p>
         <p>On June 8, 1896, University of Pennsylvania Provost Charles Harrison sent a telegram to
            W. E. B. Du Bois, who was then teaching classics at Wilberforce College in Ohio, the
            first private Black college in the country. Harrison’s telegram invited Du Bois to
            conduct a study of Blacks living in Philadelphia’s Seventh Ward. The invitation — like
            many of today’s text messages — was terse, simply stating: “Are ready to appoint you for
            one year at nine hundred dollars maximum payable monthly from the date of service. If
            you wish appointment will write definitely” [Aptheker 1997]. Though formally issued by
            the University, Du Bois’s invitation came at the prompting of the women who ran
            Philadelphia’s College Settlement Association (CSA). Philanthropist Susan P. Wharton, a
            member of the wealthy Wharton family for whom the the University of Pennsylvania’s
            business school is named, convened a meeting at her home of leading citizens interested
            in the welfare of Blacks in Philadelphia. She said that the study should focus on the
            “problems” of the Black residents and the “obstacles to be encountered by the colored
            people in their endeavor to be self-supporting” [Linsday 1899, vii–xv]. Wharton’s
            motivation, consistent with the goals of the Social Survey Movement, blended
            philanthropy, science, and political advocacy [Lindsay 1899; Katz &amp; Sugrue 1998]. In
            addition to Penn’s Provost, her neighbor Dr. Harrison, Wharton invited merchant and
            philanthropist Robert C. Ogden, editor Talcott Williams, and Fannie Jackson Coppin, the
            prominent African-American educator and first lady of the Mother Bethel African
            Methodist Episcopal Church. She initially imagined hiring a white woman social worker to
            conduct the research but was swayed by Samuel Lindsay, a faculty member in Penn’s
            Sociology Department, who recommended Du Bois. Du Bois’s proven work ethic, his
            education at Fisk and Harvard universities, and his history and sociology studies in
            Germany made him the ideal candidate for this research [Katz &amp; Sugrue 1998]. Du Bois
            was grateful to have a new job; he considered this opportunity and his recent marriage
            to have “spelled salvation” from the small-mindedness of the Midwestern Evangelical
            college where he had suffered for two years [Du Bois 1968]. </p>
         <p>Data Collection and Analysis for The Philadelphia Negro</p>
         <p>As a young scholar, Du Bois had abundant faith in the power of science to effect social
            change. “The Negro problem was in my mind a matter of systematic investigation and
            intelligent understanding,” he explained in reference to the invitation to conduct
            research in Philadelphia [Du Bois 1968, 136]. “The world was thinking wrong about race,
            because it did not know. The cure for it was knowledge based on scientific
            investigation” [Du Bois 1968, xxvi]. His research incorporated multiple methods of
            inquiry and analysis. The door-to-door surveys he conducted with all the Black
            households in the Seventh Ward were the most time-consuming aspect of his study. He sat
            in the parlors, kitchens, and living rooms of 2,500 households listening and documenting
            their stories. W. E. B Du Bois — unlike Booth, Kelly, and Addams — had no research
            assistants; he conducted all the interviews himself, following a detailed interview
            schedule he developed. In addition to this list of questions for heads of household, he
            developed questions about Black businesses and streets or alleys (see Figure 1). In what
            was perhaps the University of Pennsylvania’s only direct involvement with the study, the
            institution sent these questionnaires out for comment to leading scholars, including
            Booker T. Washington, but there is no evidence that Du Bois made any significant changes
            based on this outside feedback. He explained in <hi rend="italic">The Philadelphia
               Negro</hi> that he usually spoke with the head of the household’s wife for between 10
            and 60 minutes, with an average duration of 15 to 25 minutes [Du Bois 1899, 63]. All
            together, he likely spent more than 800 hours conducting these interviews, five months
            of full-time work by today’s standards. However, Du Bois likely worked longer days and
            weekends given the tight schedule and limited compensation — approximately $30,000 in
            today’s dollars, slightly more than a doctoral stipend at the University of Pennsylvania
            today and significantly less than a typical post-doctoral salary. </p>

            southern edge of the Seventh Ward. Du Bois described the Church of the Crucifixion as
            “perhaps the most effective church organization in the city for benevolent and rescue
            work” [Du Bois 1899,

            Eighty-year-old Robert F. Adger, a well-off furniture dealer who owned a store on South
            Street, was the sole businessman whom Du Bois listed as an advisor. Adger founded the
            Benjamin Banneker Institute, an intellectual and literary association [Dorman 2009].
            William Dorsey, a Black archivist who kept scrapbooks detailing issues and events
            relevant to Blacks in Philadelphia well into the twentieth century, rounded out the
            group [Lane 1991]. </p>
         <p>In addition to collecting information from these primary sources, Du Bois “went through
            the Philadelphia libraries for data [and] gained access in many instances to private
            libraries of colored folk” [Du Bois 1968, 124]. The five-page bibliography in <hi
               rend="italic">The Philadelphia Negro</hi> listed the secondary sources that Du Bois
            consulted, including state legislation, history books, and church reports. He cited the
            works of 35 Black Philadelphian authors including Richard Allen, Martin Robinson
            Delaney, Jarena Lee, William Still, and Benjamin T. Tanner [Du Bois 1899]. Throughout
            the book, there are references to the administrative data he reviewed, particularly
            vital statistics and disease records from the Philadelphia Department of Public Health,
            crime records from the Philadelphia Police Department, and newspaper clippings. Du Bois
            relied on church histories, minutes from local church conferences, and a report of
            churches from the eleventh U.S. census in 1890 [Henry K. Carrol and U.S. Census Bureau
            1894 ] to capture the organized life of Blacks through their congregations. Using such
            records as the membership growth and value of property owned by the African Methodist
            Episcopal Church in Philadelphia, Du Bois presented the state of the Church, a task
            facilitated by having both the headquarters and publishing house of the A.M.E. Church
            located in Philadelphia. </p>
         <p>The greatest data analysis challenge Du Bois faced was making sense of the answers from
            his door-to-door survey. Du Bois had to keep track of each household’s address and then
            connect that address to a map of the properties in the Seventh Ward to produce the
            color-coded property map of social class. There is no record of how he recorded the data
            in the field, particularly whether he adapted the large sheets that census enumerators
            used or came up with his own system. However, in the spring of 1897, presumably after
            finishing the surveys, Du Bois ordered 15,000 cards corresponding to the schedules from
            a Philadelphia printer. He probably transferred his field notes onto these cards so he
            could sort them to generate his summary statistics (see Figure 2). His original map
            appears to be based on the 1895 or 1896 Bromley fire insurance map — either an actual
            copy or a tracing. We also know that in 1890, the most recent census before Du Bois
            created his maps for Philadelphia, the U.S. Census categorized people as Indian, Chinese
            or Japenese, Black, Mulatto (“3/8-5/8 black blood”), Quadroon (“1/4 black blood,”),
            Octoroon (“1/8 or any trace of black blood”), or white (Brown 2020). Du Bois does not
            specify whether he included bi-racial or multi-racial people as Black, using the single
            category of “Negro” for all the households he interviewed, perhaps anticipating the
            collapsing of these Black and multi-racial identities into a single category and
            underscoring that any Black ancestors meant for practical purposes that one was
            “Negro.”</p>

         <p>Before Du Bois could match his household data to the corresponding properties, he had to
            determine social class based on his survey results. He did not include a direct question
            about social class on any of his schedules; instead, he used questions about income and
            employment — both the type of work and consistency of it — as the most salient factors
            for making this determination. By making house visits, he was also able to consider “the
            apparent circumstances of the family judging from the appearance of the home and
            inmates, the rent paid, the presence of lodgers, etc.”

            [Katz &amp; Sugrue 1998]. “Everyone agreed that here lay the cancer,” he explained —

            buildings on St. Mary’s Street (now Rodman Street, one block north of South Street) at
            the eastern edge of the Seventh Ward. This was the heart of the “Negro slums,” home to
            “loafers, gamblers, prostitutes, and thieves” — some of the people Du Bois would
            characterize as “vicious and criminal” [Du Bois 1899, 60]. He explained, “We lived there
            a year, in the midst of an atmosphere of dirt, drunkenness, poverty, and crime. Murder
            sat on our doorsteps, police were our government, and philanthropy dropped in with

         <p>He wanted to use the best social science tools, transcending disciplinary boundaries and
            investigating the complexity of the “Negro problem.” Though white Philadelphians largely
            thought of Blacks as a monolithic group marked by chattel slavery and marginalized
            politically and economically, Du Bois revealed Black citizens in a new light by
            introducing the notion of Black heterogeneity across class, space, religion, and
            politics [Du Bois 1899; Hunter 2015]. “Nothing more exasperates the better class of
            Negroes,” such as himself, “than this tendency to ignore utterly their existence” [Du
            Bois 1899, 310]. With his color-coded parcel map highlighting the social class
            differences among Black residents (see Figure 4), he advanced our understanding of these
            within-group differences. He also argued indirectly that Blacks were just like whites,
            thus challenging the prevailing theories of the day about white supremacy. </p>

         <p>Du Bois studied Blacks in their urban enclaves, highlighting the role of the social and
            physical environment in shaping their outcomes and documenting spatial inequalities,
            thereby anticipating the direction that public health research would take a century
            later [Jones-Eversley &amp; Dean 2018; Hunter 2013]. He also highlighted the historical,
            structural, and cultural factors that distinguished the experience of Blacks from that
            of their immigrant neighbors. Ultimately, Du Bois rejected biological explanations and
            racial logics of Black inferiority. He rested his hopes first on the Black middle class
            to save the masses from the moral disorder that contributed to their poverty and second
            on the white “benevolent despot” to sweep away racial discrimination and remedy the lack
            of educational and employment opportunities [Du Bois 1899, 127].</p>
         <p>Du Bois finished his research in Philadelphia by the end of December 1897, just as his
            appointment ended and his new teaching position at Atlanta University began. He signed
            off on the book’s preface 18 months later, in June 1899, while teaching and writing his
            landmark essay, “The Study of the Negro Problems,” for the <hi rend="italic">Annals of
               the American Academy of Political and Social Science.</hi> Inspired largely by his
            work in Philadelphia, this essay served as a research agenda and call to action for the
            next phase of his professional life. While on the faculty of Atlanta University, Du Bois
            refined his empirical data collection and data visualization techniques to draw
            attention to the significance of the color line and the plight of Black Americans at the
            1900 Paris Exposition [Du Bois 1900; <author>Battle-Baptiste</author> &amp; Rusert

         <p>Re-Making The Philadelphia Negro WITH The WARD</p>
         <p>
            <hi rend="italic">The WARD: Race and Class in Du Bois’s Seventh Ward</hi> is an ongoing
            research, teaching, and public history project that uses geographic information systems
            (GIS), individual-level 1900 U.S. census data, and archival data to recreate Du Bois’s
            survey research to the extent possible (see: http://www.dubois-theward.org). Using old
            and new technologies, we expand the analytical capabilities and the stories of the color
            line from the 19th century to the 21st century with interactive mapping, a board game,
            documentaries, an oral history collection, a walking tour, a mural, and curriculum
            materials for high school students. <hi rend="italic">The WARD</hi> project materials
            focus on Du Bois’s life and work in Philadelphia as a diligent social science researcher
            and courageous agent for social change. The project was initially funded in 2005 with a
            small grant from the University of Pennsylvania’s Research Foundation; the real dollar
            value of this grant was not much less than the compensation offered by the same
            university to Du Bois for his original study. Our project was largely advanced with
            funding from the National Endowment for Humanities and has been sustained by subsequent
            small grants from local foundations, the University of Pennsylvania, and Haverford
            College. </p>
         <p>Primary Data Sources for The WARD </p>
         <p>
            <hi rend="italic">The WARD</hi> relied primarily on address-level 1900 U.S. manuscript
            census data to recreate Du Bois’ door-to-door survey. Other primary sources included
            hospital admissions records, infectious disease records, newspaper articles, crime
            reports and mug books, historical photographs, court transcripts, and fire insurance
            records and maps. To complement these resources, we conducted oral histories with older
            members of the churches referenced in Du Bois’s original study. As we revisited and
            recovered Du Bois’s research, we did not follow his convention of anonymizing people,
            instead choosing to use the names and stories of individuals and their families as they
            highlighted the daily lives and struggles of Black people in the community, believing
            this would allow youth to connect more closely to them. </p>
         <p>Maps and Spatial Data<note> Parcel-level and aggregate census data were shared publicly
               through a series of online mapping applications that are no longer available because
               the technology they used is no longer supported. All of the GIS files are available
               as shapefiles from the authors upon request.</note>. The individual and
            household-level data that Du Bois collected on Black households no longer exists, as far
            as archivists and Du Bois scholars know. The individual-level data collected through the
            1900 U.S. census is the best available proxy for the people Du Bois found living in the
            Seventh Ward in 1897. Using the census enumerator sheets on microfilm (also available as
            scanned documents on Ancestry®), student research assistants entered the census data for
            the 28,000 Seventh Ward residents of all races into an electronic spreadsheet, including
            their name, age, place of birth for themselves and their parents, occupation (for
            adults), the number of children born and still alive (for adult women), schooling (for
            children), and their relationship to the head of household. Research assistants also
            created a corresponding GIS parcel layer by digitally tracing the boundaries of the
            approximately 5,000 properties in the Seventh Ward based on Bromley fire insurance maps,
            which also noted property ownership and the names of institutions. By lining up a
            high-resolution scan of the color-coded property map Du Bois created of the Seventh Ward
            with this digitized parcel layer, we were able to integrate the social grade Du Bois
            assigned each property into the Seventh Ward GIS. Ultimately this “thick mapping”
            collects, aggregates, and visualizes layers of place-specific data [Ammon 2019, 13],
            adding nuance and greater detail regarding race, national origin and class to
            traditional archival sources. </p>
         <p>The GIS data files work well for Lab exercises in undergraduate and graduate GIS
            courses, and we made them accessible to a broader range of students through a series of
            online interactive mapping platforms. Guided by worksheets, students analzyed the
            historical data in these applications as well as demographic changes over time using US
            Census data and Social Explorer®, a publicly-available mapping system. Students were
            able to look up individual residents of the Seventh Ward based on their name, age,
            occupation, and address. They could also create parcel-level maps to see patterns in
            race/ethnicity, nationality, household size, children enrolled in school, homeownership,
            and occupation. Because the dataset includes multiple variables, one can map multiple
            parameters simultaneously to visualize associations between, for example, place of birth
            and presence of boarders or servants — the best available proxies for low- and
            high-income households, respectively. Census block-level aggregations of the
            individual-level census data allow additional insights as distinct spatial patterns
            become more prominent (see Figure 5). The concentration of Blacks in the lower half of
            the Seventh Ward, lodgers/boarders on the eastern side, and live-in servants in the
            northwestern section, further show this relationship between race and income. By
            combining the individual geocoded addresses with block-level data, it is possible to see
            that even the most prominent Black residents — physicians and caterers — lived on
            predominantly Black blocks where they would have lived with Blacks of diverse social
            class. </p>
         <p>In addition to facilitating the analysis of these broad spatial patterns, the Seventh
            Ward GIS makes it possible to identify some of the Black individuals and households that
            contrasted with the general pattern. These include specific examples of interracial
            marriage, such as 46-year-old Oscar Stewart, a Black waiter born in Alabama who was
            married for 23 years to Katie, a 45-year-old housekeeper from Ireland. Many of the white
            women who were married to Black men were born in other countries, but not all of them.
            Similarly, while Blacks rarely had live-in servants, there were some notable exceptions.
            Abraham Corney, a 50-year-old Black man born in Delaware, worked as a stevedore and
            lived with his wife, Virginia-born Bessie, a dress-maker; his 11-year-old son; a
            63-year-old live-in servant, Lidia Anderson; and five lodgers. Arthur McKenzie, a
            47-year-old junk dealer, born in the British West Indies, had a live-in servant and two
            lodgers. The female servant was 23 years old and McKenzie’s daughter was 19; both
            lodgers were men, one 25 and the other 26 years old. </p>

         <p>A dozen physicians, including Nathan Mossell who founded Frederick Douglass Hospital for
            Blacks in 1897, and nearly 50 Black caterers, including 8 women, composed much of the
            Black middle class and professional elite. Mapping this individual-level data from the
            1900 Census along with block-level data on racial composition shows how even these Black
            elite lived with other Black residents rather than along the wealthy white streets like
            Spruce Street.</p>
         <p>Oral histories. In 2012, we began collecting the oral histories of older African
            American members affiliated with the Black churches studied by Du Bois, namely Mother
            Bethel African Methodist Episcopal Church and Tindley Temple United Methodist, earlier
            known as Bainbridge Methodist Episcopal Church.<note> The 10 oral histories processed
               can be accessed on the project website. Other oral histories as well as the original
               transcripts can be accessed from the author by emailing
               Stephanie_Boddie@baylor.edu.</note> These two congregations were located at the edges
            of the Seventh Ward and have experienced significant racial and economic change over the
            past 120 years (see Figure 6). We retrieved 30 oral histories recognizing the residents
            who once lived, worked or worshipped in or near the Seventh Ward as keepers of
            unrecorded history [Ammon 2018]. Of the oral histories collected, Mr. Samuel Joyner’s
            stood out as the kind of narrative that would have attracted Du Bois’s attention. </p>

         <figure/>
         <p>Mr. Joyner, a retired artist, entrepreneur, World War II veteran, school teacher, and
            regular church member, was among the first to sit down with us in his home to share his
            story. Born in 1924, he described himself as a once-invisible artist who is now among
            the few award-winning African American political cartoonists in the country. He was
            surprised to find himself “out of place” in the North, a condition his family had
            expected to escape when migrating from the South. Mr. Joyner’s segregated military life
            in Alabama and the brutality of the South fueled his desire to use pen and ink to
            confront racism, discrimination, and poverty. In his words, life in the South “made me
            feel like dirt, you know. I had to walk out in the street when white people came.”
            During World War II, when he discovered that the United States would feed white German
            prisoners of war before feeding Black U.S. soldiers, he was left with a deep racial
            wound. He confronted a similar kind of Anglo-Saxon exceptionalism when he returned
            North. Gifted and educated, Joyner still often gave his work to his white peers to pass
            off as their own to ensure a fair wage for his work as an artist. Eventually, new
            opportunities opened up, though they began as what he called "tokenism." In 1999, his
            cartoon on police brutality earned <hi rend="italic">The Philadelphia Tribune</hi> a
            National Newspaper Publishers Association award for best editorial cartoon (see Figure
            7). His work has been archived at his alma mater, Temple University. We use his story to
            highlight what Combs [2015] refers to as the experience of being out of place both
            geographically and symbolically (i.e., socially and politically) and the expectation of
            assuming a subservient position to whites. Though Joyner did not find his place in the
            military, he found his place of Black respectability at church and as an educator; he
            also stumbled upon his place of Black resistance as a political cartoonist. These themes
            can be heard as Joyner retells the ways he has confronted the problems of the color line
            during his life (See Mr. Joyner’s oral history post including both videos and other
            highlights: http://www.dubois-theward.org/history/histories/samuel-joyner/).</p>

         <p>The Participatory Research and the Role of Students and Teachers</p>
         <p>Over 60 students have participated in the design and development of <hi rend="italic"
               >The WARD</hi>. Through collaborations across the University of Pennsylvania and
            other colleges, local high schools, and churches, we have involved students from the
            fields of social work, history, urban studies, city planning, historic preservation,
            political science, public health, education, and English [Lowy 2011; Pirro 2012].
            Students received training and engaged in a collaborative research process with faculty
            and staff across Penn. By actively participating in each phase of the project, the
            students came to understand the lived experiences of Black citizens within their social
            environment and analyzed historical and contemporary racial patterns [Kornbluh et al.
            2015]. In the process, these students shared their knowledge, developed new skills, and
            became empowered as co-researchers. Most notably, students collected archival records,
            photographs, newspapers, and digitized manuscript census data from microfilm;
            interviewed experts and community residents; produced documentaries; and designed the
            board game, walking tour, and the high school curriculum materials. The project products
            — particularly the Seventh Ward GIS, website, board game, walking tour guide,
            documentaries, and oral history collection — are evidence of the research, analytical,
            technological, and design skills that the students mastered and the creativity that they
            brought to this project. </p>
         <p>The board game (see Figure 8) provides a special example of how student artistic skills
            and vision shaped many of our <hi rend="italic">The WARD</hi> curriculum materials. The
            game requires players to assume the identity of one of eight Seventh Ward residents from
            the 19th Century who represented the four social classes Du Bois included in his map. We
            hired a student from a Philadelphia public high school as a research assistant who had
            studied <hi rend="italic">The Philadelphia Negro</hi> in his required African American
            history course, and he combed through the book for facts to include in the game card
            questions. Jonah Taylor, then an undergraduate student, designed the board game based on
            maps and historical photographs of the Seventh Ward. He gave the buildings a bird’s-eye
            view perspective to add life to the game board, showing rooftops like Google Earth,
            “playing off of contemporary visual culture” [Taylor 2011].</p>
         <p> To complement his computer-generated graphics, Jonah commissioned an art student at the
            Maryland Institute College to paint full-length portraits of the eight board game
            characters to incorporate into the game board and use for the game pieces. Using a
            limited number of available photographs and conducting extensive research about late
            19th century dress, Katie Emmitt produced multiple sketches and line drawings in order
            to produce life-like oil paintings. “It was very difficult, and it was stressful,” she
            explained in a video interview, “but it was such a good learning experience to have to
            put all of my effort into making something that looked real,” [Emmitt 2011]. The
            original paintings include her lightly written notes in the corner to guide her
            decisions about expressions and poses. For example, Mr. Turner, a member of the working
            class who rented a room from Nettie Cook on South Darrien Street, had a common law
            marriage to Katie, a white woman who worked as a maid. On his painting, Katie Emmitt
            wrote “proud” and “tired face” in the top left corner.</p>

         <p>Another undergraduate student research assistant, Heidi Smith, was frustrated by the
            “moralizing tone” and the lack of voices of Seventh Ward residents in <hi rend="italic"
               >The Philadelphia Negro</hi> text and primary sources such as the College Settlement
            Association records. Borrowing an idea from late 20th century poet Charles Reznikoff,
            she looked at transcripts from civil court cases to hear those missing voices and
            developed poems based on individual court cases [Bernstein 2014]. “I was wary that I
            would be focusing on violence or crime, because that’s what court cases are mostly
            concerned with and I didn’t want to give the impression that life in the Seventh Ward
            had only to do with violence,” she explained in her project write-up. “I hope you will
            look around and beneath the plot, to get at its implications, having to do with race,
            class, gender, and language in really strange ways” [Smith 2006]. One of the poems she
            wrote told the story of how Mr. Turner, one of the board game characters, exchanged
            heated words with another passenger on the trolley and then killed him in self defence
            when the other man followed him off the trolley and into an alley. </p>
         <p>High school students, college students, and teachers have embraced this project as a
            novel way to recover and preserve the research of W. E. B. Du Bois and engage with a
            part of the Black experience that textbooks rarely cover. Our collaborations have
            extended to urban and suburban public schools, private middle schools, historically
            Black colleges and universities (HBCUs), private liberal arts colleges, and a state
            department of education. The curriculum has also expanded the opportunity to engage
            students as co-researchers in this project. Through the curriculum, students learn to
            apply social science methods as a tool for social change. Of particular note are the
            assignments provided during the five days. On day one, students uncover the hidden
            stories of a Black community once located in Philadelphia’s Seventh Ward through a
            19-minute documentary. On day two, students examine a range of historical primary
            sources to learn and practice skills for analyzing documents to extract information and
            identify patterns. On day three, students learn about social science research as a
            systematic process of collecting information to answer questions about a community and
            the potential role of research for social change. On day four, students play the board
            game, and on day five, students use <hi rend="italic">The WARD’s</hi> GIS mapping
            program to explore the spatial patterns of the historical Seventh Ward and learn about
            specific individuals who once lived there. (See <hi rend="italic">The WARD</hi>
            curriculum: <ref target="http://www.dubois-theward.org/curriculum/learning-goals/"
               >http://www.dubois-theward.org/curriculum/learning-goals/</ref>). This research
            project has continued to evolve with feedback from teachers, high school students, and
            college student researchers. Our student researchers continue to present new ways to
            extend Du Bois’s work while incorporating additional elements into the project. Like
            many emerging digital humanities projects, <hi rend="italic">The WARD</hi> democratizes
            the creation of this research and blurs the lines between the creators and users of this
            research [Ammom 2018]. This research project also extends the kinds of transdisciplinary
            collaborations possible. </p>
         <p>How Philadelphia and the Seventh Ward have changed</p>
         <p>Once the largest Black community in Philadelphia, itself the Northern city with the
            largest Black population at the turn of the 20th century, the Seventh Ward has lost most
            of its Black residents even while the Black population in Philadephia has increased
            ten-fold. The Black middle class was drawn to new row houses in West and North
            Philadelphia — and to a lesser extent, the inner-ring suburbs — while lower-income
            households found new opportunities in the segregated public housing developments across
            the city [Hunter 2013; 2014]. Gentrification, broadly speaking, and the threat of a
            crosstown expressway, specifically, led Blacks to forgo Center City as the heart of
            residential, religious, and cultural life. An area that was once 38% Black is now
            dominated by upper-middle-class whites; only 7% of current residents identify as Black
            or African American [Du Bois 1899; US census 2018]. Numerous historic markers stand as
            reminders of the lives and institutions of the Blacks in the Seventh Ward; memorialized
            are the intellectual and activist Octavius Catto, the Institute for Colored Youth, and
            Engine Company 11. At the edge of the Seventh Ward, Mother Bethel African Methodist
            Episcopal Church — acquired by Richard Allen in 1794 — remains the longest-held Black
            property in the nation.</p>
         <p>Maps comparing the distribution of the Black population in 1900 to that of 2020 show two
            distinct patterns (see Figure 9). First, the Black population outnumbers white,
            Hispanic/Latino and Asian groups. Second, Blacks are concentrated in areas outside the
            historical Center City and Seventh Ward, making up a majority of residents for a wide
            section of the city stretching from due north of downtown to the far reaches of
            Southwest Philadelphia. If one were to study the “Philadelphia Negro,” today, the
            historical 32nd Ward in North Philadelphia might be the more appropriate focus. Anchored
            by institutions such as Temple University and historic congregations such as the Church
            of the Advocate and Zion Baptist Church. Racial residential patterns over the past 50
            years have demonstrated a level of racial segregation unknown to people living in
            Philadelphia at the end of the 20th century. Recent maps show how gentrification has
            spread to neighborhoods north and south of the old Seventh Ward, further displacing
            Black communities that once found refuge there [Bowen-Gaddy 2018].</p>

         <p>Data sources: 1900 US Decennial Census; 2020 Census Redistricting File</p>
         <p>Limitations of The WARD</p>
         <p>Despite the advantages that the 1900 U.S. census records provide over the original data
            Du Bois collected, there are numerous limitations of this re-creation. Most importantly,
            Du Bois gathered much more information than the census enumerators because his interview
            schedules were more detailed, including questions about health, previous occupations,
            experience with racial discrimination, income, housing, and neighborhood conditions. In
            addition, the 1900 U.S. census was conducted three years after Du Bois conducted his
            study, so there is no guarantee that it included the same people. Finally, a paid
            enumerator — not a trained researcher of Du Bois’s caliber — collected the census, so
            the data are likely not of comparable reliability and validity. In fact, the <hi
               rend="italic">Philadelphia Press</hi> reported in June 1900, while the census was
            being collected, that two census enumerators were fired for drunkenness. Still, these
            data provide the best approximation of Du Bois’s survey results and offer great insight
            into what Du Bois found when he came to Philadelphia — and how he conducted his
            research.</p>
         <p>The GIS re-creation of Du Bois’s map indicates that the 2,500 households Du Bois
            interviewed lived at approximately 1,400 properties. The property lines for the GIS
            parcel layer do not correspond perfectly to the property lines on Du Bois’s map,
            primarily because they are based on different Bromley fire insurance maps. Also, some of
            the properties that Du Bois marked as Black households had white residents in 1900,
            according to the census. This was the case for at least 60 properties. Of the 1,400
            properties, 70 appear to have been owner-occupied by Blacks, consistent with Du Bois’s
            estimate that only 5% of Black Seventh Ward residents owned their own homes. We included
            the walking tour and mural in this project as we recognize there is no substitute for
            returning to the neighborhood and retracing Du Bois’ steps to discover what remains of
            the Seventh Ward, particularly how this neighborhood helps us to understand the ways the
            color line had changed over time. </p>
         <p>Conclusion</p>
         <p>Through our digital humanities project, <hi rend="italic">The WARD</hi>, we continue a
            search to understand the universality and uniqueness of W. E. B. Du Bois’s research. In
            particular, we seek to document the patterns of the lives of Black people at the end of
            the 19th century and compare those patterns to the experiences of Black people today.
            Like Du Bois, we found that denying Black humanity takes many forms and ultimately
            affects the place of Black people in education, employment, housing, civic life, and
            other sectors. </p>
         <p>Over 50 years ago, Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., Congressman John Lewis, and others
            marching for civil rights, greater equality in voting, education, housing, and other
            practices confronted firehoses, dogs, violence, verbal abuse, and even threats by the Ku
            Klux Klan. Their courage helped to outlaw codified and sanctioned racist practices.
            Today, students benefit from the progress made by changes in policies and practices in
            voting, housing, education, and employment. They have, however, only pieces of the
            racialized history pre-dating the Civil Rights movement to help them better understand
            the world they inherited. This leaves them unprepared to fully understand the context
            for the deaths of Black citizens during police encounters, challenges to voting rights,
            and other problems of the color line. </p>
         <p>The <hi rend="italic">WARD</hi> engages students in this research project to help them
            remember our past and critically consider what they can do about the color line today.
            Ultimately, we hope that revisiting Du Bois’s work will help the next generation find
            alternative ways of thinking about race and addressing both interpersonal and structural
            forms of racism. The coronavirus pandemic and the police killing of George Floyd in 2020
            have laid bare the persistent racism in our systems (e.g., persistent patterns of racial
            segregation; limited access to health care, healthy foods, and reliable transportation;
            concentrated poverty; lack of affordable housing) [Williams and Cooper 2020; Yancy
            2020]. These times call for community-engaged and participatory research projects like
               <hi rend="italic">The WARD</hi> to move us closer to our democratic ideal, one that
            recognizes the full humanity of all people as created equal and endowed with the
            unalienable rights of life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. </p>
