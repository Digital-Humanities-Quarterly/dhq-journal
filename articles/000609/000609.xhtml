                  <p>This article sheds light on the methods and meaning of W. E. B. Du Bois’s 1899 study
                     of the everyday lives of Black residents of Philadelphia’s Seventh Ward. It does so
                     by juxtaposing the way Du Bois conducted his research with our contemporary efforts
                     to recover, recreate, and preserve <cite class="title italic">The Philadelphia
                        Negro</cite> using digital and geospatial technologies to document historical and
                     contemporary patterns relating to race and class. Beginning with an exploration of
                     primary source documents that provide new details about how Du Bois went about his
                     original research, we focus on the humanities and social science research methods
                     that he employed. Of note is the color-coded parcel-level map Du Bois created to
                     illustrate Black social class status, which reflected both the influence of the
                     Social Survey Movement and Du Bois’s efforts to present a new understanding of the
                     color line. His findings were groundbreaking, considering that most white scientists
                     of his time assumed Blacks to be biologically inferior and socially homogeneous.
                     Instead, he documented the variability and social stratification within
                     Philadelphia’s Black population and the systematic exclusion they faced because of
                     anti-Black racism. Our ongoing project — <cite class="title italic">The WARD: Race and Class
                        in Du Bois’s Seventh Ward</cite>, which seeks to recreate Du Bois’s study —
                     includes new technologies and participatory research methods that engage high school
                     and college students. In-depth, intergenerational oral histories conducted with
                     students also add a new dimension to this work and complement our high school
                     curriculum, which incorporates online mapping, documentaries, a board game, a walking
                     tour, and a mural to engage others to create their own primary sources. This research
                     provides a historical context for today’s racial tensions as we seek new ways to
                     address the 21st century color line.</p>

                     28-year old Harvard-trained scholar brought his new bride to Philadelphia in 1896
                     to
                     answer questions posed by the white women of the College Settlement Association: Why
                     are
                     the Black residents of Philadelphia not doing better economically and what is the
                     solution to this “Negro Problem”? [<a class="ref" href="#philadelphiapress1896">Philadelphia Press 1896</a>]. He
                     was able to set aside the patronizing nature of the prompt — he was sure that the
                     women
                     already had their answer to that question; the indignity of being named an “assistant”
                     in the sociology department rather than an instructor; the fact that he would not
                     have
                     an office; and the overall lack of official recognition — and accepted the invitation
                     [<a class="ref" href="#lewis1993">Lewis 1993</a>]. This ambitious and talented scholar, none other than W. E. B. Du Bois,
                     methodically collected and analyzed data through surveys, interviews, and observations
                     along with a review of archival sources, census data, local government reports, and
                     the
                     press, ultimately reframing the idea of the “Negro problem.” </div>

                     College Settlement Association lamented. In making this argument, Du Bois set himself
                     apart from most other scholars and Americans at the turn of the 20th century. Today,
                     that argument is central to Critical Race Theory (CRT) and the #BlackLivesMatter

                     of
                     Philadelphia’s Seventh Ward by juxtaposing his research methods with our contemporary
                     efforts to recover, recreate, and preserve <cite class="title italic">The Philadelphia Negro: A

                     digital and geospatial technologies. Here, we explore the primary source documents,
                     mining them for new details of how Du Bois conducted his research, and focus on the
                     humanities and social science research methods he employed. In particular, this article
                     focuses on Du Bois’s survey techniques and the color-coded parcel-level map that he
                     created of Black social class status, reflecting the influence of the Social Survey
                     movement and his efforts to present a new understanding of the color line [<a class="ref" href="#dubois1903">Du Bois 1903</a>]. The range of methods he used to analyze a wide array of primary and secondary
                     data was essential to his groundbreaking findings. Disavowing the view of most social
                     scientists of his time that Blacks were (a) biologically inferior and (b) socially
                     homogeneous, Du Bois documented both the variability and social stratification within
                     Philadelphia’s Black population. With this careful empirical investigation, he pointed
                     to the need to recognize the full humanity of Black people and address what today
                     we
                     call anti-Black racism in order to solve this “Negro Problem” [<a class="ref" href="#dubois1899">Du Bois 1899</a>, 386].
                     This study continues Du Bois’s work by using what Gallon, writing within the field
                     of
                     Black digital humanities, calls the “technology of recovery, characterized by efforts to
                     bring forth the full humanity of marginalized peoples through the use of digital
                     platforms and tools” [<a class="ref" href="#gallon2016">Gallon 2016</a>, 44].</div>

                  <div class="ptext" id="p4">More than one hundred years after the publication of Du Bois’s seminal work, society
                     is
                     still plagued with the same problems of individual prejudice and structural racism,
                     which have been reinvented, reshaped, and reinforced. Our ongoing project, <cite class="title italic">The WARD: Race and Class in Du Bois’s Seventh Ward</cite>, employs both
                     old and new technologies to recreate Du Bois’s study and advance research on the state
                     of America’s race problem. A property-level historical geographic information system
                     (GIS) of Du Bois’s Seventh Ward forms the foundation of our contemporary research
                     and
                     our teaching and public history project based on <cite class="title italic">The Philadelphia
                        Negro</cite>. Like Du Bois, we use interviews and observation, archival research,
                     census data, local government reports, directories, the press, and mapping. We depart
                     from Du Bois’s study, however, by using new technologies and participatory research
                     methods that engage high school and college students as part of the research process
                     [<a class="ref" href="#ammon2018">Ammon 2018</a>]. While Du Bois wrote primarily for an audience of elite white leaders, our
                     project seeks to make the lives of Seventh Ward residents accessible to young people
                     across race, class, and gender. The in-depth, intergenerational oral histories conducted
                     with students add a new dimension to this research; these histories also complement
                     our
                     high school curriculum’s interactive mapping, documentaries, board game, walking tour,
                     and mural. These curriculum tools allow students to become co-researchers. Much like
                     Du
                     Bois’ later research during his time at Atlanta University, our process engages students
                     to help to create visualizations [<a class="ref" href="#mansky2018">Mansky 2018</a>]. </div>

                     technologies, amplifying his central argument that whites of that era were unwilling
                     to
                     embrace the full humanity of their Black neighbors. Whites typically viewed Black
                     people
                     as an inferior race at the time of his study, understood in today’s language as white
                     supremacy and anti-Black racism. This manifested in material subordination, structural
                     forms of exclusion, and individual prejudice, all techniques used by whites to keep
                     most
                     Blacks from the significant economic advancement that they had anticipated when they
                     migrated to the North [<a class="ref" href="#loughran2015">Loughran 2015</a>]. We revisit Du Bois’s work by focusing on the
                     stories and experiences of the Black residents he studied, as well as subsequent
                     generations of Black residents who have lived in and around the Seventh Ward. We also
                     directly engage youth of color and their white peers in the recreation, examination,
                     and
                     expansion of Du Bois’s seminal work. In so doing, we highlight ways to examine the
                     contemporary challenges of the color line — gentrification, housing discrimination,
                     racial profiling, and mass incarceration — that we and our young people face. This

                     in
                     the 1880s to assess the level and nature of poverty in London. Booth employed an army

                     Settlement founder Jane Addams and social reformer Florence Kelly produced the <cite class="title italic">Hull-House Maps and Papers </cite>in 1895. Like Booth’s efforts, they
                     used community-based research involving extensive field work and interviews to produce

                     and activism, Du Bois joined forces with these pioneers, who were largely marginalized

                     conditions and using their research to fight the inequality of Jim Crow segregationist
                     and discriminatory policies and practices [<a class="ref" href="#deegan1988">Deegan 1988</a>, 309]. Booth and the women of
                     Hull House served as models for Du Bois’ work in Philadelphia in their methods and

                  <div class="ptext" id="p8">On June 8, 1896, University of Pennsylvania Provost Charles Harrison sent a telegram
                     to
                     W. E. B. Du Bois, who was then teaching classics at Wilberforce College in Ohio, the
                     first private Black college in the country. Harrison’s telegram invited Du Bois to
                     conduct a study of Blacks living in Philadelphia’s Seventh Ward. The invitation —
                     like
                     many of today’s text messages — was terse, simply stating: Are ready to appoint you for
                     one year at nine hundred dollars maximum payable monthly from the date of service.
                     If
                     you wish appointment will write definitely [<a class="ref" href="#aptheker1997">Aptheker 1997</a>]. Though formally issued by
                     the University, Du Bois’s invitation came at the prompting of the women who ran
                     Philadelphia’s College Settlement Association (CSA). Philanthropist Susan P. Wharton,
                     a
                     member of the wealthy Wharton family for whom the the University of Pennsylvania’s
                     business school is named, convened a meeting at her home of leading citizens interested
                     in the welfare of Blacks in Philadelphia. She said that the study should focus on
                     the
                     “problems” of the Black residents and the “obstacles to be encountered by the colored
                     people in their endeavor to be self-supporting” [<a class="ref" href="#lindsay1899">Lindsay 1899</a>, vii–xv]. Wharton’s
                     motivation, consistent with the goals of the Social Survey Movement, blended
                     philanthropy, science, and political advocacy [<a class="ref" href="#lindsay1899">Lindsay 1899</a>] [<a class="ref" href="#katz1998">Katz and Sugure 1998</a>]. In
                     addition to Penn’s Provost, her neighbor Dr. Harrison, Wharton invited merchant and
                     philanthropist Robert C. Ogden, editor Talcott Williams, and Fannie Jackson Coppin,
                     the
                     prominent African-American educator and first lady of the Mother Bethel African
                     Methodist Episcopal Church. She initially imagined hiring a white woman social worker
                     to
                     conduct the research but was swayed by Samuel Lindsay, a faculty member in Penn’s
                     Sociology Department, who recommended Du Bois. Du Bois’s proven work ethic, his
                     education at Fisk and Harvard universities, and his history and sociology studies
                     in
                     Germany made him the ideal candidate for this research [<a class="ref" href="#katz1998">Katz and Sugure 1998</a>]. Du Bois
                     was grateful to have a new job; he considered this opportunity and his recent marriage
                     to have “spelled salvation” from the small-mindedness of the Midwestern Evangelical
                     college where he had suffered for two years [<a class="ref" href="#dubois1968">Du Bois 1968</a>]. </div>

                  <div class="ptext" id="p9">As a young scholar, Du Bois had abundant faith in the power of science to effect social
                     change. “The Negro problem was in my mind a matter of systematic investigation and
                     intelligent understanding,” he explained in reference to the invitation to conduct
                     research in Philadelphia [<a class="ref" href="#dubois1968">Du Bois 1968</a>, 136]. The world was thinking wrong about race,
                     because it did not know. The cure for it was knowledge based on scientific
                     investigation [<a class="ref" href="#dubois1968">Du Bois 1968</a>, xxvi]. His research incorporated multiple methods of
                     inquiry and analysis. The door-to-door surveys he conducted with all the Black
                     households in the Seventh Ward were the most time-consuming aspect of his study. He
                     sat
                     in the parlors, kitchens, and living rooms of 2,500 households listening and documenting
                     their stories. W. E. B Du Bois — unlike Booth, Kelly, and Addams — had no research
                     assistants; he conducted all the interviews himself, following a detailed interview
                     schedule he developed. In addition to this list of questions for heads of household,
                     he
                     developed questions about Black businesses and streets or alleys (see Figure 1). In
                     what
                     was perhaps the University of Pennsylvania’s only direct involvement with the study,
                     the
                     institution sent these questionnaires out for comment to leading scholars, including
                     Booker T. Washington, but there is no evidence that Du Bois made any significant changes
                     based on this outside feedback. He explained in <cite class="title italic">The Philadelphia
                        Negro</cite> that he usually spoke with the head of the household’s wife for between 10
                     and 60 minutes, with an average duration of 15 to 25 minutes [<a class="ref" href="#dubois1899">Du Bois 1899</a>, 63]. All
                     together, he likely spent more than 800 hours conducting these interviews, five months
                     of full-time work by today’s standards. However, Du Bois likely worked longer days
                     and
                     weekends given the tight schedule and limited compensation — approximately $30,000
                     in
                     today’s dollars, slightly more than a doctoral stipend at the University of Pennsylvania
                     today and significantly less than a typical post-doctoral salary. </div>

                        Negro</cite> [<a class="ref" href="#dubois1899">Du Bois 1899</a>, iv]. Reverend Henry Phillips was the leader of Church of
                     the Crucifixion, a Black Episcopal church located at 8th and Bainbridge Streets on
                     the
                     southern edge of the Seventh Ward. Du Bois described the Church of the Crucifixion
                     as
                     “perhaps the most effective church organization in the city for benevolent and rescue

                     Black churches in the area. “This church [the Church of the Crucifixion] especially

                     consulted, including state legislation, history books, and church reports. He cited
                     the
                     works of 35 Black Philadelphian authors including Richard Allen, Martin Robinson
                     Delaney, Jarena Lee, William Still, and Benjamin T. Tanner [<a class="ref" href="#dubois1899">Du Bois 1899</a>]. Throughout

                     records as the membership growth and value of property owned by the African Methodist
                     Episcopal Church in Philadelphia, Du Bois presented the state of the Church, a task
                     facilitated by having both the headquarters and publishing house of the A.M.E. Church
                     located in Philadelphia. </div>

                  <div class="ptext" id="p13">The greatest data analysis challenge Du Bois faced was making sense of the answers
                     from
                     his door-to-door survey. Du Bois had to keep track of each household’s address and
                     then
                     connect that address to a map of the properties in the Seventh Ward to produce the
                     color-coded property map of social class. There is no record of how he recorded the
                     data
                     in the field, particularly whether he adapted the large sheets that census enumerators
                     used or came up with his own system. However, in the spring of 1897, presumably after
                     finishing the surveys, Du Bois ordered 15,000 cards corresponding to the schedules
                     from
                     a Philadelphia printer. He probably transferred his field notes onto these cards so
                     he
                     could sort them to generate his summary statistics (see Figure 2). His original map
                     appears to be based on the 1895 or 1896 Bromley fire insurance map — either an actual
                     copy or a tracing. We also know that in 1890, the most recent census before Du Bois
                     created his maps for Philadelphia, the U.S. Census categorized people as Indian, Chinese
                     or Japenese, Black, Mulatto (“3/8-5/8 black blood”), Quadroon (“1/4 black blood,”),
                     Octoroon (“1/8 or any trace of black blood”), or white [<a class="ref" href="#brown2020">Brown 2020</a>]. Du Bois does not
                     specify whether he included bi-racial or multi-racial people as Black, using the single
                     category of “Negro” for all the households he interviewed, perhaps anticipating the
                     collapsing of these Black and multi-racial identities into a single category and
                     underscoring that any Black ancestors meant for practical purposes that one was
                     “Negro.”</div>

                     had to
                     determine social class based on his survey results. He did not include a direct question
                     about social class on any of his schedules; instead, he used questions about income
                     and
                     employment — both the type of work and consistency of it — as the most salient factors
                     for making this determination. By making house visits, he was also able to consider
                     “the
                     apparent circumstances of the family judging from the appearance of the home and
                     inmates, the rent paid, the presence of lodgers, etc.” [<a class="ref" href="#dubois1899">Du Bois 1899</a>, 169]
                     . Du Bois deliberately used similar categories as Booth — vicious and
                     criminal, poor, working people, and middle class — so he could compare the distribution
                     of social class status among Seventh Ward residents to those of London. </div>

                     Du Bois and his wife of three months, Nina Gomer, lived in a one-room apartment at
                     Seventh and Lombard Street over a cafeteria run by the Settlement House, which also
                     had
                     buildings on St. Mary’s Street (now Rodman Street, one block north of South Street)
                     at
                     the eastern edge of the Seventh Ward. This was the heart of the “Negro slums,” home to
                     “loafers, gamblers, prostitutes, and thieves” — some of the people Du Bois would
                     characterize as “vicious and criminal” [<a class="ref" href="#dubois1899">Du Bois 1899</a>, 60]. He explained, “We lived there
                     a year, in the midst of an atmosphere of dirt, drunkenness, poverty, and crime. Murder
                     sat on our doorsteps, police were our government, and philanthropy dropped in with
                     periodic advice” [<a class="ref" href="#dubois1968">Du Bois 1968</a>, 122].

                     thought of Blacks as a monolithic group marked by chattel slavery and marginalized
                     politically and economically, Du Bois revealed Black citizens in a new light by

                     differences among Black residents (see Figure 4), he advanced our understanding of
                     these

                     as archivists and Du Bois scholars know. The individual-level data collected through
                     the
                     1900 U.S. census is the best available proxy for the people Du Bois found living in
                     the
                     Seventh Ward in 1897. Using the census enumerator sheets on microfilm (also available
                     as
                     scanned documents on Ancestry®), student research assistants entered the census data
                     for
                     the 28,000 Seventh Ward residents of all races into an electronic spreadsheet, including
                     their name, age, place of birth for themselves and their parents, occupation (for
                     adults), the number of children born and still alive (for adult women), schooling
                     (for
                     children), and their relationship to the head of household. Research assistants also
                     created a corresponding GIS parcel layer by digitally tracing the boundaries of the
                     approximately 5,000 properties in the Seventh Ward based on Bromley fire insurance
                     maps,
                     which also noted property ownership and the names of institutions. By lining up a

                     assigned each property into the Seventh Ward GIS. Ultimately this “thick mapping”
                     collects, aggregates, and visualizes layers of place-specific data [<a class="ref" href="#ammon2018">Ammon 2018</a>, 13],

                     of
                     online interactive mapping platforms. Guided by worksheets, students analzyed the
                     historical data in these applications as well as demographic changes over time using
                     US
                     Census data and Social Explorer®, a publicly-available mapping system. Students were
                     able to look up individual residents of the Seventh Ward based on their name, age,
                     occupation, and address. They could also create parcel-level maps to see patterns
                     in
                     race/ethnicity, nationality, household size, children enrolled in school, homeownership,
                     and occupation. Because the dataset includes multiple variables, one can map multiple
                     parameters simultaneously to visualize associations between, for example, place of
                     birth
                     and presence of boarders or servants — the best available proxies for low- and
                     high-income households, respectively. Census block-level aggregations of the
                     individual-level census data allow additional insights as distinct spatial patterns
                     become more prominent (see Figure 5). The concentration of Blacks in the lower half
                     of
                     the Seventh Ward, lodgers/boarders on the eastern side, and live-in servants in the
                     northwestern section, further show this relationship between race and income. By
                     combining the individual geocoded addresses with block-level data, it is possible
                     to see
                     that even the most prominent Black residents — physicians and caterers — lived on
                     predominantly Black blocks where they would have lived with Blacks of diverse social
                     class. </div>

                     Ward GIS makes it possible to identify some of the Black individuals and households
                     that
                     contrasted with the general pattern. These include specific examples of interracial
                     marriage, such as 46-year-old Oscar Stewart, a Black waiter born in Alabama who was
                     married for 23 years to Katie, a 45-year-old housekeeper from Ireland. Many of the
                     white
                     women who were married to Black men were born in other countries, but not all of them.
                     Similarly, while Blacks rarely had live-in servants, there were some notable exceptions.
                     Abraham Corney, a 50-year-old Black man born in Delaware, worked as a stevedore and
                     lived with his wife, Virginia-born Bessie, a dress-maker; his 11-year-old son; a
                     63-year-old live-in servant, Lidia Anderson; and five lodgers. Arthur McKenzie, a
                     47-year-old junk dealer, born in the British West Indies, had a live-in servant and
                     two
                     lodgers. The female servant was 23 years old and McKenzie’s daughter was 19; both
                     lodgers were men, one 25 and the other 26 years old. </div>

                  <div class="ptext" id="p26">Mr. Joyner, a retired artist, entrepreneur, World War II veteran, school teacher,
                     and
                     regular church member, was among the first to sit down with us in his home to share
                     his
                     story. Born in 1924, he described himself as a once-invisible artist who is now among
                     the few award-winning African American political cartoonists in the country. He was
                     surprised to find himself “out of place” in the North, a condition his family had
                     expected to escape when migrating from the South. Mr. Joyner’s segregated military
                     life
                     in Alabama and the brutality of the South fueled his desire to use pen and ink to
                     confront racism, discrimination, and poverty. In his words, life in the South “made me
                     feel like dirt, you know. I had to walk out in the street when white people came.”
                     During World War II, when he discovered that the United States would feed white German
                     prisoners of war before feeding Black U.S. soldiers, he was left with a deep racial
                     wound. He confronted a similar kind of Anglo-Saxon exceptionalism when he returned
                     North. Gifted and educated, Joyner still often gave his work to his white peers to
                     pass
                     off as their own to ensure a fair wage for his work as an artist. Eventually, new
                     opportunities opened up, though they began as what he called "tokenism." In 1999,
                     his
                     cartoon on police brutality earned <cite class="title italic">The Philadelphia Tribune</cite> a
                     National Newspaper Publishers Association award for best editorial cartoon (see Figure
                     7). His work has been archived at his alma mater, Temple University. We use his story
                     to
                     highlight what [<a class="ref" href="#combs2015">Combs 2015</a>] refers to as the experience of being out of place both
                     geographically and symbolically (i.e., socially and politically) and the expectation
                     of
                     assuming a subservient position to whites. Though Joyner did not find his place in
                     the
                     military, he found his place of Black respectability at church and as an educator;
                     he
                     also stumbled upon his place of Black resistance as a political cartoonist. These
                     themes
                     can be heard as Joyner retells the ways he has confronted the problems of the color

                     Students received training and engaged in a collaborative research process with faculty
                     and staff across Penn. By actively participating in each phase of the project, the
                     students came to understand the lived experiences of Black citizens within their social
                     environment and analyzed historical and contemporary racial patterns [<a class="ref" href="#kornbluh2015">Kornbluh et al. 2015</a>]. In the process, these students shared their knowledge, developed new skills, and
                     became empowered as co-researchers. Most notably, students collected archival records,
                     photographs, newspapers, and digitized manuscript census data from microfilm;
                     interviewed experts and community residents; produced documentaries; and designed

                     documentaries, and oral history collection — are evidence of the research, analytical,
                     technological, and design skills that the students mastered and the creativity that
                     they

                     on
                     maps and historical photographs of the Seventh Ward. He gave the buildings a bird’s-eye

                     characters to incorporate into the game board and use for the game pieces. Using a
                     limited number of available photographs and conducting extensive research about late
                     19th century dress, Katie Emmitt produced multiple sketches and line drawings in order
                     to produce life-like oil paintings. “It was very difficult, and it was stressful,” she
                     explained in a video interview, “but it was such a good learning experience to have to
                     put all of my effort into making something that looked real,” [<a class="ref" href="#emmitt2011">Emmitt 2011</a>]. The

                     decisions about expressions and poses. For example, Mr. Turner, a member of the working
                     class who rented a room from Nettie Cook on South Darrien Street, had a common law
                     marriage to Katie, a white woman who worked as a maid. On his painting, Katie Emmitt

                     Association records. Borrowing an idea from late 20th century poet Charles Reznikoff,
                     she looked at transcripts from civil court cases to hear those missing voices and
                     developed poems based on individual court cases [<a class="ref" href="#bernstein2014">Bernstein 2014</a>]. “I was wary that I
                     would be focusing on violence or crime, because that’s what court cases are mostly
                     concerned with and I didn’t want to give the impression that life in the Seventh Ward
                     had only to do with violence,” she explained in her project write-up. “I hope you will

                     stories of a Black community once located in Philadelphia’s Seventh Ward through a
                     19-minute documentary. On day two, students examine a range of historical primary
                     sources to learn and practice skills for analyzing documents to extract information
                     and
                     identify patterns. On day three, students learn about social science research as a
                     systematic process of collecting information to answer questions about a community
                     and
                     the potential role of research for social change. On day four, students play the board

                  <div class="ptext" id="p32">Once the largest Black community in Philadelphia, itself the Northern city with the
                     largest Black population at the turn of the 20th century, the Seventh Ward has lost
                     most
                     of its Black residents even while the Black population in Philadephia has increased
                     ten-fold. The Black middle class was drawn to new row houses in West and North
                     Philadelphia — and to a lesser extent, the inner-ring suburbs — while lower-income
                     households found new opportunities in the segregated public housing developments across
                     the city [<a class="ref" href="#hunter2013b">Hunter 2013b</a>] [<a class="ref" href="#hunter2014">Hunter 2014</a>]. Gentrification, broadly speaking, and the threat of a
                     crosstown expressway, specifically, led Blacks to forgo Center City as the heart of
                     residential, religious, and cultural life. An area that was once 38% Black is now
                     dominated by upper-middle-class whites; only 7% of current residents identify as Black
                     or African American [<a class="ref" href="#dubois1899">Du Bois 1899</a>] [<a class="ref" href="#census2018">U.S. Census Bureau 2018</a>]. Numerous historic markers stand as
                     reminders of the lives and institutions of the Blacks in the Seventh Ward; memorialized
                     are the intellectual and activist Octavius Catto, the Institute for Colored Youth,
                     and
                     Engine Company 11. At the edge of the Seventh Ward, Mother Bethel African Methodist
                     Episcopal Church — acquired by Richard Allen in 1794 — remains the longest-held Black
                     property in the nation.</div>

                     two
                     distinct patterns (see Figure 9). First, the Black population outnumbers white,
                     Hispanic/Latino and Asian groups. Second, Blacks are concentrated in areas outside
                     the
                     historical Center City and Seventh Ward, making up a majority of residents for a wide
                     section of the city stretching from due north of downtown to the far reaches of
                     Southwest Philadelphia. If one were to study the “Philadelphia Negro,” today, the
                     historical 32nd Ward in North Philadelphia might be the more appropriate focus. Anchored
                     by institutions such as Temple University and historic congregations such as the Church
                     of the Advocate and Zion Baptist Church. Racial residential patterns over the past
                     50
                     years have demonstrated a level of racial segregation unknown to people living in
                     Philadelphia at the end of the 20th century. Recent maps show how gentrification has
                     spread to neighborhoods north and south of the old Seventh Ward, further displacing

                  <div class="ptext" id="p34">Despite the advantages that the 1900 U.S. census records provide over the original
                     data
                     Du Bois collected, there are numerous limitations of this re-creation. Most importantly,
                     Du Bois gathered much more information than the census enumerators because his interview
                     schedules were more detailed, including questions about health, previous occupations,
                     experience with racial discrimination, income, housing, and neighborhood conditions.
                     In
                     addition, the 1900 U.S. census was conducted three years after Du Bois conducted his
                     study, so there is no guarantee that it included the same people. Finally, a paid
                     enumerator — not a trained researcher of Du Bois’s caliber — collected the census,
                     so
                     the data are likely not of comparable reliability and validity. In fact, the <cite class="title italic">Philadelphia Press</cite> reported in June 1900, while the census was
                     being collected, that two census enumerators were fired for drunkenness. Still, these
                     data provide the best approximation of Du Bois’s survey results and offer great insight
                     into what Du Bois found when he came to Philadelphia — and how he conducted his

                     interviewed lived at approximately 1,400 properties. The property lines for the GIS
                     parcel layer do not correspond perfectly to the property lines on Du Bois’s map,
                     primarily because they are based on different Bromley fire insurance maps. Also, some
                     of
                     the properties that Du Bois marked as Black households had white residents in 1900,
                     according to the census. This was the case for at least 60 properties. Of the 1,400
                     properties, 70 appear to have been owner-occupied by Blacks, consistent with Du Bois’s
                     estimate that only 5% of Black Seventh Ward residents owned their own homes. We included
