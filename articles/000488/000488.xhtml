               <div class="ptext" id="p5">Abstract: This book analyzes the tensions that arise when the numerical, predictive
                  exactitude of digital computing embraces the humanities. Such tensions  <span class="hi italic">are</span> thrown into frequent and sharper relief, whereas the sciences proceed on the basis
                  of skepticism, and the humanities proceed on the basis of interpretation, criticism
                  and dialectical engagement with given issues. In addition, the pervasive nature of
                  digital computing heightens the risk of over-shadowing the humanities. The authors
                  argue for a critical turn in digital humanities.</div>

               <div class="ptext" id="p8">A number of critics accuse digital humanities of systematically betraying the foundational
                  principles of the humanities. Other critics say that the digital besieges the humanities,
                  and create tension by questioning the humanities’ viability, relevance, or purpose
                  in the contemporary world. Furthermore, tensions between the digital and the humanities
                  have led to a scenario where “the territory of digital humanities is currently under
                  negotiation” [Svensson 2010, 173]. Reflections along similar lines have led to other
                  assertions: that digital humanities is a discipline very much under construction,
                  that “digital liberal arts” [Pannapacker 2013] would be a more preferable term, that
                  the term <span class="hi italic">digital studies</span> should be adopted. Some maintain that the term <span class="hi italic">digital humanities</span> is void of meaning, preferring to call it “computational criticism” [Hackler and
                  Kirsten 2016, 6], and others hold that digital humanities is only a certain way of
                  doing humanities research: a computational turn in the humanities. While Sterne is
                  content with contrasting digital humanities with analog humanities [Sterne 2015, 19],
                  Galloway warns that “few things will cripple the humanities more than the uncritical
                  <span class="hi italic">adoption of tools</span> or the continued encroachment of positivistic research methods borrowed from cognitive
                  science, neuroscience, computer science, or elsewhere” [Galloway 2021, 257].</div>
               
               <div class="counter"><a href="#p9">9</a></div>
               <div class="ptext" id="p9">By placing themselves at the boundary of computing and humanities, the authors Berry
                  and Fagerjord examine a broad spectrum of practices, methods and inquiries that apply
                  to digital humanities. They also discuss the impact (and limitations) of computational
                  tools on humanities research, making the case that contemporary humanities must eventually
                  inculcate new digital culture into its purview, in the same way that previous humanities
                  interrogated and inculcated writing, images and the printing press. However, the epistemic
                  yield of digital humanities, the authors argue, runs the risk of materially distorting
                  the essence of the humanities: the digital gently morphing into a major obstacle to
                  the humanities. They insist that failure to dwell critically upon these <span class="hi italic">tensions</span> would increasingly render the humanities impotent in the face of hegemonic, ubiquitous
                  digital technology. In order to side-step the domineering tendencies of digital technology,
                  the authors propose a form of cross-disciplinary dialectics: a <span class="hi italic">critical digital humanities</span> that skillfully manages the conceptual quagmires that must arise: a critical turn
                  in digital humanities will consolidate its status in academia.</div>
               
               <div class="counter"><a href="#p10">10</a></div>
               <div class="ptext" id="p10">Part II.</div>
               
               <div class="counter"><a href="#p11">11</a></div>
               <div class="ptext" id="p11">First, critical digital humanities must avoid treating digital methodologies and computers
                  as “truth machines” [Berry and Fagerjord 2015, 110], by recalling the socio-technical
                  aspects of their design and manufacture: digital technology, after all, is not neutral
                  in itself.  Furthermore, the authors propose that technical issues in computing must
                  never be allowed to drive research in the humanities. Such a resistive stance, they
                  hope, will create room for the humanities to “communicate their vision of humanity
                  to the public” [114] by “helping to broaden the very idea of instrumentalism, technological
                  and otherwise” [114].</div>
               
               <div class="counter"><a href="#p12">12</a></div>
               <div class="ptext" id="p12">Second, they insist that the “digital itself is to be historicized” [112]. Digital
                  methods evolved as responses to certain types of problems. However, when applied to
                  culture, the digital risks reducing culture to data, “a complete anathema to the humanities”
                  [112]. They also maintain that one must diligently engage the shadowy side of the
                  digital, which enables global surveillance of world citizenry on a troubling scale:
                  a shadowy side which must also be resisted. Part of this resistance involves grappling
                  with the tendency of computational sciences to ignore matters of ethics and justice:
                  a disastrous glorification and idolization of instrumental reason. Digital methods
                  alone cannot determine whether “justice and freedom are better in themselves than
                  injustice and oppression” [Horkheimer 1947, 16]. Failure in such resistance might
                  end up making the digital humanities complicit in the problematic system of predatory
                  capitalism and domination: a problematic system that previous humanities would have
                  called out.</div>
               
               <div class="counter"><a href="#p13">13</a></div>
               <div class="ptext" id="p13">Third, the authors recommend eternal vigilance lest human society itself become victimized
                  by uncritical digital humanities endeavours. The large datasets generated by digital
                  humanities projects need to be guarded with utmost diligence, given that “the digital
                  enables exploding quantities of data that are increasingly hard to contain within
                  organizations and boundaries” [Berry and Fagerjord 2015, 113]. Citing the highly scandalous
                  fallouts of the WikiLeaks saga, which resulted from an informational overload, the
                  authors allude to an even earlier critique made by Horkheimer: “the physical sciences
                  are endowed with so-called objectivity, but emptied of human content; the humanities
                  preserve the human content, but only as ideology, at the expense of truth” [Horkheimer
                  1947, 52]. A critical turn in the humanities will necessarily result in a slow-down
                  of some sort. The authors insist that such a slow-down will necessarily benefit humanity
                  in the long run.</div>
               
               <div class="counter"><a href="#p14">14</a></div>
               <div class="ptext" id="p14">Part III.</div>
               
               <div class="counter"><a href="#p15">15</a></div>
               <div class="ptext" id="p15">The key to following the argumentations in this book is to perceive digital humanities
                  as a field “positioned between technology and culture” [Berry and Fagerjord 2015,
                  11]. While paging through this book, I was reminded of a fairly popular riddle among
                  some cultures in southern Africa. The riddle has to do with the description of a zebra:
                  whether the zebra is a white animal with black stripes, or a black animal with white
                  stripes. In marrying humanities to digital computing, one creates a zebra-like creature,
                  a creature whose stripes are challenging to describe at some level. An uncritical
                  form of digital humanities will necessarily get bogged down by intractable tensions
                  between the digital and the humanities. Similar intractable tensions arise in trying
                  to describe the zebra’s stripes, with the additional risk of forgetting other profiles
                  that the zebra presents to consciousness. In many ways, the authors remind the reader
                  that any field of study is never exhausted by its particular presentation. A particular
                  givenness does not exhaust the field; the field of study is a unity of its givennesses.
                  One should not get so distracted by the zebra’s stripes that one loses sight of zebras’
                  hidden profiles. Critical digital humanities leads us to unify the digital and the
                  humanities without making one dominate the other.</div>
