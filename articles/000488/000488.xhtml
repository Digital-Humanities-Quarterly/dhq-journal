                  <p>This book analyzes the tensions that arise when the numerical, predictive exactitude
                     of digital computing embraces
                     					the humanities. Such tensions <em class="emph">are</em> thrown into frequent and sharper relief, whereas the sciences
                     					proceed on the basis of skepticism, and the humanities proceed on the basis of
                     interpretation, criticism and
                     					dialectical engagement with given issues. In addition, the pervasive nature of
                     digital computing heightens the risk
                     					of over-shadowing the humanities. The authors argue for a critical turn in digital
                     humanities.</p>

                  <div class="ptext" id="p1">A number of critics accuse digital humanities of systematically betraying the foundational
                     principles of the
                     					humanities. Other critics say that the digital besieges the humanities, and create
                     tension by questioning the
                     					humanities’ viability, relevance, or purpose in the contemporary world. Furthermore,
                     tensions between the digital
                     					and the humanities have led to a scenario where “the territory of digital humanities is
                     						currently under negotiation”
                     					[<a class="ref" href="#svensson2010">Svennson 2010</a>, 173]. Reflections along similar lines have led to other assertions: that digital
                     					humanities is a discipline very much under construction, that “digital liberal arts”
                     					[<a class="ref" href="#pannapacker2013">Pannapacker 2013</a>] would be a more preferable term, that the term <em class="term">digital studies</em> should
                     					be adopted. Some maintain that the term <span class="hi italic">digital humanities</span> is void of meaning, preferring to
                     					call it “computational criticism”
                     					[<a class="ref" href="#hackler_etal2016">Hackler and Kirsten 2016</a>, 6], and others hold that digital humanities is only a certain way of doing
                     					humanities research: a computational turn in the humanities. While Sterne is
                     content with contrasting digital
                     					humanities with analog humanities [<a class="ref" href="#sterne2015">Sterne 2015</a>, 19], Galloway warns that “few things will cripple the humanities more than the uncritical <em class="emph">adoption of tools</em> or the continued
                     						encroachment of positivistic research methods borrowed from cognitive science,
                     neuroscience, computer science, or
                     						elsewhere”

                  <div class="ptext" id="p2">By placing themselves at the boundary of computing and humanities, the authors Berry
                     and Fagerjord examine a broad
                     					spectrum of practices, methods and inquiries that apply to digital humanities.
                     They also discuss the impact (and
                     					limitations) of computational tools on humanities research, making the case that
                     contemporary humanities must
                     					eventually inculcate new digital culture into its purview, in the same way that
                     previous humanities interrogated
                     					and inculcated writing, images and the printing press. However, the epistemic
                     yield of digital humanities, the
                     					authors argue, runs the risk of materially distorting the essence of the humanities:
                     the digital gently morphing
                     					into a major obstacle to the humanities. They insist that failure to dwell critically
                     upon these
                     						<em class="emph">tensions</em> would increasingly render the humanities impotent in the face of hegemonic, ubiquitous
                     					digital technology. In order to side-step the domineering tendencies of digital
                     technology, the authors propose a
                     					form of cross-disciplinary dialectics; a <em class="term">critical digital humanities</em> that skillfully manages the
                     					conceptual quagmires that must arise: a critical turn in digital humanities will
                     consolidate its status in
                     					academia.</div>

                     					manufacture: digital technology, after all, is not neutral in itself. Furthermore,
                     the authors propose that
                     					technical issues in computing must never be allowed to drive research in the
                     humanities. Such a resistive stance,
                     					they hope, will create room for the humanities to “communicate their vision of humanity to the
                     						public”

                     					However, when applied to culture, the digital risks reducing culture to data,
                     “a complete
                     						anathema to the humanities”
                     					[<a class="ref" href="#berry_etal2017">Berry and Fagerjord 2017</a>, 112]. They also maintain that one must diligently engage the shadowy side of
                     					the digital, which enables global surveillance of world citizenry on a troubling
                     scale: a shadowy side which must
                     					also be resisted. Part of this resistance involves grappling with the tendency
                     of computational sciences to ignore
                     					matters of ethics and justice: a disastrous glorification and idolization of
                     instrumental reason. Digital methods
                     					alone cannot determine whether “justice and freedom are better in themselves than injustice and

                     					[<a class="ref" href="#horkheimer1947">Horkheimer 1947</a>, 16]. Failure in such resistance might end up making the digital humanities
                     					complicit in the problematic system of predatory capitalism and domination: a
                     problematic system that previous
                     					humanities would have called out.</div>

                     by uncritical digital
                     					humanities endeavours. The large datasets generated by digital humanities projects
                     need to be guarded with utmost

                     					[<a class="ref" href="#berry_etal2017">Berry and Fagerjord 2017</a>, 113]. Citing the highly scandalous fallouts of the WikiLeaks saga, which
                     					resulted from an informational overload, the authors allude to an even earlier
                     critique made by Horkheimer: “the physical sciences are endowed with so-called objectivity, but emptied of human
                     content; the
                     						humanities preserve the human content, but only as ideology, at the expense

                  <div class="ptext" id="p6">The key to following the argumentations in this book is to perceive digital humanities
                     as a field “positioned between technology and culture”
                     					[<a class="ref" href="#berry_etal2017">Berry and Fagerjord 2017</a>, 11]. While paging through this book, I was reminded of a fairly popular riddle
                     					among some cultures in southern Africa. The riddle has to do with the description
                     of a zebra: whether the zebra is
                     					a white animal with black stripes, or a black animal with white stripes. In marrying
                     humanities to digital
                     					computing, one creates a zebra-like creature, a creature whose stripes are challenging
                     to describe at some level.
                     					An uncritical form of digital humanities will necessarily get bogged down by
                     intractable tensions between the
                     					digital and the humanities. Similar intractable tensions arise in trying to describe
                     the zebra’s stripes, with the
                     					additional risk of forgetting other profiles that the zebra presents to consciousness.
                     In many ways, the authors
                     					remind the reader that any field of study is never exhausted by its particular
                     presentation. A particular givenness
                     					does not exhaust the field; the field of study is a unity of its givennesses.
                     One should not get so distracted by
                     					the zebra’s stripes that one loses sight of zebras’ hidden profiles. Critical
                     digital humanities leads us to unify
                     					the digital and the humanities without making one dominate the other.</div>
