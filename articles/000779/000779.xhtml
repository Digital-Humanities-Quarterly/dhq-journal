               <div class="ptext" id="p5">James O’Sullivan’s edited volume is, to use his words, likely to attract three kinds
                  of readers: DH-experts, DH-curious, and naysayers. This review examines what the
                  book offers to each category of readers, as a way of approaching the Herculean task
                  of capturing a glimpse of 43 chapters that touch upon the domain in diverse ways.
                  The self-critical spirit consistently demonstrated across chapters will stimulate
                  dialogue regarding the gains made by DH when analysing culture textually.</div>
               
               <div class="counter"><a href="#p6">6</a></div>
               <div class="ptext" id="p6">A handbook is a tricky object: it must provide an overview of a domain: articulating
                  its first principles, mapping its present debates and trajectories, and pointing to
                  the directions where it is likely to head. Very often, it is also likely to be
                  judged on the basis of what it excludes, engaged with on the basis of what it has
                  missed rather than what it includes. It is against the background of that baggage
                  of
                  expectations that this review approaches its subject (the volume) through the
                  editor’s own framing. James O’Sullivan, in his introduction to the handbook,
                  clarifies that his volume was imagined as future-focused – offering reference
                  materials and provocations to facilitate further progress in the field – and likely
                  to be of interest to DH-experts, DH-curious, and naysayers. It is a rich collection
                  divided into five parts: ‘Perspectives &amp; Polemics’, ‘Methods, Tools, &amp;
                  Techniques’, ‘Public Digital Humanities’, ‘Institutional Contexts’, and ‘DH
                  Futures’. With every part, individual chapters present overviews of subdomains while
                  highlighting specific problems and approaches to address the same. For instance,
                  ‘Methods, Tools, &amp; Techniques’ carries chapters around programming, encoding
                  practices within textual editions, text mining, natural language processing, audio
                  and visual data analysis, social media analysis, spatiality, data visualisation, and
                  the importance of critical digital humanities as a praxis of digital humanities. As
                  an independent part within the handbook, it brings together principles that guide
                  DH
                  praxis in the subdomains mentioned while also offering critiques of them where
                  applicable. Thus, while the handbook cannot be rendered coherent in terms of
                  argument, there are a few things to be said about its structure that can help
                  readers approach it in specific ways. Let us examine what the volume does for these
                  categories of readers rather than summarise over forty chapters spread over five
                  parts.</div>
               
               <div class="counter"><a href="#p7">7</a></div>
               <div class="ptext" id="p7">Firstly, the handbook is an interesting expression of how to approach dissent and
                  critique. Usually, such compilations offer critiques at the end, <span class="hi italic">after</span> one has read about different definitions, theories and approaches
                  prevalent within a subject. James O’Sullivan has thrown this sequencing logic out
                  of
                  the window for part one of the book, which has ‘polemics’ built into it. As the
                  longest part (with 11 chapters), it engages with the question of what DH is and what
                  it is not. Instead of clearing this opening space for providing an overview of the
                  field, O’Sullivan piles upon it the task of critique and it is a genius move
                  because, after all, what is an overview without critique? To understand what DH is,
                  O’Sullivan’s readers must also take into account what it is not. For instance, one
                  chapter (Johanna Drucker’s) argues that one must not take the tools for granted but
                  develop a deeper understanding of how these tools work, failing which DH-ers would
                  stop innovating or keep relying on tools and their output for arguments. Drucker
                  rathers that they design new tools for diverse purposes or decide how to use them
                  for different agendas. The chapters on the ‘peripheries and epistemic margins’,
                  non-Western DH, postcolonial DH, DH and race, queer DH, feminist DH, multilingual
                  DH, and so on uncover silences and erasures within the field. Both DH-experts and
                  DH-curious are likely to engage with this critique-next-to-definitions design of the
                  book very well by identifying new questions to work on. Sullivan’s design also helps
                  one realise that the field is richer for this kind of embedding of polemics within
                  itself, and it demonstrates the constant introspection to which the researchers in
                  the domain are committed. </div>
               
               <div class="counter"><a href="#p8">8</a></div>
               <div class="ptext" id="p8">Second, the choice of contributors/chapters keeps critique an ongoing dialogue rather
                  than something that is restricted to part one. For instance, the chapter on critical
                  digital humanities (by David M. Berry) points out that a reliance on mathematization
                  that tends to govern computational approaches, to, say, text mining, interferes with
                  cultural critique and hides political questions such as those of labour or
                  democracy. Another expression of self-critique and introspection comes from chapter
                  13 (by Quinn Dombrowski) on the importance of coding in DH: the insecurity brought
                  in by a lack of proficiency in coding, or induced by those who claim DH to be a
                  computational space, meant for the computationally fluent. Chapter 13 is an example
                  of the fact that the DH community is not threatened by voices outside DH (such as
                  Nan Z Da’s) but by those who undermine the work done outside computational skills,
                  without realising that the skills required to translate humanities research into
                  programming need not involve writing elegant codes, to count as relevant. One way
                  to
                  make the DH space inclusive is to prioritize thinking in terms of workflows over
                  programming. Another position, by Joanna Byszuk (chapter 15), is that scholars must
                  clearly articulate their methodologies and processes in their publications, rather
                  than assume readers would not make sense of them and thereby keep critical aspects
                  of research as well-guarded secrets. Similarly, Alexandra Schofield (chapter 16)
                  argues that reading research output in NLP gives one the impression that the first
                  attempt at a question is the successful one; more often than not, research in DH
                  tends to be iterative, most of which is not shared in the conventional research
                  article style of dissemination. For more people to make sense of DH methods, the
                  illusion of question-to-solution model should change. DH-curious readers will find
                  such insights helpful. </div>
               
               <div class="counter"><a href="#p9">9</a></div>
               <div class="ptext" id="p9">Third, the idea that DH is a lot more than computation or programming finds ample
                  expression in the pages of the handbook. DH is also about archiving, keeping
                  scholarship open access, pursuing projects in cultural heritage, sustaining such
                  projects within the university and the larger communities, investing in DH community
                  building activities through documentation of pedagogies, working with print and book
                  history and textuality in general, thinking about design, and reflecting on cultures
                  of data and artificial intelligence. Indeed, the existence of these fields of
                  inquiry throws text mining into stark relief: it turns out to be in a minority in
                  the larger DH imagination. As Taylor Arnold and Lauren Tilton argue (chapter 17),
                  consistent with the spirit of self-critique in the volume, an obsession with text
                  mining betrays the logocentric orientation of DH, something that needs to change
                  with rich imaginations of audio, visual, and even spatial texts within DH. Such a
                  range of questions are likely to provide a lot of space to the naysayers about
                  considering the impact of the discipline on questions of cultural texts, especially
                  as can be seen in the final section on the “futures”: the suggestion that terms and
                  ideas such as datawork and ETA (exploratory text analysis rather than computational
                  literary or textual studies) in chapter 34 or the suggestion that computing can be
                  an aid in hermeneutic scholarship (chapter 35) unpack the ways in which DH is likely
                  to be practised and understood in the near (and maybe the distant) future. One
                  development to look forward to is its intersection with public humanities, opening
                  up all knowledge to specialists and the general publics (chapter 37), in not just
                  making knowledge available as open access but also in making it more accessible or
                  comprehensible. Between the time the book was finished and this time of reading
                  about it, the AI aspect of this future has already happened (chapter 42). The book
                  covers a lot of territory as it stops at this edge between the present and the
                  future. </div>
               
               <div class="counter"><a href="#p10">10</a></div>
               <div class="ptext" id="p10">James O’Sullivan’s <span class="hi italic">Handbook</span> deserves to be read widely for its
                  very approach to curation and conversation around a subject. Its relevance lies
                  beyond DH. If every volume were to conceptualize its subject to include critical
                  reflections, only articulating the backlash it has received, it would be a healthy
                  sign of knowledge production in every domain. Perhaps, that is the greatest takeaway
                  from the book: DH may have its naysayers but DH itself does not naysay, as it were,
                  even to its naysayers.</div>
