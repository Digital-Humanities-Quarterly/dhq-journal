Isabella’s studiolo is a regular point of reference in the study of Renaissance history and art, yet for centuries it has been accessible only in dispersed pieces and in spaces depopulated of major works and artefacts. Digital technology offers the possibility of creating a ‘remastered’ studiolo, a virtual space in which both visual and acoustic elements may be enhanced with respect to previous attempts at its representation. At the same time, historical uncertainty about numerous details in the arrangement of the objects in this collection requires a high level of flexibility in the digital remix, allowing for the programming of a customisable virtual environment. In anticipation of the project’s full construction and in order to facilitate discussion with potential users about the Virtual Studiolo’s backward design, the authors have developed a concept-demonstration video within the open-source Blender environment (<a class="link_ref" href="https://www.blender.org/">www.blender.org</a>). Among the concerns we aim to address in this phase of the project is how to combine historical accuracy, emotional power, and creative possibilities for users.

The project aims to reassemble in a virtual, open-access environment one of Renaissance Italy’s most stunning courtly art collections, the studiolo of Isabella d’Este (1474-1539), marchesa of the city-state of Mantua. The Virtual Studiolo will join a set of already existing, interlocking projects gathered in the multimedia online environment of IDEA: Isabella d’Este Archive (<a class="link_ref" href="http://isabelladeste.web.unc.edu">http://isabelladeste.web.unc.edu</a>) (<a class="link_ref" href="#figure01" title="IDEA Isabella dEste Archive Homepage.">fig. 1</a>).

These camerini (little rooms) functioned as personal retreats for reading and reflection but also as galleries for the display of Renaissance learning and luxuries and as private performance spaces for Isabella’s music. A purposeful projection of her ideal self, they were created both for her own pleasure and for exhibition to privileged visitors <a class="link_ptr" href="#liebenwein2005" title="Liebenwein Wolfgang.

Isabella managed her acquisitions largely through voluminous written correspondence with artists and dealers, directing the lavish decoration of these rooms with intarsia panels, gilded ceilings, frescoes, tiles, and enigmatic personal emblems. She also filled them with treasures she collected, including books, cameos, Roman antiquities and Renaissance bronzes. Dominating the studiolo was a series of large paintings that now hang prominently in the Italian galleries of the Louvre: two each by Andrea Mantegna, Lorenzo Costa and Antonio Allegri da Correggio, and one by Pietro Perugino.</p><p>As a signature instance of personal ‘branding,’ Isabella’s studiolo stands on a historic par with Granduke Francesco de’ Medici’s later studiolo in the Palazzo Vecchio in Florence and those of Duke Federico da Montefeltro in Urbino and Gubbio (the latter now transplanted to New York’s Metropolitan Museum of Art). It also holds special significance as a collection that anticipated the achievements of such modern female collectors as Isabella Stewart Gardner in Boston, Etta and Claribel Cone in Baltimore, and Peggy Guggenheim in Venice. Isabella’s camerini were an unparalleled architectural and artistic expression of specifically feminine Renaissance culture. In their sensory and intellectual density, they functioned as a space for contemplative withdrawal but also for display, and as a controlled environment in which the human passions could be summoned and engaged while also remaining safely contained <a class="link_ptr" href="#campbell2006" title="Campbell Stephen.

One of this project’s aims is to allow visitors to experience the sensory power of the studiolo in a virtual environment.</p><p>Both for its coherence and for the gender of its creator, Isabella’s studiolo is a regular point of reference in the study of Renaissance history and art, yet for centuries it has been accessible only in dispersed pieces and spaces depopulated of major works and artefacts. As documented in detail by the late Clifford M. Brown, the rooms remain but have sustained significant renovations; many of the studiolo’s paintings and sculptures survive, but they belong to museums around the world <a class="link_ptr" href="#brown2005" title="Brown Clifford M.

Today researchers, students, and visitors are limited to looking at books, slides, and variously published online images; they may also listen to limited examples of recorded music. Visiting Mantua’s Ducal Palace in person, on the other hand, one finds empty rooms whose former glory can only be imagined. For a brief tour of the rooms of Isabella’s second studiolo as it appears today, see the video <span class="titlem quotes">Ad tempo taci’: Songs for Isabella d’Este</span> (see 6:00 ff.) <a class="link_ptr" href="#macneil2015" title="MacNeil Anne. 2015.

Yet historical uncertainty about numerous details in Isabella’s arrangement of the objects in her collection compels us to present, and to argue, this project as itself a hypothetical and interactive remix: a media artefact that inevitably alters the original through processes of reconstruction, supplementation, subtraction, and reorientation to create something unquestionably new.</p><p>Adding to the complexity of efforts to visualize the historic studiolo is the fact that Isabella had it constructed twice, in two different locations at different times in her life, and the two versions of these spaces are in different states of repair and restoration. If one premise of our endeavour is that the virtual integration of the studiolo’s contents will foster understanding of collecting and display, of the studiolo as an early modern project, and of Renaissance culture broadly conceived in ways that have been unattainable for centuries, another is that a single, definitive, and statically ‘authentic’ restoration of these historic spaces is not only impossible, but also undesirable. We view the Virtual Studiolo as an opportunity to acknowledge the dynamism of collecting and curating as cultural practices, today as well as in the sixteenth century.</p><p>Accordingly, we are aiming to present both our own curation of the studiolo as it has been researched and documented by art historians, and also the opportunity for users to move objects in and out of the spaces, rearranging and adding contents in newly-authored configurations — remixes — that may be saved for personal use or publication. Currently we anticipate the use of Blend4Web (<a class="link_ref" href="https://www.blend4web.com">https://www.blend4web.com</a>) as the framework both for navigating our own, proposed arrangement of the historic studiolo and for programming a customisable environment for future users. In anticipation of this phase of the project, the Samuel H. Kress Foundation (<a class="link_ref" href="www.kressfoundation.org/">www.kressfoundation.org/</a>) funded a concept-demonstration video that allows us to present some of the project’s foreseeable further developments. We would welcome feedback on this material, which users may offer either by contacting us through the IDEA project’s home page: (<a class="link_ref" href="http://ideaart.web.unc.edu/virtual-studiolo-studiolo-virtuale/)">http://ideaart.web.unc.edu/virtual-studiolo-studiolo-virtuale/</a>), or by filling out our short User Story survey: <a class="link_ref" href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1nbhkt7W0nHwVh76EOiQNtH-IfkKlRARPtD7UAoKzPVM/viewform?edit_requested=true">https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1nbhkt7W0nHwVh76EOiQNtH-IfkKlRARPtD7UAoKzPVM/viewform?edit_requested=true </a>.</p></div><div class="teidiv0" id="index.xml-body.1_div.3"><h2><span class="headingNumber">3. </span><span class="head">3 Directing the concept demo-video</span></h2><p>The design and development phase of the demonstration video for <span class="titlem italic">Isabella d'Este: Virtual Studiolo</span> aims to illustrate concisely and effectively to potential funding agencies the attractions of a complex project such as the Virtual Studiolo, while also raising awareness regarding the range of disciplinary collaborations and knowledge bases required for its realization (<a class="link_ref" href="http://ideaart.web.unc.edu/virtual-studiolo-studiolo-virtuale/)">http://ideaart.web.unc.edu/virtual-studiolo-studiolo-virtuale/</a>). For this purpose, we chose to produce an emotionally captivating video presenting both the historic space of the studiolo, as a 3D reconstruction resulting from a photogrammetric campaign, and a small selection of objects from the collection once housed in it. The video, for example, opens on a vortex of Isabella’s letters, which alludes to the surviving correspondence that documents the studiolo’s acquisitions and that is viewable in another IDEA project, <span class="titlem italic">IDEA Letter/e</span>. It shows two musical instruments represented by intarsia panel carvings in the historic studiolo — a lute and a spinet — which recall the love for music that led Isabella to commission songs that she played on those instruments (and which are the focus of several projects in <span class="titlem italic">IDEA Music/a</span>). It shows ceramics that she received as a gift from her daughter (featured in the <span class="titlem italic">IDEA Ceramics</span> project located in <span class="titlem italic">IDEA Art/e</span>).

The first, more creative, emotional and evocative segment is accompanied by an insistent, contemporary music track by Kai Engel that carries a certain driving force. The second segment includes a sound track of music from Isabella’s time. This sequence is especially important, as it conveys both the participant credits, which range across disciplines and institutions, and technical information about the potential evolution of the project. The video’s conclusion opens out onto new horizons for study and educational itineraries that are now possible thanks to digital media. Our project is therefore consciously a marriage of the current renaissance of art and technology with the historic, Italian Renaissance from which we draw inspiration and knowledge. </p></div><div class="teidiv0" id="index.xml-body.1_div.4"><h2><span class="headingNumber">4. </span><span class="head">4 Technical issues</span></h2><p>The creation of the video began with a photographic campaign for the photogrammetric acquisition of the historic studiolo and grotta in Mantua’s Ducal Palace. More than 500 photos were taken inside each of Isabella’s two rooms at a 36-Megapixel resolution. The photogrammetric reconstruction, with PhotoScan (<a class="link_ref" href="www.agisoft.com/">www.agisoft.com/</a>) (<a class="link_ref" href="#figure05" title="Photogrammetric reconstruction of the studiolo in PhotoScan.">Figure 5</a>), produced the following results: </p><ul><li class="item"><span class="hi">for the studiolo, starting from 574 photos, the software was able to align 574, creating a dense point cloud of 110,945,015 points with 11 million vertices and eight 4096*4096 pixel textures;</span></li></ul><p> </p><ul><li class="item"><span class="hi">for the grotta, starting from 620 photos, the software was able to align 492, creating a dense point cloud of 122,408,100 points with 12 million vertices and four 4096*4096 pixel textures.</span></li></ul><div class="figure" id="figure05"><div class="caption">Figure 4. Photogrammetric reconstruction of the studiolo in PhotoScan.</div><img src="resources/images/figure05.jpg" alt="" class="graphic" /></div><p>The 3D models were then imported and optimised in Blender. The mesh was duplicated and divided into macro areas (ceiling, walls, floor) and further subdivided into smaller zones. On the bare walls we applied a <em>planar</em> decimation, while on the rougher or more irregular areas of the mesh — such as those corresponding with the intarsia on the ceiling — we applied a <em>collapse</em> decimation. The output of this process was a mesh with a lower level of detail (100/200.000 vertices) that is suitable for full-room renderings. For close-up shots, instead, segments of the full-resolution mesh were used.</p><p>As for the textures, since PhotoScan does not optimize <em>UV unwrap</em>, the mesh had to be manually subdivided through <span style="font-style:italic">seams</span>, in order to isolate planar areas and perform a new manual unwrap. Two techniques were applied. Blender <em>standard unwrap</em> was used for the more irregular portions, with a <em>relax</em> post-processing passage for better smoothing out of irregularities. The second technique we adopted was a <em>project from view</em>.</p><p>In some areas, such as those with the intarsia wooden panels or the richly coffered ceiling, we obtained a higher level of resolution by scaling the <em>UV island</em>; for an immediate visual feedback we applied a 4K resolution UV grid texture (<a class="link_ref" href="#figure06" title="UV grid texture applied to the studiolo 3D model within Blender.">Figure 6</a>). The mesh material was configured in order to use a new empty texture for the colour. In this instance, the colour information obtained with <em>bake</em> was transferred from a high poly mesh to an optimized one.</p><div class="figure" id="figure06"><div class="caption">Figure 5. UV grid texture applied to the studiolo 3D model within Blender.</div><img src="resources/images/figure06.jpg" alt="" class="graphic" /></div><p>Several other techniques were also key for the video: fluid simulation, for ink and sealing wax drops (<a class="link_ref" href="#figure07" title="Final simulation effect of sealed wax on one of Isabella dEste letters.">Figure 7</a>); a series of particle simulations, for the vortex of letters; Blender animation nodes for the spreading of the floor tiles; and 3D photo matching, for Isabella’s portrait.</p><p>For a credible representation of the ink and sealing wax drops, the Blender fluid simulator was programmed with the real physical density of the two substances. Moreover, for sealing the wax, Blender modifiers and shapekeys were used, as explained in the tutorial we have shared on the VisitLab blog (<a class="link_ref" href="http://visitlab.cineca.it/?p=1771">http://visitlab.cineca.it/?p=1771 </a>).</p><div class="figure" id="figure07"><div class="caption">Figure 6.

Any browser supporting WebGL, even on handheld devices, through a Web address and in a fully transparent way, will provide the user with all the resources necessary to run our application (<a class="link_ref" href="#figure10" title="A still from the closing titles showing a possible Augmented Reality application to be developed in the future phases of Isabel...">Figure 10</a>).</p><p>Emotionally compelling Virtual Reality experiences have the potential to appeal to a wide and diverse audience and to achieve long-lasting learning impacts. Firsthand testimonials, oral histories and memories are typical means for achieving these effects, in Virtual Museums as well as in traditional exhibits. Where such authentic responses are unavailable, scripted storytelling may provide information that engages visitors, as for example in the Etruscanning project <a class="link_ptr" href="#pietroni2014" title="Pietroni Eva and Andrea Adami.

Interactivity is a further means for engaging visitors’ undivided attention; adding immersivity to the experience promises to achieve even higher levels of involvement, with interactions that are attainable either in real-life settings or in virtual ones, or in both at the same time <a class="link_ptr" href="#dong2017" title="Dong Yuanfa Mark Webb Carlo Harvey Kurt Debattista Alan Chalmers. 2017.

At the same time, we also anticipate that users may experience the Virtual Studiolo’s space and objects as a <span class="quote">‘playable medium,’</span> exploring through a game-like environment the choices, intentions, and tacit judgments that may have informed Isabella’s decisions <a class="link_ptr" href="#wardrip-fruin2005" title="WardripFruin Noah.

We also anticipate the creation of special projections inside physical immersive spaces, such as CAVEs, coupled with user tracking to enable a natural-feeling interaction with the objects contained in the Virtual Studiolo.</p><p>Finally, Isabella d’Este Virtual Studiolo is conceived as a multi-location, cross-media opportunity that aims both at the general public and at a specific audience of researchers. Our reflections on this spatial multiplicity and its potential realizations include not simply the two levels of real and virtual space, but also multiple potential real interfaces within the current Ducal Palace in Mantua, with its empty, historic studiolo, and any other reproductions of the studiolo that might merge real and virtual layers. In the case of the real studiolo, for example, the museum’s director has considered the possibility of installing physical copies of the paintings and other artefacts pertaining historically to these rooms. Spatial augmented reality could, however, provide another solution <a class="link_ptr" href="#bimber2005" title="Bimber Oliver and Ramesh Raskar. Spatial augmented reality Merging Real and Virtual Worlds. A.K. PetersCRC Press Natick MA (200...">[4]</a>, where projections of virtualized objects would be superimposed over the real space and could be accompanied by animations and other elements capable of increasing people's involvement. In such a realization, the virtual information layer could be integrated almost seamlessly inside the real world, reducing the estrangement factor for non 3D-experts <a class="link_ptr" href="#ridel2014" title="Ridel Brett Patrick Reuter Jeremy Laviole Nicolas Mellado Nadine Couture and Xavier Granier.

Outside the Ducal Palace of Mantua, it is also possible to set up a simulated studiolo made of real bare walls, in plywood for example, and 3D printed or reconstructed objects, such as furniture or 3D printed copies of works of art, to be used as simulacra of the objects visualized inside the virtual world. Here, visitors would experience a situation of hyper reality, with a seamless intermixture of physical and virtual worlds <a class="link_ptr" href="#tiffin2005" title="Tiffin John and Nobuyoshi Terashima.

At present, environments such as <span class="titlem italic">The Void</span> (<a class="link_ref" href="https://www.thevoid.com/">https://www.thevoid.com/</a>), a hyper reality environment for gaming defined by the company as <span class="q">‘VR you can feel,’</span> represent a possible frontier for Digital Cultural Heritage as well. Such a level of immersivity and ‘realism’ may suit both scholarly and general audiences. 360 degrees of free movement combined with environmental audio would simulate a lifelike experience that opens new perspectives for researchers on topics that will be no longer isolated but rather clearly interconnected with other dimensions of research on Isabella’s life and milieu. A still further step may be that of setting up a collaborative virtual reality environment <a class="link_ptr" href="#masson2017" title="Masson Terrence Daffy and Ken Perlin.

Multiple data sources within the project will complement each other, and their careful fusion will increase knowledge about Isabella d’Este, her practices as a collector, and the values of her time. As the Virtual Studiolo develops, we will focus on immersive technology through CAVE and museum-situated applications to add to this project the critical dimensions of scale and spatial proprioception. In both the desktop and the 3D immersive applications that will be our initial products, we attend to the textures and the aesthetics of this space, not only as principles of beauty but also in the shaping of a sensorium where Renaissance visitors affirmed their own values, desires, and emotions. We would welcome feedback from readers on the video or the project as a whole. </p></div><div class="teidiv0" id="index.xml-body.1_div.7"><h2><span class="headingNumber">7. </span><span class="head">Acknowledgements</span></h2><p>Following submission of our proposal (with video) in 2018, the Virtual Studiolo project was awarded a National Endowment for the Humanities Digital Advancement Grant, Level II, for 2019-2020.
