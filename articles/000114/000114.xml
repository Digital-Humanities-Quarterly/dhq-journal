         <dhq:abstract>
            <p>Despite DH’s long history, it is still perceived as a relatively emergent academic
               discipline which has several implications for its ongoing development and acceptance.
               In order to understand its role in supporting the field’s development and acceptance,
               SSHRC commissioned a survey of the larger Humanities and Social Science’s community
               to understand the issues related to DH’s development and acceptance and the types of
               activities that should be funded. The survey results suggest there is reason for
               optimism regarding the growing acceptance of digital methods, resources and tools and
               electronic dissemination as instructors, researchers, and students are using and
               publishing in digital outlets and creating and employing digital recourses, methods
               and tools andventuring into new research fields. This trend is likely to continue as
               students and younger scholars continue to embrace the digital in all aspects of their
               personal and professional lives. However, this optimism should be tempered to some
               extent as students and junior faculty are still less likely than associate professors
               to present and publish their digital-oriented research for a variety of reasons. The
               field’s more senior faculty can mentor their junior colleagues and students to this
               end and shape salary, tenure and promotion policies to recognize and reward these
               efforts. Finally, issues remain around the amount of funding required for the initial
               development and ongoing sustainability and relevance of digital resources and may
               become more critical over time. Granting agencies will need to evaluate their funding
               role in this regard.</p>

            <head>Introduction</head>
            <p>Despite Digital Humanities’ (DH) long history, it is still perceived as a relatively
               emergent academic discipline, rather than an established one <ptr target="#borgman2009"/>; <ptr target="#csstc2006"/>; <ptr target="#juola2008"/>. This perspective has several implications for the ongoing development and
               acceptance of the field. First, the valuation and creditability of electronic
               publishing, and digital resources and tools development and application for purposes
               of employment, salary, tenure and promotion have still not been resolved despite many
               ongoing efforts on the part of community members <ptr target="#borgman2009"/>; <ptr target="#schreibman2010"/>. Further, while a committed core of digital humanists
               exists, the DH community is still exploring ways to encourage both <q>traditional</q>
               scholars and graduate students to create and use digital tools, resources and
               methodologies. Finally, digital humanists, administrators, and granting agencies
               alike continue to struggle with age-old questions about the type and amount of
               resources, including but not limited to computing infrastructure and funding, needed
               to support and grow DH’s academic capacity.</p>
            <p>Within this larger context, Canada’s Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council
               (SSHRC) is evaluating its role in the ongoing development and acceptance of DH within
               Canada and beyond. Historically, SSHRC’s primary financial support was through the
               Image, Text, Sound and Technology (ITST) fund with some additional funding through
               discipline-specific committees and some strategic grants, such as the Digging into
               Data Challenge <ptr target="#sshrc2010"/>; <ptr target="#odh2010"/>. However, the
               agency is considering other possibilities for support that may move its funding from
               DH targeted solely to digital initiatives within the wider Humanities and Social
               Sciences community. As a result, it commissioned an environmental scan of the
               academic capacity of DH in Canada, which included a survey of the larger community
               which draws upon digital resources, tools and methodologies in their research and
               teaching, in order to understand the issues in the community and the types of
               activities that could and should be funded. This paper will report on the survey
               results.</p>
            <p>Briefly, the survey results suggest there is reason for optimism regarding the
               growing acceptance of digital methods, resources and tools and electronic
               dissemination within Humanities and Social Sciences in Canada. Instructors at all
               levels, researchers, and students are using and publishing in digital outlets and
               creating and employing digital resourses, methods and tools. Further, a diverse range
               of research, both within <q>traditional</q> fields and those created by technology
               itself are being undertaken. This trend is likely to continue as students and younger
               scholars continue to embrace the digital in all aspects of their personal and
               professional lives. However, this optimism should be tempered to some extent.
               Students and junior faculty are still less likely than associate professors to
               present their digital-oriented research at both discipline-specific and
               digital-focused conferences and to publish these results. Further, despite progress
               made, it remains unclear how this digital-oriented research is treated for salary,
               tenure and promotion. As a result, the more senior faculty can play an important
               mentoring role with the junior ones and students to encourage them to present and
               publish their digital-oriented work while continuing to shape salary, tenure and
               promotion policies to reward these efforts. Finally, issues for funding both initial
               development and ongoing sustainability and relevance of digital resources remain
               unresolved and may become more critical over time as more digital resources and tools
               are created. Funding agencies will need to continue to evaluate their role in this
               regard while individual projects explore alternative funding mechanisms.</p>
            <p>This paper is structured as follows. First, the context for this study will be
               discussed. Then, the survey methodology will be outlined followed by a detailed
               discussion of the survey results with the implications both for the Canadian DH
               community and beyond. It will conclude with recommendations to support the ongoing of
               larger DH community <note>I would like to thank Drs. Michael Eberle-Sinatra and
                  Geoffrey Rockwell, and Caitlin Brownrigg for their contribution to the development
                  of the survey and SSHRC for the research funding.</note>. </p>

            <head>Context</head>
            <p>As a community of practice, DH has had a long history with its roots in the work of
               Roberto Busa, who developed a machine-generated concordance with IBM <ptr target="#winter1999"/>. From there, more researchers saw the potential of
               computers in their work and worked to incorporate the ever growing computational
               capacity into their research and teaching. To support these efforts and provide
               outlets for research dissemination, the Association for Computing and the Humanities
               formed in 1978 and the Association for Literary and Linguistic Computing formed in
               1973. The Canadian association (now known as Society for Digital Humanities/Société
               pour l'étude des médias interactifs) followed in 1986 (ADHO). Despite this
               established history, this field is still considered to be a relatively emergent
               academic discipline <ptr target="#csstc2006"/>; <ptr target="#juola2008"/>. As
               Borgman argues, DH is at a <quote rend="inline" source="#borgman2009">pivotal moment</quote> and, with the
               right support and argument for funding and professional acceptance, the field can
               transition to an established discipline <ptr target="#borgman2009"/>. </p>
            <p>This raises the question about the nature of that <q>right</q> support needed to
               enable the field to become more mainstream. To this end, several barriers have been
               identified. First, given the reliance on technology and computing power, the Digital
               Humanist needs computers and cyberinfrastructure, accessible from their desk, within
               their institution and across organizational and national boundaries. Further to this,
               the researcher also needs access to data in electronic form and the tools that allow
               them to analyze, re(interpret) and otherwise visualize that data for new
               understandings. Of course, this requires more money than the traditional humanities
               researcher who has been traditionally seen to rely solely on their books and pencils.
               This funding is needed not just to start projects but to subsequently maintain and
               sustain them, an expectation not often applied to books. Finally, researchers,
               particularly those in traditional academic positions, need the support of their peers
               in order to be able to disseminate their research in discipline-approved venues and
               ultimately receive tenure <ptr target="#borgman2009"/>; <ptr target="#unsworth2007"/>; <ptr target="#babeu2011"/>.</p>
            <p>Despite these challenges, progress has been made on a variety of fronts to the
               community’s strength. First, various national granting agencies and non-profit
               foundations have provided funding for digital initiatives, including programs such as
               individual projects <ptr target="#sshrc2010"/>, <ptr target="#neh2010"/>, research
               infrastructure <ptr target="#cfi2010"/>, and support for digital research <ptr target="#mellon2011"/>. Further many of these agencies are cooperating to fund
               large collaborative projects, such as the Digging into Data Challenge <ptr target="#odh2010"/>. At the same time, outlets for electronic dissemination have
               increased through online versions of print journals as well as open access ones, many
               of which are supported through the Open Journal System <ptr target="#pkp"/> and
               through more informal means such as personal webpages, blogs and wikis. Finally,
               groups such as the Modern Language Association (<ptr target="#mla2002"/>, <ptr target="#mla2003"/>, <ptr target="#mla2010"/>) and others have articulated
               language for tenure documents to ensure that digital-oriented work receives
               appropriate academic credit.</p>
            <p>As the DH community makes this transition to a more established discipline, it is
               important to measure the progress made thus far and the impact of past initiatives in
               order to recommend next steps. Within Canada, two studies have measured changes in
               the acceptance in electronic resources and publishing within the Humanities and
               Social Sciences <ptr target="#archer1999"/>; <ptr target="#siemens2002"/>. Conducted
               several years apart and using similar survey questions, these studies documented the
               increasing acceptance of these in conducting research and teaching, but not
               necessarily, however, as peer-approved outlets for disseminating research that will
               appear on one’s tenure dossier. These findings have been confirmed by studies
               conducted in other countries <ptr target="#harley2010"/>; <ptr target="#network2010"/>.</p>
            <p>It is within this context that SSHRC requested this environment scan of the Canadian
               DH academic capacity in order to understand where the community currently stands and
               to determine required next steps to strengthen the field within Canada and beyond. In
               particular, the funding agency wanted to understand the type of funding programs
               which were needed. This survey is intended to provide recommendations in this
               regard.</p>
         </div>
         <div>
            <head>Methodology</head>
            <p>This survey was developed in January 2009 and focused on three components of academic
               capacity: research activity and dissemination, professional development, and teaching
               and student development. Given the broad audience for this survey, the term
                  <q>digital methods, technologies and resources</q> was used in place of Digital
               Humanities or Humanities Computing for several reasons. First, the broader term was
               intended to capture those who may not consider themselves to be a <q>Digital
                  Humanist,</q> but yet undertake that type of work using and creating databases,
               analytical tools, digital manuscripts, electronic resources, and others. (A list of
               these digital-oriented methods, technologies and resources can be seen in Table 2.)
               Second, the DH community as a whole itself is debating the skills and knowledge
               required to be a <q>Digital Humanist,</q> as evidenced by blog postings (For example,
               see <ptr target="#hoover2011"/>; <ptr target="#mccarty2011"/>; <ptr target="#reside2011"/>; <ptr target="#pannapacker2011"/>; <ptr target="#ramsay2011a"/>; <ptr target="#ramsay2011b"/>). </p>
            <p>In order to provide some comparison to earlier surveys related to the credibility of
               electronic publishing and determine if attitudes to electronic resources and
               materials have changed over the past 10 years <ptr target="#archer1999"/>; <ptr target="#siemens2002"/>, demographic information and several questions related to
               electronic dissemination and tenure and promotion policies were repeated from these
               earlier surveys. Given the Canadian audience, the survey was translated into French.
               The English and French versions can be found in Appendix 1 and 2.</p>
            <p>The survey was distributed in May and June 2009 with data collection closing on June
               19. In an attempt to reach the full Humanities and Social Sciences community in
               Canada, it was distributed through the emailing lists of the Society for Digital
               Humanities/Société pour l'étude des médias interactifs, the Canadian DH society, the
               Digital Humanities Summer Institute to the attention of Canadians, and email messages
               to the associations which comprise the Canadian Federation of Social Sciences <ptr target="#cfhss2011"/> asking them to forward, if appropriate, a copy of the
               invitation to their members, and email invitations to other individuals that may not
               have received it through these various other channels. (This echoed the approach used
               in earlier surveys <ptr target="#siemens2002"/>.) A total of 227 usable responses
               were received. </p>
            <p>The survey data was analyzed through the use of Excel and SPSS in order to gain
               statistical information. The open-ended questions were analyzed through a grounded
               theory approach which focuses on the themes that emerge from the data. This analysis
               is broken into several steps. First, the data is organized, read and coded to
               determine categories, themes and patterns. These are tested for emergent and
               alternative understandings, both within a single interview and across all interviews.
               This is an iterative process, involving movement between the data, codes and
               concepts, constantly comparing the data to itself and the developing themes <ptr target="#glaser1967"/>; <ptr target="#marshall1999"/>.</p>

            <head>Survey Results</head>
            <p>The following section will explore the results from the survey, including demographic
               information, research activity and dissemination, professional development, and
               teaching and student development. (This order reflects the survey’s structure.) The
               fuller implications of these results along with recommendations will be discussed in
               the paper’s final sections.</p>
            <div>
               <head>Demographic Characteristics</head>
               <p>The respondents represented a broad cross-section of a broadly defined DH
                  community of practice in Canada. As can be seen in Table 1, most respondents work
                  in English and are affiliated with a university. Of those who indicated their
                  gender, females were the larger group. The spread of academic rank and age was
                  reasonable with 45% between the ages of 30 and 49, and 16% were at the Assistant
                  Professor level, 17% at the Associate, and 17% at the Full Professor. Graduate
                  students comprised 6% of the responses. </p>
               <p>The respondents represented over 35 disciplines from the social sciences,
                  humanities, library and information sciences, computer science and business.
                  (Respondents could check more than one discipline.) The best represented
                  disciplines were English (40%), Literature (25%), Humanities (15%), Culture and
                  Language Studies (12%), and History (10%). Approximately 6% of the respondents
                  identified humanities computing as their discipline, which suggests that DH is
                  beginning a recognized discipline in its own right. An overwhelming majority of
                  the respondents (80%) have undertaken research projects involving digital methods,
                  technologies and resources. Those who answered <q>no</q> to this question still
                  provided information on their research dissemination, professional development,
                  and teaching and student development activities.</p>

               <p>As the survey results show, Humanists and Social Scientists are actively embracing
                  digital technologies and resources, and to a lesser extent, digital methods, in
                  their research. In particular, they are using and creating software, databases,
                  digital manuscripts and electronic resources within a traditional approach to
                  research. For some, the digital has created new research avenues. The survey
                  participants have been successful in accessing funding for their projects. They
                  are also overwhelmingly using formal and informal electronic outlets to
                  disseminate their scholarship. However, as a group, these participants are not
                  generally presenting their digital-oriented research at conferences. Finally, they
                  have received very little training in digital technologies, resources and digital
                  methods.</p>
               <div>
                  <head>Research Activity</head>
                  <p>As stated above, 80% of respondents indicated that their research projects
                     involve digital methods, technologies and resources at some level. As seen in
                     Table 2, databases, software, webpages, digital manuscripts, and electronic
                     resources were used most regularly. Approximately one-third of respondents use
                     analytical tools, authoring tools, bibliographic software, and wikis and blogs
                     in their research. </p>
                  <p>As evidenced in their responses to an open-ended question about their research
                     focus, respondents are involved in both the creation of these digital methods,
                     technologies and resources and their application. They are also grounding their
                     research in traditional Humanities and Social Sciences research approaches and
                     within new fields of studies such as virtual worlds, interface design and
                     online gaming. Further, they are using digital methods, tools and resources to
                     facilitate and enhance collaborations.</p>
                  <p>By way of example and to name but a few, the <q>creators</q> are creating
                     online scholarly annotated editions and digital editions, preparing and then
                     using <q>electronic versions of historic texts</q> with
                     the Text Encoding Initiative (TEI), building a <q>database
                        that will be a scholarly reference work,</q> developing search tools and
                     building <q>a digital library of illustrations and books from
                        the 1860s.</q> Further, the <q>users</q> draw upon digitized images,
                     manuscripts, and other materials, encoded texts, electronic editions and
                     databases, online journals, websites, and software such as TEI, googledocs,
                     Zotero, and authorship attribution. For others, the digital has created new
                     opportunities such as <q>examining social media <q>best
                           practices,</q>
                     </q> researching <q>game studies, the development of

                  <p>There is some variation among age groups on the use of these methods,
                     technologies and resources. In particular, the younger age groups were more
                     likely to use Facebook and social networking. Approximately 34% of the 20–29
                     age group and over 25% of the 30–39 age group indicated that they were regular
                     users of Facebook/Social Networking. This is in contrast to the 40–49 age group
                     (14.5%), 50–59 age group (0%), and 60 and older (18.5%). </p>
                  <p>The respondents also indicated the type of electronic resources that they used
                     within their research. As seen in Table 3, they primarily draw upon electronic
                     versions of previously paper resources, such as journals, government resources,
                     newspapers and archival materials. However, they do not appear to be using
                     tools such as TAPoR, OJS and Conftool, tools that can make some aspects of
                     academic life easier to coordinate. Further, sizable portions of respondents
                     (up to 10% in some cases) do not appear to be aware of these types of
                     resources. </p>

                     As one respondent said about the research in which they are involved, <q>Loci of research are: (1) scholarly editing &amp;
                        bibliographical work, for which the development and use of digital tools is
                        necessary &amp; commonplace; (2) historical research, whose data sets are
                        often of a size to make manual management hard, so digital tools (e.g.
                        databases) are a necessity: (3) literary-critical projects.</q>

                        speaking, ALL of my research involves this because it's all written on
                        computer, submitted to publishers electronically, and typically the data
                        collection and analysis is done on computer as well. I don't think there's

                  <p>Respondents provided guidance on the type of granting program they felt was
                     needed to support digital-oriented research. First, a segment of respondents
                     recommended more funding from SSHRC. This included a request for an independent
                     application category for DH/Humanities Computing scholarship while another
                     suggested an extended Image, Text, Sound and Technology program<note>SSHRC
                        discontinued this program in 2010 and instituted a broader funding program
                        focused on the Digital Economy.</note>. Second, respondents specifically
                     suggested funding for technical support and infrastructure and the capacity to
                     share this between institutions. One respondent stated, <q>...but we definitely need infrastructure here in Canada, e.g., something
                        like surveymonkey, space for setting up interactive web sites for
                        participant engagement. Right now, each team and each university reinvents
                        the wheel, leading to a huge waste of precious resources. Researchers should
                        have a service for digital humanities research to go to that includes design
                        and software experts, etc.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Further, several respondents called for renewal-based funding programs for
                     ongoing research agenda, similar to that seen in the sciences. As one
                     respondent argued, <q>programmes permettant un financement à

                              to finance the hiring of technical personnel; programs to establish
                              digital humanities centres (which accept a hybrid of service and

                        </note>
                     </q> Finally, some respondents argued for grant funding for maintenance and
                     renewal of existing projects. One respondent commented that funding is needed
                        <q>to ensure that we can continue to update and improve
                        the resource. But funding bodies (perhaps understandably) want to support
                        new digital projects, rather than helping to make existing ones continue to
                        be relevant and cutting edge.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Amongst the calls for additional funding was the recognition that digital
                     projects experience challenges that are often not associated with traditional
                     forms of scholarship, such as long term usability, sustainability, quality
                     standards and training. For example, one respondent called for <q>more funding for projects that involve substantial work on
                        conservation, archiving and upgrading digital collections and research
                        databases for ongoing work that keeps research data and archival collections
                        in useable form.</q> Another argued for additional <q>support for online archiving of rare materials, which probably includes
                        support for continued training (a bigger problem in DH than in other
                        branches of scholarship) and access to sophisticated technologies for
                        rendering manuscripts in high def or under different kinds of light,
                        etc.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>At the same time, a portion of the respondents suggested that additional
                     support from colleagues and knowledgeable grant adjudicators and reviewers were
                     just as important as funding. One commented that they <q>think
                        digital projects should be treated exactly as other research projects are
                        treated, and judged on their own merits. As long as we have knowledgeable
                        SSHRC committees who understand the place of digital tools, resources and
                        practices in humanities research, we should be able to compete on a level
                        playing field with other grant applicants.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Another echoed that <q>I'd like to see it incorporated more
                        into the <q>normal</q> grant processes, rather than it being a
                           <q>special</q> thing to use digital methods.</q>

                  <p>The respondents are actively disseminating their research through electronic
                     means with over 72% of all respondents having made their scholarship available
                     in some digital form. This suggests the use of electronic dissemination is
                     increasing, albeit with some variation among age groups. As compared to the
                     younger age groups, older respondents were more likely to have made their
                     scholarship available electronically, as seen in Table 5.</p>

                  <p>The respondents are disseminating their research electronically through a
                     variety of formal and informal channels. In terms of other electronic outlets,
                     respondents are publishing in electronic journals (both open access and
                     pay-per-view), online conference proceedings and electronic books, and through
                     inclusion in research databases as well as distributing through websites,
                     email, listserves, blogs and wikis. In terms of refereed electronic outlets,
                     almost 40% have published in this type of outlet. Again, some variation among
                     age groups and roles exists. As shown in Table 6 and Table 7, both the 40–49
                     age group and Associate Professors are more likely to have published in a
                     refereed electronic outlet than other age groups and roles. At the same time,
                     the youngest age group and graduate and doctoral students were least likely to
                     have published in a refereed electronic outlet.</p>

                  <p>While they are disseminating electronically, respondents appear to be hesitant
                     to present their digital-oriented research at conferences. Only 37% have
                     presented their digital-oriented research at discipline-specific conferences. A
                     still smaller number (21%) have presented at a digital-oriented conference. Of
                     those who have, they have presented primarily at Society for Digital
                     Humanities/Societe pour l'étude des médias interactifs (7%), Digital Humanities
                     (6%) and Canadian Symposium on Text Analysis (5%). Other venues named include
                     Text Encoding Initiative Annual meeting, International Conference on Electronic
                     Publishing, Digital Resources in the Humanities, Digital Games Research
                     Association, Computer Assisted Language Instruction Consortium, and Association
                     for History and Computing. Following the trends highlighted above, the 40–49
                     age group and Associate Professors tend to be the most active in this regard,

                  <p>Only a small percentage of respondents are members of DH associations.
                     Approximately 9% are members of the Society for Digital Humanites/Société pour
                     l'étude des médias interactifs, 7% are in the Association for Computing in the
                     Humanities and 6% are members of the Association for Literary and Linguistic

                  <p> The final set of questions within this category related to training. Less than
                     one-third of respondents have attended digital methods institutes, workshops or
                     courses for skill development. Of those who indicated that they had, over 50%
                     named the University of Victoria's Digital Humanities Summer Institute (DHSI)
                     and its courses including text encoding, digitization, text analysis, and
                     project management. Respondents also mentioned other institutes and workshops
                     such as Nineteenth Century Scholarship Online (NINES), Digital Humanities
                     Observatory (Royal Irish Academy), University of Illinois Urbana Champagne
                     Software Environment for the Advancement of Scholarly Research (SEASR). The
                     respondents also noted that they have taken courses in website development,
                     graduate courses and programs, computers and composition, and media
                     applications. As seen in Tables 12 and 13, the 40–49 age group and associate
                     professors are more likely to have undergone training of some nature.</p>

                  <p>Overall, the respondents are actively incorporating the digital within their
                     research activity and disseminating through electronic means. However, at the
                     same time, they are not as involved in conference presentations on their
                     digital-oriented work or in receiving formal training in digital methods,

               <p>Respondents were asked their expectations and understandings of the impact that
                  their digital-oriented work will have on their professional development and career
                  trajectory, particularly in relation to tenure, salary and promotion. As seen in
                  Table 14, approximately 10% of respondents answered that their institutions had
                  policies regarding electronic documents and publication and development and use of
                  digital technologies, tools, and resources for purposes of tenure, salary and
                  promotion. However, the majority did not know if their institutions had these
                  policies, which means that scholars are undertaking their work without knowing how
                  it will count in professional contexts.</p>

               <p>When it comes to teaching and work with students, the survey respondents are
                  actively including digital resources, methods and technologies in the classroom.
                  This level of interaction is further supported by digital program development,
                  particularly at the undergraduate level. Finally, the survey respondents suggested
                  that their students were actively incorporating digital methods, technologies and
                  resources into their course work and personal lives, something that was
                  encouraging, or even pushing, instructors to do the same within their
                  teaching.</p>

                  <p>Over 80% of respondents are actively incorporating electronic resources into
                     their teaching. As outlined in Table 15, the most popular digital methods,
                     technologies and resources incorporated include electronic resources, webpages,
                     course management systems, digital manuscripts, and databases. At the time of
                     the survey, respondents were not incorporating web 2.0 technologies, such as
                     second life and Facebook and other social networks, though this may be
                     different today.</p>

                     of Humanities, Arts, Social Sciences and Information Sciences, primarily at the
                     undergraduate level (35%), with fewer at the masters (24%) and PhD level (14%).
                     Approximately 41% indicated that their universities had plans to develop
                     courses or programs at the undergraduate (33%), the masters (22%) and PhD (15%)
                     levels. This growth is expected to be in the longer term with 26% indicating
                     this development will likely occur in the next few years.</p>

                  <p>Respondents were also asked about whether students use digital methodologies,

                     students were perceived to be actively incorporating digital methodologies,
                     tools and resources in their course and thesis work, teaching assistantships,
                     research assistantships and particularly their social lives. </p>

               <head>Final Comments from Respondents</head>
               <p>At the end of the survey, the respondents were asked a series of open-ended
                  questions regarding the future of DH and the supports required to develop capacity
                  in this community. </p>
               <p>The first question focused on the respondents’ use of their <q>crystal ball</q> to
                  envision future directions of DH. Collectively, the respondents provided thoughts
                  along a series of themes. Several respondents indicated that they foresaw DH
                  moving beyond a narrow disciplinary focus into more collaboration and broader
                  questions. For example, one suggested that there would be increased <q>cross-discipline work with computer science, library/information
                     science and the fine arts in areas such as data mining and multimedia
                     incorporation</q> while another foresaw the following activities: <q>Interconnecting researchers and building teams; archiving and
                     analysis of large amounts of textual, audio, and visual data; working more
                     closely with colleagues in other fields to solve problems rather than remaining
                     within a purely disciplinary framework; new ways of relating text to image as
                     the latter grows in importance; using resources to provide the public with
                     informed, scholarly materials aimed at a popular audience.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Others suggested that the field would be developing new tools, especially those
                  that would <q>facilitate the migration of humanities scholars
                     into digital environments.</q> For example, <q>DH appears
                     to be tackling increasingly non-trivial computing programs. I see two future
                     tracks of development: one in which these more challenging avenues are
                     explored, and another in which the realized tools and techniques are repackaged
                     and made more accessible to the less sophisticated late adopters within the
                     humanities field.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Another argued that they <q>believe one important strategic
                     direction the digital humanities will take will be to develop tools, workflows,
                     and expressive and attestive conventions to facilitate the migration of
                     humanities scholars into digital environments. For such a migration to occur,
                     digital humanities scholars will need to devise and test tools, workflows and
                     scholarly conventions for communication.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Finally, one foresaw <q>a shift away from the digitizing and
                     tagging of primary materials toward the development of tools for integrating
                     research tools, e.g. NINES.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Another set of respondents focused on the likely development of additional online
                  resources for research, dissemination and teaching. One individual envisioned
                     <q>more use of digitized texts — wider access to instant
                     answers from queries on historical and cultural issues...</q> while another
                  suggested that within their field <q>...digital critical
                     editions of significant but not widely distributed texts will become
                     increasingly important for both scholarly and financial reasons.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Finally, respondents suggested the DH will likely become more widely adopted. One
                  individual articulated that they <q>think that it will become
                     mainstream — everything that succeeds will be available through Google or its
                     equivalent. Specialized sites with a high learning curve won't last.</q>
                  Another echoed this with <q>(l)arge scale adoption</q>
                  happening through <q>ubuiquity rather than conscious
                     effort.</q> Another suggested that their <q>goal is for
                     students to work seamlessly between the real and digital worlds and see that
                     expanded workspace as integral to their learning, their research, their work
                     and to their private and public lives.</q>
               </p>
               <p>However, some concern was expressed that a digital divide may be created between
                  those who already have the skills and those who cannot easily access training to
                  develop them. As one respondent stated, <q>I am not a digital
                     user unless required. It does save me time and it can be used widely. However,
                     the problem is that there is [sic] no programs to allow faculty to develop
                     their digital skills.</q>
               </p>
               <p>In a second open-ended question, the respondents offered recommendations on the
                  capacity needed to strengthen the DH community. First, they called for more
                  infrastructure such as networks, labs, supply workstations, and computer
                  programming. One individual stated that this included <q>computational infrastructure in the humanities, generally, that plus
                     appropriate instruction, expertise, and support.</q> A key component is to
                  ensure adequate research funding to both individuals and universities so that they
                  can <q>keep digital technologies up-to-date and the
                     infrastructure to support such technologies well into the future — this is the
                     biggest problem at my institution.</q> Finally, there was also a call for
                  maintenance and sustainability. As one stated, <q>increased
                     funding is an obvious one, but not only for new projects. We need a system in
                     place for ensuring project sustainability.</q> Besides more dollars, some
                  respondents indicate the need to educate grant adjudicators and reviewers to
                  ensure that they have the knowledge needed to effectively evaluate a
                  digital-oriented application. </p>
               <p>Beyond funds for digital projects, respondents suggested continued support and
                  leadership from universities is required. Some recommended courses for students
                  and faculty to learn the skills by <q>making available know-how:
                     workshops, team-teaching programs, traveling seminars.</q> Rewards and
                  recognition policies were also highlighted. As one suggested, <q>at the faculty level, collaborative research and publishing needs to be
                     encouraged, recognized and rewarded. Interdisciplinary research also needs to
                     be funded and encouraged.</q> Further, <q>(m)ore
                     acceptance of/respect for publishing in online journals. This needs to happen
                     not only at the level of official policies on hiring and promotion, but also in
                     the attitudes of professors.</q>
               </p>
               <p>A selection of the respondents argued that it is important to keep the digital
                  development grounded within the humanities. While digital material and tools are
                  important, one respondent suggested that <q>we still need know
                     how to read, how to interpret, how to analyze and how to write.</q>
                  Finally, <q>the interface between <q>the digital</q> and <q>the
                        humanities</q> needs to be strengthened. Too few humanists (let alone
                     administrators) understand what d.h. is.</q>
               </p>
               <p>The respondents also saw the opportunity to develop new skills beyond traditional
                  humanities skills. For example, <q>Digital Humanists will need
                     to develop the skills required to conduct lab and field experiments. We will
                     also need to develop methods to support such research.</q> There is also a
                  recognition of the need for collaboration and cross-disciplinary work as there is
                  a <q>shift from disciplinary to problem focused research;
                     structures and funding that encourage cross-disciplinary work and team
                     building; creation of physical spaces that allow for interactive work amongst
                     researchers (not just individual scholars in individual offices)...</q>
               </p>
               <p>At the same time, however, several respondents did not perceive the need to take
                  concrete steps to increase academic capacity within the community. As stated,
                     <q>the community is strong and our numbers are growing.
                        <q>Digital Humanities</q> is being recognized as a legitimate field of
                     study.</q> Several suggested that change will be driven by students as
                  articulated in this comment <q>Le renouvellement viendra des
                     étudiants Peu de la génération des profs.</q>
                  <note>English translation: <q>The renewal comes from the
                        generation of students, not of the professors.</q>
                  </note>
               </p>
               <p>As a third open-ended question, respondents were asked to articulate the type of
                  support needed to develop this capacity within DH. One key priority identified was
                  continued leadership from deans, other administrators and colleagues. Policies to
                  support publishing in electronic journals and recognition are needed because
                     <q>the creation of digital repositories, thematic
                     collections, etc. has to be viewed on an equal footing as publishing
                     monographs.</q> Given the amount of time required to learn and utilize new
                  technologies, several respondents also articulated a desire for more time to do
                  this type of work. As one respondent articulated, they need <q>Funding, and time!!! Time is important — it takes a long time to learn and
                     utilize new technologies and to be able to trouble shoot them.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Echoing many of the comments already made, respondents recommended funding as well
                  as the involvement from other disciplines, particularly computer scientists as
                  researchers, rather than purely as programmers and developers. Further, there
                  needs to be <q>greater support for research in the digital
                     outside of <q>digital</q> departments. That is, keep the research highly
                     interdisciplinary.</q> Finally, one respondent suggested that the community
                  of practice needs <q>more <q>hybrid</q> individuals who are at
                     home with the two cultures and who are committed to building a new hybrid
                     culture within the academy.</q> With this, several respondents also
                  suggested that infrastructure needs to be shared more, especially across a single
                  campus. As one respondent stated, <q>We need infrastructure here
                     badly. Otherwise, each research team needs to come up with their own server,
                     designer, programmer, maintenance, etc. Lots of previous time and resources are
                     lost that way.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Finally, respondents were asked whether they recommend that untenured faculty
                  undertake digital research and teaching. Their answers fall into three categories.
                  First, a selection of respondents felt that untenured faculty could undertake
                  digital research and teaching, but that it not be <q>at the expense of traditional
                     research and teaching.</q> This caution recognized that <q>the academy does not yet take new methods seriously across the board.</q>
                  Another echoed that <q>reality still dictates that
                        '<q>traditional</q>' scholarship be strong.</q>
               </p>
               <p>The second category was <q>yes, but</q> with some overall caution since digital
                  scholarship is not always recognized for tenure. As one stated, <q>it is vitally necessary that younger scholars take up digital
                     research and teaching, but I would not ask someone to do so where it might not
                     be recognized in retention and tenure decisions.</q> Another respondent
                  suggested that an untenured faculty member undertake this work <q>but it has to be kept secret from older colleagues and especially
                     the administration.</q> Another individual is encouraging the work <q>because we don't want valuable projects to be postponed to a time
                     when faculty are <q>safe</q>... Some projects need several years to gain
                     momentum and achieve results.</q> Finally, in recognition of the amount of
                  time required to learn the skills, one untenured faculty member stated, <q>Since I happen to be untenured at this point — and I undertake
                     digital research and teaching — my answer is yes, with one proviso. That
                     proviso is that the given faculty member have those skills prior to their entry
                     into a tenure-track position. If they don't have those skills, they will not
                     have the time to acquire them in the five or so years they are untenured. Such
                     a person would be better served completing whatever teaching, research and
                     service requirements they need to acquire tenure before learning a new digital
                     skill.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Finally, a third group provided an unqualified <q>yes.</q> One suggested <q>Yes — I think there is rich terrain there for publication and
                     experience, and often junior faculty have more experience with these methods in
                     their PhD programs, so the trajectory seems natural.</q> Another stated
                     <q>yes, because by the time they acquire tenure, they will be
                     familiar with the process and more likely to incorporate it and mentor new
                     faculty into it.</q> One more individual recommended <q>Yes, at this stage, my department (regardless of what it might say) couldn’t
                     imagine bringing anyone in for a career with us unless they were aware, and
                     incorporating, digital methods in their work — even if it wasn’t the focus of
                     their own research endeavour.</q> Several respondents highlighted that the
                  number of faculty positions positioned within both the humanities and DH are
                  increasing.</p>
               <p>Some respondents also provided a practical reason for the incorporation of digital
                  methods, tools and resources. They suggested that faculty do not have much choice
                  in this regard given the importance of keeping ahead of students. As one stated
                  emphatically, <q>Absolutely. Tenured or untenured shouldn't
                     really make any difference, but it's a greater expectation that younger
                     colleagues can keep up with their students and will have the know-how to make
                     time-efficient use of technology to help in course-management and democratizing
                     the learning process.</q> Finally, <q>Yes. It is the way
                     of the future, and the way to keep ahead of and in tune with students.</q>

               <head>Discussion</head>
               <p>This survey provides a snapshot of DH capacity within the Canadian context. These
                  opportunities and ongoing challenges are, however, not unique to Canada, but
                  reflect issues in the larger DH community.</p>
               <p>First, these results suggest much reason for optimism regarding the growing
                  acceptance of digital methods, resources, and tools and electronic dissemination,
                  particularly at the associate professor rank and 40–49 age group. From an overall
                  perspective, as can be seen in Table 18, since the larger academic community has
                  been asked questions about the incorporation of electronic resources into their
                  work <ptr target="#archer1999"/>, <ptr target="#siemens2002"/>, a steady increase
                  in use and acceptance can be seen. This trend is reinforced by the fact that many
                  publishers and libraries have moved from print journals and books to print and
                  electronic materials and solely digital ones, as well as efforts to digitize
                  materials such as newspapers, government documents and archival material <ptr target="#schonfeld2010"/>. Further, over the past decade, several projects
                  which make access to online materials easier have started and grown in size and
                  acceptance, including initiatives such as the Public Knowledge Project (<ref target="http://pkp.sfu.ca/">http://pkp.sfu.ca/</ref>), the Open Journal System
                     (<ref target="http://pkp.sfu.ca/?q=ojs">http://pkp.sfu.ca/?q=ojs</ref>),
                  Synergies (<ref target="http://www.synergiescanada.org/">http://www.synergiescanada.org/</ref>), NINES (<ref target="http://www.nines.org/">www.nines.org</ref>), and other open access and
                  open source projects.</p>

               <p>Second, respondents have embraced broader methods of dissemination beyond the
                  traditional print journal. Many faculty, staff, students and projects have
                  webpages which provide links to research and journal articles <ptr target="#harley2010"/>; <ptr target="#network2010"/>. Further, blogging has
                  become popular among digital humanists with examples such as Lisa Spiro’s <title rend="quotes">Digital Scholarship in the Humanities</title> (<ref target="http://digitalscholarship.wordpress.com/">http://digitalscholarship.wordpress.com/</ref>), Bethany Nowviskie’s musings
                     (<ref target="http://nowviskie.org/">http://nowviskie.org/</ref>), and Dan
                  Cohen’s Digital Humanities Blog (<ref target="http://www.dancohen.org/">http://www.dancohen.org/</ref>) to name but a few. And of course, twitter has
                  taken off in the community as evidenced by the numerous accounts and hash tags
                  related to all things DH, such as @DHAnswers, @RayS6, @nowviskie, @dhinstitute,
                  @unsworth, #dh11, #teifuture, #thatcamp, and many others <ptr target="#kirschenbaum2010"/>. </p>
               <p>Third, the consideration of digital is creating a diverse range of research, both
                  within 'traditional' fields and those created by the technology itself. The new
                  generation of scholars and alternative academic professionals are demonstrating
                  high comfort levels with digital tools, methodologies, and resources and
                  incorporating these into all aspects of their professional and personal lives.
                  These individuals are also likely to strongly encourage others to accept these in
                  their efforts to stay current. Further, many faculty are drawing upon this
                  potential by employing students within their digital-oriented research. The
                  additional training opportunities are providing additional support and skill
                  development. </p>
               <p>Further, these results suggest that a new generation of scholars, who may not
                  build or develop a tool, database or digitized manuscript, but will instead
                  incorporate these resources into their research and teaching. From this, new
                  opportunities for scholarship will occur which will, in turn, likely contribute to
                  ongoing discussions of who is actually a <q>digital humanist</q> (For example, see
                     <ptr target="#hoover2011"/>; <ptr target="#mccarty2011"/>; <ptr target="#reside2011"/>; <ptr target="#ramsay2011a"/>; <ptr target="#ramsay2011b"/>. In the future, will a person need to have encoded
                  their own document, created their own database or even written their own software
                  code to be accepted into this community of practice, as argued by some <ptr target="#ramsay2011a"/>; <ptr target="#ramsay2011b"/>? The answer to this will
                  then inform the direction that DH will proceed. Should more creators of these
                  digital methods, technologies and resources be developed? Or should users be
                  trained to be become creators? Or finally, should the community work to accomplish
                  both options while creating more general acceptance of digital methods,
                  technologies and resources? The answers to these questions will drive many aspects
                  of determining the type of support that is needed — whether funding, tools,
                  training, infrastructure and others — to increase academic capacity. For example,
                  if the goal is to attract more users, then perhaps the response is the creation of
                  more <q>tools for the novice</q>
                  <ptr target="#flanders2009"/> or <q>killer apps</q>
                  <ptr target="#juola2008"/>. If the goal is to develop more creators, more training
                  in these skills and knowledge will be required.</p>
               <p>Despite these opportunities, challenges still abound for those who wish to
                  undertake this type of scholarship. For example, these results suggest the most
                  active Digital Humanist is an associate professor and likely between the ages of
                  40–49. This group appears to be the most active in terms of making their research
                  available electronically, presenting on their digital-oriented research at both
                  discipline-specific and digital-focused conferences, and employing these materials
                  in the classroom, a finding echoed by <ptr target="#harley2010"/>. If this is the
                  case, despite the growing acceptance of things digital, then more work needs to be
                  done to ensure that graduate students and pre-tenured faculty feel confident to
                  embrace the digital methods, technologies, and resources and to incorporate these
                  into their professional portfolio <ptr target="#harley2010"/>; <ptr target="#schonfeld2010"/>; <ptr target="#schonfeld2010"/>; <ptr target="#babeu2011"/>. Some of this reluctance on the part of the community’s
                  junior members may be explained by the apparent lack of headway that has been made
                  in the valuation of these within the salary, tenure and promotion process,
                  especially when compared against past surveys. As can be seen in Table 20, while
                  the number of respondents who said <q>yes</q> that their institution has policies
                  related to the evaluation of digital resources, methods and tools has increased
                  and the percentage of <q>no</q> has decreased, the percentage of respondents who
                  do not know has increased. This trend comes despite work done over the past decade
                  following examples from other institutions <ptr target="#price2010"/> and work by
                  organizations such as the MLA (<ptr target="#mla2002"/>, <ptr target="#mla2003"/>). In particular, Schreibman and Hanlon <ptr target="#schreibman2010"/> have
                  identified tool development as one area where more work is required to value this
                  activity for the purposes of employment, professional advancement and tenure.</p>
               <p>Significant change may be slow to come in the short term. The more senior scholars
                  do not appear to be pursuing digital-oriented research, disseminating
                  electronically or employing digital resources in the classroom. Given their roles
                  as researchers, administrators, decision makers, and grant reviewers, if this
                  group does not support DH’s potential, efforts on the part of graduate students
                  and pre-tenured faculty to employ these methods may be stalled. </p>

               <p>Another challenge identified by these results is the apparent hesitation for
                  individuals to present their digital-oriented research at discipline-specific and
                  digital-oriented conferences. Perhaps, given the growing ubiquity of digital
                  materials, many respondents may not think of presenting at digital-oriented
                  conferences or identify these as parts of their paper at discipline-oriented
                  conferences, such as the Modern Languages Association (MLA) and Renaissance
                  Society of America (RSA). Alternatively, the younger scholars may be reluctant to
                  identify themselves in this manner, particularly at those conferences which are an
                  important contribution to the CV of a starting scholar. More work will need to be
                  done to understand this trend.</p>
               <p>As always, issues of funding for both initial development and ongoing
                  sustainability and relevance of digital resources remains unresolved and may
                  become more critical in the future. Unlike books where an expectation of updates
                  does not exist, this community will need to work with granting agencies to create
                  new funding models that will support not only the development of these resources,
                  but changes and updates that come with advances in both technology and scholarship
                     <ptr target="#kretzschmar2009"/>. Given the amount of resources needed for many
                  DH projects, every effort should be made to ensure ongoing sustainability <ptr target="#mckie2002"/>.</p>
            </div>
            <div>
               <head>Conclusions and Recommendations</head>
               <p>The following conclusions and recommendations are designed to support the already
                  strong efforts that are in place to develop and strengthen academic capacity in
                  Digital Humanities both within Canada and beyond. </p>
               <p>First, given that most respondents appear to be learning digital methods,
                  technologies and resources on their own rather than through more formal settings,
                  more opportunities for the development of training and skill development
                  opportunities must be created. For example, departments, faculties and
                  universities need to continue their plans for additional undergraduate and
                  graduate courses and degrees, combining skill and knowledge development in
                  traditional disciplinary methods with digital and project management skills.
                  Further thought should also be given to certificate programs that could be taken
                  in parallel to traditional graduate programs or in addition to these <ptr target="#spiro2010"/>. The recently launched Praxis Program at the Scholars’
                  Lab (<ptr target="#scholars2011"/>) at University of Virginia is one example of
                  this type of program. It would also be beneficial for students to have hands-on
                  experiences through internships with libraries and DH centres, to the benefit of
                  the students and the projects <ptr target="#conway2010"/>. At the same time,
                  individuals who are interested in developing their skills can take advantage of
                  the growing number of courses, such as DHSI (<ref target="http://www.dhsi.org">dhsi.org</ref>), THATCamp (<ref target="http://www.thatcamp.org">thatcamp.org</ref>), One Week|One Tool (<ref target="http://www.oneweekonetool.org">oneweekonetool.org</ref>), the Advanced
                  Topics in Scholarly Text Encoding <ptr target="#wwp"/> and many others. </p>
               <p>As indicated by these respondents and in other forums, such as a recent DH funding
                  conference panel <ptr target="#adho2011"/>, DH projects continue to need funding
                  and often on a scale that is not typically seen within the Humanities. Lobbying
                  efforts with various funding agencies should continue, not only for resources to
                  support the creation of new digital resources and tools, but also for the ongoing
                  maintenance and sustainability as technology and scholarship advances. Users
                  expect that these will stay current and survive changes in hardware and software
                  and not <q>gather dust</q> like a book on a shelf, particularly given the
                  sometimes large amounts of money that was invested to create the resource at the
                  outset. The DH community may also need to look beyond traditional funding sources
                  to include alternative revenue models, some of which may be borrowed from the
                  private sector <ptr target="#guthrie2008"/>. For example, while the success of
                  these efforts still have to be determined, the Internet Shakespeare Editions has
                  moved in this direction with cooperative advertising and click-through ads with
                  AbeBooks.com and Amazon.com <ptr target="#shakespeare2010"/>.</p>
               <p>To support these ongoing calls for additional funding, DH community members need
                  to continue to educate colleagues, administration, and granting agencies so that
                  these individuals understand how DH supports and extends Humanities and Social
                  Sciences research by answering traditional questions as well as forming new ones.
                  Associate professors can play an important role in this regard as they move into
                  positions of decision making and leadership within their institutions and
                  disciplines as a whole. In addition, as associate professors, they have the
                  security of position which allows them to take these types of risks to use and
                  promote digital methods, tools and resources <ptr target="#hackett2005"/>.
                  Further, Digital Humanists can support these efforts by making the <q>digital</q>
                  more visible within their discipline-specific conference presentations and
                  articles. At the same time, the DH associations need to continue their membership
                  recruitment efforts among graduate students, faculty and alternative academics. As
                  is often said, strength comes with numbers and larger membership bases will give
                  these associations more credibility when engaging with administration, granting
                  councils and other key stakeholders. Finally, efforts to both write and ensure
                  awareness of policies regarding digital methods, technologies and resources for
                  the purposes of employment, tenure and promotion must continue. With these in
                  place, graduate students, untenured faculty, and alternative academics will be
                  more likely to invest their efforts in the creation and application of DH. </p>
               <p>As the results from this survey suggest, the acceptance and use of digital
                  methods, tools and resources within research and teaching are increasing within
                  the Canadian context and beyond. The above recommendations are intended to support
                  the ongoing efforts to move DH from <q>emergent</q> to the mainstream.</p>
