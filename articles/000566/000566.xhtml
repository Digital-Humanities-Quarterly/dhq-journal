                     New Modernist Studies over a decade ago, the “digital turn” did not make the cut.
                     [<a class="ref" href="#mao2008">Mao and Walkowitz 2008</a>, 737–748] In fact, only very recently have
                     accounts of modernism turned to the conceptual purview of the digital, often to 
                     reframe understandings of modernism and digital technology
                     or to contextualize new digital technologies applied to modernism. Jessica

                     necessitate special note in this regard, as each study in
                     its own way accounts for how a digital modernism, or a digital approach to
                     modernism, is “aligned with strategies of the avant-garde: it challenges
                     traditional expectations about what art is and does [and] illuminates and
                     interrogates the cultural infrastructures, technological networks, and critical

                     Stephen Ross and Jentery Sayers trace as much in
                     “Modernism Meets Digital Humanities,” and Gabriel Hankins argues similarly that
                     through the “weak program” of digital methods applied to modernism, critics can
                     activate a variety of subtler points of contact that better model how diffuse
                     modernisms share aesthetic territory. [<a class="ref" href="#ross2014">Ross and Sayers 2014</a>] [<a class="ref" href="#hankins2018a">Hankins 2018 a</a>, 582]
                     Elsewhere, Hankins goes so far as to
                     say that the “new modernist studies is now always already digital,” and though
                     Ama Bemma Adwetewa-Badu reminds us that “digital tools cannot do the critical
                     and analytical work that we do,” she adds that
                     “neither can we do the work that they do,” work necessitated by a messy and
                     data-filled literary world.[<a class="ref" href="#hankins2018b">Hankins 2018 b</a>] [<a class="ref" href="#adwetewabadu2020">Adwetewa 2020</a>] Look no
                     further for corroboration than Laura McGrath et al.’s “Measuring of Modernist
                     Novelty,” an essay that operationalizes modernist “newness” to measure
                     evolutions of novelty in 20th-century fiction.[<a class="ref" href="#mcgrath2018">MacGrath et al. 2018</a>] Other digital forays in
                     the past half-decade, as detailed expansively by J. Matthew Huculak, represent
                     substantial collections, recoveries, expansions, and innovations of

                     of modernist criticism seems fully upon us, furnishing the New Modernist Studies
                     with accounts that illustrate how the critical debates of modernism are
                     newly accessible, and newly accessible to critique, through digital approaches.</div>

                     texts (e.g. text analysis, stylometry, computational stylistics, network

                     modernism’s new digital surge. There are scattered exceptions,<a class="noteRef" href="#d4e268">[1]</a>
                     and by far the most active scholars at
                     the intersection of text analysis and modernist studies have been Hoyt Long and
                     Richard Jean So, whose work on modernism at the Chicago Text Lab has spanned a
                     wide range of modernist topics: they’ve analyzed the poetic publication networks
                     of high modernism, provided a multifaceted analysis of the English-language
                     haiku, and studied the movement of stream of consciousness as literary
                     technique.[<a class="ref" href="#long2013">Long and So 2013</a>] [<a class="ref" href="#long2016a">Long and So 2016 a</a>][<a class="ref" href="#long2016b">Long and So 2016 b</a>] Yet their work
                     makes up the bulk of digital literary criticism that measures, models, and

                     work still converge in the early 20th century. <a class="noteRef" href="#d4e289">[2]</a> Computational literary
                     criticism requires an accessible textual archive, and since the preferred
                     periodization of modernism has gone largely unchanged, large portions of modernist
                     corpora have long been under copyright until only very recently — and most works,
                     at
                     least widely, may remain so for the better part of the next decades.

                     Unsurprisingly, easy access to reliable digital materials is a strong determiner of
                     the topic matter of computational literary study, which often seeks to analyze
                     bodies of work macroanalytically or, in the now notorious Morettian variation, “from
                     a distance.” These limits have held particular sway in the realm of stylometry, a
                     broad approach to studying textual style that aims, usually, to analyze a large
                     corpus of literature by counting certain words (or other linguistic elements like
                     grammatical structures, punctuation, etc.), averaging the measurements out into a
                     unique “signature,” and then comparing that stylistic composite to other texts,
                     authors, periods, and so on. Applied to literature, these countings have helped
                     scholars make claims about style as a measurable form as it exposes certain
                     conditions, contexts, and forms of representation, both inside and outside of
                     narratives; through style, that is, critics have argued that they can digitally
                     identify, measure, and compare the flows and workings of social and cultural
                     mechanisms — like productions and representations of gender, race, class, or
                     nationality — as they slip into linguistic tendency.</div>

                  <div class="ptext" id="p5"> If one puts aside the material limitations of modernist computational study, one
                     finds that deeper conceptual concerns have also restricted that study, especially
                     with regard to modernist stylometry and its relationship to gender (and other
                     identity categories). Modernist social life was as much governed by the
                     sociopolitical affordances of feminism’s first wave as anything else, and its
                     consequences rippled powerfully through much of modernist literature. Coupled with
                     the dicta of avant-garde modernist aesthetics — which, for the sake of space, we might
                     vulgarly boil down to newness and experimentation — this access to new material

                     first wave for many writers. Gertrude Stein, Virginia Woolf,
                     H.D., Djuna Barnes, Mina Loy, and Jean Rhys, among a multitude of others, unwound
                     the concertinaed styles of their literary predecessors to produce, if we might
                     borrow from Cary Nelson, a literature “generically undecidable, sometimes feminist
                     and lesbian, wholly unassignable to a humanizing persona, and more purely and
                     powerfully devoted to an exploration of how language works.” [<a class="ref" href="#nelson1989">Nelson 1986</a>, 179]</div>

                  <div class="ptext" id="p6"> Our aim in this essay is to consider the conceptual impediments to studying that
                     undecidability of gender stylometrically, as an influencer (or correlative feature)
                     of modernist style.<a class="noteRef" href="#d4e322">[4]</a> We
                     first locate where some of those difficulties are borne out in computational
                     literary criticism broadly and, in particular, call attention to the way stylistic
                     markers that have been taken as proxies for forms of gendered experience can prove
                     unreliable in modernist contexts. Virginia Woolf’s famous meditation in 
                     <cite class="title italic">A Room of One’s Own</cite> on androgyny and its creative potential
                     might be invoked here: stylometric scholarship has not yet contended with how
                     extensively the experiments of modernist style, full of gender explorations and
                     polysemous difficulty, complicate the tidiness and differentiability sometimes
                     required of text analysis. Such a claim is certainly not new in the realm of
                     computational literary criticism generally, and as the next section details, many
                     digital practitioners have already studied just how deeply our notions of gender
                     undermine computational designs. It is simply to this mounting critical stack that
                     we add a new stylometric case featuring a small corpus of modernist fiction, in an
                     effort to show both the limits and potentials of its stylometric study.<a class="noteRef" href="#d4e335">[5]</a></div>

                  <div class="ptext" id="p7"> Using Woolf’s novel <cite class="title italic">Orlando</cite> specifically, we argue that the
                     story of gender and modernism as seen through stylometry reveals a shared limit of
                     its models — of identity and computation — to provide trustworthy exemplars. We briefly
                     consider, too, some ways that the stylistic uniqueness of Woolf’s novel might help
                     us understand modernism more completely. After all, if the full cultural stakes of
                     modernism remain unearthed (as Seshagiri and James have proposed), if the legacies
                     of modernism continue to haunt our aesthetic forms, and if gender is one site of
                     particularly fruitful aesthetic experimentation, then stylometry may help further
                     uncover the stylistic innovations and cultural remnants that constitute the topos
                     of

                     shed their copyright shackles, the proto-framing for a modernist stylometry is
                     perhaps already overdue.</div>

                     encountering and thinking through modernist texts, as singular materials to linger
                     with but also to scrutinize through their forms of digital manufacture. We hope to
                     show that stylometric analysis of someone like Woolf in particular, and perhaps many
                     modernist writers in general, links critics to new ways of seeing the designs of
                     gender, the stylistic transitions of which require stylometrists to contend
                     carefully with the complexity and multiplicity of modernist literature and its

                     Such a view has the benefit of
                     reiterating two important points: first that modernism’s collection of digital
                     movements (vis-à-vis Pressman) occasioned an understanding of linguistic styles as
                     flexible, experimental technologies that could hide and reveal, invoke and
                     manufacture identity categories at the proverbial touch of a pen or click of a
                     typewriter; and second that our computational methods themselves complicate
                     modernism’s representational politics by rewriting literary data into new and
                     ongoing digital dialectics.</div>

                     style and gender (using tools and methods at least adjacent to stylometry). After,
                     we consider how treating Woolf’s <cite class="title italic">Orlando</cite> as a case study of
                     gender and modernist style helps us reassess the way we see exemplary cases, and how

                     to imagine we might reliably
                     evaluate gender computationally seems at least somewhat confused. Gayle Rubin’s
                     sex-gender system, that “set of arrangements by which society transforms biological
                     sexuality into products of human activity,” [<a class="ref" href="#rubin1975">Rubin 1975</a>]
                     has long-since clarified that gendered
                     identities are sets of internalized, performative scripts reified through various
                     legal, political, scientific, and cultural processes. This is an essential
                     clarification for stylometric analysis, which purports to measure these discursive
                     influences as they bleed through language. If it is only through socializing
                     discourses that a body becomes vested with the idea of an essential sex/gender,
                     stylometry only detects the un-isolated impressions of that social and cultural
                     influence as they mix with a mess of other discursive powers; for Bode, this manner
                     of viewing texts often ends in “dismiss[ing] the documentary record’s

                     undertaken the intricate work of studying gender and style throughout literary
                     history and at various scales. A first and landmark example is John Burrows’s 1986
                     study of Jane Austen’s novels, which simply used Austen’s varied frequency of
                     function words (pronouns, prepositions, articles, conjunctions, and other
                     non-content words) to identify character dialogue patterns, narrative subtleties,
                     thematic transformations, tonal ebbs and flows in characterization, directions and
                     forces of speech, and so on, many of which fall along typical 19th-century gender
                     
                     lines.<a class="noteRef" href="#d4e389">[7]</a> Many have since built from Burrows’s pioneering study, and
                     among the more recent attempts to unravel gender’s impact on literary style, Matthew
                     Jockers’s work on 19th-century fiction in <cite class="title italic">Macroanalysis</cite> is likely the most well-known. 
                     Chief among Jockers’s
                     conclusions is that gender is the <em class="emph">least</em> influential
                     determiner on literary style in the 19th century when compared
                     to other categories of stylistic difference — e.g. author, genre, (decade-long)
                     period, textual variations (punctuation, pronoun usage, etc.). [<a class="ref" href="#jockers2013">Jockers 2013</a>, 98–8]
                     In a narrower study
                     of 19th-century fiction, one framed more closely by the period’s sociohistorical
                     contexts, Jockers and Gabi Kirilloff looked at the depiction and action (via pronoun
                     and verb combinations like <em class="emph">she walked</em> or <em class="emph">he
                        dressed</em>) of male and female characters. They observed that men and women
                     were narrated with different vocabularies according to 19th-century norms, and that
                     
                     19th-century novelists had
                     difficulty masking their own gender when they wrote characters of the opposite.
                     <a class="noteRef" href="#d4e406">[8]</a> In fact, Kirilloff and
                     Jockers published an addendum to that study recently, pairing close reading of
                     several of its outliers with those verb-usage lists, concluding that “[t]hough the
                     characters in these novels behave in ‘‘unconventional’’ ways, all three struggle to
                     mitigate traditional and emerging social values,” a dialectic they found“reflected
                     not only at the level of plot but at the level of the sentence, and in fact, at the
                     level of individual words.” [<a class="ref" href="#kirilloff2018">Kirilloff et al. 2018</a>, 842] </div>

                  <div class="ptext" id="p12"> Although the above examples concern gender as it emerges in literature to reflect
                     certain cultural norms and social circumstances, critics have also studied gender
                     computationally in relation to its contemporary production via the politics of
                     reception and the literary marketplace, productively tying the stylistic into its
                     socioeconomic imprints. Ted Underwood, David Bamman, and Sabrina Lee find that
                     gender divisions between characters in fiction are becoming less distinguishable
                     (i.e. men and women characters are being described and speaking/acting more
                     similarly), but that the proportion of fiction written by women, and the proportion
                     of women characters, dropped dramatically from 1800-1960. Hence “while gender roles
                     were becoming more flexible,” Underwood et al. argue that the story of women writing
                     literature is “a story of steady decline,” and that between 1850 and 1960, “fiction
                     itself became more attentive to men,” such that women as characters were becoming
                     less prominent, even in books by women. Jonathan Y. Cheng, meanwhile, takes physical
                     descriptions as an entryway to studying gender and gendered embodiment over the last
                     150 years of English-language fiction; he uncovers that physical descriptions of
                     characters has increased over time, but that for women’s characterization,
                     specifically, bodily descriptions remain curiously central, even as literary
                     depictions of men and women become less binary. [<a class="ref" href="#cheng2020">Cheng 2020</a>, 28–29]
                     In a strictly contemporary account, after canvassing thousands of
                     reviews from the <em class="emph">New York Times Book Review</em>, Andrew Piper and
                     Richard Jean So discovered that reviewers still talk about women’s books and men’s
                     books in stereotypically antithetical terms, “reproduc[ing] the public/private split
                     bequeathed to us from the nineteenth century.” For Piper and So, their findings
                     indicate that the damaging discourses around gender are still being subtly
                     reproduced in the public apparatuses that surround literature.<a class="noteRef" href="#d4e445">[9]</a> Their results were
                     expanded later by Eve Kraicer and Piper, who found similarly — and through a diverse
                     and thorough assortment of computational models — that the representations of women
                     in
                     much of contemporary fiction mirrors their marginalized and decentralized positions
                     in the literary marketplace. [<a class="ref" href="#kraicer2019">Kraicer and Piper 2019</a>] Matthew J. Lavin achieves something similar in his more located

                     book reviews between 1905 and 1925; and, contrary to Underwood et al., Lavin
                     finds that women were in fact writing <em class="emph">more</em> fiction than men
                     and yet that diverse work was still being discussed and reviewed within a reductive,
                     domestic, private/public vocabulary. [<a class="ref" href="#lavin2020">Lavin 2020</a>]</div>

                     story, which is most often by examining the stylistic indications of a period’s
                     culturally and socially produced gender binary, and then determining how those
                     categorizations reveal new aspects of gendered subjectivity. In fact, this is
                     probably a fair way to summarize the basic project of most computational studies of
                     literary style and gender, the majority of which unearth, organize, and interpret
                     linguistic traces through gender’s various social and cultural histories and subtle

                           personages, and the signs of gender they used in producing characters. In both
                           cases, we understand gender as a conventional role that people were expected to
                           assume in order to become legible in a social context. Authors and characters have
                           been coded according to a tripartite scheme (feminine / masculine / other or
                           unknown), because that scheme organized most public representation of gender in the
                           period we are studying. Gender can certainly be more complex than these categories
                           suggest, and flexible ontologies can be designed to illuminate the complexity. But
                           this essay is inquiring about the history of conventional roles, not about the truth
                           of personal identity, or the underlying processes that produce gendered behavior.

                     hierarchized within novels.”[<a class="ref" href="#kraicer2019">Kraicer and Piper 2019</a>, 26]
                     A first lesson in quantitative formalism is that discourse
                     predetermines data — depending on the tools we implement and the discourses we
                     possess, data can always be made to appear a certain way. As they track some of
                     those ways in their <em class="emph">Cultural Analytics</em> “Identity Issue”
                     introduction, Susan Brown and Laura Mandell develop an exhaustive history of
                     conceptualizing gender, outlining the importance of such historicizing for digital
                     projects, which must balance quantitative methodologies with that same reflexive
                     process that asks how our methodological designs direct our analyses. “Historicizing
                     helps to destabilize identities,” Brown and Mandell maintain, “and cultural
                     analytics can make visible a kind of history that we have never seen before.”

                     stabilize more than <em class="emph">de</em>stabilize. Underwood et al. say, for
                     instance (to keep with our arbitrary, cherry-picked example), that their essay does
                     not delve into “the underlying processes that produce gendered behavior.” But the
                     assumption that such processes can be ignored when studying literary history seems
                     suspect — because language, we know, is one such process, one that governs many
                     others; and as Drucker reminds us, if you want to model gender you must produce (or
                     reproduce) the underlying structures of gender. At some point, the current confines
                     of stylometric analysis require that data be sorted into comparable categories,
                     which means whether one gender, two gender, three gender, four, categories or
                     columns of gender identification remain much easier to compare than gender spectra.
                     Does adding a third, non-binary category — or a fourth, or a fifth — unlock or
                     ameliorate the hindered politics of representation at the heart of designing
                     computational analyses around those historical notions of gender? As Pamela Caughie
                     et al. emphasize in their work on feminist ontologies, the answer is of course
                     not.[<a class="ref" href="#caughie2018">Caughie et al. 2018</a>] And yet, to label some identity as historically extant when

                     and company note, to imagine there was social space for more gender fluidity than
                     there actually was does us little good when analyzing textual traces we aim to tie

                     found a rather comfortable home. Underwood is right, as he aptly remarks elsewhere,
                     that “nothing about this [binary] method compels us to stop at two perspectives”;
                     but is the best we can really expect of such critique its regular revelation that
                     “ “the very act of modelling carries with it the seeds
                     of a constructionist recognition that a phenomenon could [or will soon] be

                     limited critical positions and several vital, unaddressed questions. Does the

                     anachronistically apply new understandings of gender to contexts that cannot hold
                     them, or (b) hand-wash our responsibility to witness different kinds of gendered
                     being, whenever they occurred? In the context of stylometry specifically, how can
                     we
                     responsibly do (a) while avoiding (b)? As Klein has asked elsewhere, how can we
                     avoid reproducing normative investigations of identity categories like gender
                     through models of distant reading, given that those models function in systemic and
                     epistemological hierarchies of power that were not designed with plurality in

                     modernism began with an inevitably insufficient selection (and rejection) of texts
                     to analyze, and the narrow variety we collected here is representative of three,
                     semi-arbitrary governing features: first, each author needed to have written at
                     least three works of fiction (or collections of short stories);

                     analyses, the category of gender has been biologized, binarized, and essentialized
                     in a trend that I call ‘‘stereotyping’’”; and if literary data has “been collected,
                     sorted, and even produced according to the categories M/F,” then it will find
                     statistically significant differences whether or not those differences are
                     significant. [<a class="ref" href="#mandell2019">Mandell 2019</a>] An algorithm trained on constructed
                     differences of data (i.e. assigned authorial gender) does not sort through the world
                     it purports to represent, after all, but generates a new world through the measures
                     of difference with which we provide it. Bearing that considerable problem in mind,
                     and building on the foundations set by the many computational studies of 19th-century
                     literature, our interest is not in asking if or where
                     gender is marked in fiction, but whether and how it “gives-to-see” the literary
                     styles and structures of modernist fiction. Because we rely on gender as a
                     historical category, we can learn about its in/stability and trans/formation from
                     the ways it is invoked, signaled, modified, or tailored textually, around specific
                     cultural contexts and social meanings and in relation to other texts. As
                     traditional, binary conceptions of gender began to be understood as culturally,
                     socially, politically, and legally affixed to bodies, modernist authors might also
                     have affixed them to — or unfixed them from — their texts at a macro level, and we
                     want

                     table of word frequencies, from which stylistic similarity (based on statistical
                     distance) can be measured. Traditionally, the most influential words in these tables
                     are those function words, English’s grammatical glue (articles, prepositions,
                     pronouns, etc.), because it turns out that each author — and, though to a lesser
                     degree, each period, genre, and gender — uses each of those words at a remarkably
                     consistent rate in their own work, and at a unique rate when compared to others.
                     <a class="noteRef" href="#d4e696">[19]</a> Stylometrists can then measure the

                     groups (e.g. based on gender) to detect broad trends. This research has tended to
                     take the form of sorting and examining diverse most-frequent-word (MFW) lists made
                     up of other types of content words (nouns, verbs, adjectives, etc.) to locate
                     stylistic quirks or generate topics for close-reading. For instance, one group of
                     authors might prefer one term, set of terms, or set of topics over another — or, they
                     might not — and by contextualizing and interpreting the divergences or convergences,
                     critics can theorize what circumstances (generic, historical, social) might
                     contribute to similarity or difference. However, in this study, we want to be
                     particularly sensitive to the interpretive dangers in close-reading individualized
                     wordlists (either for authors or their texts) because of how our digital design
                     treats gender as a two-body problem. Fearing, that is, the equal likelihood of
                     finding gender-specific stylistic trends and replicating essentializing discourses
                     in our interpretations, we decided to take a less orthodox path by staying macro and
                     running a series of broader, supervised machine-learning analyses on our modernist

                     will assign any text to its correct group 50% of the time — with two possible groups
                     in our analysis, the algorithm has the equivalent of a digital coin toss — which means
                     that anything consistently or considerably more accurate suggests there may be
                     measurable stylistic differences between the two groups. Among hundreds of
                     classifying runs, misattributions occurred on average about 10% of the time; the
                     classifier accurately determined the assigned gender of a text’s author in around
                     90% of cases, which supports the notion that even given the experiments of
                     modernism, the period’s gender binary seems to remain a strong determiner of
                     style.<a class="noteRef" href="#d4e725">[22]</a> We utilized a series of different test conditions to

                  <div class="ptext" id="p30"> Common stylometric practice says to zoom in here and discern why 
                     <cite class="title italic">Orlando</cite> is an outlier — and options abound for doing so: we might, for
                     example, compare individual wordlists of each gender grouping, or of the text
                     itself, or of the words preferred or avoided by one gender grouping/text over
                     another. Again, however, our interest is in staying macro. Unsurprisingly, having
                     already separated male and female novels, the wordlists only provide the same
                     stylistic snapshot that has been traced extensively elsewhere (as our previous
                     section details). We know that even as standard uses sometimes lead to surprising
                     ends, male and female authors normally reproduce socially, culturally, historically
                     consistent accounts of gender in their writing, often through predictable and
                     stereotypically gendered characterizations, vocabularies, narrative actions,
                     identifiers, and locales.<a class="noteRef" href="#d4e759">[25]</a> Locating the gender
                     difference we structured our studies around is not so interesting to us. What we
                     want to ascertain, separately, is whether we can deploy stylometric methods without
                     double-reading gendered cultural meaning into a list of semantic differences like
                     verb constructions or function words. What if we apply stylometry to zoom out a tad,
                     to the level of each text rather than each word? What does gender play look like
                     within our small modernist corpus if we treat it as, for instance, an element of
                     narrative structuring?</div>

                  <div class="ptext" id="p31"> Instead of studying how male and female authors diverged in word choice or
                     grammatical preference, then, we decided to look at the overarching structure of
                     that difference in our consistent outlier, <cite class="title italic">Orlando</cite>. To do so,
                     we ran a more specific classification Eder calls a “Rolling NSC.”

                     This method also requires that we train the machine on our two gender groups, but
                     rather than supply it with a random selection of texts to assign, we ask it to
                     analyze slices of one particular text — in this case, 
                     <cite class="title italic">Orlando</cite> — and then assign each slice to its stylistically closest group/gender.
                     To make matters more interesting, we isolated our test author, so that none of
                     Woolf’s other works appeared in the training sample or contributed to the averaged
                     style of the female set; if she had a particularly strong author signal (and she
                     does), this process would prevent her unique style from overpowering the average
                     gendered style that results from the amalgam of her contemporaries’ works.

                     assigned to their author’s corresponding gender (Figures 1-2).<a class="noteRef" href="#d4e802">[28]</a> In other

                     to be the stylistic norm in literature, modernism or no.</div>

                  <div class="ptext" id="p37"> As she narrates a sex change in her story, Woolf actively styles a gender signature
                     to match that of her character, a creative feat no other author — of 
                     <em class="emph">any</em> period — has managed as far as we know. It’s difficult to explain just
                     how unusual this is, in part because our subsection of modernist fiction doesn’t
                     speak for all of modernism (let alone all of fiction), but in larger part because
                     we’ve just never seen anything like this before. If our analysis isolated a
                     descriptive, content-based lexicon (nouns, verbs, adverbs, adjectives), something
                     like this result would be expected, at least to a degree. Several of the studies we
                     outlined in the last section confirm that regardless of an author’s gender, talented
                     writers are capable of imitating aspects of another gender in their writing
                     (preferred behaviors, contexts, spaces, styles of speaking, etc.), a fact truer
                     still for a writer as accomplished as Woolf. In our analyses, however, which again
                     ranged from 50 to 500 MFW, the words we used to measure literary style are largely
                     just those functional, non-descriptive terms void of any narrative context. This
                     mean that Woolf didn’t simply change the <em class="emph">what</em>, the content
                     her male-turned-female protagonist was thinking, saying, or doing — she fundamentally
                     changed the <em class="emph">how</em>, the grammar and
                     syntax that holds that content together.<a class="noteRef" href="#d4e903">[29]</a> Perhaps how
                     this came to pass, as <cite class="title italic">Orlando</cite>’s narrator relates, matters
                     little: “It is enough for us to state the simple fact; Orlando was a man till the
                     age of thirty; when he became a woman and has remained so ever since.” [<a class="ref" href="#woolf1928">Woolf 1928</a>, 139]</div>

                     impressiveness of this stylistic manipulation would seem inevitable given the
                     theoretical projects the novel is said to carry out. “Long before university Gender
                     Studies departments came into existence,” writes Anne Delaplace, “Woolf had already
                     reflected on the dissonance between social and sexual identity” in 
                     <cite class="title italic">Orlando</cite>, which retains echoes of the “intermix[ing]” of genders from the
                     exploration of androgyny in <cite class="title italic">A Room of One’s Own</cite>. [<a class="ref" href="#delaplace2011">Delaplace 2011</a>, 39]
                     Indeed, “in
                     every human being,” says <cite class="title italic">Orlando</cite>’s narrator, “a vacillation
                     from one sex to the other takes place, and often it is only the clothes that keep
                     the male or female likeness, while underneath the sex is the very opposite of what
                     it is above.”[<a class="ref" href="#woolf1928">Woolf 1928</a>, 139] For Pamela Caughie,
                     the novel provides nothing less than the archetypal “model of modernist life writing
                     in the era of transsexualism,” a unique, modernist “transgenre” that “radically
                     refigures the narrative of transsexualism.[<a class="ref" href="#caughie2013">Caughie 2013</a>, 504–2]<a class="noteRef" href="#d4e966">[30]</a> 
                     These literary critics identify
                     clearly the power of Woolf’s novel as it derives from close readings of context and
                     narrative, producing feminist modes of representation for non-normative sexuality
                     and genders through its play of literary genre — in Caughie’s case, the biography,
                     mock or not. Elsa Högberg and Amy Bromley even consider <cite class="title italic">Orlando</cite>
                     the novel that inaugurated Woolf’s theory of sentence morphology, the way Woolf
                     playfully reshapes formal and generic sentence structures to mark a “modernist
                     rewriting of biography and gender, and the orthodox ways in which they tend to shape
                     life and the body.[<a class="ref" href="#h%C3%B6gberg2018">Högberg and Bromley 2018</a>, 2]</div>

                  <div class="ptext" id="p39"> Keeping with these accounts, we simply want to make one vital addendum: that the
                     novel’s power — as proto-gender study or as transgenre — emerges from Woolf’s style.
                     Again, while not every novel in our analysis was always assigned so tidily to one
                     gender or another, no text separated as consistently or in such a structured manner
                     as <cite class="title italic">Orlando</cite> — on cue, as it were, with the gender transition in
                     its narrative. That level of stylistic control raises new questions about the scales
                     of gender performativity, or rather focuses them down to the level of the line, the
                     choice of one (seemingly insignificant) function word over the other, which
                     complicates readings of <cite class="title italic">Orlando</cite> as a tale of cross-dressing,
                     in which clothes make the (wo)man without regard for the discursive power wielded
                     in
                     the creation of “men” and “women.” Woolf, it seems, did not merely change the
                     descriptions and clothes of her protagonist and so change the gender; she altered
                     the very stylistic nuances that characterized Orlando when she was a woman from when
                     he was a man. Hers isn’t just a narrative exploration of transition either, in the
                     vein of Dr. Matthew O’Connor in Djuna Barnes’s <cite class="title italic">Nightwood</cite> or
                     Leopold Bloom in James Joyce’s <cite class="title italic">Ulysses</cite>.
                     <a class="noteRef" href="#d4e1005">[31]</a> That
                     her writing diverges so thoroughly from the stylistic doxa of her contemporaries
                     suggests to us that, as Woolf celebrates the new possibilities of being gendered and
                     representing genderedness, she delivers a linguistic paradigm of that futurity. In
                     <cite class="title italic">Orlando</cite>, that is, Woolf not only cultivates a sustained,
                     pluralist theory of gender transition, but she also practices the linguistic
                     applications of its modern futures, a multifaceted engagement that perhaps no other

                  <div class="ptext" id="p40"> In this our study deviates from the findings of several aforementioned accounts of
                     gender and literary style (e.g. Kirilloff and Jockers’ work on gender in 19th-century
                     fiction), which tend to suggest gender-disciplinary
                     social norms had a significant and, by extension, inextricable effect on
                     literature’s stylistic structures. Most stylometric studies that isolate gender
                     within a corpus of literature treat it similarly, as a governing stylistic force
                     that manifests in formal semantic preferences or syntactic characteristics. Staying
                     out of the wordlists, though, changes our perspective.<a class="noteRef" href="#d4e1019">[32]</a> Perhaps the history of gender and literary style is more than a
                     sum of linguistic tendencies and more than gender’s socially, culturally,
                     politically enforced written marking. In her innovative styling of gender
                     transition, Woolf shows (among this subsection of Anglo-modernist fiction, at least)
                     that this history is also an account of gender’s <em class="emph">unmarking</em>
                     and <em class="emph">undisciplining</em>. Perhaps all that Woolf intuited is that
                     gender needn’t have been as influential on literary style as we think it must have
                     been; or, perhaps Woolf saw that our ideas about gender do not so much influence
                     literary style as literary style influences our ideas about gender. If 
                     <cite class="title italic">Orlando</cite> declares gender as merely the newest formal territory
                     on which writers could experiment with identity, then it uncovers for us Woolf’s
                     broader way of modern seeing, which could understand gender not as an imminent,
                     immutable, uniform stylistic determiner, but as a flexible literary landscape — or,
                     what comes to the same thing, as a style.</div>

                     to repeat a key clarification: “We are not trying to solve Woolf.”[<a class="ref" href="#ramsay2011">Ramsay 2011</a>, 66]
                     We instead want to use <cite class="title italic">Orlando</cite>
                     to ask whether the current registers of stylometry and computational stylistics
                     stymie some of the radical potentials of modernist style. Because we constructed
                     this stylometric study around a constricting binary gender logic, it can only tell
                     us so much about that binary or what constitutes its differences, especially with
                     tools applied as narrowly as we apply them here (e.g. on a relatively small
                     modernist corpus, and then on a single modernist text relative to that corpus).
                     Stylometric methods, like other forms of quantitative formalism, can’t exactly be
                     employed in pursuit of such a task, particularly when our assumptions need to be
                     levied in service of cultural and social conclusions to make them critically
                     relevant — for example, if a linguistic difference can be tracked along gender lines,
                     that difference must divulge something about gender’s representational or lived
                     history. We are not convinced this is always true — sometimes the only thing stylistic
                     difference informs is our understanding of failed historical representation, or a
                     history of <em class="emph">unlived</em> difference, or gender’s otherwise hidden
                     potentials. Despite writing from within a descriptive system that inhibits gender
                     identity’s expression and possible futures — and despite being studied from within
                     the
                     same — Woolf still teaches us about the ways gender/ing could be deployed, inverted,
                     and resisted, a didactic function that materializes even through, even as, a broken
                     and insufficient gender binary.</div>

                     even applied narrowly can teach us a great deal about, say, the depth of modernism’s
                     <em class="emph">avant-garde</em> or about the limitations of studying style as
                     a consistent and formal indicator of real-world messiness. After all, it’s through
                     our study’s significant structural limitations that we see the extent to which
                     modernists could make their styles fit (or an ill fit for) its categories — see, that
                     is, how Woolf fashioned gender in, out, and around the binary trying to contain it.
                     So, what other new alignments does a modernist experiment like Woolf’s make
                     available within the genealogy of gender and digital analysis? Two observations seem
                     essential: the first, a minor point about exemplarity, will lead us to the second,
                     a
                     broader claim about the limits of studying modern sociocultural forms through
                     stylometric analysis of, in this case, a small portion of Anglo-modernist fiction.

                  <div class="ptext" id="p43">Christy Burns asserts that “in <cite class="title italic">Orlando</cite> Woolf has already […]
                     anticipated our attempts to clothe her writings in our own desires,” explaining that
                     only “the curious residue of language […] both invites and resists our insistent

                     In this unique anticipatory capacity Woolf’s novel comes
                     to represent an exceptional case in our corpus of modernist fiction, both through
                     its multi-century generic scope and through its stylistic flexibility. Its
                     uniqueness thus poses an interpretive problem: How can we draw general conclusions
                     about Anglophone modernism, or about gender and modernist literature, from a text
                     so
                     different from the rest, a novel that singularly rejects what we thought we knew
                     about the relationship between gender and literary style?<a class="noteRef" href="#d4e1066">[33]</a></div>

                  <div class="ptext" id="p44"> According to Ben Etherington and Sean Pryor, by focusing on such exceptional cases
                     scholars “can actively resist the falsifications and exclusions performed by the
                     abstract generalisations of history, theory, and society at large.”[<a class="ref" href="#etherington2019">Etherington and Pryor 2019</a>]
                     Stylometry notwithstanding, computational methods
                     of analyzing literature attempt to discern a set of generalities that can cater to
                     the macroanalytic at the cost of particulars, outliers or exceptions that sometimes
                     require discarding. But if Woolf’s unprecedented literary experimentalism is what
                     makes her an exemplary modernist — which is the case made by Burns and many other
                     modernist critics — perhaps <cite class="title italic">Orlando</cite>’s 
                     <em class="emph">exceptionalism</em> is what makes it an ideal text from which to generalize. If,
                     in numerous cases of Anglophone modernism, the experimentally exceptional 
                     <em class="emph">is</em> the general,<a class="noteRef" href="#d4e1083">[34]</a> then the discovery of new forms of
                     difference in that literature, like <cite class="title italic">Orlando</cite>’s stylistic play,
                     requires that the very category of “general” be productively expanded to include
                     even its most remarkable outliers. And when the general example produces an updated
                     interpretive scale or model, then it also produces a politics of historical
                     interpretation consistent with that model, a politics that Burns would insist Woolf
                     not only refuses but remakes.<a class="noteRef" href="#d4e1096">[35]</a> Another way to say this is that, as Woolf invents
                     a new means by which gender could be individually styled and proven as style, she
                     shows that our general, normative understanding of the conditions and capabilities
                     of fiction for representing gendered life is incomplete and in need of expansion.
                     Literary critics have known about this capacity of Woolf for a long time, of course,
                     but this stylometric view of <cite class="title italic">Orlando</cite> demonstrates just how
                     acutely she played with gender as itself a type of literary style. There is no
                     solving Woolf, as Ramsay says, because Woolf fundamentally changes the stylistic
                     equation, widening modernism’s scope of the representatively possible.</div>

                     by
                     studying the literature of the 19th century, Woolf <em class="emph">proves</em> again that modernist literature generated

                     not merely in, its styles. Modernists, we know, were among the first generations of
                     writers fundamentally influenced by the reality that unconscious forces construct
                     us,[<a class="ref" href="#ellman2010">Ellman 2010</a>][<a class="ref" href="#ffytch2012">Ffytch 2012</a>][<a class="ref" href="#north1999">North 1999</a>] and it’s
                     essential to remember that their words are thus not simply markers of hidden
                     sociocultural powers and discourses, but that they instead represent — for one of
                     the
                     first times in modern literary history — active, ongoing, deliberate engagements with
                     those discourses as they knew they were appearing in their literature. Hopefully
                     it’s clear how our point about exemplarity is a stepping-stone to this. When we
                     arrive in modernism, a period in which authors, figures, writers, and thinkers were
                     explicitly styling gender and its cultural markers, tracing a gender signal in
                     writing is no longer quite as defensible by the logic used in stylometric studies
                     of
                     19th-century literature. As Woolf herself says elsewhere,
                     theirs was “an age clearly when we are not fast anchored where we are; things are
                     moving round us; we are moving ourselves.”[<a class="ref" href="#woolf2009">Woolf 2009</a>, 74]</div>

                     other computational methods invested in written style) cannot be trusted to have
                     been latent at all in modernism. Woolf’s experiment reminds us that the fundamental
                     assumption of traditional stylometry is notoriously unreliable — namely, that authors
                     and specified groups have distinct, independent, hidden markers of style we can
                     compare and from which we can glean social and cultural insight (about, for
                     instance, the intentional or accidental written production of gender). Earlier we
                     argued that modernism hasn’t been studied digitally for two reasons, but this would
                     offer a much more compelling third: when it comes to the matter of gender, we can
                     neither do so dependably nor do so without presuming to already know, and thus
                     arrange a study around, where gender identity begins and ends for literary stylists.
                     Scholars leveraging stylometric methods to analyze modernist literature must contend
                     with modernism’s unique self-awareness in this regard — the ways stylistic
                     experimentation may limit the conclusions that can be drawn from modernist language
                     about the conditions of modern life.</div>

                     modernism in the same breath. We do not mean to suggest that stylometry is
                     fundamentally an ill-fitted tool for studying modernism and gender. We think the
                     case of <cite class="title italic">Orlando</cite>’s gender transition and its conflicted
                     stylistic story <em class="emph">exemplifies</em> just as many reasons to apply
                     stylometric methods to study modernist style and gender as to prefer other
                     approaches. Rather than declare stylometry insufficient, we simply want to point out
                     that modernism, perhaps more so than other aesthetic movements or literary periods,
                     necessitates a critical mutuality that requires from its scholars an upfront and
                     explicit negotiation between object and method, accident and intention, style and
                     styling. As interpretive constraints, these tensions address both why there isn’t
                     much serious stylometric work on modernism and why there perhaps should be. If we
                     want the future of modernist digital literary analysis to have any kind of
                     educational function — i.e. if we anticipate that the lessons of stylometry will spill
                     forth new insights about or models of the histories of gendered representation that
                     can inform our understandings today — then we must reassess how we structure the study
                     of gender and its stylistic waves as social and cultural trace. Maybe Woolf isn’t
                     the first or only author to make this reorientation necessary, but she certainly
                     illustrates the extent to which, when applied to and in modernism, our literary
                     data and our digital critical methods must become more than “mere containers” of
                     language’s curious residues. [<a class="ref" href="#posner2017">Posner et al. 2017</a>, 4]</div>

                     literary scholars (e.g. Rebecca Walkowitz), which tend to invoke the term
                     loosely and synonymously with “form,” insofar as each denotes a literary pattern
                     traceable through (for example) close reading. In the realm of stylometry, a
                     notion of literary style is technical and tied to word use, and the term stands
                     in for the aggregate of a set of formal, observable textual features. Our
                     underlying assumption is that word preference can be measured by first counting

                     Hence conventional caveats apply: our corpus may indeed produce a
                     narrative driven by ease-of-access or proximity over actual
                     representativeness; a larger, more diverse, more global (in short, a
                     “different”) corpus may provide different results; and the claims we
                     hope to make about gender and modernist style thus can’t reliably be
                     extrapolated to modernist literature’s other flavors without further
                     analysis. We admit this is a substantial, but so far largely
                     unavoidable, limitation of studying the literary canon of a period still
                     heavily under material and economic wraps. It’s reason, too, to be
                     skeptical of the scale of our study, which ends by looking at one text
                     and one author and is thus not nearly as macroanalytic as most

                     Though, there are indeed more nuanced measures of stylistic distance
                     that weight function and content words in different ways. Regardless,
                     this general technique is often called the “bag of words” approach, and
                     while it is popular in text analysis it also has its drawbacks. Its most
                     basic model treats every word in each text in the same way, regardless
                     of that word’s (a) syntactic or semantic contexts and (b) relation to
                     the narrative or literary forms — thus, every novel merely becomes a
                     countable bag of words. The approach makes measuring stylistic
                     difference simple and effective, but in doing so it erases the context
                     of all other literary elements in a work, which makes “reading” the
                     resulting wordlists a precarious task. Take the exchange in <cite class="title italic">Orlando</cite>
                     between the newly acquainted Shelmerdine and Orlando as a brief
                     example — and take first a jumbled approximation of what our machine sees,
                     in the spirit of “big-data” experimentalism: ‘a’ (2), ‘cried’ (2),
                     ‘[a]re’ (2), ‘you’ (2), ‘he’ (1), ‘man’ (1), ‘Orlando’ (1), ‘she’ (1),
                     ‘Shel’ (1), ‘woman’ (1). What’s happened in this sequence, now that
                     we’ve merely counted words and glossed over all context? Maybe a man and
                     a woman were crying together, but who really knows? The flattening
                     perils of decontextualized computational analysis are indeed laid bare.
                     Now, here’s the moment as it appears in the actual narrative: “‘You’re a
                     woman, Shel!’ she cried. ‘You’re a man, Orlando!’ he cried.” Even in a
                     short, two-sentence example, Woolf’s tremendous gender-/word-play and
                     its meaning for the speakers, who have fallen for one another (and soon
                     marry) in part because of their gender non-conforming androgyny, is
                     entirely lost if one merely rushed to count one’s computational

                     difference between supervised and unsupervised machine learning
                     techniques (though, there are other techniques that borrow from both
                     types). Supervised techniques tend to require the input of
                     pre-classified data to “learn from,” so that the algorithm can track and
                     then predict future patterns from similarly classified data (e.g. one
                     might train a road sign classification machine on thousands of different
                     stop sign images, and then feed it other random images and ask it to
                     output whether or not they feature stop signs). Unsupervised machine
                     learning, conversely, tends to model the distribution or configuration
                     of input data (e.g. providing a large, unsorted data set of road sign
                     images and some metric of sorting them might provide correlations,
                     groupings, or trends to help identify or separate those images). For

                     in the statistical computing program, R (see [<a class="ref" href="#eder2016b">Eder et al. 2016</a>]). Although we’ve
                     chosen a supervised analysis, its methodological limitations are
                     significant. The benefit of unsupervised learning (e.g. PCA) is that the
                     machine doesn’t know how many groups of data we think we’re studying, so
                     we can’t privilege a group split just because we think there is one; the
                     difficulty becomes identifying what features, exactly, constitute the
                     groupings output by the machine. Inversely, the downside of a supervised
                     analysis is that we organize the data in two pre-conceived groups and
                     ask that each text be assigned to one group or the other. The benefit is
                     that we at least think we have an idea of where machine-located
                     differences are coming from — i.e. in this case, we isolate our groups
                     based on gender. Both methods put us in an at least somewhat compromised

                     studies from Jockers and Underwood, for example, discern as much in their 19th-century
                     and contemporary corpuses, and alongside Jonathan
                     Cheng’s aforementioned piece, one of our prior essays confirms those findings in
                     modernist fiction (see again [<a class="ref" href="#weidman2018">Weidman and O'Sullivan 2018</a>]).</span></div>

                     stylometric classifier that finds an averaged stylistic profile, NSC
                     provides certain benefits over a standard variant like Burrows’s Delta
                     in Eder’s rolling method, which tries to pinpoint moments of stylistic
                     “takeover” in a single text after being trained on one more groups of
                     texts — see Eder, 459-63. With Delta, each text in each training group is
                     treated distinctly and is not consolidated into a stylistic profile
                     (i.e. <cite class="title italic">Orlando</cite>is measured against <em class="emph">each</em> training
                     sample/text, ranking the “styles” that are closest to the test text);
                     NSC, however, produces composites against which we can compare our test
                     text (i.e. <cite class="title">Orlando</cite> against the averaged style of all female texts or
                     all male texts). For our study, where we want to isolate the gender
                     binary as a two-class problem, NSC is a natural fit. </span></div>

                     function words were to the close analysis of literary style. Remarkable, then,
                     that Woolf seems to have divined and manipulated this reality half-a-century

                        Theory, and the Trans Feminine Allegory</cite> (Northwestern UP, 2017). In
                     fact, Heaney’s exploration of the history and production of trans femininity
                     provides an important clarification to our study’s finding, detaching Woolf from
                     a legacy of modernist trans feminism (see [<a class="ref" href="#heaney2017">Heaney 2017</a>, 302 footnote 11]).</span></div>

                     literary styles (via a bag-of-word list of most frequent terms) in this study,
                     and we do not call that essential stylometric practice into question. What we’re
                     after here, rather, is a reimagining of how eschewing the inexact close-readings
                     that tend to follow computational measures of style can actually help us
                     accomplish something critically important. Deciphering averaged stylistic
                     differences — or, what’s more probable, incidentally lodging our pre-held
                     assumptions into stylistic peculiarities — does not expand or contextualize our
                     conclusions as much as it forecloses their messiness in almost-assuredly biased
                     explainers. By restraining that stylometric impulse, we hope to let the text’s
                     relation to the corpus (rather than specific terminological
                     connections/disparities) do the critical work for us. We want to venture an
                     observation here, helped along by Adam Kilgarriff’s influential essay, “Language
                     is never, ever, ever, random,” which clarifies an adjacent point by
                     distinguishing between randomness and arbitrariness in interpretations of
                     linguistic phenomena in literary corpora. That linguistic structures appear
                     nonrandom or predictable in their relation does not make that relation
                     meaningful — just as syntax can colonize meaning, narrative structures can demand
                     certain forms, patterns, and distributions of linguistic content, which detaches
                     judgments about their meaning from their possible literary-historical or
                     sociocultural arbitrariness. Having used a specific corpus organization and
                     specific modeling tools, all of which were designed to treat gender as a bimodal
                     stylistic question, we think finding in <cite class="title italic">Orlando</cite> a
                     nonrandom and narratively nonarbitrary gender flip is more than a linguistic
                     oddity.</span></div>
