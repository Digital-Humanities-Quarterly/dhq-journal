               <p>Virginia Woolf writes in her novel Orlando that “it is clothes that wear us and not we them; we may make them take to mould of arm or breast, but they mould our hearts, our brains, our tongues to their liking.” Her observation remains vital to the author’s longstanding critique of essentializing discourses, but it also gives recourse to the ways our computational methods of studying literature and its history sometimes “mould […] to their liking” the objects of their study. When applied to style, digital humanists tend to use computational methods to trace embedded, hidden linguistic structures, showing how they can contain, conceal, and condition the gendered lives of social groups and cultural milieus. But we present a case study — Woolf’s Orlando — that suggests stylometric criticism, when dealing with gender in modern literature, may not be capable of addressing the modernism in the same generalizable way that it has other periods. We outline the limitations of our own and prior approaches to questions of gender and literary style, and we consider how even flawed stylometric analyses can acquaint us with new ways that modernism and its stylistic innovations may haunt the conclusions of digital literary criticism.</p>

            <p>When Doug Mao and Rebecca Walkowitz described the innovative critical turns of the
                New Modernist Studies over a decade ago, the “digital turn” did not make the cut.
                <ptr target="#mao2008" loc="737–748"/> In fact, only very recently have
                accounts of modernism turned to the conceptual purview of the digital, often to 
                reframe understandings of modernism and digital technology
                    or to contextualize new digital technologies applied to modernism. Jessica
                    Pressman’s <title rend="italic">Digital Modernism</title>
                    and Shawna Ross and James O’Sullivan’s edited collection
                    <title rend="italic">Reading Modernism with Machines </title>
                    necessitate special note in this regard, as each study in
                    its own way accounts for how a digital modernism, or a digital approach to
                    modernism, is <quote rend="inline">aligned with strategies of the avant-garde: it challenges
                    traditional expectations about what art is and does [and] illuminates and
                    interrogates the cultural infrastructures, technological networks, and critical
                    practices that support and enable these judgments.</quote><ptr target="#pressman2014" loc="10"/>

                    Stephen Ross and Jentery Sayers trace as much in
                    <title rend="quotes">Modernism Meets Digital Humanities,</title> and Gabriel Hankins argues similarly that
                    through the <soCalled>weak program</soCalled> of digital methods applied to modernism, critics can
                    activate a variety of subtler points of contact that better model how diffuse
                    modernisms share aesthetic territory. <ptr target="#ross2014"/> <ptr target="#hankins2018a" loc="582"/>
                    Elsewhere, Hankins goes so far as to
                    say that the “new modernist studies is now always already digital,” and though
                    Ama Bemma Adwetewa-Badu reminds us that <quote rend="inline">digital tools cannot do the critical
                    and analytical work that we do,</quote> she adds that
                    <quote rend="inline">neither can we do the work that they do,</quote> work necessitated by a messy and

                    evolutions of novelty in 20th-century fiction.<ptr target="#mcgrath2018"/> Other digital forays in
                    the past half-decade, as detailed expansively by J. Matthew Huculak, represent
                    substantial collections, recoveries, expansions, and innovations of
                    archivism.<ptr target="#huculak2018" /> Cue in Amanda Golden and Cassandra Laity’s co-edited

                    of modernist criticism seems fully upon us, furnishing the New Modernist Studies
                    with accounts that illustrate how the critical debates of modernism are
                newly accessible, and newly accessible to critique, through digital approaches.</p>
            <p> Even so, computational approaches to analyzing modernist
                    texts (e.g. text analysis, stylometry, computational stylistics, network
                    analysis, and topic modeling) so far account for a relatively scarce subset of
                    modernism’s new digital surge. There are scattered exceptions,<note><ptr target="#mcgrath2018"/> and 
                    <ptr target="#ross2016"/> notwithstanding. See also: <ptr target="#drouin2014"/>; <ptr target="#weidman2018"/></note>
                    and by far the most active scholars at
                    the intersection of text analysis and modernist studies have been Hoyt Long and
                    Richard Jean So, whose work on modernism at the Chicago Text Lab has spanned a
                    wide range of modernist topics: they’ve analyzed the poetic publication networks
                    of high modernism, provided a multifaceted analysis of the English-language
                    haiku, and studied the movement of stream of consciousness as literary
                    technique.<ptr target="#long2013"/> <ptr target="#long2016a"/><ptr target="#long2016b"/> Yet their work
                makes up the bulk of digital literary criticism that measures, models, and
                interprets the styles of modernism computationally.</p>
            <p> Several practical reasons have shouldered much of the blame for this lack of
                critical diversity. Although new and compelling intellectual paradigms have
                attempted temporal and spatial refigurings of modernism through its complex global
                and planetary shifts, <ptr target="#hayot2016"/><ptr target="#wollaeger2012"/><ptr target="#long2016b"/>the dominant critical views of modernist
                work still converge in the early 20th century. <note>In fact,
                            Urmila Seshagiri and David James recently bolstered that organizing
                            logic, arguing how <quote rend="inline">[r]etaining modernism across deep time can
                            dehistoricize it as a movement but repoliticize it as a global practice,
                            a practice that serves instrumental ends in the context of cultural
                            circumstances with which modernist writing has yet to be associated</quote>

                criticism requires an accessible textual archive, and since the preferred
                periodization of modernism has gone largely unchanged, large portions of modernist
                corpora have long been under copyright until only very recently — and most works, at
                least widely, may remain so for the better part of the next decades.

                            explanation of why published works after 1923 have
                             remained out of the public domain. As of 1 January, 2019, a variety of
                            US-published works from 1923 have entered the public domain, and each
                            subsequent year will see a correlative year’s worth of once-copyrighted
                            works do the same. An exception must be made, however, for Matthew
                            Huculak and Claire Battershill’s <title rend="italics">Open Modernisms</title> project, which as of
                            this writing represents an online archive of nearly 500 modernist works
                            in various genres (see <ref target="http://openmods.uvic.ca/">Open Modernisms</ref>). Otherwise, in the past half-decade, the
                            HathiTrust Research Center is the only digital collection that offers
                            access to sets of post-1923 texts for scholars doing computational
                            research, and it comes with several restrictions.</note>
                Unsurprisingly, easy access to reliable digital materials is a strong determiner of
                the topic matter of computational literary study, which often seeks to analyze
                bodies of work macroanalytically or, in the now notorious Morettian variation, “from
                a distance.” These limits have held particular sway in the realm of stylometry, a
                broad approach to studying textual style that aims, usually, to analyze a large
                corpus of literature by counting certain words (or other linguistic elements like
                grammatical structures, punctuation, etc.), averaging the measurements out into a
                unique <soCalled>signature,</soCalled> and then comparing that stylistic composite to other texts,
                authors, periods, and so on. Applied to literature, these countings have helped
                scholars make claims about style as a measurable form as it exposes certain
                conditions, contexts, and forms of representation, both inside and outside of
                narratives; through style, that is, critics have argued that they can digitally
                identify, measure, and compare the flows and workings of social and cultural
                mechanisms — like productions and representations of gender, race, class, or
                nationality — as they slip into linguistic tendency.</p>
            <p> If one puts aside the material limitations of modernist computational study, one
                finds that deeper conceptual concerns have also restricted that study, especially
                with regard to modernist stylometry and its relationship to gender (and other
                identity categories). Modernist social life was as much governed by the
                sociopolitical affordances of feminism’s first wave as anything else, and its
                consequences rippled powerfully through much of modernist literature. Coupled with
                the dicta of avant-garde modernist aesthetics — which, for the sake of space, we might
                vulgarly boil down to newness and experimentation — this access to new material
                conditions, sociopolitical spaces, forms of representation, and modes of
                being-in-the-everyday also released a well-documented <emph>stylistic</emph> 
                first wave for many writers. Gertrude Stein, Virginia Woolf,
                H.D., Djuna Barnes, Mina Loy, and Jean Rhys, among a multitude of others, unwound
                the concertinaed styles of their literary predecessors to produce, if we might
                borrow from Cary Nelson, a literature <quote rend="inline">generically undecidable, sometimes feminist
                and lesbian, wholly unassignable to a humanizing persona, and more purely and
                powerfully devoted to an exploration of how language works.</quote> <ptr target="#nelson1989" loc="179"/></p>
            <p> Our aim in this essay is to consider the conceptual impediments to studying that
                undecidability of gender stylometrically, as an influencer (or correlative feature)
                of modernist style.<note> We should clarify that
                    our use of the term <soCalled>style</soCalled> diverges from other variants used by modernist
                    literary scholars (e.g. Rebecca Walkowitz), which tend to invoke the term
                    loosely and synonymously with <soCalled>form,</soCalled> insofar as each denotes a literary pattern
                    traceable through (for example) close reading. In the realm of stylometry, a
                    notion of literary style is technical and tied to word use, and the term stands
                    in for the aggregate of a set of formal, observable textual features. Our
                    underlying assumption is that word preference can be measured by first counting
                    words, both within individual texts and comparatively within a group of texts,
                    and that those counts will be unique along different axes (e.g. different from
                    writer to writer; genre to genre; etc.). By extension, those counts tell us
                    something about the content and <soCalled>style</soCalled> of a text/writer relative to other
                    texts. See section 3, and footnote 20 specifically, for a technical expansion on
                    this process of determining literary style computationally. For a terrific
                    account of the interdisciplinary use of the term among textual studies fields,
                    see <ptr target="#herrmann2015"/></note> We
                first locate where some of those difficulties are borne out in computational
                literary criticism broadly and, in particular, call attention to the way stylistic
                markers that have been taken as proxies for forms of gendered experience can prove
                unreliable in modernist contexts. Virginia Woolf’s famous meditation in 
                <title rend="italic">A Room of One’s Own</title> on androgyny and its creative potential
                might be invoked here: stylometric scholarship has not yet contended with how
                extensively the experiments of modernist style, full of gender explorations and
                polysemous difficulty, complicate the tidiness and differentiability sometimes
                required of text analysis. Such a claim is certainly not new in the realm of
                computational literary criticism generally, and as the next section details, many
                digital practitioners have already studied just how deeply our notions of gender
                undermine computational designs. It is simply to this mounting critical stack that
                we add a new stylometric case featuring a small corpus of modernist fiction, in an
                effort to show both the limits and potentials of its stylometric study.<note>
                    And this line probably owes a great critical
                    debt to those recent critiques of computational literary study proffered by
                    Katherine Bode — though, our study tends toward slightly more optimism: in the
                    end, while we suggest stylometric critique needs to be wary of drawing firm
                    conclusions about modern life via modernist fiction, we nevertheless think
                    stylometry has much to offer the study of modernism. See <ptr target="#bode2017"/></note></p>
            <p> Using Woolf’s novel <title rend="italic">Orlando</title> specifically, we argue that the
                story of gender and modernism as seen through stylometry reveals a shared limit of
                its models — of identity and computation — to provide trustworthy exemplars. We briefly
                consider, too, some ways that the stylistic uniqueness of Woolf’s novel might help
                us understand modernism more completely. After all, if the full cultural stakes of
                modernism remain unearthed (as Seshagiri and James have proposed), if the legacies
                of modernism continue to haunt our aesthetic forms, and if gender is one site of
                particularly fruitful aesthetic experimentation, then stylometry may help further
                uncover the stylistic innovations and cultural remnants that constitute the topos of
                modernist influence. And since modernist texts, at least in the US, are beginning to
                shed their copyright shackles, the proto-framing for a modernist stylometry is
                perhaps already overdue.</p>
            <p> The digital turn has provided an innovative set of tools for reading and
                encountering and thinking through modernist texts, as singular materials to linger
                with but also to scrutinize through their forms of digital manufacture. We hope to
                show that stylometric analysis of someone like Woolf in particular, and perhaps many
                modernist writers in general, links critics to new ways of seeing the designs of
                gender, the stylistic transitions of which require stylometrists to contend
                carefully with the complexity and multiplicity of modernist literature and its
                shifting orientations.<note> In this we uphold
                    Losh et al.’s call for a <quote rend="inline">genuinely messy, heterogeneous, and contentious
                    pluralism</quote> as the underlying ethic of our digital methods, a critical approach
                    that may also productively join — or productively digitize — the political
                    investments of our data, its structures, and our own methods of analyzing and
                    contextualizing modernism <ptr target="#losh2016" loc="98"/>.</note> 
                Such a view has the benefit of
                reiterating two important points: first that modernism’s collection of digital
                movements (vis-à-vis Pressman) occasioned an understanding of linguistic styles as
                flexible, experimental technologies that could hide and reveal, invoke and
                manufacture identity categories at the proverbial touch of a pen or click of a
                typewriter; and second that our computational methods themselves complicate
                modernism’s representational politics by rewriting literary data into new and
                ongoing digital dialectics.</p>

                    Formalism</head>
            <p>Some framing is in order before we outline our modernist experiment, regarding first
                how we employ the concept of gender in relation to modernist literature, and second
                what digital humanists have tended to glean from the computational study of literary
                style and gender (using tools and methods at least adjacent to stylometry). After,
                we consider how treating Woolf’s <title rend="italic">Orlando</title> as a case study of
                gender and modernist style helps us reassess the way we see exemplary cases, and how
                it may require that modernist scholars differ from prior studies in their
                applications of stylometric critique.</p>
            <p> If we follow the conceptualization of gender as a set of sociopolitical conventions
                and laws discursively assigned to bodies and constructed and policed accordingly (a
                là Judith Butler), <ptr target="#debeauvoir2011"/> <ptr target="#butler1990"/> <ptr target="#butler1993"/> <ptr target="#faustosterling2000"/>
                to imagine we might reliably
                evaluate gender computationally seems at least somewhat confused. Gayle Rubin’s
                sex-gender system, that <quote rend="inline">set of arrangements by which society transforms biological
                sexuality into products of human activity,</quote> <ptr target="#rubin1975" />
                has long-since clarified that gendered
                identities are sets of internalized, performative scripts reified through various
                legal, political, scientific, and cultural processes. This is an essential
                clarification for stylometric analysis, which purports to measure these discursive
                influences as they bleed through language. If it is only through socializing
                discourses that a body becomes vested with the idea of an essential sex/gender,
                stylometry only detects the un-isolated impressions of that social and cultural
                influence as they mix with a mess of other discursive powers; for Bode, this manner
                of viewing texts often ends in <quote rend="inline">dismiss[ing] the documentary record’s
                    multiplicity.</quote><ptr target="#bode2018" loc="92"/></p>
            <p> In spite of these conceptual limitations, a variety of digital humanists have
                undertaken the intricate work of studying gender and style throughout literary
                history and at various scales. A first and landmark example is John Burrows’s 1986
                study of Jane Austen’s novels, which simply used Austen’s varied frequency of
                function words (pronouns, prepositions, articles, conjunctions, and other
                non-content words) to identify character dialogue patterns, narrative subtleties,
                thematic transformations, tonal ebbs and flows in characterization, directions and
                forces of speech, and so on, many of which fall along typical 19th-century gender 
                lines.<note> See <ptr target="#burrows1986"/> Burrows
                    popularized the field of literary computational stylistics with his book, and
                    his was one of the first to recognize the scales of semantic meaning within
                    patterns of function word usage; although he doesn’t really study gender in
                    Austen explicitly, literary stylometrists continue to build on his
                    principles.</note> Many have since built from Burrows’s pioneering study, and
                among the more recent attempts to unravel gender’s impact on literary style, Matthew
                Jockers’s work on 19th-century fiction in <title rend="italic">Macroanalysis</title> is likely the most well-known. 
                Chief among Jockers’s
                conclusions is that gender is the <emph>least</emph> influential
                determiner on literary style in the 19th century when compared
                to other categories of stylistic difference — e.g. author, genre, (decade-long)
                period, textual variations (punctuation, pronoun usage, etc.). <ptr target="#jockers2013" loc="98–8"/>
                In a narrower study
                    of 19th-century fiction, one framed more closely by the period’s sociohistorical
                contexts, Jockers and Gabi Kirilloff looked at the depiction and action (via pronoun
                and verb combinations like <emph>she walked</emph> or <emph>he
                    dressed</emph>) of male and female characters. They observed that men and women
                were narrated with different vocabularies according to 19th-century norms, and that 
                19th-century novelists had
                difficulty masking their own gender when they wrote characters of the opposite.
                <note> See <ptr target="#jockers2016"/>. Refer also to both <ptr target="#rybicki2016"/>, 
                    as well as <ptr target="#algeehewitt2015a"/>for two more essays
                    utilizing similar methods to reach similar ends.</note> In fact, Kirilloff and
                Jockers published an addendum to that study recently, pairing close reading of
                several of its outliers with those verb-usage lists, concluding that <quote rend="inline">[t]hough the
                characters in these novels behave in <soCalled>‘unconventional’</soCalled> ways, all three struggle to
                    mitigate traditional and emerging social values,</quote> a dialectic they found<quote rend="inline">reflected
                not only at the level of plot but at the level of the sentence, and in fact, at the
                level of individual words.</quote> <ptr target="#kirilloff2018" loc="842"/> </p>
            <p> Although the above examples concern gender as it emerges in literature to reflect
                certain cultural norms and social circumstances, critics have also studied gender
                computationally in relation to its contemporary production via the politics of
                reception and the literary marketplace, productively tying the stylistic into its
                socioeconomic imprints. Ted Underwood, David Bamman, and Sabrina Lee find that
                gender divisions between characters in fiction are becoming less distinguishable
                (i.e. men and women characters are being described and speaking/acting more
                similarly), but that the proportion of fiction written by women, and the proportion
                of women characters, dropped dramatically from 1800-1960. Hence <quote rend="inline">while gender roles
                were becoming more flexible,</quote> Underwood et al. argue that the story of women writing
                literature is <quote rend="inline">a story of steady decline,</quote> and that between 1850 and 1960, <quote rend="inline">fiction
                itself became more attentive to men,</quote> such that women as characters were becoming
                less prominent, even in books by women. Jonathan Y. Cheng, meanwhile, takes physical
                descriptions as an entryway to studying gender and gendered embodiment over the last
                150 years of English-language fiction; he uncovers that physical descriptions of
                characters has increased over time, but that for women’s characterization,
                specifically, bodily descriptions remain curiously central, even as literary
                depictions of men and women become less binary. <ptr target="#cheng2020" loc="28–29"/>
                In a strictly contemporary account, after canvassing thousands of
                reviews from the <emph>New York Times Book Review</emph>, Andrew Piper and
                Richard Jean So discovered that reviewers still talk about women’s books and men’s
                books in stereotypically antithetical terms, <quote rend="inline">reproduc[ing] the public/private split
                bequeathed to us from the nineteenth century.</quote> For Piper and So, their findings
                indicate that the damaging discourses around gender are still being subtly
                reproduced in the public apparatuses that surround literature.<note> This claim is made even clearer and more forcefully by Amy
                    E. Earhart, Roopika Risam, and Matthew Bruno in their account of gender and
                    scholarly citational practices in <ptr target="#earhart2020"/></note> Their results were
                expanded later by Eve Kraicer and Piper, who found similarly — and through a diverse
                and thorough assortment of computational models — that the representations of women in
                much of contemporary fiction mirrors their marginalized and decentralized positions
                in the literary marketplace. <ptr target="#kraicer2019" /> Matthew J. Lavin achieves something similar in his more located
                study of gender, reception, and the descriptive styles of <emph>NYT</emph>
                book reviews between 1905 and 1925; and, contrary to Underwood et al., Lavin
                finds that women were in fact writing <emph>more</emph> fiction than men
                and yet that diverse work was still being discussed and reviewed within a reductive,
                domestic, private/public vocabulary. <ptr target="#lavin2020"/></p>
            <p> The above is by no means a cumulative list,<note>
                    See, among other, longer accounts, <ptr target="#bode2018"/> and 
                    <ptr target="#underwood2019"/>, each of which
                    contains a section on gender and (mainly) 19th-century
                    literature.</note> but as a largely current critical sampling, these studies
                showcase both the standard story of gender and style leading up to or following the
                    <emph>fin de siècle</emph> and how scholars have approached that
                story, which is most often by examining the stylistic indications of a period’s
                culturally and socially produced gender binary, and then determining how those
                categorizations reveal new aspects of gendered subjectivity. In fact, this is
                probably a fair way to summarize the basic project of most computational studies of
                literary style and gender, the majority of which unearth, organize, and interpret
                linguistic traces through gender’s various social and cultural histories and subtle
                modes of material and narrativized representations.</p>
            <p> Yet as these scholars realize, utilizing digital methods to approach gender as a
                defining mechanism governing literary reception, critique, production, and
                reproduction introduces as many problems as insights, especially when the results of
                their digital literary analyses are placed within those social and historical
                contexts from which their corpuses are pulled. As an astute reader will have noted,
                the computational analyses we covered largely discuss gender and literary production
                in the 19th-century or our contemporary period, and we draw
                attention to them not only to detail the range of current quantitative formalist
                work on gender and literature, but also to point to the critical gap that exists
                where a related digital modernist criticism could be, given that these studies have
                provided few insights about modernism.<note> In fact, aside from Lavin’s essay about modern
                        reviewing, we can think of only two studies that
                            employ some form of quantitative formalist approach to modernist work
                            and even vaguely relate it to gender. Stephen Ramsay’s <title rend="italic">Reading Machines</title> opens with a chapter that analyzes Virginia
                            Woolf’s <title rend="italic">The Waves</title> in relation to its feminist criticism, and David
                            Hoover’s later <title rend="quotes">Argument, Evidence, and the Limits of Digital Literary
                            Studies</title> positions itself directly opposite Ramsay’s earlier study by

                        quantitative formalism, however, modernist digital scholarship is
                        flourishing — see, for instance, Suzanne Churchill, Linda Kinnahan, and Susan
                        Rosenbaum’s recent discussion of their work on Mina Loy, style, and UX
                        design and their interactive digital project of feminist modernist design
                        (which builds on the related work of Catherine D’Ignazio and Klein’s
                        foundational feminist visualizations essay).</note> </p>
            <p> The first impulse of computational critics is often
                to test the already-reified categories around us, gender notwithstanding. But that
                approach can tend toward troublesome precarity — troublesome not merely from a
                computational standpoint either, per Johanna Drucker, who makes the following
                observation about the hazards of studying gender digitally in her recent
                meta-analysis of computational modeling:</p>
            <p>The markers of gender identity may be not in the corpus but in the biographical
                details, expressed or suppressed, of authors. Looking at stylistic features and
                asking how they come to represent or construct conventions of gender as an effect of
                textual practice would lead in directions other than those that presume to sort
                according to gender as a given category. <ptr target="#drucker2017" loc="632"/></p>
            <p>So, as we harness computational methods for the textual analysis of gender, we cannot
                neglect the urgency of self-reflexivity, which must illuminate how the parameters of
                our textual data, as well as our own interpretive contexts, already construct the
                pseudo-essentialized elements of gender in our digital practices. Miriam Posner and
                Lauren Klein helpfully reimagine data in an analogous way, <quote rend="inline">as much an orientation
                toward one’s sources as it is a primary category of knowledge.</quote><ptr target="#posner2017"/>
                Such a view, the scholars point out, yields DH methods
                more materially, socially, culturally oriented, attendant to the non-digital
                conditionings of the digital, the discourses of which are often grounded in
                dialectics of visibility and invisibility.</p>
            <p> Take, though, a statement from some of the scholars participating in that digital
                praxis — for example, Underwood et al. in their <emph>Cultural Analytics</emph>
                piece — who often explain these shared limitations differently:
           <cit><quote rend="block"> This essay considers both the gender positions ascribed to authors as biographical
                personages, and the signs of gender they used in producing characters. In both
                cases, we understand gender as a conventional role that people were expected to
                assume in order to become legible in a social context. Authors and characters have
                been coded according to a tripartite scheme (feminine / masculine / other or
                unknown), because that scheme organized most public representation of gender in the
                period we are studying. Gender can certainly be more complex than these categories
                suggest, and flexible ontologies can be designed to illuminate the complexity. But
                this essay is inquiring about the history of conventional roles, not about the truth
                of personal identity, or the underlying processes that produce gendered behavior.</quote>
           <ptr target="#underwood2018" loc="2"/></cit> </p>
            <p>The message here begins to echo Drucker’s, in that it is in the author’s biographical
                details and situated experiences, which leech into the text as stylistic attributes,
                that the idiosyncrasies of the author’s personal style become the clothing that
                outfits a novel’s gendered position. But where Drucker implies that gender can
                operate as other than a given category, Underwood et al. must admit to retaining a
                tripartite structure for sorting gender, even though they make very clear that such
                a schema will fail to encapsulate gender’s complex, messy, performative capacities.
                In most computational analyses of literary style and gender this is an inevitable
                move that, as Kraicer and Piper explain, historicizes the results and <quote rend="inline">allows us to
                make explicit the otherwise latent ways in which gender is being mobilized and
                hierarchized within novels.</quote><ptr target="#kraicer2019" loc="26"/>
                A first lesson in quantitative formalism is that discourse
                predetermines data — depending on the tools we implement and the discourses we
                possess, data can always be made to appear a certain way. As they track some of
                those ways in their <emph>Cultural Analytics</emph> <title rend="quotes">Identity Issue</title>
                introduction, Susan Brown and Laura Mandell develop an exhaustive history of
                conceptualizing gender, outlining the importance of such historicizing for digital
                projects, which must balance quantitative methodologies with that same reflexive
                process that asks how our methodological designs direct our analyses. <quote rend="inline">Historicizing
                helps to destabilize identities,</quote> Brown and Mandell maintain, <quote rend="inline">and cultural
                analytics can make visible a kind of history that we have never seen before.</quote>
                <ptr target="#brown2018"/></p>
            <p> Perhaps, though, the kind of historicizing typical textual analysis does serves to
                stabilize more than <emph>de</emph>stabilize. Underwood et al. say, for
                instance (to keep with our arbitrary, cherry-picked example), that their essay does
                not delve into <quote rend="inline">the underlying processes that produce gendered behavior.</quote> But the
                assumption that such processes can be ignored when studying literary history seems
                suspect — because language, we know, is one such process, one that governs many
                others; and as Drucker reminds us, if you want to model gender you must produce (or
                reproduce) the underlying structures of gender. At some point, the current confines
                of stylometric analysis require that data be sorted into comparable categories,
                which means whether one gender, two gender, three gender, four, categories or
                columns of gender identification remain much easier to compare than gender spectra.
                Does adding a third, non-binary category — or a fourth, or a fifth — unlock or
                ameliorate the hindered politics of representation at the heart of designing
                computational analyses around those historical notions of gender? As Pamela Caughie
                et al. emphasize in their work on feminist ontologies, the answer is of course
                    not.<ptr target="#caughie2018"/> And yet, to label some identity as historically extant when
                it wasn’t <emph>also</emph> introduces a set of problems, and as Underwood
                and company note, to imagine there was social space for more gender fluidity than
                there actually was does us little good when analyzing textual traces we aim to tie
                back into historically grounded claims about social realities.</p>
            <p> This is the uncertain impasse at which stylometric gender analysis has, so far,
                found a rather comfortable home. Underwood is right, as he aptly remarks elsewhere,
                that <quote rend="inline">nothing about this [binary] method compels us to stop at two perspectives</quote>;
                but is the best we can really expect of such critique its regular revelation that
                   <quote rend="inline"> “the very act of modelling carries with it the seeds

                            Richard Jean So contends similarly that errors help us realign models to
                            the unseen peripheries of data, and echoes Brown and Mandell’s sentiment
                            through the oft-quoted adage of famed statistician George E.P. Box: “All
                            models are wrong, but some are useful” <ptr target="#so2017" loc="669"/>. Andrew Piper makes a
                            comparable remark in his essay, <title rend="quotes">There Will Be Numbers,</title> <title rend="italic">Cultural Analytics</title>

                            implementation on particular data selections, necessitates reduction — and
                            that in its ubiquity reductiveness can actually be generative.

                limited critical positions and several vital, unaddressed questions. Does the
                clumsiness of quantitative formalism actually force us to decide whether to (a)
                anachronistically apply new understandings of gender to contexts that cannot hold
                them, or (b) hand-wash our responsibility to witness different kinds of gendered
                being, whenever they occurred? In the context of stylometry specifically, how can we
                responsibly do (a) while avoiding (b)? As Klein has asked elsewhere, how can we
                avoid reproducing normative investigations of identity categories like gender
                through models of distant reading, given that those models function in systemic and
                epistemological hierarchies of power that were not designed with plurality in

                            of women authors is almost entirely hand-scanned and OCRed, because the
                            continued gender inequality of the literary marketplace, which Piper and
                            So have studied, also occupies the realm of text digitization. Allen

            <p> In short, we not only lack a spectrum-based computational model for categorizing and
                operationalizing gender stylistically, but — for scholars of modernism — we also lack a
                critical vocabulary to address how our digital methods at once allow and prevent us
                from analyzing those <soCalled>thick textures of history</soCalled> that the New Modernist Studies
                    promised. <ptr target="#mao2008" loc="745"/>
                This is the hinge, after all, of Nan Z. Da’s argument against computational literary
                studies: that computational approaches to texts (stylometry among them) are
                frequently ill-applied to data not suited for its methods, and that its results are
                either incorrect, overstated, or unoriginal. <ptr target="#da2019"/> So, how
                might we develop a situated stylometry as <quote rend="inline">a digital strategy
                that <emph>can</emph> inform</quote> our computational and interpretative
                    methods? <ptr target="#christie2014"/> How can we put at our service digital
                methods that, according to Drucker, only act as a kind of filter through which we
                pull existing social structures and hierarchies, like normative or binary ideas
                about gender? Can we avoid treating their computational products as purified or more
                extant forms of pre-constructed inequity, and instead allow our processes of
                modeling to deconstruct themselves, to produce findings resistant to the systems
                that arrange them?</p>
            <p> In addition to underscoring the urgency of revising our methods to better fit
                gender’s actualities, we hope to demonstrate shortly — against recent critiques of
                computational literary scholarship — that even flawed stylometric models can teach us
                new things about modernism and its study. We want to explore how studying Woolf from
                within the binary she saw beyond can itself constitute a project of imaginative
                self-fashioning. To that end, and treating Woolf’s <title rend="italic">Orlando</title> as
                an important edge-case in the future of modernist-digital-critical scaffolding, we
                offer an investigation that recovers one of the stylistic innovations of gender in
                modernist literature before rethinking a few of stylometry’s prevailing critical
                assumptions.</p>

            <p>
                As with any digital literary analysis, taking the stylometric baton into
                modernism began with an inevitably insufficient selection (and rejection) of texts
                to analyze, and the narrow variety we collected here is representative of three,
                semi-arbitrary governing features: first, each author needed to have written at
                least three works of fiction (or collections of short stories);
                <note> While our
                            analyses included the default standardization of all texts with z-scores
                            (such that variations in a term like <soCalled>novel-length</soCalled> no longer come into
                            play) and might have analyzed works of intentionally disparate lengths,
                            we wanted to ensure our corpus maintained a cohesive genre; the phrase
                            <soCalled>novel-length fiction</soCalled> is one common compromise.</note>
                second, those texts needed to be published between 1900 and 1940;
                <note> Give or
                            take a year or two — we cheated, for example, to fit in Conrad’s 
                    <title rend="italic">Heart of Darkness</title> (1899).</note> and third, those works
                needed to be written in English. Bearing in mind the lessons of Jockers’s 
                <title rend="italic">Macroanalysis</title>, by narrowing our scope so dramatically we
                tried our best to isolate gender and its stylistic pressures from other well-known
                influencers of style like genre, period, translation, and so on. We thus settled on
                15 male and 15 female Anglo-modernists (Tables 1-2), and chose three to five works
                from each, for a total of 141 texts (68 female, 73 male).<note> The full text list is, of course, available on
                    request.</note></p>

            <p> If the process of forming a modernist corpus begets a state-of-the-field question
                about the current archive of modernism, this study’s selection of authors succeeds
                only in capturing a small, Anglophone, transatlantic subsection of the diverse,
                global engagements with and reactions to the political, social, and cultural
                investments of modernity. It is representative, that is, of only one, precarious,
                incomplete variant of modernism — a small sample that allows us to make clear claims
                about one subsection of modernist work. Archives, digital or otherwise, summarize
                and sometimes disguise significant acts of scholarship, and our own corpus operates
                with an agenda that erases as much as it attempts to combat its erasures. The
                resulting selections are meant only to represent one specific stylistic case — a
                rather <soCalled>traditional</soCalled> canon of Anglophone modernist fiction<note>
                    We would be remiss if we did not mention Elizabeth F. Evans
                    and Matthew Wilkens’s <title rend="quotes">Nation, Ethnicity, and the Geography of British Fiction,
                    1880-1940</title> (<title rend="italic">Cultural Analytics</title>, 2018) as the most recent
                    (computational) study to add to the mounting rationales 
                    <emph>against</emph> such a canon. The authors argue convincingly that, when taking
                    British fiction as a whole (and not just its canonical works), the modernist
                    period produced narrative attentions to international locales that greatly
                    outnumbered national ones. Most modern British fiction, that is, spent more time
                    discussing international milieus than not, which reaffirms concerns about the
                    representative validity of something like an orthodox canon of British modern
                    fiction.</note> — among the many stylistic cases of modernist literature, and we
                hope readers will forgive the indiscretions of our modernist assemblage, knowing
                that this list of authors may have taken any number of reasonable forms.
                <note>
                            Hence conventional caveats apply: our corpus may indeed produce a
                            narrative driven by ease-of-access or proximity over actual
                            representativeness; a larger, more diverse, more global (in short, a
                            <soCalled>different</soCalled>) corpus may provide different results; and the claims we
                            hope to make about gender and modernist style thus can’t reliably be
                            extrapolated to modernist literature’s other flavors without further
                            analysis. We admit this is a substantial, but so far largely
                            unavoidable, limitation of studying the literary canon of a period still
                            heavily under material and economic wraps. It’s reason, too, to be
                            skeptical of the scale of our study, which ends by looking at one text
                            and one author and is thus not nearly as macroanalytic as most
                            stylometric studies of literature. (It should be said that Mark
                            Algee-Hewitt and McGurl explore this and other rationales of
                            corpus-making in <ptr target="#algeehewitt2015b" loc="2–8"/>
                </note></p>
            <p> After just outlining some of the many problems of doing so, the irony of organizing
                our study around normative gender categories has not eluded us. Mandell announces
                that this very move is her topic of inquiry in the opening chapter of a recent 
                <title rend="italic">Debates in the DH</title> volume: <quote rend="inline">in some quantitative cultural
                analyses, the category of gender has been biologized, binarized, and essentialized
                in a trend that I call <soCalled>‘stereotyping’</soCalled></quote>; and if literary data has <quote rend="inline">been collected,
                sorted, and even produced according to the categories M/F,</quote> then it will find
                statistically significant differences whether or not those differences are
                    significant. <ptr target="#mandell2019"/> An algorithm trained on constructed
                differences of data (i.e. assigned authorial gender) does not sort through the world
                it purports to represent, after all, but generates a new world through the measures
                of difference with which we provide it. Bearing that considerable problem in mind,
                and building on the foundations set by the many computational studies of 19th-century literature, our interest is not in asking if or where
                gender is marked in fiction, but whether and how it <soCalled>gives-to-see</soCalled> the literary
                styles and structures of modernist fiction. Because we rely on gender as a
                historical category, we can learn about its in/stability and trans/formation from
                the ways it is invoked, signaled, modified, or tailored textually, around specific
                cultural contexts and social meanings and in relation to other texts. As
                traditional, binary conceptions of gender began to be understood as culturally,
                socially, politically, and legally affixed to bodies, modernist authors might also
                have affixed them to — or unfixed them from — their texts at a macro level, and we want
                to track the unique structural styling of gender in those texts.</p>
            <p> Like most, our methods for doing so stylometrically rely on the production of a
                table of word frequencies, from which stylistic similarity (based on statistical
                distance) can be measured. Traditionally, the most influential words in these tables
                are those function words, English’s grammatical glue (articles, prepositions,
                pronouns, etc.), because it turns out that each author — and, though to a lesser
                degree, each period, genre, and gender — uses each of those words at a remarkably
                consistent rate in their own work, and at a unique rate when compared to others.
                <note>
                            Though, there are indeed more nuanced measures of stylistic distance
                            that weight function and content words in different ways. Regardless,
                            this general technique is often called the <soCalled>bag of words</soCalled> approach, and
                            while it is popular in text analysis it also has its drawbacks. Its most
                            basic model treats every word in each text in the same way, regardless
                            of that word’s (a) syntactic or semantic contexts and (b) relation to
                            the narrative or literary forms — thus, every novel merely becomes a
                            countable bag of words. The approach makes measuring stylistic
                            difference simple and effective, but in doing so it erases the context
                            of all other literary elements in a work, which makes <soCalled>reading</soCalled> the
                            resulting wordlists a precarious task. Take the exchange in <title rend="italic">Orlando</title>
                            between the newly acquainted Shelmerdine and Orlando as a brief
                            example — and take first a jumbled approximation of what our machine sees,
                            in the spirit of <soCalled>big-data</soCalled> experimentalism: ‘a’ (2), ‘cried’ (2),
                            ‘[a]re’ (2), ‘you’ (2), ‘he’ (1), ‘man’ (1), ‘Orlando’ (1), ‘she’ (1),
                            ‘Shel’ (1), ‘woman’ (1). What’s happened in this sequence, now that
                            we’ve merely counted words and glossed over all context? Maybe a man and
                            a woman were crying together, but who really knows? The flattening
                            perils of decontextualized computational analysis are indeed laid bare.
                            Now, here’s the moment as it appears in the actual narrative: <quote rend="inline">‘You’re a
                            woman, Shel!’ she cried. ‘You’re a man, Orlando!’ he cried.</quote> Even in a
                            short, two-sentence example, Woolf’s tremendous gender-/word-play and
                            its meaning for the speakers, who have fallen for one another (and soon
                            marry) in part because of their gender non-conforming androgyny, is
                            entirely lost if one merely rushed to count one’s computational
                            chickens.</note> Stylometrists can then measure the
                statistical distances between the styles of individual texts, authors, or other
                groups (e.g. based on gender) to detect broad trends. This research has tended to
                take the form of sorting and examining diverse most-frequent-word (MFW) lists made
                up of other types of content words (nouns, verbs, adjectives, etc.) to locate
                stylistic quirks or generate topics for close-reading. For instance, one group of
                authors might prefer one term, set of terms, or set of topics over another — or, they
                might not — and by contextualizing and interpreting the divergences or convergences,
                critics can theorize what circumstances (generic, historical, social) might
                contribute to similarity or difference. However, in this study, we want to be
                particularly sensitive to the interpretive dangers in close-reading individualized
                wordlists (either for authors or their texts) because of how our digital design
                treats gender as a two-body problem. Fearing, that is, the equal likelihood of
                finding gender-specific stylistic trends and replicating essentializing discourses
                in our interpretations, we decided to take a less orthodox path by staying macro and
                running a series of broader, supervised machine-learning analyses on our modernist
                    corpus.<note>A basic note may be necessary regarding the
                            difference between supervised and unsupervised machine learning
                            techniques (though, there are other techniques that borrow from both
                            types). Supervised techniques tend to require the input of
                            pre-classified data to “learn from,” so that the algorithm can track and
                            then predict future patterns from similarly classified data (e.g. one
                            might train a road sign classification machine on thousands of different
                            stop sign images, and then feed it other random images and ask it to
                            output whether or not they feature stop signs). Unsupervised machine
                            learning, conversely, tends to model the distribution or configuration
                            of input data (e.g. providing a large, unsorted data set of road sign
                            images and some metric of sorting them might provide correlations,
                            groupings, or trends to help identify or separate those images). For
                            further reading on this difference, and for the other variations of
                            these methods, see <ptr target="#shalevshwartz2014" loc="4–6"/></note></p>
            <p> So, we trained our machine on the two groups of modernist texts (female, male),
                asking it, in effect, to develop an average style for each group based on the
                frequencies with which its authors used common words.<note> Our stylistic
                            analysis was done entirely through Eder et al.’s <title rend="italic">Stylo</title> package
                            in the statistical computing program, R (see <ptr target="#eder2016b"/>). Although we’ve
                            chosen a supervised analysis, its methodological limitations are
                            significant. The benefit of unsupervised learning (e.g. PCA) is that the
                            machine doesn’t know how many groups of data we think we’re studying, so
                            we can’t privilege a group split just because we think there is one; the
                            difficulty becomes identifying what features, exactly, constitute the
                            groupings output by the machine. Inversely, the downside of a supervised
                            analysis is that we organize the data in two pre-conceived groups and
                            ask that each text be assigned to one group or the other. The benefit is
                            that we at least think we have an idea of where machine-located
                            differences are coming from — i.e. in this case, we isolate our groups
                            based on gender. Both methods put us in an at least somewhat compromised
                            position when drawing conclusions about gender and its stylistic
                            features.</note> We then gave it sequences of random groupings
                of six different texts (three male, three female), which it had to correctly place
                in the corresponding author’s associated gender group. By random chance, the machine
                will assign any text to its correct group 50% of the time — with two possible groups
                in our analysis, the algorithm has the equivalent of a digital coin toss — which means
                that anything consistently or considerably more accurate suggests there may be
                measurable stylistic differences between the two groups. Among hundreds of
                classifying runs, misattributions occurred on average about 10% of the time; the
                classifier accurately determined the assigned gender of a text’s author in around
                90% of cases, which supports the notion that even given the experiments of
                modernism, the period’s gender binary seems to remain a strong determiner of
                    style.<note>One digital interpretation of the stylistic
                            distinctiveness between the genders in modernism has been advanced
                            elsewhere — see <ptr target="#weidman2018"/>
                            Again, as Mandell notes, this measure of <soCalled>textual gender</soCalled> alone is not
                            terribly interesting. Traditional social and cultural gender signaling
                            is perfectly expected in literary work and, in this case, we also
                            constructed our data to produce a split along that line of pre-sorted
                            difference <ptr target="#mandell2016"/></note> We utilized a series of different test conditions to
                ensure our results weren’t skewed with any one set of parameters,
                <note> We
                            forced the machine, for example, to cull words that didn’t appear in
                            most or all of the texts (to prevent particularly uncommon themes,
                            narrative locations, or character names to artificially amplify
                            differences); we used different MFW counts (50, 100, 200, … 1000) to see
                            if a more robust set of word frequencies would change our findings; we
                            swapped between statistical distance measures, seeing similar results
                            from Burrows’s Delta and the promising Wurzburg Cosine; and we employed
                            a variety of sampling methods, from analyzing each text in its entirety
                            to including only one or two random, bag-of-word
                    samples.</note> and though our tests turned up fleeting
                misattributions — among other examples, the machine assigned a random sample from
                Hemingway’s <title rend="italic">For Whom the Bell Tolls</title> to the female group, and
                it ascribed several samples from Radclyffe Hall’s <title rend="italic">Well of
                    Loneliness</title> to the male set<note> This
                    finding about Hall is especially intriguing; though we haven’t space to discuss
                    the novel here, Hall’s protagonist, the <soCalled>sexual invert</soCalled> Stephen Gordon, is
                    narrated through much of the same language as Woolf’s in 
                    <title rend="italic">Orlando</title>, a comparison that certainly warrants further study.</note> — we
                produced one misattribution that was both more frequent and more consistent than the
                rest: Virginia Woolf’s 1928 novel, <title rend="italic">Orlando: A Biography</title>. </p>
            <p> Common stylometric practice says to zoom in here and discern why 
                <title rend="italic">Orlando</title> is an outlier — and options abound for doing so: we might, for
                example, compare individual wordlists of each gender grouping, or of the text
                itself, or of the words preferred or avoided by one gender grouping/text over
                another. Again, however, our interest is in staying macro. Unsurprisingly, having
                already separated male and female novels, the wordlists only provide the same
                stylistic snapshot that has been traced extensively elsewhere (as our previous
                section details). We know that even as standard uses sometimes lead to surprising
                ends, male and female authors normally reproduce socially, culturally, historically
                consistent accounts of gender in their writing, often through predictable and
                stereotypically gendered characterizations, vocabularies, narrative actions,
                identifiers, and locales.<note> Many of the
                    studies from Jockers and Underwood, for example, discern as much in their 19th-century and contemporary corpuses, and alongside Jonathan
                    Cheng’s aforementioned piece, one of our prior essays confirms those findings in
                    modernist fiction (see again <ptr target="#weidman2018"/>).</note> Locating the gender
                difference we structured our studies around is not so interesting to us. What we
                want to ascertain, separately, is whether we can deploy stylometric methods without
                double-reading gendered cultural meaning into a list of semantic differences like
                verb constructions or function words. What if we apply stylometry to zoom out a tad,
                to the level of each text rather than each word? What does gender play look like
                within our small modernist corpus if we treat it as, for instance, an element of
                narrative structuring?</p>
            <p> Instead of studying how male and female authors diverged in word choice or
                grammatical preference, then, we decided to look at the overarching structure of
                that difference in our consistent outlier, <title rend="italic">Orlando</title>. To do so,
                we ran a more specific classification Eder calls a <soCalled>Rolling NSC.</soCalled>
                <note> For a
                            detailed explanation of the <soCalled>nearest shrunken centroid</soCalled> (NSC) method of
                            classification, see <ptr target="#jockers2010"/>
                            for a specific description of the technical features of NSC as applied
                            in <title rend="italic">Stylo</title>, see <ptr target="#eder2016a"/>. As a
                            stylometric classifier that finds an averaged stylistic profile, NSC
                            provides certain benefits over a standard variant like Burrows’s Delta
                            in Eder’s rolling method, which tries to pinpoint moments of stylistic
                            <soCalled>takeover</soCalled> in a single text after being trained on one more groups of
                            texts — see Eder, 459-63. With Delta, each text in each training group is
                            treated distinctly and is not consolidated into a stylistic profile
                            (i.e. <title rend="italic">Orlando</title>is measured against <emph>each</emph> training
                            sample/text, ranking the <soCalled>styles</soCalled> that are closest to the test text);
                            NSC, however, produces composites against which we can compare our test
                            text (i.e. <title>Orlando</title> against the averaged style of all female texts or
                            all male texts). For our study, where we want to isolate the gender
                            binary as a two-class problem, NSC is a natural fit. </note>
                This method also requires that we train the machine on our two gender groups, but
                rather than supply it with a random selection of texts to assign, we ask it to
                analyze slices of one particular text — in this case, 
                <title rend="italic">Orlando</title> — and then assign each slice to its stylistically closest group/gender.
                To make matters more interesting, we isolated our test author, so that none of
                Woolf’s other works appeared in the training sample or contributed to the averaged
                style of the female set; if she had a particularly strong author signal (and she
                does), this process would prevent her unique style from overpowering the average
                gendered style that results from the amalgam of her contemporaries’ works.
                <note>
                            This control turned out to matter little — when we reintroduced her
                            remaining texts to the training set and re-ran the analysis, the results
                            were nearly identical.</note> For sake of reference, we did
                the same analysis on a number of other randomly selected texts and, as is to be
                expected with a ~90% attribution rate, most slices of most novels were correctly
                assigned to their author’s corresponding gender (Figures 1-2).<note> Although we
                            analyzed each text at 50-1000 MFWs with culling from 0-50% and received
                            remarkably negligible variation in our results, for exact
                            reproducibility’s sake, each NSC classification image we included here
                            was produced at 500 MFWs and 0% culling.</note> In other
                words, most modernist authors in our corpus write more like the other modernists of
                their sex, and do so consistently and for the entirety of each novel, which appears
                to be the stylistic norm in literature, modernism or no.</p>

            <p> But <title rend="italic">Orlando</title> presents an atypical case — and to an extraordinary
                degree (Figure 3). About 32,000 words into the novel, the seemingly misclassified
                <soCalled>male</soCalled> style of Virginia Woolf abruptly changes, and the algorithm attributes the
                remainder of the novel’s style to the correctly assigned sex. More extraordinary,
                even, is what takes place narratively at the stylistic switch. The barely visible
                vertical dotted line marked ‘<emph>a</emph>’ in Figure 3, which lines up
                almost perfectly with the moment of stylistic gender reassignment, if you will,
                comes just after our protagonist Orlando is awakened in dramatic fashion from a
                weeklong slumber, and as those around him make a startling discovery:</p>

            <p> As she narrates a sex change in her story, Woolf actively styles a gender signature
                to match that of her character, a creative feat no other author — of 
                <emph>any</emph> period — has managed as far as we know. It’s difficult to explain just
                how unusual this is, in part because our subsection of modernist fiction doesn’t
                speak for all of modernism (let alone all of fiction), but in larger part because
                we’ve just never seen anything like this before. If our analysis isolated a
                descriptive, content-based lexicon (nouns, verbs, adverbs, adjectives), something
                like this result would be expected, at least to a degree. Several of the studies we
                outlined in the last section confirm that regardless of an author’s gender, talented
                writers are capable of imitating aspects of another gender in their writing
                (preferred behaviors, contexts, spaces, styles of speaking, etc.), a fact truer
                still for a writer as accomplished as Woolf. In our analyses, however, which again
                ranged from 50 to 500 MFW, the words we used to measure literary style are largely
                just those functional, non-descriptive terms void of any narrative context. This
                mean that Woolf didn’t simply change the <emph>what</emph>, the content
                her male-turned-female protagonist was thinking, saying, or doing — she fundamentally
                changed the <emph>how</emph>, the grammar and
                syntax that holds that content together.<note>
                    Burrows’s aforementioned 1986 study, among other contemporary versions — e.g.
                    James W. Pennebaker’s <title rend="italic">The Secret Life of Pronouns</title>
                    (Bloomsbury, 2011) — was among the first to explore just how important
                    function words were to the close analysis of literary style. Remarkable, then,
                    that Woolf seems to have divined and manipulated this reality half-a-century
                    earlier and without the benefit of computational analysis.</note> Perhaps how
                this came to pass, as <title rend="italic">Orlando</title>’s narrator relates, matters
                little: <quote rend="inline">It is enough for us to state the simple fact; Orlando was a man till the
                age of thirty; when he became a woman and has remained so ever since.</quote> <ptr target="#woolf1928" loc="139"/></p></div>

            <p>If we turn to the literary criticism on <title rend="italic">Orlando</title>, the
                impressiveness of this stylistic manipulation would seem inevitable given the
                theoretical projects the novel is said to carry out. <quote rend="inline">Long before university Gender

                These literary critics identify
                clearly the power of Woolf’s novel as it derives from close readings of context and
                narrative, producing feminist modes of representation for non-normative sexuality
                and genders through its play of literary genre — in Caughie’s case, the biography,
                mock or not. Elsa Högberg and Amy Bromley even consider <title rend="italic">Orlando</title>
                the novel that inaugurated Woolf’s theory of sentence morphology, the way Woolf
                playfully reshapes formal and generic sentence structures to mark a <quote rend="italic">“modernist
                rewriting of biography and gender, and the orthodox ways in which they tend to shape
                life and the body.</quote><ptr target="#högberg2018" loc="2"/></p>
            <p> Keeping with these accounts, we simply want to make one vital addendum: that the
                novel’s power — as proto-gender study or as transgenre — emerges from Woolf’s style.
                Again, while not every novel in our analysis was always assigned so tidily to one
                gender or another, no text separated as consistently or in such a structured manner
                as <title rend="italic">Orlando</title> — on cue, as it were, with the gender transition in
                its narrative. That level of stylistic control raises new questions about the scales
                of gender performativity, or rather focuses them down to the level of the line, the
                choice of one (seemingly insignificant) function word over the other, which
                complicates readings of <title rend="italic">Orlando</title> as a tale of cross-dressing,
                in which clothes make the (wo)man without regard for the discursive power wielded in
                the creation of <soCalled>men</soCalled> and <soCalled>women.</soCalled> Woolf, it seems, did not merely change the
                descriptions and clothes of her protagonist and so change the gender; she altered
                the very stylistic nuances that characterized Orlando when she was a woman from when
                he was a man. Hers isn’t just a narrative exploration of transition either, in the
                vein of Dr. Matthew O’Connor in Djuna Barnes’s <title rend="italic">Nightwood</title> or
                Leopold Bloom in James Joyce’s <title rend="italic">Ulysses</title>.
                <note> We steal both examples directly from Emma Heaney’s
                    magnificent book, <title rend="italic">The New Woman: Literary Modernism, Queer
                        Theory, and the Trans Feminine Allegory</title> (Northwestern UP, 2017). In
                    fact, Heaney’s exploration of the history and production of trans femininity
                    provides an important clarification to our study’s finding, detaching Woolf from
                    a legacy of modernist trans feminism (see <ptr target="#heaney2017" loc="302 footnote 11"/>).</note> That
                her writing diverges so thoroughly from the stylistic doxa of her contemporaries
                suggests to us that, as Woolf celebrates the new possibilities of being gendered and
                representing genderedness, she delivers a linguistic paradigm of that futurity. In
                    <title rend="italic">Orlando</title>, that is, Woolf not only cultivates a sustained,
                pluralist theory of gender transition, but she also practices the linguistic
                applications of its modern futures, a multifaceted engagement that perhaps no other
                author had actualized before.</p>
            <p> In this our study deviates from the findings of several aforementioned accounts of
                gender and literary style (e.g. Kirilloff and Jockers’ work on gender in 19th-century fiction), which tend to suggest gender-disciplinary
                social norms had a significant and, by extension, inextricable effect on
                literature’s stylistic structures. Most stylometric studies that isolate gender
                within a corpus of literature treat it similarly, as a governing stylistic force
                that manifests in formal semantic preferences or syntactic characteristics. Staying
                out of the wordlists, though, changes our perspective.<note> We understand, of course, that we still depend on averaged
                    literary styles (via a bag-of-word list of most frequent terms) in this study,
                    and we do not call that essential stylometric practice into question. What we’re
                    after here, rather, is a reimagining of how eschewing the inexact close-readings
                    that tend to follow computational measures of style can actually help us
                    accomplish something critically important. Deciphering averaged stylistic
                    differences — or, what’s more probable, incidentally lodging our pre-held
                    assumptions into stylistic peculiarities — does not expand or contextualize our
                    conclusions as much as it forecloses their messiness in almost-assuredly biased
                    explainers. By restraining that stylometric impulse, we hope to let the text’s
                    relation to the corpus (rather than specific terminological
                    connections/disparities) do the critical work for us. We want to venture an
                    observation here, helped along by Adam Kilgarriff’s influential essay, <title rend="quotes">Language
                    is never, ever, ever, random,</title> which clarifies an adjacent point by
                    distinguishing between randomness and arbitrariness in interpretations of
                    linguistic phenomena in literary corpora. That linguistic structures appear
                    nonrandom or predictable in their relation does not make that relation
                    meaningful — just as syntax can colonize meaning, narrative structures can demand
                    certain forms, patterns, and distributions of linguistic content, which detaches
                    judgments about their meaning from their possible literary-historical or
                    sociocultural arbitrariness. Having used a specific corpus organization and
                    specific modeling tools, all of which were designed to treat gender as a bimodal
                    stylistic question, we think finding in <title rend="italic">Orlando</title> a
                    nonrandom and narratively nonarbitrary gender flip is more than a linguistic
                    oddity.</note> Perhaps the history of gender and literary style is more than a
                sum of linguistic tendencies and more than gender’s socially, culturally,
                politically enforced written marking. In her innovative styling of gender
                transition, Woolf shows (among this subsection of Anglo-modernist fiction, at least)
                that this history is also an account of gender’s <emph>unmarking</emph>
                and <emph>undisciplining</emph>. Perhaps all that Woolf intuited is that
                gender needn’t have been as influential on literary style as we think it must have
                been; or, perhaps Woolf saw that our ideas about gender do not so much influence
                literary style as literary style influences our ideas about gender. If 
                <title rend="italic">Orlando</title> declares gender as merely the newest formal territory
                on which writers could experiment with identity, then it uncovers for us Woolf’s
                broader way of modern seeing, which could understand gender not as an imminent,
                immutable, uniform stylistic determiner, but as a flexible literary landscape — or,
                what comes to the same thing, as a style.</p>
            <p>Taking a step back, and stealing from the punchy clarity of Stephen Ramsay, we want
                to repeat a key clarification: <quote rend="inline">We are not trying to solve Woolf.</quote><ptr target="#ramsay2011" loc="66"/>
                We instead want to use <title rend="italic">Orlando</title>
                to ask whether the current registers of stylometry and computational stylistics
                stymie some of the radical potentials of modernist style. Because we constructed
                this stylometric study around a constricting binary gender logic, it can only tell
                us so much about that binary or what constitutes its differences, especially with
                tools applied as narrowly as we apply them here (e.g. on a relatively small
                modernist corpus, and then on a single modernist text relative to that corpus).
                Stylometric methods, like other forms of quantitative formalism, can’t exactly be
                employed in pursuit of such a task, particularly when our assumptions need to be
                levied in service of cultural and social conclusions to make them critically
                relevant — for example, if a linguistic difference can be tracked along gender lines,
                that difference must divulge something about gender’s representational or lived
                history. We are not convinced this is always true — sometimes the only thing stylistic
                difference informs is our understanding of failed historical representation, or a
                history of <emph>unlived</emph> difference, or gender’s otherwise hidden
                potentials. Despite writing from within a descriptive system that inhibits gender
                identity’s expression and possible futures — and despite being studied from within the
                same — Woolf still teaches us about the ways gender/ing could be deployed, inverted,
                and resisted, a didactic function that materializes even through, even as, a broken
                and insufficient gender binary.</p>
            <p> Our brief analysis of <title rend="italic">Orlando</title> should suggest that stylometry
                even applied narrowly can teach us a great deal about, say, the depth of modernism’s
                    <emph>avant-garde</emph> or about the limitations of studying style as
                a consistent and formal indicator of real-world messiness. After all, it’s through
                our study’s significant structural limitations that we see the extent to which
                modernists could make their styles fit (or an ill fit for) its categories — see, that
                is, how Woolf fashioned gender in, out, and around the binary trying to contain it.
                So, what other new alignments does a modernist experiment like Woolf’s make
                available within the genealogy of gender and digital analysis? Two observations seem
                essential: the first, a minor point about exemplarity, will lead us to the second, a
                broader claim about the limits of studying modern sociocultural forms through
                stylometric analysis of, in this case, a small portion of Anglo-modernist fiction. </p>
            <p>Christy Burns asserts that <quote rend="italic">“in <title rend="italic">Orlando</title> Woolf has already […]
                anticipated our attempts to clothe her writings in our own desires,” explaining that
                only “the curious residue of language […] both invites and resists our insistent
                refigurations, our attempts to make Woolf conform to our societal demands.</quote><ptr target="#burns1994" loc="67"/>
                In this unique anticipatory capacity Woolf’s novel comes
                to represent an exceptional case in our corpus of modernist fiction, both through
                its multi-century generic scope and through its stylistic flexibility. Its
                uniqueness thus poses an interpretive problem: How can we draw general conclusions
                about Anglophone modernism, or about gender and modernist literature, from a text so
                different from the rest, a novel that singularly rejects what we thought we knew
                about the relationship between gender and literary style?<note> This is a problem Piper recently aimed to tackle at much
                    greater length and with much greater care than we do here — see <ptr target="#piper2020"/></note></p>
            <p> According to Ben Etherington and Sean Pryor, by focusing on such exceptional cases
                scholars <quote rend="inline">can actively resist the falsifications and exclusions performed by the
                abstract generalisations of history, theory, and society at large.</quote><ptr target="#etherington2019"/>
                Stylometry notwithstanding, computational methods
                of analyzing literature attempt to discern a set of generalities that can cater to
                the macroanalytic at the cost of particulars, outliers or exceptions that sometimes
                require discarding. But if Woolf’s unprecedented literary experimentalism is what
                makes her an exemplary modernist — which is the case made by Burns and many other
                modernist critics — perhaps <title rend="italic">Orlando</title>’s 
                <emph>exceptionalism</emph> is what makes it an ideal text from which to generalize. If,
                in numerous cases of Anglophone modernism, the experimentally exceptional 
                <emph>is</emph> the general,<note> As
                    Pryor notes elsewhere, <quote rend="inline">the category of modernism was developed through
                    attention to exemplars</quote> <ptr target="#pryor2019" loc="37"/></note> then the discovery of new forms of
                difference in that literature, like <title rend="italic">Orlando</title>’s stylistic play,
                requires that the very category of <soCalled>general</soCalled> be productively expanded to include
                even its most remarkable outliers. And when the general example produces an updated
                interpretive scale or model, then it also produces a politics of historical
                interpretation consistent with that model, a politics that Burns would insist Woolf
                not only refuses but remakes.<note> Etherington
                    and Pryor clarify this point: <quote rend="inline">because exemplarity conditions the production of
                    knowledge, helping to construct the very object of inquiry, it is also a
                    political problem</quote><ptr target="#etherington2019" loc="5"/>.</note> Another way to say this is that, as Woolf invents
                a new means by which gender could be individually styled and proven as style, she
                shows that our general, normative understanding of the conditions and capabilities
                of fiction for representing gendered life is incomplete and in need of expansion.
                Literary critics have known about this capacity of Woolf for a long time, of course,
                but this stylometric view of <title rend="italic">Orlando</title> demonstrates just how
                acutely she played with gender as itself a type of literary style. There is no
                solving Woolf, as Ramsay says, because Woolf fundamentally changes the stylistic
                equation, widening modernism’s scope of the representatively possible.</p>
            <p> To our second point, then, and contrary to what most digital humanists have found by
                studying the literature of the 19th century, Woolf <emph>proves</emph> again that modernist literature generated
                denaturalizing and atypical movements of gender <emph>through</emph>, and
                not merely in, its styles. Modernists, we know, were among the first generations of
                writers fundamentally influenced by the reality that unconscious forces construct
                    us,<ptr target="#ellman2010"/><ptr target="#ffytch2012"/><ptr target="#north1999"/> and it’s
                essential to remember that their words are thus not simply markers of hidden
                sociocultural powers and discourses, but that they instead represent — for one of the
                first times in modern literary history — active, ongoing, deliberate engagements with
                those discourses as they knew they were appearing in their literature. Hopefully
                it’s clear how our point about exemplarity is a stepping-stone to this. When we
                arrive in modernism, a period in which authors, figures, writers, and thinkers were
                explicitly styling gender and its cultural markers, tracing a gender signal in
                writing is no longer quite as defensible by the logic used in stylometric studies of
                    19th-century literature. As Woolf herself says elsewhere,
                theirs was <quote rend="inline">an age clearly when we are not fast anchored where we are; things are
                moving round us; we are moving ourselves.</quote><ptr target="#woolf2009" loc="74"/></p>
            <p> Simply put, what we imagine to be the latent, stylistic territory of stylometry (and
                other computational methods invested in written style) cannot be trusted to have
                been latent at all in modernism. Woolf’s experiment reminds us that the fundamental
                assumption of traditional stylometry is notoriously unreliable — namely, that authors
                and specified groups have distinct, independent, hidden markers of style we can
                compare and from which we can glean social and cultural insight (about, for
                instance, the intentional or accidental written production of gender). Earlier we
                argued that modernism hasn’t been studied digitally for two reasons, but this would
                offer a much more compelling third: when it comes to the matter of gender, we can
                neither do so dependably nor do so without presuming to already know, and thus
                arrange a study around, where gender identity begins and ends for literary stylists.
                Scholars leveraging stylometric methods to analyze modernist literature must contend
                with modernism’s unique self-awareness in this regard — the ways stylistic
                experimentation may limit the conclusions that can be drawn from modernist language
                about the conditions of modern life.</p>
            <p>In other words, <title rend="italic">Orlando</title>’s remarkable stylistic play gives us
                reason to pause, reason to question stylometry’s ability to contextualize gender and
                modernism in the same breath. We do not mean to suggest that stylometry is
                fundamentally an ill-fitted tool for studying modernism and gender. We think the
                case of <title rend="italic">Orlando</title>’s gender transition and its conflicted
                stylistic story <emph>exemplifies</emph> just as many reasons to apply
                stylometric methods to study modernist style and gender as to prefer other
                approaches. Rather than declare stylometry insufficient, we simply want to point out
                that modernism, perhaps more so than other aesthetic movements or literary periods,
                necessitates a critical mutuality that requires from its scholars an upfront and
                explicit negotiation between object and method, accident and intention, style and
                styling. As interpretive constraints, these tensions address both why there isn’t
                much serious stylometric work on modernism and why there perhaps should be. If we
                want the future of modernist digital literary analysis to have any kind of
                educational function — i.e. if we anticipate that the lessons of stylometry will spill
                forth new insights about or models of the histories of gendered representation that
                can inform our understandings today — then we must reassess how we structure the study
                of gender and its stylistic waves as social and cultural trace. Maybe Woolf isn’t
                the first or only author to make this reorientation necessary, but she certainly
                illustrates the extent to which, when applied to and in modernism, our literary
                data and our digital critical methods must become more than “mere containers” of
                language’s curious residues. <ptr target="#posner2017" loc="4"/></p>
