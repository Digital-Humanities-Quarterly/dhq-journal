			<p><quote rend="inline">Can software or tools be feminist,</quote> asks <name>Tara McPherson</name> in <title
					rend="italic">Feminist in a Software Lab: Difference + Design</title>, <quote rend="inline">or are tools wielded
					with feminist intent?</quote>
				<ptr target="#mcpherson2018" loc="23"/>. That question weaves through the three challenges McPherson sets for herself
				in this complex and sometimes frustrating book. She reframes the text-centric origin story of the digital humanities
				(DH) to push back against prevailing narratives of text-centric and major project / method trajectories; she models
				ways in which critical making and critique can co-exist; and she presents an ethnographic narrative about a seminal
				project in <title rend="none">Vectors</title> that was founded and functions as a truly collaborative endeavor. The
					<title rend="none">Vectors</title> journal and lab, an object-oriented research and publishing mechanism, has since
				its inception centered on Black feminist theory and praxis, and in so doing has informed and inspired the
				intersectional approach of many emergent DH projects. In the process she traces the hegemonic development of UNIX in
				the 1960s that in many ways conflicted and belied the concurrent civil unrest and calls for social change. In so
				doing she raises uncomfortable questions for readers about the UNIX-based systems and applications on which we rely
				to undertake and disseminate our work. She does all of this while pushing the limits of the design-rich house style
				of its series – then at HUP and continued since at MIT Press – in an attempt to recapture and remediate scholarly
				work that was never intended to be presented in print. Indeed the work of editors and designers in the <title
					rend="none">Vectors</title> journal was meant to pursue <quote rend="inline">the relation of form and content, of
					interactivity, of shifting screen languages, and of emergent genres for scholarly publishing [that] are necessarily
					flattened in a bookish format</quote>
				<ptr target="#mcpherson2018" loc="25"/>. So it is this effort to describe the work of <title rend="none"
					>Vectors</title> that gives a sense of poignancy and frustration, given that many of the works she presents have
				been made inaccessible and therefore lost to us because of the ineffable burden of sustaining them over a long period
				– in the very UNIX operating systems and applications that supported them in the first place.</p>
			<p>The book comprises two long essays, one short essay, a series of multimodal interjections, and a variety of
				editorial and navigational apparatus. There is a <title rend="quotes">Visual Introduction</title> that presents a
				brief imagistic recounting of inspirations for design in digital publications. The preface, <title rend="quotes"
					>Opening <title rend="none">Vectors</title>,</title> outlines reasons why a text-centric understanding of DH is so
				limiting, and recognizes the importance of scholars who work in digital media, design, and critical making and how
				their works align better than is sometimes acknowledged with other forms of production and critique. In the preface
				McPherson also emphasizes how crucial it is to recognize the collaborative nature of DH work, and in particular the
				kinds of complex feminist software and critical race platforms that were undertaken at the <title rend="none"
					>Vectors</title> Lab. <title rend="quotes">How to Read This Book</title> is a wayfinder for readers who might be
				particularly interested in one or another of the book’s components, and so offers encouragement for nonlinear
				reading. The two long essays, <title rend="quotes">Designing for Difference</title> and <title rend="quotes"
					>Assembling Scholarship: From <title rend="none">Vectors</title> to <title rend="none">Scalar</title>,</title> in
				turn recognize the gendered, racist perspectives buried in the guts of the computer work we do and recount the
				efforts of the <title rend="none">Vectors</title> collective to push back against that hegemonic construction of data
				at its core. The book ends with a brief essay, <title rend="quotes">Outro: Scholarship in the Wild,</title> in which
				McPherson expresses anxiety about how the forms of scholarship made possible through DH are so fragile. There is also
				a section on <title rend="quotes">Guidelines for Evaluating Multimedia Scholarship,</title> in which she proposes
				ways in which such work should be recognized and evaluated. Perhaps the most effective and engaging are the five
				sections that punctuate the second essay. McPherson describes them as <q>recombinatory</q> attempts to re-present and
				thus make durable the voices and visions of the teams of editors and designers whose digital scholarship was
				published with and by the <title rend="none">Vectors</title> team <ptr target="#mcpherson2018" loc="26–27"/>.
				Throughout the book McPherson capitalizes on the ambitious aesthetic of the Harvard series (no doubt collaborating
				with its design team) to both play and provoke. The screengrabs of web pages and data visualizations, the different
				paper color and stock, font families, and page layouts underscore the othering involved in communicating and
				critiquing both digital process and product. As we explore the work of <title rend="none">Vectors</title>, we are
				pushed into unusual and sometimes uncomfortable modes of engaging with the material.</p>
			<p>
				<title rend="italic">Feminist in a Software Lab</title> is one in a growing number of monographs and volumes of
				collected essays that push against hegemonic assumptions about DH, including <name>Roopika Risam</name>’s <title
					rend="italic">New Digital Worlds</title> (2018), <name>Safiya Noble</name>’s <title rend="italic">Algorithms of
					Oppression</title> (2018), <name>Catherine D’Ignazio</name> and <name>Lauren Klein</name>’s <title rend="italic"
					>Data Feminism</title> (2020), and several volumes in the Debates in DH series, including <title rend="italic"
					>Bodies of Information</title> (<name>Jacqueline Wernimont</name> and <name>Elizabeth Losh</name>, eds., 2018),
					<title rend="italic">The Digital Black Atlantic</title> (<name>Roopika Risam</name> and <name>Kelly Baker</name>,
				eds., 2021), <title rend="italic">Global Debates in the Digital Humanities</title> (<name>Dominico Fiormonte</name>,
					<name>Sukanta Chaudhuri</name>, and <name>Paola Ricaurte</name>, eds., 2022), and <title rend="italic">People,
					Practice, Power: Digital Humanities Outside the Center</title> (<name>Anne McGrail</name>, <name>Angel David
					Nieves</name>, and <name>Siobhan Senier</name>, eds., 2022). What distinguishes McPherson’s volume is its frankly
				autoethnographic tone, especially in the sections reflecting upon the growth and construction of the <title
					rend="none">Vectors</title> projects and how those in turn informed the development of the <title rend="none"
					>Scalar</title> platform. McPherson’s representation of the overt rootedness of the <title rend="none"
					>Vectors</title> team in critical race theory and Black feminist praxis reveals its difference – and its chosen
				alignment with other major projects built upon concepts of North American feminist praxis, notably including the
				Canadian Writing Research Collaboratory: <ref target="https://cwrc.ca/">https://cwrc.ca/</ref>, the Women Writers
				Project: <ref target="https://www.wwp.northeastern.edu/">https://www.wwp.northeastern.edu/</ref>, the Advanced
				Research Consortium: <ref target="https://arc.dh.tamu.edu/">https://arc.dh.tamu.edu/</ref>, and Mukurtu: <ref
					target="https://mukurtu.org/">https://mukurtu.org/</ref> (led by <name>Susan Brown</name>, <name>Julia
					Flanders</name>, <name>Laura Mandell</name>, and <name>Kim Christen</name>, respectively). The model that McPherson
				puts forward is truly demonstrative of the ways that major projects both mature and when coming into being should
				develop their missions, and be intentional about long-range strategies for sustainable production.</p>
			<p>The first essay in the book, <title rend="quotes">Designing for Difference,</title> presents a clear-eyed
				explication of how embedded are the roots of computing in white male-led American military- and corporate-funded
				projects that developed and disseminated systems built upon the UNIX programming language, concurrent with the fight
				for racial justice and countercultural movements of the 1960s and 1970s. McPherson builds upon earlier work in which
				she unpacks the interrelationship between ‘cultural and computational operating systems,’ and how the latter served –
				wittingly or not – to embed covert racism into the very systems we use to communicate. McPherson thus challenges us
				to resist neoliberal modularity, using our coding and database design at the beginning rather than at the end of our
				work: <quote rend="inline">[g]ender, race, sexuality, class, and disability might then be understood not as things to
					be added on to our analysis (or to our metadata) after the fact, after the first principles, but instead as
					operating principles of a different order, already coursing through discourse and matter</quote>
				<ptr target="#mcpherson2018" loc="99"/>.</p>
			<p>The second essay, <title rend="quotes">Assembling Scholarship: From <title rend="none">Vectors</title> to <title
						rend="none">Scalar</title>,</title> offers a fascinating forensic reflection upon how the needs for new forms of
				dynamic publication were pursued at the <title rend="none">Vectors</title> Lab at USC for over a dozen years, weaving
				into that search the development of the multimodal, multivalent <title rend="none">Scalar</title> platform. Whereas
				some such biographical works might embed the labor committed to this kind of development to footnotes and appendices,
				here the memos, emails, schematics, and specification documents are wholly a part of the recounting. That such work
				was so carefully archived in the first place is an act of difference; think how often, at the pace with which we
				develop our digital projects, we leave our documentation to some later moment when we will have time (we think) to
				reflect. McPherson explains the principles that guided <title rend="none">Vectors</title>. The founding members were
					<quote rend="inline">committed to work with scholars who were engaging issues of gender, race, affect, memory,
					sexuality, nationhood, mediation, space, and social justice</quote>
				<ptr target="#mcpherson2018" loc="146"/>. Their works were object-driven and dynamic, and were chosen because they
				could not be adequately presented in print. The team did this work in ways that required deep collaboration – even
				immersion – into each scholar’s work, sometimes for months at a time, driven by an <quote rend="inline">impulse to
					reanimate the archive through narrative and design – to bring a waning form to new life while blurring the line
					between form and content, repertoire and archive</quote>
				<ptr target="#mcpherson2018" loc="158"/>. Such work necessitated making more explicit the intersection of humanistic
				and artistic scholarly expression, designing new types of databases that broke with rigid data hierarchies, pushing
				back against prevailing metadata schemas that reinforced colonial knowledge graphs, and building middleware and
				interfaces that privileged object over text. Description of that process reveals how highly customized and therefore
				how fragile the work was, and ultimately how the <title rend="none">Vectors</title> group designed the open-source,
				open-access <title rend="none">Scalar</title> platform to find a balance between specific design needs and
				sustainable publication.</p>
			<p>As indicated above, perhaps the most compelling parts of the book are the <q>Windows</q> that offer case studies of
				the projects developed at <title rend="none">Vectors</title>. The first three <q>Windows</q> are dedicated to the
					<title rend="none">Vectors</title> journal itself, and to the development of its first project, <title
					rend="quotes">The Stolen Time Archive.</title>
				<q>Window 4</q> features snapshots of the visions of authors and designers of <title rend="quotes">Neue
					Nationalgallerie,</title>
				<title rend="quotes">Narrating Bits,</title>
				<title rend="quotes">WiFi-Bedouin,</title>
				<title rend="quotes">Cast-offs from the Golden Age,</title>
				<title rend="quotes">Unmarked Planes and Hidden Geographies,</title> and <title rend="quotes">shu jian.</title> Each
				includes statements of intent, woven amongst authors and designers that reflect the excitement and challenges
				presented by these complex projects – some of which seem never to have made it beyond the scoping phase. It’s hard to
				tell. The fifth <q>Window</q> features <title rend="quotes">The <title rend="none">Scalar</title> Feature
					Showcase,</title> presenting <title rend="none">Scalar</title>’s specifications, functionality, and a selection of
				projects produced within the platform, therefore positioning it as the direct evolution of the <title rend="none"
					>Vectors</title> journal.</p>
			<p>It is the <q>Windows</q> inserts that reveal the most problematic nature of digital media projects: their
				ephemerality, that is rooted in access needs over long periods of time, choices of software applications, and plugins
				that are made redundant, and what all of that means for our ability to think about preservation. It is McPherson’s
				attempt to describe the work that produces a feeling of unreclaimable distance for the reader. We can read about
					<name>Alice Gambill</name> and <name>Raegan Kelly</name>’s intention for <title rend="quotes">The Stolen Time
					Archive,</title> a project that was meant to transform and capture ephemeral time spent working with archival
				documents, but we cannot recapture it. Not only does the book push us away, but Adobe stopped supporting the Flash
				plugin in 2020, and so the Flash player-based content can no longer be accessed. Just as McPherson points to the
				flattening of these projects in bookish format, she reveals the precarity of this work, and anticipates the reader’s
				unease with the warning, <quote rend="inline">due to technological obsolescence and other factors a number of <title
						rend="none">Vectors</title> Journal projects have become unavailable since their original publication</quote>
				<ptr target="#mcpherson2018" loc="235"/>. Any scholar who has worked in DH – or who has tried to cite a DH project –
				has experienced this kind of anxiety: the 404 error, the puzzle piece icon, the dead link. At a certain point even
				the most carefully curated and archived digital work will go missing and scholars who rely on digital forms of
				publication and presentation would be well served to consider this eventuality at the beginning of their work.</p>
			<p>But herein lies the poignancy of the book: these projects can only be described as lost referents. There is
				currently no way to experience them in the way that they were envisioned and designed. And who would be responsible
				for updating the artifacts so that they could be reclaimed? Perhaps that is McPherson’s ultimate gift to us through
				this book: to offer a kind of eulogy for all the work now lost.</p>
			<p>There is one problematic aspect of the book which the Press would be wise to redress. Despite extensive endnotes,
				references, and credits that rely on (and even are presented to suggest) hyperlinks, there is no e-edition of the
				text or even a PDF that would allow the reader to access the sources McPherson consulted as she wrote the book. Such
				oversight (unless for some reason the author or Press meant to omit) betrays the kind of privileged gate-keeping that
				still dictates how we share our scholarly work.</p>
			<p>Ultimately, McPherson uses the book to carve out a place for critical digital media theory and production. She
				models how purposeful analysis and production can be when they are driven by careful attention to collaborative labor
				practice. And she challenges us to think about whether we can ever truly publish the totality of our DH research,
				even as we strive to find new ways to document our work.</p>
