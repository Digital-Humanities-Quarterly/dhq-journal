               <div class="ptext" id="p1">“Can software or tools be feminist,” asks Tara McPherson in <cite class="title italic">Feminist in a Software Lab: Difference + Design</cite>, “or are tools wielded
                  					with feminist intent?”
                  				[<a class="ref" href="#mcpherson2018">McPherson 2018</a>, 23]. That question weaves through the three challenges McPherson sets for herself
                  				in this complex and sometimes frustrating book. She reframes the text-centric
                  origin story of the digital humanities
                  				(DH) to push back against prevailing narratives of text-centric and major project
                  / method trajectories; she models
                  				ways in which critical making and critique can co-exist; and she presents an ethnographic
                  narrative about a seminal
                  				project in <cite class="title none">Vectors</cite> that was founded and functions as a truly collaborative endeavor. The
                  					<cite class="title none">Vectors</cite> journal and lab, an object-oriented research and publishing mechanism, has since
                  				its inception centered on Black feminist theory and praxis, and in so doing has
                  informed and inspired the
                  				intersectional approach of many emergent DH projects. In the process she traces
                  the hegemonic development of UNIX in
                  				the 1960s that in many ways conflicted and belied the concurrent civil unrest
                  and calls for social change. In so
                  				doing she raises uncomfortable questions for readers about the UNIX-based systems
                  and applications on which we rely
                  				to undertake and disseminate our work. She does all of this while pushing the
                  limits of the design-rich house style
                  				of its series – then at HUP and continued since at MIT Press – in an attempt to
                  recapture and remediate scholarly
                  				work that was never intended to be presented in print. Indeed the work of editors
                  and designers in the <cite class="title none">Vectors</cite> journal was meant to pursue “the relation of form and content, of
                  					interactivity, of shifting screen languages, and of emergent genres for scholarly
                  publishing [that] are necessarily
                  					flattened in a bookish format”
                  				[<a class="ref" href="#mcpherson2018">McPherson 2018</a>, 25]. So it is this effort to describe the work of <cite class="title none">Vectors</cite> that gives a sense of poignancy and frustration, given that many of the works she
                  presents have
                  				been made inaccessible and therefore lost to us because of the ineffable burden
                  of sustaining them over a long period
                  				– in the very UNIX operating systems and applications that supported them in the
                  first place.</div>
               			
               <div class="counter"><a href="#p2">2</a></div>
               <div class="ptext" id="p2">The book comprises two long essays, one short essay, a series of multimodal interjections,
                  and a variety of
                  				editorial and navigational apparatus. There is a “Visual Introduction” that presents a
                  				brief imagistic recounting of inspirations for design in digital publications.
                  The preface, “Opening <cite class="title none">Vectors</cite>,” outlines reasons why a text-centric understanding of DH is so
                  				limiting, and recognizes the importance of scholars who work in digital media,
                  design, and critical making and how
                  				their works align better than is sometimes acknowledged with other forms of production
                  and critique. In the preface
                  				McPherson also emphasizes how crucial it is to recognize the collaborative nature
                  of DH work, and in particular the
                  				kinds of complex feminist software and critical race platforms that were undertaken
                  at the <cite class="title none">Vectors</cite> Lab. “How to Read This Book” is a wayfinder for readers who might be
                  				particularly interested in one or another of the book’s components, and so offers
                  encouragement for nonlinear
                  				reading. The two long essays, “Designing for Difference” and “Assembling Scholarship: From <cite class="title none">Vectors</cite> to <cite class="title none">Scalar</cite>,” in
                  				turn recognize the gendered, racist perspectives buried in the guts of the computer
                  work we do and recount the
                  				efforts of the <cite class="title none">Vectors</cite> collective to push back against that hegemonic construction of data
                  				at its core. The book ends with a brief essay, “Outro: Scholarship in the Wild,” in which
                  				McPherson expresses anxiety about how the forms of scholarship made possible through
                  DH are so fragile. There is also
                  				a section on “Guidelines for Evaluating Multimedia Scholarship,” in which she proposes
                  				ways in which such work should be recognized and evaluated. Perhaps the most effective
                  and engaging are the five
                  				sections that punctuate the second essay. McPherson describes them as “recombinatory” attempts to re-present and
                  				thus make durable the voices and visions of the teams of editors and designers
                  whose digital scholarship was
                  				published with and by the <cite class="title none">Vectors</cite> team [<a class="ref" href="#mcpherson2018">McPherson 2018</a>, 26–27].
                  				Throughout the book McPherson capitalizes on the ambitious aesthetic of the Harvard
                  series (no doubt collaborating
                  				with its design team) to both play and provoke. The screengrabs of web pages and
                  data visualizations, the different
                  				paper color and stock, font families, and page layouts underscore the othering
                  involved in communicating and
                  				critiquing both digital process and product. As we explore the work of <cite class="title none">Vectors</cite>, we are
                  				pushed into unusual and sometimes uncomfortable modes of engaging with the material.</div>

                  				<cite class="title italic">Feminist in a Software Lab</cite> is one in a growing number of monographs and volumes of
                  				collected essays that push against hegemonic assumptions about DH, including Roopika Risam’s <cite class="title italic">New Digital Worlds</cite> (2018), Safiya Noble’s <cite class="title italic">Algorithms of
                     					Oppression</cite> (2018), Catherine D’Ignazio and Lauren Klein’s <cite class="title italic">Data Feminism</cite> (2020), and several volumes in the Debates in DH series, including <cite class="title italic">Bodies of Information</cite> (Jacqueline Wernimont and Elizabeth Losh, eds., 2018),
                  					<cite class="title italic">The Digital Black Atlantic</cite> (Roopika Risam and Kelly Baker,

                  					Nieves, and Siobhan Senier, eds., 2022). What distinguishes McPherson’s volume is its frankly
                  				autoethnographic tone, especially in the sections reflecting upon the growth and
                  construction of the <cite class="title none">Vectors</cite> projects and how those in turn informed the development of the <cite class="title none">Scalar</cite> platform. McPherson’s representation of the overt rootedness of the <cite class="title none">Vectors</cite> team in critical race theory and Black feminist praxis reveals its difference – and
                  its chosen
                  				alignment with other major projects built upon concepts of North American feminist
                  praxis, notably including the
                  				Canadian Writing Research Collaboratory: <a href="https://cwrc.ca/" onclick="window.open('https://cwrc.ca/'); return false" class="ref">https://cwrc.ca/</a>, the Women Writers
                  				Project: <a href="https://www.wwp.northeastern.edu/" onclick="window.open('https://www.wwp.northeastern.edu/'); return false" class="ref">https://www.wwp.northeastern.edu/</a>, the Advanced

                  					Flanders, Laura Mandell, and Kim Christen, respectively). The model that McPherson
                  				puts forward is truly demonstrative of the ways that major projects both mature
                  and when coming into being should
                  				develop their missions, and be intentional about long-range strategies for sustainable
                  production.</div>

               <div class="ptext" id="p4">The first essay in the book, “Designing for Difference,” presents a clear-eyed
                  				explication of how embedded are the roots of computing in white male-led American
                  military- and corporate-funded
                  				projects that developed and disseminated systems built upon the UNIX programming
                  language, concurrent with the fight
                  				for racial justice and countercultural movements of the 1960s and 1970s. McPherson
                  builds upon earlier work in which
                  				she unpacks the interrelationship between ‘cultural and computational operating
                  systems,’ and how the latter served –
                  				wittingly or not – to embed covert racism into the very systems we use to communicate.
                  McPherson thus challenges us
                  				to resist neoliberal modularity, using our coding and database design at the beginning
                  rather than at the end of our
                  				work: “[g]ender, race, sexuality, class, and disability might then be understood not as things
                  to
                  					be added on to our analysis (or to our metadata) after the fact, after the first
                  principles, but instead as
                  					operating principles of a different order, already coursing through discourse
                  and matter”

               <div class="ptext" id="p5">The second essay, “Assembling Scholarship: From <cite class="title none">Vectors</cite> to <cite class="title none">Scalar</cite>,” offers a fascinating forensic reflection upon how the needs for new forms of
                  				dynamic publication were pursued at the <cite class="title none">Vectors</cite> Lab at USC for over a dozen years, weaving
                  				into that search the development of the multimodal, multivalent <cite class="title none">Scalar</cite> platform. Whereas
                  				some such biographical works might embed the labor committed to this kind of development
                  to footnotes and appendices,
                  				here the memos, emails, schematics, and specification documents are wholly a part
                  of the recounting. That such work
                  				was so carefully archived in the first place is an act of difference; think how
                  often, at the pace with which we
                  				develop our digital projects, we leave our documentation to some later moment
                  when we will have time (we think) to
                  				reflect. McPherson explains the principles that guided <cite class="title none">Vectors</cite>. The founding members were
                  					“committed to work with scholars who were engaging issues of gender, race, affect,
                  memory,
                  					sexuality, nationhood, mediation, space, and social justice”
                  				[<a class="ref" href="#mcpherson2018">McPherson 2018</a>, 146]. Their works were object-driven and dynamic, and were chosen because they
                  				could not be adequately presented in print. The team did this work in ways that
                  required deep collaboration – even
                  				immersion – into each scholar’s work, sometimes for months at a time, driven by
                  an “impulse to
                  					reanimate the archive through narrative and design – to bring a waning form to
                  new life while blurring the line
                  					between form and content, repertoire and archive”
                  				[<a class="ref" href="#mcpherson2018">McPherson 2018</a>, 158]. Such work necessitated making more explicit the intersection of humanistic
                  				and artistic scholarly expression, designing new types of databases that broke
                  with rigid data hierarchies, pushing
                  				back against prevailing metadata schemas that reinforced colonial knowledge graphs,
                  and building middleware and
                  				interfaces that privileged object over text. Description of that process reveals
                  how highly customized and therefore
                  				how fragile the work was, and ultimately how the <cite class="title none">Vectors</cite> group designed the open-source,
                  				open-access <cite class="title none">Scalar</cite> platform to find a balance between specific design needs and

               <div class="ptext" id="p7">It is the “Windows” inserts that reveal the most problematic nature of digital media projects: their
                  				ephemerality, that is rooted in access needs over long periods of time, choices
                  of software applications, and plugins
                  				that are made redundant, and what all of that means for our ability to think about
                  preservation. It is McPherson’s
                  				attempt to describe the work that produces a feeling of unreclaimable distance
                  for the reader. We can read about
                  					Alice Gambill and Raegan Kelly’s intention for “The Stolen Time
                  					Archive,” a project that was meant to transform and capture ephemeral time spent working with
                  archival
                  				documents, but we cannot recapture it. Not only does the book push us away, but
                  Adobe stopped supporting the Flash
                  				plugin in 2020, and so the Flash player-based content can no longer be accessed.
                  Just as McPherson points to the
                  				flattening of these projects in bookish format, she reveals the precarity of this
                  work, and anticipates the reader’s
                  				unease with the warning, “due to technological obsolescence and other factors a number of <cite class="title none">Vectors</cite> Journal projects have become unavailable since their original publication”
                  				[<a class="ref" href="#mcpherson2018">McPherson 2018</a>, 235]. Any scholar who has worked in DH – or who has tried to cite a DH project –
                  				has experienced this kind of anxiety: the 404 error, the puzzle piece icon, the
                  dead link. At a certain point even
                  				the most carefully curated and archived digital work will go missing and scholars
                  who rely on digital forms of
                  				publication and presentation would be well served to consider this eventuality
                  at the beginning of their work.</div>
               			
               <div class="counter"><a href="#p8">8</a></div>
               <div class="ptext" id="p8">But herein lies the poignancy of the book: these projects can only be described as
                  lost referents. There is
                  				currently no way to experience them in the way that they were envisioned and designed.
                  And who would be responsible
                  				for updating the artifacts so that they could be reclaimed? Perhaps that is McPherson’s
                  ultimate gift to us through
                  				this book: to offer a kind of eulogy for all the work now lost.</div>
               			
               <div class="counter"><a href="#p9">9</a></div>
               <div class="ptext" id="p9">There is one problematic aspect of the book which the Press would be wise to redress.
                  Despite extensive endnotes,
                  				references, and credits that rely on (and even are presented to suggest) hyperlinks,
                  there is no e-edition of the
                  				text or even a PDF that would allow the reader to access the sources McPherson
                  consulted as she wrote the book. Such
                  				oversight (unless for some reason the author or Press meant to omit) betrays the
                  kind of privileged gate-keeping that
                  				still dictates how we share our scholarly work.</div>
               			
               <div class="counter"><a href="#p10">10</a></div>
               <div class="ptext" id="p10">Ultimately, McPherson uses the book to carve out a place for critical digital media
                  theory and production. She
                  				models how purposeful analysis and production can be when they are driven by careful
                  attention to collaborative labor
                  				practice. And she challenges us to think about whether we can ever truly publish
                  the totality of our DH research,
                  				even as we strive to find new ways to document our work.</div>
