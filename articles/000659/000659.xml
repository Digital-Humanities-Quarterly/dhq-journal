            <!--Include a brief abstract of the article-->
            <p>The internet has vastly expanded access to Shakespeare resources, as well as the
               range of materials included in the Shakespeare canon. Online Shakespeare resources
               often focus on making Shakespeare more accessible to educators, students, and general
               audiences. Accessibility for people with disabilities, however, is not often
               mentioned. This article argues for making Shakespeare resources radically accessible
               and inclusive by incorporating both Universal Design approaches and Disability
               Studies perspectives. This dual approach emphasizes the importance of accessible
               technologies and the necessity of incorporating Disability Studies theories and
               methods, including contributions of Deaf and disabled artists and scholars and
               critical analyses of cultural representations of disability. While the
               overrepresentation of Shakespeare in digital space is problematic, the massive scope
               of Shakespeare’s online presence provides opportunities for radically transforming,
               or cripping, the digital canon. Cripping the digital Shakespeare canon involves
               centering accessibility, incorporating anti-ableist content, and promoting new
               methods of engaging with Shakespeare and digital spaces. Due to Shakespeare’s
               outsized presence, cripping the digital Shakespeare canon provides a significant
               avenue for advancing the accessibility and inclusivity of digital resources
               generally.</p>

            <head>Introduction</head>
            <p>The internet has vastly expanded access to Shakespeare resources and has led to the
               proliferationofborn-digitalShakespeareana.Shakespeareexistsonlineinarchivalmaterials,
               digital texts, apps, films, recordings of theatrical performances, YouTube videos,
               and other digital media. Shakespeare has enough of a digital presence to justify
               considering online Shakespeare a subset of the Digital Humanities field (Carson and
               Kirwan, 2014, pp. 1–2).</p>
            <p>Articles in<hi rend="italic">DHQ</hi>testify to the innovations of Digital Humanities
               projects focused on Shakespeareandearlymodernstudies(LeeandLee,2017;GiglioandVenecek,
               2009;Mueller, 2014;Jenstad, McLean-Fiander, and McPherson, 2017;Kelley, 2017;Boyd,
               2021). In addition to disseminating established forms of Shakespeare scholarship to
               wider audiences, online modalities allow opportunities for radically new
               interpretations, perspectives, and ways of interacting with Shakespeare to
               emerge.</p>
            <p>Making Shakespearean texts, performances, and scholarship more accessible to wider
               audiences motivates much of the online Shakespeare world. This view of Shakespeare’s
               accessibility often focuses on making materials more engaging, comprehensible, and
               freely available;accessibilityforpeoplewithdisabilities,however,isnotoften
               mentioned.Whilethere has been productive scholarly dialogue between Disability
               Studies and Shakespeare studies (Hobgood and Wood, 2013; Iyengar, 2015; Row-Heyveld,
               2018; Love, 2019; Dunn, 2020; Loftis, 2021; Hobgood, 2021; Schaap Williams, 2021),
               between Digital Humanities and Shakespeare studies (Hirsch and Craig, 2014; Carson
               and Kirwan, 2014; Estill, Jakacki, and</p>
            <p>Ullyot, 2016; Jenstad, Kaethler, and Roberts-Smith, 2018; O’Neill, 2019; Squeo,
               Pennacchia, and Winckler, 2021), and between Disability Studies and Digital
               Humanities (Williams, 2012; Godden and Hsy, 2018; Ellcessor, 2016; Ellcessor, 2018,
               Hamraie, 2018), it is necessary to foster further collaboration across these three
               interdisciplinary fields. Words like “accessible” and “democratized” are often
               applied in discussions of online Shakespeare. However, until the
               worldofonlineShakespearefully includespeoplewithdisabilities,itwillnotbe
               trulyaccessible or democratized. Following Carson and Kirwan, I consider “the
               importance of Shakespeare as a case study to understand the developing nature of the
               digital world” (Carson and Kirwan, 2014, p. 1). In addition to providing a “case
               study,” the world of online Shakespeare can be a site in which interventions are
               implemented and shared to enhance the accessibility and inclusivity of digital worlds
               more broadly.</p>
            <p>Scholars have illustrated the need for more inclusivity in Digital Humanities. The
               #TransformDH movement has drawn attention to how “Questions of race, class, gender,
               sexuality,
               anddisabilityshouldbecentraltodigitalhumanitiesanddigitalmediastudies”(Bailey et al.,
               2016). At the same time, Shakespeare’s outsized presence in Digital Humanities
               projects has been interpreted as a key example of the field’s “canon problem”
               (Estill, 2019). Laura Estill writes: “It has been well-documented that major digital
               literary studies projects often focus on canonical authors. [...] yet comparatively
               few scholars have critiqued how digital humanities overrepresents perhaps the most
               canonical figure in all of English literature: Shakespeare”(Estill, 2019). While the
               overrepresentation of Shakespeare in digital space is problematic, the massive scope
               of Shakespeare’s online presence makes it a useful entry point for critically
               evaluating accessibility and advocating for the accessibility and inclusivity of
               digital resources generally. It is crucial to fund and build Digital Humanities
               projects that focus on marginalized</p>
            <p>authorsandcommunities.Inadditiontosupportingprojectsthatdecenter the canon,itisalso
               useful to critically analyze how the Shakespeare canon is continually reimagined in
               digital environments, and to work toward making this expanding canon as diverse,
               inclusive, and accessible as possible.</p>
            <p>Digitization has already significantly transformed the Shakespeare canon. Douglas M.
               Lanier writes: “The disciplinary field of ‘Shakespeare’ has expanded dramatically in
               recent decades. […] ‘Shakespeare’ now includes performances, translations,
               transmediations, adaptations, appropriations, and even memes, not just in English but
               also in myriad languages from around the world” (Lanier, 2017, p. 293). Digital
               projects, such as the MIT Global Shakespeares Video &amp; Performance Archive,
               highlight the diversity of Shakespearean performanceandcuratean
               ever-expandingcanon(MITGlobalShakespeares).Asdigitalprojects related to Shakespeare
               continue to grow, it is crucial to continually reflect upon who is included in and
               excluded from the digital corpus that comprises “Shakespeare.” Productions of
               Shakespeare’s plays by Deaf and disabled artists and Shakespearean criticism by Deaf
               Studies and Disability Studies scholars1are an integral part of the ever-expanding
               Shakespeare canon; these performances and perspectives can be further highlighted in
               digital projects.</p>
            <p>Since digital Shakespeare resources are widely used pedagogical tools, critical
               reflection upon their accessibility and inclusivity is especially urgent. A
               recentspecialissue in<hi rend="italic">Research in Drama Education</hi>examines the
               “diversity of pedagogical approaches to Shakespeare” borne through Shakespeare’s
               overrepresentation in educational and digital spaces globally (Bell and Borsuk, 2020,
               p. 1). The special issue “aim[s] to illustrate the cultural hegemonies present in
               teaching Shakespeare on a global scale, and how digital technologies potentially
               maintain these hegemonies,orconfrontthem”(BellandBorsuk,2020,p.3).Inasimilarvein,
               thisarticle argues</p>
            <p>that Shakespeare pedagogy and digital technologies can maintain or confront ableism.
               The “canon problem” (Estill, 2019) that Shakespeare’s massive online presence
               encapsulates also presentsanopportunityto“cripthe canon,”
               touseAnnM.Fox’sphrase(Fox,2010).2Universal Design and Disability Studies can be
               employed to crip the digital Shakespeare canon, transforming both Shakespeare studies
               and digital spaces. I argue that cripping the digital

               digital environments that are as accessible as possible and (2) incorporating
               Disability Studies perspectives and disability representation to create anti-ableist
               content. This dual approach emphasizes both the importance of accessible technology
               and the necessity of incorporating Disability Studies theories and methods, including
               highlighting the contributions of Deaf and disabled artists and scholars and
               critically analyzing cultural representations of disability.</p>

            <p>In the following section, I provide an overview of Universal Design, review how it

               and provide an overview of accessibility in Shakespeare studies. Following that, I
               analyze a key example of a digital work that expands the Shakespeare canon. I then
               analyze how YouTube functions as a digital Shakespeare archive with significant
               accessibility failures and discuss how Shakespeare’s overrepresentation in digital
               spaces can be utilized to improve accessibility.</p>

            <p>George H. Williams has called for Digital Humanities projects to incorporate
               Universal Design, which he defines as “the idea that we should always keep the
               largest possible audience in mind as we make design decisions, ensuring that our
               final product serves the needs of those
               withdisabilitiesaswellasthosewithout”(Williams,2012).
               Originallyanarchitecturalconcept, Universal Design was developed by Ronald Mace who
               described it as “designing all products andthebuiltenvironmenttobe aestheticand
               usabletothegreatestextentpossiblebyeveryone, regardless of their age, ability, or
               status in life” (Mace qtd. in Williams, 2012).</p>

            <p>Drawing from feminist and disability theories, Hamraie critically analyzes these
               principles and discusseshowUniversalDesigncanbe“abroadand
               intersectionalsocialjusticemethodthrough</p>
            <p>whichdesignerscanaddressmorecollective,overlapping,andintersectionalexclusionsfromthe
               built environment” (Hamraie, 2013).</p>
            <p>The purported “universality” of Universal Design has been critiqued (Godden and Hsy;
               Hamraie, 2013; Hamraie, 2017). Hamraie writes: “When the content of the universal is
               unspecified,UDcanslipintovaguenotionsof‘all’or‘everyone’thatassumenormateusersand
               de-center disability” (Hamraie, 2013). Hamraie emphasizes the importance of
               intersectional, disability justice-oriented approaches to design and focuses on
               “broad accessibility,” writing: “Broad accessibility serves as a more complex notion
               of inclusion, showing that UD must still center disability access in order to avoid
               lapsing into the normate template” (Hamraie, 2013).</p>
            <p>Richard H. Godden and Jonathan Hsy’s “Universal Design and Its Discontents” is a
               Digital Humanities-focused critique of Universal Design. Godden writes: “Although UD
               arose outofarealsocialandpoliticalresponseto thedisablingaspectsofeveryday
               lifeforPeoplewith Disabilities, I want to suggest that the ‘Universal’ in UD can
               carry with it some unintended and unexpected assumptions aboutnormalcy and our
               physicalorientation to theworld”(Godden and Hsy, 2018, p. 92). Godden argues “we need
               to move forward by balancing the Universalist and utopian aims of UD with a more
               local, attentive approach to individual use” (Godden and Hsy,
               2018,p.100).Hsywrites:“BothUDandDH advocatesofteninvokeanunrealizedandidealized
               conception of collective space (physical or online) in order to challenge dominant
               beliefs and practices and to encourage people to join in a newly reconfigured sense
               of common purpose” (Godden and Hsy, 2018, pp. 101–2).</p>
            <p>AsHamraiearguesinasection entitled “CrippingUniversalDesign,”whiledisabilityis often
               elided in Universal Design discourse, subsumed by an undertheorized concept of</p>

               cultural resonance (Hamraie, 2017, pp. 11–14). Hamraie writes:</p>
            <p>in the early twenty-first century, around the time that Universal Design became a
               predominantlydisability-neutraldiscourse,criticalandcriptheoriesofdisabilityemerged
               to challenge the social model for overemphasizing the environmental construction of

               term “cripple” dating to the 1970s independent living movement, resists imperatives
               for normalization and assimilation. Crip theories contribute that disability is a
               valuable cultural identity, a source of knowledge, and a basis for relationality.

               of discussions of universality and accessibility frequently eliding disability. When
               universality and accessibility are discussed generally, in both Shakespeare studies
               and Digital Humanities discourse, people with disabilities are often left out.

            <p>As Tanya Titchkosky (2011) has shown, the structures and spaces of universities, and
               even bureaucratic attempts to create more “access,” are laden with and constitutive
               of conceptions about who belongs and what disability signifies. The same is true for
               digital spaces, and particularly academic digital spaces. As the physical and the
               virtual spaces of universities and knowledge circulation are increasingly blurred,

               Titchkosky writes: “I am particularly interested in how disability is socially
               produced as</p>
            <p>something that is not yet considered an essential participant in social life. Still,

               Universal Design may be impossible, it is still a useful framework for pursuing
               increased accessibility. While truly

            <p>Similarly, cripping the digital Shakespeare canon entails critiquing, rather than
               reinforcing, Shakespeare’s purported “universality.” In advocating for inclusive
               Shakespeare programs and performances, Sonya Freeman Loftis cautions against “the
               failure of universal design and the way in which universal design may become bound up
               with notions about ‘universal’ Shakespeare” (Loftis, 2021, p. 79). The salience of
               “universality” and “access” in Shakespearestudieshighlightstheneed

               field.</p>
            <p>My argument for cripping the digital Shakespeare canon is founded on Shakespeare’s
               ubiquity, not universality. Considering the size of Shakespeare’s massive presence
               online and how often these resources are used for educational purposes, the world of
               online Shakespeare should be a driving force in advancing Universal Design
               approaches. When Shakespeare resourcesarenotfullyaccessible,peoplewithdisabilities —
               scholarsandnon-scholarsalike — are
               excludedfromexploringandco-creatingthedigitalShakespearecanon.Moreover,incorporating
               Universal Design principles into online Shakespeare resources enhances their
               pedagogical</p>
            <p>potential for a broad range of users. Captions on videos of Shakespearean
               performances make theworkaccessibletoDeaf andhard-of-hearingaudiences,while
               alsoaidingcomprehensionfor hearing audiences. Descriptions of visual images make
               paintings accessible to blind users and can provide significant details to sighted
               audiences as well. While incorporating Universal Design increases accessibility and
               can deepen engagement for a broad range of users, attentiveness to Disability Studies
               theory is necessary to combat the tendency to reproduce notions of “universal” and
               “access” that exclude disability (Hamraie, 2013; Hamraie, 2017; Titchkosky, 2011;
               Godden and Hsy, 2018).</p>

               entails both correcting inaccessible digital forms and confronting ableist
               content.</p>
            <p>Digital humanists can learn from pedagogical and theatrical experiments in cripping
               content and increasing accessibility. In “How to Crip the Undergraduate Classroom:
               Lessons from Performance, Pedagogy, and Possibility,” Fox outlines methods to center
               disability in courses and on campuses (Fox, 2010). In a section entitled “Cripping
               the Canon,” Fox asks:
               “howdowemaketheknowledgeaboutandcreativeworkofdisabledpeople(includingactivists,
               educators, artists, scholars, and thinkers) available to our students within our
               classrooms?” (Fox, 2010, p. 39). She poses the question: “Where could I locate the
               presence of disability into that which I was already teaching?” (Fox, 2010, p. 39).
               These questions can animate not only classrooms, but also the world of online
               Shakespeare and Digital Humanities projects generally. Digital humanists can “locate
               the presence of disability” (Fox, 2010, p. 39) by making accessibility, inclusivity,
               and critical analysis of representations of disability integral parts of their
               projects. Cripping the canon involves not only giving critical attention to
               disability-related content, but also to expanding academic epistemologies; Fox
               writes: “To crip the canon might alsomean
               crippingourrathercanonicalwaysofreading,researching,andotherwise approaching and
               engaging an individual discipline, its core ideas and subject matter, introducing or
               framing them instead with a disability perspective” (Fox, 2010, p. 40). Cripping the
               digital Shakespeare canon requires going beyond making digital materials usable by
               people with disabilities; itentails incorporating critical Disability Studies
               perspectives, increasing disability representation, analyzing how digital materials
               are reinforcing or combatting ableism, and considering whose perspectives are
               represented or omitted. This can be applied to not only to digital Shakespeare</p>
            <p>resources,butalsotodigitalprojectsgenerally. TherangeandvolumeofShakespeareanmaterial
               online makes it a useful site evaluating accessibility and inclusivity, developing

               center of the English literary canon — transforms our understanding not only of
               Shakespeare’s poems and plays, but also of literary studies and digital environments
               more broadly.</p>
            <p>Sonya Freeman Loftis’s recent book,<hi rend="italic">Shakespeare and Disability
                  Studies</hi>, makes a compellingcasefor“CrippingShakespeareStudies”(Loftis,2021,
               p.15).Loftisanalyzeshow Shakespeare’s canonicity and ubiquity have promoted a focus
               on accessibility, writing:</p>
            <p>Over thepasttwenty years, Shakespearetheatres havebeen particularly innovativein the
               area of accessibility. This is, in part, because modern Shakespearians have always
               been driven by the need for access. Shakespeare has a central place in the
               curriculum, and
               makingShakespeareaccessibletostudentshaslongbeenagoalinthemodernclassroom. […] four
               hundred years have already reduced the accessibility of the source text for lay
               reader and audiences. Indeed, popular culture often depicts Shakespeare as inherently
               difficult to understand. Shakespeare has become the classic symbol of that which is
               highbrow, and teachers and directors are charged with making his work accessible for
               everyone — from popular audiences to reluctant high schoolers. This means that
               Shakespearians are in a natural position to consider disability access; it makes
               sense that Shakespeare theatres would approach disability as just one more point of
               potential inaccessibility. (Loftis, 2021, p. 12)</p>
            <p>As Loftis has shown, a commitment to making Shakespeare accessible has led to
               Shakespeare
               theatersbecomingleadersininclusiveperformance.Loftiswrites:“itisnaturalthatanemphasis</p>
            <p>on general accessibility would lead to increased disability awareness — in the wake
               of the disability rights movement and in light of the growing neurodiversity
               movement, the endeavour to create ‘access for all’ must include those with physical
               and mental disabilities” (Loftis, 2021, p. 53). People working on online Shakespeare
               projects, and indeed, digital humanists generally, should have the same goal of
               becoming leaders in accessibility. Access is not only a key term in
               Shakespearestudies,itisalsoacentralconceptinDigitalHumanitiesdiscourse.
               Ellcessorwrites: “Digital tools and services are routinely lauded for their ability
               to increase<hi rend="italic">access</hi>to texts, resources, educational experiences,
               and new forms of pedagogy. Yet, merely making material available is insufficient to
               promote genuine access” (Ellcessor, 2018, p. 108).3</p>
            <p>In discussing inventive approaches to accessibility by Shakespeare’s Globe, the Royal
               Shakespeare Company, and the Oregon Shakespeare Festival, Loftis writes: “Access can
               be artistic — itcanbeanintegralpartoftheperformanceexperience,shaping
               theinterpretationboth of the show and Shakespeare’s text” (Loftis, 2021, p. 12). The
               same spirit of accessibility as innovation can be foregrounded in digital Shakespeare
               projects, and in Digital Humanities projects generally. Loftis writes: “an
               understanding of disability theory is essential for scholars, teachers, and directors
               of Shakespeare. Statistics suggest that as many as one out of four people could
               potentially be considered as disabled. Since providing quality accommodations and
               pedagogical materials for users with disabilities requires a basic understanding of
               disability theory, teachers and directors of Shakespeare who wish to reach general
               audiences have a good reason to engage with disability studies” (Loftis, 2021, p.
               10). Similarly, it is essential that creators ofdigitalShakespeareresources —
               andindeed,alldigitalresources — have anawareness of Disability Studies. As Loftis
               notes, incorporating disability theory entails valuing the knowledge that comes from
               lived experience, and thus including people with disabilities in</p>
            <p>projects’ leadership positions (Loftis, 2021, p. 11). In her review of inclusive
               Shakespeare
               theaters,Loftisnotesthat“accessibilityisalwaysaworkinprogress,neverastaticendgoalthat
               can be achieved” (Loftis, 2021, p. 66). Working toward making performances as
               accessible as possible requires ongoing collaboration with people with disabilities
               and a commitment to welcoming audience members with disabilities into the theater,
               which often begins by highlighting access through the theater’s website (Loftis,
               2021, pp. 70–72). Jill Marie Bradbury (2022) provides a critical account of
               theatrical performances of Shakespeare that include ASL, written from her perspective
               as a deaf audience member. Bradbury writes: “I argue that hearing directors who work
               with deaf actors and ASL have an ethical responsibility to be inclusive of deaf
               audiences. This can be accomplished by centering deaf perspectives and experiences
               both onstage and in front-of-house practices” (Bradbury, 2022, p. 45).</p>
            <p>What would it mean to truly welcome Deaf and disabled people into the world of online
               Shakespeare?HowcouldthedigitalShakespearecanonbemoreaccessibleandinclusive?I have
               been arguing that this process includes incorporating Universal Design to increase
               the accessibility of digital content and incorporating Disability Studies
               perspectives to confront ableism in both form and content. In the next section, I
               will analyze a digital work that expands the Shakespeare canon through Universal
               Design and Deaf studies perspectives.</p>

            <p>Digit(al) Shakespeares brings Deaf studies perspectives to bear on both disability
               studies and digital humanities. Deaf studies focuses on what the experience of
               deafness enables, rather than disables. Justas wecan reconceptualizehearing loss as
               deaf gain, so we can reframe Shakespeare’s works as being at heart visual rather than
               auditory. This can lead to a richer experience of Shakespeare for everyone,
               regardless of hearing status. Throughout the video, clips illustrate the
               powerofsignlanguagetoconveytheBard’svirtuosityincreatingimagesthrough words. New
               media and technology allow Deaf people to share translations and performances of

            <p>Giordano and Bradbury’s project highlights the potential of combining Digital
               Humanities and Deaf Studies approaches. Hsy analyzes how Giordano and Bradbury’s
               project “deftly exploits themanifoldvalence ofthe‘digit’ in its pluralized title<hi
                  rend="italic">Digit(al)Shakespeares</hi>” (Godden and Hsy, p. 107). Viewing
               Shakespeare from a visual perspective fundamentally transforms the Shakespeare canon
               and opens up new modes of engagement that utilize possibilities
               thatdigitalenvironments provide. Miako Rankin explains:“So much has happened in the
               last 15 years, with smartphones, touchpad technology, video-to-video interaction,
               Deaf people are interacting and communicating with one another more than ever before”
               (Giordano and Bradbury, 2015, 06:33-06:48). As Jill Bradbury discusses, this
               technology has a significant impactonDeafapproachestoShakespeare: “Digital technology

               DeafpeopletheworldovertoexperienceShakespeare’spoetryandcreatefilmsand translations
               to share so others might enjoy that work” (Giordano and Bradbury, 2015,
               06:48-07:00).</p>
            <p>Bradbury continues: “It is paramount that we collect those films and experiences,
               essentially forming adigitalarchivefor us, notonly to preserve this work for
               futuregenerations, butalso to createaspacewheredeaf

               07:16-07:34). Ethan Sinnott explains the enormous potential of digital archives:
               “Allthisbecomesa library, onethattheDeafcommunitycanaccessregardlessoftheir
               background: whether their interests lie in theatre, education, English, or if they
               are interested in improving bilingual ASL-English access” (Giordano and Bradbury,

               “the first bilingual and bicultural website on Shakespeare on the internet” (Novak,
               2008, p. 74). The ASL Shakespeare Project, like Giordano and Bradbury’s<hi

            <head>TheInaccessibleShakespeareArchiveonYouTube</head>
            <p>The world of online Shakespeare includes spaces that encourage productive exchange
               between humanities scholars and the broader public. This traffic is not one-way:
               while scholars can reach wider audiences online, scholars and students routinely use
               online content created by
               non-academics.TheShakespearecanoniscurated,adapted,andexpanded inthesedigitalspaces.
               For the evolving Shakespeare canon to be inclusive, these sites of exchange and
               engagement must be fully accessible.</p>
            <p>YouTube is a key platform on which this exchange occurs. Christy Desmet refers to
               YouTube as “what for the past decade has been one of the most popular, most
               prevalent, and most innovative sources for teaching Shakespearean drama” (Desmet,
               2016, p. 223). Indeed, YouTube has transformed Shakespeare performance studies, as
               John Lavagnino writes: “YouTube was not founded for the purpose of transforming the
               study of Shakespeare in performance by providing a vastly larger range of material to
               see than had ever been available before, but that was one of its effects. In this as
               in other areas of study, digital approaches
               becameprominentbecausetheyhadvastnumbersofpeopleoutsidetheacademybehind them”
               (Lavagnino, 2014, p. 21). YouTube users are producing a seemingly-democratized</p>
            <p>Shakespearean archive, as Stephen O’Neill describes: “the small screens of YouTube
               grant access to an accidental archive of Shakespeareana, to user-generated
               Shakespeares and to such genres as the video mashup (combining one or more audio
               tracks with moving images, sometimeswithironiceffect),thevlog(or
               videodiary)andthefan-mademovietrailer”(O’Neill, 2014, pp. 2–3).</p>
            <p>YouTube’s seemingly-democratized Shakespeare archive, however, is failing miserably
               when it comes to accessibility. Many Shakespeare videos do not have captions or use
               automatically generated captions that are grossly inaccurate when attempting to
               capture Shakespeare’s verse.4It is crucial that these videos are captioned
               accurately, especially since theyareoftenusedaseducationalresources.
               Accuratecaptionsareboth anessentialaccessibility feature and an aid to all users’
               comprehension of Shakespearean language.</p>
            <p>Williams has surveyed ways in which the accessibility of Digital Humanities projects
               could be improved and offered suggestions, including crowdsourcing the captioning and
               transcriptionsofvideocontent(Williams,2012).
               Shakespeare’stextsarefreelyavailableinOpen Access digital formats,5which can aid the
               captioning of Shakespeare videos. Crowdsourcing the captioning and transcriptions of
               digital Shakespeare videos could make use of the abundance of Shakespeare material
               online to significantly improve accessibility. This is an example of how
               Shakespeare’s overrepresentation in digital spaces (in both text and video) can be
               utilized to improve accessibility and model best practices for digital archives.</p>
            <p>YouTube’s community captions feature had the potential to be used to crowdsource
               captions in this way and radically improve the accessibility of the digital
               Shakespeare archive, yet this feature was discontinued on September 28, 2020 (Lyons,
               2020). Deaf YouTuber and advocateforcaptionsRikkiPoynterhasdiscussedtheimportanceof
               thisfeatureinDeaf,hardof</p>
            <p>hearing, and disability communities and critiqued YouTube’s failure to promote the
               feature, make it accessible on mobile devices, or improve the feature rather than
               dismantling it (Poynter, 2020). While more YouTube users are now submitting their own
               captions due to increased awareness (O’Dell, 2021), much more remains to be done.
               Especially since YouTube has been
               transformativeinShakespearestudies,itisimperativethatShakespeareans
               raiseawarenessabout accurately captioning the Shakespeare performance archive on
               YouTube. Doing so will not only improve the accessibility of the ever-growing
               Shakespeare canon, but will also increase awareness about the importance of
               captioning videos generally.</p>
            <p>Inaddition tocaptions,audiodescriptionsareneededtomake theShakespearearchiveon
               YouTube accessible. Hamraie (2018) writes: “Miele’s crowdsourcing technology,
               YouDescribe.org, enlists sighted people to audio-describe YouTube videos, creating a
               database of integrated narrative tracks, providing information not included in
               YouTube’s automatictextual captions” (Hamraie, 2018, p. 476). At the time of this
               writing, two audio-describedvideos were available when “Shakespeare” was searched
                  on<hi rend="italic">YouDescribe</hi>. Especially since Shakespeare videos on
               YouTube are often used as educational resources, crowdsourcing audio descriptions for
               more Shakespeare content would be a valuable digital accessibility project.</p>
            <p>In addition to improving the accessibility of YouTube materials, it is important to
               critically analyze how disability is represented and performed in YouTube content.
               Ayanna Thompson has demonstrated that YouTube’s “large and complex archive of
               classroom-inspired Shakespeare performances” provides “a window onto production and
               reception that highlights uncomfortable aspects of the texts […] specifically, the
               dynamics of race and gender” (Thompson,2010,p.338).Scholarshave
               criticallyanalyzedrepresentationsofrace,gender,and sexualityinYouTubers’Shakespeare

            <p>Victoria Van Hyning (2019) has discussed how crowdsourcing can increase the

               motivate volunteers to participate in significant crowdsourcing projects, such as the
               transcription of non-Shakespearean materials produced during Shakespeare’s era.
               Building upon this, it is crucial to ensure that ever-growing online

               crowdsourcing model to create and allow for a multiplicity of and successive
               generations of ASL translations of Shakespeare’s plays to exist” (Giordano, 2013, p.
               viii). Giordano writes:</p>
            <p>The increasing digitization of Shakespeare, and the market for localization of

               images and videos of plays in performance, to be enjoyed as they are, or to be
               reinterpreted by creative artists and users of social media, not just by an academic
               audience. (Morris, 2014, p. 180)</p>
            <p>Shakespeare’s immenseaudiencehighlights boththe “canonproblem” (Estill,2019)andthe
               urgency of creating a more accessible and inclusive digital Shakespeare canon.

            <p>Disability Studies and other cultural studies approaches to Shakespeare must reach
               beyond academic subfields to general readers who engage with Shakespeare’s texts and
               to the
               actors,artists,andeducatorswhomediateandre-createthesetextsforfuturegenerations.Online
               environments are ideal for this type of outreach. Alan Liu (2012) has argued that
               advocating for thehumanities can beakey contribution of the Digital Humanities field.
               Hewrites:“Thedigital humanities […] can create, adapt, and disseminate new tools and
               methods for reestablishing communication between the humanities and the public” (Liu,
               2012). Liu calls for digital
               humaniststo“moveseamlesslybetweentextanalysisandculturalanalysis”;hewrites:“Trulyto
               partner with the mainstream humanities, digital humanists now need to incorporate
               cultural criticismin away thatshows leadership in thehumanities”(Liu, 2012).
               Incorporating Universal Design approaches and Disability Studies awareness in Digital
               Humanities projects can create truly accessible and inclusive resources and further
               projects’ public humanities impact.</p>
            <p>GoddenandHsy(2018)havediscussedhow UniversalDesignwasnotintendedtobe limited to
               adding accessibility features; it is far more radical. As Hsy puts it:</p>
            <p>I wonder if a general discursive tendency to conflate UD with narrower discourses of
               “accessibility” risks enacting the reverse of what UD initially envisions. Rather

            <p>Notes</p>
            <list rend="numbered">
               <item>For a discussion of intersections and tensions between Deaf Studies and
                  Disability Studies, see (Burch and Kafer, 2010). I follow the convention of
                  capitalizing Deaf, which “distinguish[es]<hi rend="italic">deaf</hi>(signifying
                     anauditorycondition)from<hi rend="italic">Deaf</hi>(signifying acoherentculture
                  based on shared language, identity, and history)” (Burch and Kafer, 2010, p. xxi).
                  Bradbury (2022) has critiqued distinctions between Deaf and deaf that align the
                  former with using ASL and the latter with not using ASL, writing: “As someone who
                  grew up oral (speaking and using assistive listening devices) but is now fluent in
                  ASL and immersed in the deaf community professionally and personally, I find this
                  nomenclature reductive and exclusionary in its oppositional binaries” (Bradbury,
                  2022, pp. 49–50).</item>
               <item>Fox explains the useof “crip” as areclaimed termthat expresses pride, and as
                  averb that has been used, like “queer,” to deconstruct binaries, writing: “‘to
                  queer’ or ‘to crip’ the knownistotwistourexpectationsofit,defamiliarize
                  it,andrenderitanewinwaysthatopenup

                  establish queer and crip identities as that againstwhich, respectively, ‘norms’ of
                  sexuality and ability can be defined” (Fox, 2010, p. 39).</item>
