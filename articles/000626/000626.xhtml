                  <p>Jason De León’s Undocumented Migration Project and Valeria Luiselli’s <cite class="title italic">Lost Children Archive</cite> are two archival studies of the
                     U.S.-Mexico border crisis that challenge hegemonic practices of documentation,
                     including those historically privileged by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security,
                     human rights activism, and the field of digital humanities alike. Though De León and
                     Luiselli have participated in human rights work while identifying migrant corpses
                     and
                     collecting detainees’ testimonies, both use counter-mapping to interrogate the
                     dominant humanitarian move of restoring visibility and voice, or sight and sound,
                     to
                     human victims. After investigating the ways in which De León and Luiselli privilege
                     visual and sonic counter-mapping, respectively, I model a more multi-sensory
                     counter-mapping practice. Though this practice remains far from perfect, I argue that
                     such digital counter-mapping crosses sight and sound in ways that defy historical
                     divisions among humans and nonhumans. Accordingly, it decenters humans as the sole
                     victims of the U.S.-Mexico border crisis.</p>

                  <div class="counter"><a href="#p1">1</a></div>
                  <div class="ptext" id="p1">The field of digital humanities defines itself by a capacity for interrogating and
                     innovating the traditional humanities. More than a mere transference from material
                     to
                     analog to digital, this field claims to function as a “subversive force” with its own
                     creations and challenges [<a class="ref" href="#hayles2012">Hayles 2012</a>]. Distinguishing digital humanities as not better
                     or worse, but different, from its predecessor, N. Katherine Hayles states that such
                     “differences can leverage traditional assumptions so they become visible and hence
                     available for rethinking” [<a class="ref" href="#hayles2012">Hayles 2012</a>]. Yet, this very assertion demonstrates one of
                     the field’s central challenges, for Hayles here replicates an age-old assumption that
                     something must first “become visible” for it then to be “available for rethinking.”
                     Multiple digital humanities scholars have acknowledged the field’s difficulty in defying
                     such visual hegemony or, stated otherwise, interrogating and innovating vision as
                     itself
                     historically dominant. </div>
                  
                  <div class="counter"><a href="#p2">2</a></div>
                  <div class="ptext" id="p2">Observing that “the digital humanities is today overwhelmingly visual,” Sari Altschuler
                     and David Weimer claim this imbalance to “have inadvertently exacerbated a tendency to
                     privilege sight as the sense through which knowledge is accessible” [<a class="ref" href="#altschuler2020">Altschuler 2020</a>].
                     Such privileging largely results from the Scientific Revolution and subsequent Age
                     of
                     Enlightenment. With the development of seeing and printing technologies in the 15th
                     and
                     16th centuries, visual mapping and charting assumed central roles in understanding
                     the
                     world on small and large scales. In <cite class="title italic">Hypercities: Thick Mapping in the
                        Digital Humanities</cite>, Todd Samuel Presner, David Shepard, Yoh Kawano note such
                     mapping to have been critically involved in the establishment and expansion of European
                     nation-states, including colonial conquest [<a class="ref" href="#presner2014">Presner 2014</a>]. Yet while mapping never has
                     been, and never will be, a neutral representation of knowledge, many scholars celebrate
                     the shift to digital mapping as a potentially more multi-sensory and malleable practice.
                     </div>
                  
                  <div class="counter"><a href="#p3">3</a></div>
                  <div class="ptext" id="p3">According to Clancy Wilmott, digital mapping has upended “the assumption that ‘the map’
                     is a static representational object” [<a class="ref" href="#cooper2016">Cooper 2016</a>]. More than artifactual maps made with
                     permanent ink and parchment, “the map” now commonly functions less as an object and more
                     as a dynamic, interactive process. Such functionality is inevitably transformational,
                     if
                     not exactly subversive, prompting the skeptical attention of humanities and digital
                     humanities scholars alike. In <cite class="title italic">Literary Mapping in the Digital
                        Age</cite>, David Cooper, Christopher Donaldson, and Patricia Murrieta-Flores emphasize
                     the need to evaluate “how the process of digital mapping and map-making alters the way
                     we perceive and engage with the geographies that surround us” [<a class="ref" href="#cooper2016">Cooper 2016</a>]. Such
                     evaluation interrogates what digital mapping reveals, conceals, and remains unable
                     to
                     convey, perhaps facilitating “new spatial practices and spatial imaginings.” </div>
                  
                  <div class="counter"><a href="#p4">4</a></div>
                  <div class="ptext" id="p4">In this article, I engage debates on critical cartography with particular attention
                     to
                     how digital mapping influences humans’ understandings of landscape, as well as
                     themselves. Specifically, I investigate the subversive potential of digital mapping
                     the
                     Sonoran Desert in the context of an ongoing U.S.-Mexico border crisis, where hegemonic
                     practices of seeing, knowing, and surveilling continue to shore up colonization and
                     its
                     violent legacy. As U.S. border militarization implicates, and intentionally disappears,
                     multitudes of humans and nonhumans each year, questions of mapping preoccupy government
                     agencies, international corporations, on-the-ground activists, and interdisciplinary
                     scholars alike. In what follows, I join multiple humanities and digital humanities
                     scholars in thinking about the possibility of mapping the unmappable, including that
                     which remains invisible by design. Additionally, I ask, “How might such counter-mapping
                     facilitate a rethinking of the U.S.-Mexico border crisis, beyond anthropocentrism?” </div>
                  
                  <div class="counter"><a href="#p5">5</a></div>
                  <div class="ptext" id="p5">To address these questions, I first provide historical and theoretical background
                     on the
                     necessity, as well as difficulty, of mapping and counter-mapping this region. Next,
                     I
                     analyze two well-known examples of counter-mapping, namely Jason De León’s Undocumented
                     Migration Project and Valeria Luiselli’s <cite class="title italic">Lost Children Archive</cite>.
                     After investigating the ways in which De León and Luiselli privilege visual and sonic
                     counter-mapping, respectively, I model a more multi-sensory counter-mapping practice.
                     Though this practice remains far from perfect, I argue that such digital counter-mapping
                     crosses sight and sound in ways that challenge historical divisions among humans and
                     nonhumans. Accordingly, it decenters humans as the sole, and most important, victims
                     of
                     the U.S.-Mexico border crisis.</div>

                  <div class="ptext" id="p6">I focus on the Arizona-Sonora region of the U.S.-Mexico border: home to Apache, Hopi,
                     Maricopa, Mayo, Pima, Navajo, Yaqui, Hohokam, and Tohono O’odham peoples, as well
                     as
                     exceptionally biodiverse mountain regions known as sky islands.<a class="noteRef" href="#d4e246">[1]</a> Throughout the arrival of Spanish missionaries in the early 18th
                     century, the Mexican-American War (1846-47), the Gadsden Purchase (1854), and the
                     Apache
                     Wars (1849-1924), indigenous and colonial settler populations violently negotiated
                     and
                     renegotiated control of these borderlands. After the annexation of U.S. territories
                     including Texas, New Mexico, Arizona, and Southern California from Mexico in the
                     mid-1800s, migration northward was incentivized or illegalized depending on the U.S.’
                     political and economic need.<a class="noteRef" href="#d4e253">[2]</a> Still,
                     enforcement remained relatively lax until the “Border Patrol Strategic Plan of 1994 and
                     Beyond,” which heightened the militarization of the border through increasingly brutal
                     uses of land and surveillance technology. Since its implementation, such policy has
                     resulted in 7,000 to 8,000 migrants dying while crossing Southern Arizona [<a class="ref" href="#colibri2020">Colibrí 2020</a>]<a class="noteRef" href="#d4e258">[3]</a>. By design, many of these deaths remain
                     unidentifiable, if not altogether invisible. In turn, mapping practices in this area
                     now
                     indicate not just who wins the war and owns the land, but what life remains in this

                     data on drone technology, scope stations, and ArcGIS live monitoring software. Knowledge
                     of this largely invisible surveillance system exposes border wall-building as mere
                     spectacle, for DHS policy is not designed to prevent migration per se, but rather
                     to
                     ensure its profitability. Instead of stopping migrants from crossing at all, for
                     example, Prevention Through Deterrence intentionally pushes migrants out into the
                     remote
                     and dangerous desert, where they are more likely to die or, alternatively, to be
                     apprehended, detained, and eventually deported. On its website, however, DHS
                     misrepresents itself as benign, wall-building protector, and the Sonoran Desert as
                     brutal murderer.</div>

                  <div class="ptext" id="p10">Given the high stakes of mapping in this and other areas of conflict, scholars and
                     activists have employed varied practices of counter-mapping. Coined by sociologist
                     Nancy
                     Peluso, the term “counter-mapping” refers to processes in which communities appropriate
                     and repurpose institutional techniques of map-making in order to create alternatives
                     to
                     hegemonic representations [<a class="ref" href="#peluso1995">Peluso 1995</a>]. Anthropologist Jason De León, who has studied
                     migration and violence in Southern Arizona since 2009, draws on fellow migration scholar
                     Martina Tazzioli’s elaboration of counter-mapping as having two specific purposes
                     of 1)
                     making visible the effects of authority and 2) challenging the very possibility of
                     mapping these effects [<a class="ref" href="#tazzioli2015">Tazzioli 2015</a>]. This definition is notable for exhibiting a
                     tension similar to that of digital humanities insofar as it simultaneously relies
                     on and
                     resists “making visible” as a principal source of knowledge.</div>

                  <div class="ptext" id="p11">Like Hayles, Tazzioli here implies that she intends to rethink the very concepts to
                     which she appeals, including visibility and mapping. Noting the humanities and digital
                     humanities’ dominant reliance on visual and textual methods, multiple scholars have
                     recently turned to sound and listening as part of a heretofore neglected epistemology.
                     For example, Mary Caton Lingold, Darren Mueller, and Whitney Trettien, editors of
                     <cite class="title italic">Digital Sound Studies</cite>, wonder what forms of knowledge and embodied
                     experience are going unheard in the digital turn [<a class="ref" href="#lingold2018">Lingold 2018</a>]. Turning to sound as an
                     under-utilized mode of study within digital humanities, this collection challenges
                     not
                     just the hierarchization of senses, but also their very separation. Since this
                     separation emerged over time, as part of Enlightenment thinking, sound studies scholars
                     such as Jonathan Sterne and Michael J. Kramer claim we can use the “flexible modularity”
                     of digital data to both understand and reverse this history [<a class="ref" href="#lingold2018">Lingold 2018</a>].</div>

                     undoing this separation of senses can also challenge the historical division of
                     nation-states and species. For while much discussion of counter-mapping emphasizes
                     the
                     visualization of space, and even De León claims his work to “foster alternative forms of
                     understanding, visualizing, and producing <em class="emph">space</em>,” I read his work
                     as especially important for the ways in which it sets up a rethinking of the Sonoran
                     Desert as a space of invisible and indiscriminate violence. In <cite class="title italic">Lost
                        Children Archive</cite>, a novel that also studies migration and disappearance in
                     Southern Arizona, Valeria Luiselli furthers such rethinking by privileging sound as
                     a
                     mode of knowledge with counter-mapping capabilities. Reading these scholars’ work
                     together exposes the stakes of counter-mapping to be not simply a rethinking of sight
                     and sound as they relate to space, but also as they relate to the humans <em class="emph">and</em> nonhumans traversing such space. In other words, the stakes
                     are ways of witnessing the U.S.-Mexico border crisis that decenter visuality and

                     specifically, these books are about the many thousands of migrants that have attempted
                     to cross this dangerous landscape, especially since the Department of Homeland

                     aforementioned “Border Patrol Strategic Plan of 1994 and Beyond.” Entailing heightened
                     militarization and surveillance in urban sections of the border such as San Diego,
                     California and Nogales, Arizona, this policy intentionally pushes traveling migrants
                     into rural areas that increase their chances of turning themselves in, getting lost,
                     or
                     dying. Since the early 2000s, the Pima County Office of the Medical Examiner has
                     reported doing upwards of 150 autopsies on undocumented border corpses annually
                     [<a class="ref" href="#continued2013">Continued 2013</a>]. Furthermore, Dr. Gregory Hess, Pima County’s current Chief Medical
                     Examiner, estimates that these self-disclosed numbers likely represent just 1/3 of
                     actual migrant deaths in this area [<a class="ref" href="#hess2019">Hess 2019</a>].</div>

                     desert’s intense heat, strong wind, and flash floods quickly decompose and disperse
                     migrant bodies, making finding and identifying them still difficult. De León, both
                     an
                     archaeologist and anthropologist by training, started the <a href="https://www.undocumentedmigrationproject.org/" onclick="window.open('https://www.undocumentedmigrationproject.org/'); return false" class="ref">Undocumented Migration

                     experiences, of undocumented border crossing [<a class="ref" href="#deleon2015">De León 2015</a>]. Using ethnographic,
                     archaeological, forensic, and visual anthropological methods to collect evidence of
                     such
                     crossing, De León distinguishes his interdisciplinary work as taking “sideways glances”
                     that “foster new ways of thinking about border crossings and the routinized pain and
                     suffering that accompany them” (<a href="#deleon2015">17</a>). These sideways glances, a concept originally
                     proposed by Slavoj Žižek in Violence: Six Sideways Reflections, entail zooming out
                     beyond a mere focus on the human subjects of violence in order to think more broadly
                     and
                     critically about the structural causes of such violence [<a class="ref" href="#deleon2015">De León 2015</a>]. For De León,
                     this means witnessing what remains otherwise overlooked, including the socioeconomic
                     factors that cause migrants to leave their homelands, as well as those that have made
                     their journey increasingly dangerous.</div>

                     narrating and counter-mapping in ways that put pressure on hegemonic forms of

                     sometimes also those of fellow human rights activists. Acknowledging the graphic nature
                     of his work, for example, De León recounts instances in which critics have claimed
                     his
                     photos of decayed migrant corpses to rob their subjects of human dignity. His refusal
                     to
                     instead make migrant bodies visible as whole and uninjured is striking for its refusal
                     to rehumanize such victims, as many human rights archives and organizations profess
                     to
                     do.<a class="noteRef" href="#d4e388">[5]</a> In his words, “The deaths that migrants experience in the Sonoran

                     the point” [<a class="ref" href="#deleon2015">De León 2015</a>, emphasis added]. For De León, such dehumanization, both in
                     life and in death, is the precise point of policies including Prevention Through
                     Deterrence. Identifying such decomposition as a form of structural, postmortem violence,
                     he elaborates that the seeming “natural” processes of dying and decaying in the desert
                     are actually “political facts representative of the value placed on the lives and deaths
                     of undocumented people” [<a class="ref" href="#deleon2015">De León 2015</a>]. </div>

                     Enlightenment-based practices of seeing, knowing, and valorizing the human. For while
                     De
                     León does privilege visual and material evidence, he also stubbornly casts his glance
                     askew of the very subjectivity, or indeed humanity, associated with such epistemology.
                     This move corresponds with Elizabeth Anker’s critique of how Enlightenment-based notions
                     of the human body and mind still inform dominant notions of humanitarianism and human
                     rights activism. As she observes, these discourses predicate human dignity on corporeal
                     integrity; for an individual to be a human worthy of rights, they must first have
                     a body
                     that is “whole, autonomous, and self-enclosed” [<a class="ref" href="#anker2012">Anker 2012</a>]. This is because, according
                     to Enlightenment-based liberalism, only this type of body meets related ideals, such
                     as
                     reason, conscience, and freedom. Yet Anker points out that this idealized human body
                     and
                     subject is paradoxically “decorporealized,” for it negates core dimensions of embodied
                     experience, including “vulnerability” and “decay” [<a class="ref" href="#anker2012">Anker 2012</a>]. </div>

                  <div class="ptext" id="p17">When De León foregrounds migrants’ partially decayed corpses as “<cite class="title italic">anything</cite> but dignified,” he likewise acknowledges and critiques hegemonic
                     standards of human rights subjectivity. Making visible a commonly overlooked reality,
                     his photos are graphic reminders of the human body’s limits: the very limits that
                     leave
                     it susceptible to both violence <em class="emph">and</em> ignorance. If bodies are not
                     whole, they also cannot see whole pictures, or know whole stories. Yet, denying these
                     limits in the name of human dignity is one way humans separate themselves as physically
                     and mentally superior to other animals [<a class="ref" href="#anker2012">Anker 2012</a>]. In this sense, De León’s images
                     challenge visuality and anthropocentrism simultaneously, serving his noted interest
                     in
                     “troubling human-nonhuman binaries” [<a class="ref" href="#deleon2015">De León 2015</a>]. Furthermore, they help show how
                     “structural agency” both commits and conceals violence in the U.S.-Mexico borderlands. </div>

                  <div class="ptext" id="p18">According to De León’s counter-mapping research with the Undocumented Migration Project,
                     such structural agency involves the dehumanization of humans, as well as the
                     humanization, or “denaturalization,” of nonhumans such as the Arizona desert. Prevention
                     Through Deterrence, which is just one policy, for example, involves human,
                     technological, geographical, animal, mineral, and meteorological actants. Drawing
                     on
                     Michel Callon and John Law’s theory of “hybrid collectif,” which identifies agency as a
                     property that emerges from the interaction of various heterogeneous actants, De León
                     refers to this combination of human and nonhuman agents involved in the U.S.-Mexico
                     border crisis as the “Sonoran Desert hybrid collectif.” To fully account for this
                     collectif, De León stresses the need to abandon dualist thinking, including that which
                     relies on simplistic human-nonhuman binaries. On one hand, he wants to expose how
                     the
                     U.S. Department of Homeland Security “can draw on the agency of animals and other
                     nonhumans to do its dirty work while simultaneously absolving itself of any blame
                     connected to migrant injuries or loss of life” [<a class="ref" href="#deleon2015">De León 2015</a>]. Yet, on the other hand,
                     he is careful of falling back into an anthropocentrism that myopically frames humans
                     as
                     the only perpetrators, as well as victims, involved in this complex crime scene.</div>

                     humans’ victimization and the desert’s weaponization simultaneously [<a class="ref" href="#gokee2020">Gokee 2020</a>].</div>

                  <div class="ptext" id="p25">When counter-mapping, De León is forthright about the “seemingly paradoxical attempt to
                     use spatial data and spatial analysis to critique and undermine spatial data and spatial
                     analysis” [<a class="ref" href="#deleon2016">De León 2016</a>]. While DHS employs private mapping and analytics software, such
                     as Esri’s ArcGIS, De León draws from the Arizona OpenGIS Initiative for Deceased
                     Migrants map, which uses open source software to make data readily available. Yet,
                     this
                     information on migrants’ deaths could simultaneously serve as valuable data on the
                     efficacy of border enforcement, and how to strengthen it. Given this possibility,
                     De
                     León elsewhere notes a resistance to publishing such data and touches on a central
                     debate in digital humanities about the possibility of dismantling the master’s house
                     with the master’s tools [<a class="ref" href="#deleon2016">De León 2016</a>]. Analyzing the risks of using GIS software that
                     produces data, as well as money, for ethically dubious companies, Safiya Noble advises
                     the public to stay vigilant of how such software further entrenches them in the very
                     systems they may be critiquing [<a class="ref" href="#noble2011">Noble 2011</a>]. Since Noble also notes how these same GIS
                     technologies often help improve communities, she urges critical yet creative
                     applications. Yet, I contend that part of De León’s conundrum is his maps’ reliance
                     on
                     not just the same GIS tools, but also the same visual media and human categories,
                     that
                     are readily recognizable to DHS.</div>

                  <div class="ptext" id="p26">For this reason, I am most interested in where and how De León also repurposes the
                     master’s tools beyond the point of easy recognition. Though he views his counter-maps
                     as
                     able to let the suffering of migrants “speak,” he claims “they also contain their own
                     silences and elisions” [<a class="ref" href="#gokee2020">Gokee 2020</a>]. Here, De León notably switches from framing his
                     work as predominantly visual to also vocal in order to point out how it is only
                     partially revelatory. Yet, he elaborates on his maps’ incapacity to represent everything
                     in every way as “critical to countering the scalar projects, including maps, that
                     obscure decades of migrant suffering at the hands of PTD [Prevention Through Deterrence]
                     policies along the US- Mexico border” [<a class="ref" href="#gokee2020">Gokee 2020</a>]. In this sense, such silences are
                     part of his maps’ functionality, not flaws. In fact, they also “speak,” as they further
                     expose the ways in which migrants have been intentionally disappeared, both in life
                     and
                     death.</div>

                  <div class="ptext" id="p27">At the same time, such silences remain absolute insofar as they represent absence:
                     the
                     absence of a body, testimony, identifiable human subject. Throughout the humanities
                     and
                     digital humanities, multiple scholars continue to grapple with how to account for
                     such
                     absence, which is endemic to archives about systemic violence and erasure. Thinking
                     specifically about the archive of American slavery, Lauren Klein notes how the silences
                     of slaves expose a “true” archive that “encompasses impossibility,” including the
                     impossibility of knowing [<a class="ref" href="#klein2013">Klein 2013</a>]. Against Enlightenment-based epistemological
                     biases that elevate “what is observable to the status of fact,” Klein values the archive
                     as a tool for exposing the limits of our knowledge, limits that even digital methods
                     such as data visualization fail to surpass [<a class="ref" href="#klein2013">Klein 2013</a>]. In failing, however, they force
                     us to think about other ways of seeing and knowing, such as speaking and listening.
                     While De León’s work briefly mentions these possibilities, I now turn to Valeria
                     Luiselli’s <cite class="title italic">Lost Children Archive</cite> as a counter-mapping model that
                     instead privileges the auditory. Such an approach, I argue, enables her to further
                     challenge epistemological biases and human/nonhuman binaries. </div>

                     to “the southern borderlands,” the book becomes about her process of trying to connect
                     multiple ideas, images, voices, and lack thereof into a new project. </div>

                     specific type of interdisciplinary archive: a sound map. Encouraging interdisciplinarity
                     and experimentation within archival studies, Marlene Marnoff claims that “thinking
                     through making” is key to finding new ways of “interrogating archival silence”

                     as
                     she continually tries to chart the sounds and spaces that both envelop and elude her.
                     Lacking a visual and digital interface, such counter-mapping requires readers to
                     likewise navigate the Sonoran Desert through her ears, a methodology that often

                     Yet, Luiselli cues a reading of this map as also inevitably exclusionary and, in this
                     sense, complicit with invisibility. Noting how maps can “make visible what is usually
                     unseen,” the mother-protagonist nevertheless concludes that “To map is to include as
                     much as to exclude” <span class="error"><a class="ref" href="#luiselli2019">#luiselli2019</a></span>. More than associate excluded remains with
                     invisibility, however, she connects them specifically to sound. A section of the book
                     titled “Undocumented,” for example, begins with the epigraph, “An exile feels that the
                     state of exile is a constant, special sensitivity to sound” <span class="error"><a class="ref" href="#luiselli2019">#luiselli2019</a></span>. In the
                     context of the U.S.-Mexico border crisis, “undocumented” thus takes on multiple
                     meanings, including unmapped, unseen, and yet still potentially audible.</div>

                     yet
                     multiple artists, activists, and scholars have likewise observed this area’s sonic
                     dimensions to be uniquely boundless. In an analysis of how composer Guillermo Galindo
                     turns objects found along the U.S.-Mexico border, including the border wall itself,
                     into
                     musical instruments, culture and music scholar Josh Kun observes sound to be more
                     permeable than sight. Noting how we can readily hear the border’s other side, even
                     without full vision, Kun states, “What walls and fences are meant to divide, sounds can
                     move through and resonate across. What looks monumental to the eye sounds unmonumental
                     to the ear. There are no borders for vibrations” [<a class="ref" href="#misrach2016">Misrach 2016</a>]. Here, Kun touches on
                     the material <em class="emph">and</em> immaterial nature of sound, for such vibrations
                     only become audible, even amplified, through the very objects they contact. This makes
                     containing sound very difficult, as even ostensible silence often involves resonant
                     vibrations. In auditory encounter, something usually escapes, perceived or unperceived.
                     Given this unmonumental medium and sense’s historic subordination to sight as form
                     of
                     knowledge, however, such sound often fails to adequately capture human ears, let alone

                  <div class="ptext" id="p34">For this reason, multiple humanities and digital humanities scholars frame listening
                     as
                     an acquired, not default, sense. As Jonathan Sterne explains, listening is a technique
                     that connotes practice, virtuosity, and the possibility of failure and accident […] It
                     is a learned skill [<a class="ref" href="#sterne2003">Sterne 2003</a>]. For the mother-protagonist in <cite class="title italic">Lost
                        Children Archive</cite>, listening evolves from simply hearing sound, namely that of
                     migrants’ oral testimonies, to sonically counter-mapping a landscape of unbounded
                     phenomena. During a moment of revelation, she realizes that both her and her husband’s
                     research projects entail “chasing ghosts and echoes” <span class="error"><a class="ref" href="#luiselli2019">#luiselli2019</a></span>. Her husband’s
                     ghosts and echoes are those of the last Apache leaders, including Chief Cochise,
                     Geronimo, and the Chiricahuas. As the final indigenous Americans to surrender to
                     settler-colonists and their Indian Removal Act, which forced remaining tribes onto
                     federal reservations, these people were exiled from their own homeland just like many
                     migrant refugees and deportees. The mother-protagonist draws this parallel most closely
                     as she watches a plane of child refugees head back to their ostensible homeland, yet
                     only by departing from the land of their probable ancestors, as well as current family
                     (<a href="luiselli2019" onclick="window.open('luiselli2019'); return false" class="ref">191</a>). Because migrant and indigenous populations have been effectively disappeared, one
                     through “removal” and another through “deportation,” both the mother-protagonist and her
                     husband necessarily take a spectral approach to sound.</div>

                  <div class="ptext" id="p35">According to Ana María Ochoa Gautier, the “spectrality of sound” refers to that which
                     remains inaudible, at least to humans, as “excesses of the acoustic” [<a class="ref" href="#steingo2019">Steingo 2019</a>].
                     Another sense in which sound is boundless, for example, involves the fact that it
                     reverberates well beyond human hearing, including in acoustic <em class="emph">and</em>
                     ultrasonic forms. If a bat chirps or cactus falls in the Sonoran Desert and no human
                     hears it, it still does make a sound. Furthermore, that sound may interact with and
                     turn
                     into other sounds, commonly called echoes. In <cite class="title italic">Lost Children
                        Archive</cite>, both the husband and wife appeal to echoes as a trope for spectral
                     listening to that which they both can and cannot hear. However, only the wife practices
                     such listening as a dynamic and disorienting mode of counter-mapping. For her, such
                     counter-mapping entails contextualizing sounds, as well as related ideas, against
                     hegemonic maps of time, space, and subjects as singular and absolute. </div>

                     sound as self-evident affords him a rather literal definition of echoes. An
                     “acoustemologist” trained in “soundscaping,” the husband follows the work of R. Murray
                     Schafer and shares his interest in acoustic ecology as “the study of sounds in
                     relationship to life and society” [<a class="ref" href="#schafer1977">Schafer 1977</a>]. For Schafer, as well as <cite class="title italic">Lost Children Archive</cite>’s husband, the bulk of this study entails
                     recording, naming, and cataloging sounds in an effort to capture, and thereby
                     understand, “the general acoustic environment of a society” [<a class="ref" href="#schafer1977">Schafer 1977</a>]. While most
                     sound scholars recognize Schafer as pivotal in establishing sound as another way of
                     knowing, they also criticize his presumptuous appeal to “the general,” or universal, as
                     neglectful of sound’s multivalent, and highly contextual, meanings [<a class="ref" href="#novak2015">Novak 2015</a>].<a class="noteRef" href="#d4e716">[7]</a> Similarly, the wife assesses her husband’s work as crudely

                     heard in the present are, inevitably and indubitably, reverberations of sound waves
                     from
                     foregone times and peoples. Given the mother-protagonist’s attention to uncertainty
                     and
                     exclusion, however, she interprets his inventory of echoes as “<em class="emph">trying</em> to capture their [the Apaches’] past presence in the world, and making

                     of

                     echo temporarily “illuminate[s] an area of a map, a soundscape, in which Geronimo once
                     was” <span class="error"><a class="ref" href="#luiselli2019">#luiselli2019</a></span>. Here, the wife crosses sight and sound in conceptualizing an
                     illuminative echo, one that appears and disappears simultaneously. Using the spectrality
                     of sound to trace the spectrality of removed populations makes sense to this
                     cartographer, especially as she refuses to organize her own recorded material into
                     a
                     “clean narrative sequence” <span class="error"><a class="ref" href="#luiselli2019">#luiselli2019</a></span>. As she states, “We haven’t understood how

                     evaluation, archivists such as her husband often fail to acknowledge the way all
                     hearing, including all recording, is contextual: that is, it takes place in a particular
                     time and space, neither of which are entirely singular or absolute. Situating all
                     recording as a type of echo, Mark M. Smith similarly emphasizes the need to think
                     of
                     both as simultaneously historical and ahistorical. Rather than capture sounds from
                     the
                     past exactly as they were, recordings and echoes reproduce sounds from the past in
                     the
                     present, inevitably altering them [<a class="ref" href="#novak2015">Novak 2015</a>]. For the wife in <cite class="title italic">Lost

                     and,

                     other
                     historical instances of disappearance. Hearing spectral sounds of the Apache, missing
                     border crossers, and surrounding desert landscape all at once, she observes “the chaos
                     of history repeated, over and over, reenacted, reinterpreted, the world, its fucked-up
                     heart palpitating underneath us [...] And in the middle of it all, tribes, families,

                     description is highly reminiscent of philosopher Walter Benjamin’s “Angel of History,”
                     which recognizes the past, present, and future as “one single catastrophe” in constant
                     risk of oblivion, especially under the pressure of “what we call progress” [<a class="ref" href="#benjamin2007">Benjamin 2007</a>]. Like this angel, and more critically than her husband, Luiselli’s
                     mother-protagonist thus hears bird chirps, arroyo babbles, snake rattles, wind gusts,
                     etc. as “reenactments” and “reinterpretations” of loss: the loss, yes, of child migrants
                     but also the indigenous populations that preceded them and likewise endangered wildlife

                     through her insistent use of “perhaps.” In doing so, she shows the practice of “aural
                     literacy,” or interdisciplinary listening without knowing, to function as a viable mode
                     of counter-mapping against categorical understandings of time, space, and subject.</div>

                        the violence that policies such as Prevention Through Deterrence attempt to conceal,
                        neither of them replicate this map’s digital interface or related humanitarian

                        in
                        life or death, De León and Luiselli take more reflexive approaches to witnessing.
                        Questioning their own use of sight and sound while consulting visual, material, and
                        sonic evidence, these scholars practice “sideways” seeing and spectral listening, both
                        of which serve to witness the complexity of this U.S.-Mexico border crisis. Such
                        complexity, as De León and Luiselli illustrate, is largely due to the involvement
                        of
                        human and nonhuman, as well as present and absent, agents. Since this border violence
                        also implicates settler colonialism and imperialism, as well as the hegemony of
                        visuality and human rights politics, it requires multiple, novel ways of knowing,

                        multi-sensory counter-mapping helps readers and listeners further disorient themselves
                        and, in the process, also the Sonoran Desert as a land that has been so forcefully
                        oriented around the human, both as aggressor and as victim. Rather than centralize
                        the
                        human in witnessing the U.S.-Mexico border crisis, is it possible to listen from the

                        and

                        counter-mapping the U.S.-Mexico border crisis as both a humanitarian crisis and a
                        crisis
                        of humanitarianism, or the centering and privileging of human victimhood. To be clear,

                        senses — a bodily retraining that can help listeners learn to become more open to

                        practice of listening that involves thinking critically about the experience of sound,
                        which she understands to be a “contextual […] sonic event” [<a class="ref" href="#ceraso2018">Ceraso 2018</a>]. While
                        “multimodal” implies that there are discrete modes of knowing and being, for example,

                        learned. </div>

                     <div class="ptext" id="p46">In turn, her practices of multimodal listening and digital sound mapping involve
                        attending to the ways senses interact with, and even subvert, each other in creating
                        an
                        embodied experience of place. More than simply “listen” with their ears, Ceraso’s
                        students record the time of day and weather conditions of their audio recordings;
                        look
                        for visual and tactile proof of sonic vibrations; write textual descriptions of
                        fieldwork experiences; and reflect on the limits of a digital interface such as
                        Soundcities [<a class="ref" href="#ceraso2018">Ceraso 2018</a>]. By crossing multiple senses while collecting data, students
                        gradually recognize such sensory knowledge as both contextual and partial. At stake,
                        therefore, in this “reeducation of our senses” is not just a newfound attunement to the
                        complex connections among humans’ own sensory modes, but also among those modes and
                        surrounding “environments” and “materials.” Such attunement, according to Ceraso,
                        challenges visual approaches to knowing, “ear-centric” approaches to listening, and, in
                        my evaluation, also anthropocentric approaches to the humanities, including related
                        humanitarian concerns [<a class="ref" href="#ceraso2018">Ceraso 2018</a>]. </div>

                        mentioned throughout this article and my own fieldwork in Southern Arizona, I have
                        created a digital counter-map that decenters humans as the sole victims of the
                        U.S.-Mexico border crisis. In this ArcGIS project, accessible <a href="https://arcg.is/41PDy" onclick="window.open('https://arcg.is/41PDy'); return false" class="ref">here</a> and represented in Figure 5, I combine
                        sonic, visual, and literary evidence, sometimes together, at the same geotag, and
                        sometimes apart. Such evidence, or proof of existence, includes descriptions of deceased
                        migrants’ “body condition,” audio recordings of animals, photos of desert landscapes,
                        outlines of endangered species ranges and border walls, and excerpts from multiple

                        species and senses, privileging humans and their vision simultaneously. In contrast,
                        my
                        practice crosses species and senses alike, showing all to be in relation, and also

                        while
                        co-leading a university trip to Southern Arizona called <em class="emph">Conocimiento</em>, or “awareness.” To expose students to the complexities of the
                        U.S.-Mexico border crisis, this trip included meetings with various on-the-ground
                        actors, including border residents, patrol agents, activists, and unauthorized day
                        laborers. Depending on the actors’ differing interests, they referenced maps
                        foregrounding border wall construction, military checkpoints, humanitarian aid stations,
                        or, most commonly, the discovery of human remains. Throughout this trip, we saw at
                        least
                        three versions of Humane Borders’ “Map of Migrant Mortality,” which De León and Luiselli
                        both reference in their work. Because my students had not read these authors’ depictions
                        of the Sonoran Desert hybrid collectif, I feared that their perception of this landscape
                        would be reduced to the hostile, even criminal, terrain that policies like Prevention
                        Through Deterrence situate it as. It was during this trip, therefore, that I began
                        brainstorming ways to map this landscape differently.</div>

                     <div class="ptext" id="p50">Like Ceraso, I wanted to put my students into a collaborative, even conversational,
                        interaction with their surroundings. What did they hear as they took photos of
                        Normandy-style vehicle barriers, Cottonwood trees, and a horizon often dotted with
                        at
                        least one memorial cross? How might this hearing change if they simultaneously recalled
                        Luiselli’s onomatopoeic depiction of desert dust-clouds appearing and disappearing
                        as
                        “Shrrrrrr, sssssssss, hsssssss, sss, hhhhh,” or Jason De León’s graphic description of a
                        mummified migrant corpse with a face “replaced by a stone-colored ghoul stuck in
                        mid-scream”? And what if they could digitally return to this location months later to
                        hear the nocturnal chirp of a Whippoorwill that escaped their notice while they were
                        previously there in person? To begin investigating these questions, I consulted the
                        Institute for Digital Arts and Humanities (IDAH) at Indiana University Bloomington
                        about
                        multimedia map tools. A group of faculty, graduate students, and staff who specialize
                        in
                        digital methods, IDAH recommended Esri’s ArcGIS Online and ArcGIS Survey 123 for their
                        institutional availability and ease of use.<a class="noteRef" href="#d4e1003">[11]</a>

                     <div class="counter"><a href="#p51">51</a></div>
                     <div class="ptext" id="p51">Yet, while Esri is the industry standard for commercial Geographic Information Systems
                        (GIS) software, its open partnerships with numerous private and public agencies,
                        including the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, initially give me pause. As the
                        software that connects DHS’ vast system of remote sensors, lookout towers, drones,
                        and
                        other agent-carried GPS technologies, ArcGIS both facilitates and maximizes security
                        enforcement along the U.S.-Mexico border [<a class="ref" href="#deleon2016">De León 2016</a>]. Yet, these very same
                        technologies can likewise map and critique the systemic violence of such enforcement.
                        Like De León, I thus began experimenting with co-opting “the master’s tools” by
                        uploading various online resources into a map titled “Counter-mapping the U.S.-Mexico
                        Border Crisis.” </div>

                     <div class="ptext" id="p52">The first resource was the open source data from the Arizona OpenGIS Initiative for
                        Deceased Migrants, from which I selected “unidentified” remains and created color-coded
                        survey points based on the “body condition” upon discovery. Such anonymity, along with
                        conditions that range from “fully fleshed” to “skeletonizaton w/ mummification” to
                        “complete skeletonization w/ bone degradation,” emphasize the postmortem dehumanization
                        of these human corpses. Especially in death, migrant bodies become indistinguishable
                        from the landscape that both witnesses and facilitates their gradual decomposition.
                        To
                        further challenge human-nonhuman binaries, I next searched online for digital sounds
                        and
                        images representing the natural environment implicated in the U.S.-Mexico border crisis.
                        This search yielded multiple relevant materials, including those from Sky Island
                        Alliance’s Border Wildlife Study, Charles Bogert’s <cite class="title italic">Sounds of the
                           American Southwest</cite>, The Western Soundscape Archive, and The Acoustic Ecology Lab

                        an essential part of producing my counter-map was field photography and sound recording.
                        When initially conceptualizing this project, I was set to lead additional <cite class="title italic">Conocimiento</cite> trips and planned on including those students in
                        on-the-ground data collection using the aforementioned ArcGIS Survey 123. The COVID-19
                        pandemic cancelled those plans, yet I was able to make multiple solo visits to Southern
                        Arizona in 2020, including to Chiricahua National Monument in early March, Organ Pipe
                        Cactus National Monument in late March, and the Huachuca Mountains in late September.
                        Each of these places has a history of forced displacement, including the Apache Wars
                        taking place around Chiricahua National Monument and ongoing border militarization
                        happening throughout Organ Pipe Cactus National Monument and the Huachuca Mountains.
                        I
                        visited Organ Pipe Cactus National Monument as the Trump administration expedited
                        border
                        wall construction along its southern edge, destroying local flora, animal habitat,
                        and
                        Tohono O’odham sacred sites in the process. Similar construction eventually reached
                        the
                        Huachuca Mountains in 2021, after I had already visited the area. </div>

                        With
                        the continued support of IDAH, I was able to borrow their Sony IC recorder for short
                        audio samples. While relatively basic, and prone to picking up wind sounds, this
                        recorder still captures the spectrality that interests me most about soundscapes.
                        Like
                        the mother-protagonist in Luiselli’s <cite class="title italic">Lost Children Archive</cite>, I
                        listened for presence and absence, appearance and disappearance. And unlike the U.S.
                        Department of Homeland Security, I did not map such listening with the purpose of
                        definitively locating, tracking, or identifying anything. Instead, I aimed to use
                        digital data and GIS software to record a multi-sensory experience of a landscape
                        that
                        humans cannot readily understand. For this reason, I recorded sonic environments that
                        spontaneously intrigued me. There was never any recording schedule or inventory, though
                        I did keep track of the date, time, and location of each recording. I did this because
                        I
                        would like to eventually return to these same places and listen for changes in the

                        interminable practice of witnessing human bodies, as well as human-made maps, as in
                        dynamic relation with environments that both includes and exceeds them. Against
                        simplistic representations of the Sonoran Desert as hostile terrain rife with
                        humanitarian crisis, “Counter-mapping the U.S.-Mexico Border Crisis” thus situates this
                        landscape as endangered, biodiverse, and complex beyond absolute comprehension. While
                        my
                        ArcGIS map is still informative, especially to those who have not visited Southern
                        Arizona in person, its multiple layers orient and disorient viewers simultaneously.
                        Firstly, the diversity and quantity of information is overwhelming, as this digital
                        map
                        includes images, sounds, textual excerpts, animal ranges and migratory routes, border
                        wall models, and hundreds of data points marking unidentified migrant remains. Secondly,
                        many geotags include multiple types of media, thereby facilitating “sideways glances” in
                        which map visitors think critically about this landscape, its history, and their sensory
                        relationship to it all.</div>

The point of this map, however, is not to train the expert ear, or even

                        cannot witness in the Arizona desert: a landscape layered with historical, political,

                        or
                        voice and visibility, of human victims is insufficient to addressing the U.S.-Mexico
                        border crisis. Rather than replace one mode of witnessing with another, however, this
                        map models and facilitates a multi-modal, interdisciplinary interrogation of witnessing.

                        exhaustive answers, this digital counter-map invites participants into the ongoing
                        question of hearing what the Sonoran Desert hears, as assassin, witness, and victim.
                        Such inquiry is both orienting and disorienting, as it prompts viewers to engage the
                        sensory and epistemological limits inherent to humanhood. Engaging these limits,
                        however, also draws witnesses into closer, more attentive connection with the nonhuman
                        ecosystems that both envelop and elude them. </div>

                        what the desert hears, yet asking it reminds them that such unknowns are also in crisis,
                        and also worth protecting. As the Prevention Through Deterrence policy and other border
                        militarization efforts remain in full effect, it is especially important to remember
                        that the U.S.-Mexico border crisis necessitates epistemological and social, not just
                        political, paradigm shifts. Indeed, it requires a decentering of visuality and
                        anthropocentrism simultaneously, wherein witnesses recognize humanitarian and ecological
                        issues as interrelated. As I have shown, this counter-mapping project contributes
                        to
                        such decentering by offering a practice of crossing the senses, leaning into
                        disorientation, and collapsing human-nonhuman binaries. This practice is difficult
