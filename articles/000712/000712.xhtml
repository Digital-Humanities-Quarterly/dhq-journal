                  <p>This study examines the potential of using Augmented Reality to increase urban participation
                     to deal with identified problems in Maputo city, Mozambique, southern Africa. The
                     study’s aim is twofold; first, it seeks to add to the nascent literature on Augmented
                     Reality (AR) in Africa; second, to experiment with AR for public participation in
                     urban Maputo to explore the affordances of AR and examine the possibility and limitations
                     of deploying the technology for such purposes. The study concludes that AR can enhance
                     public participation and engagement with public spaces in Maputo city. However, technical
                     and economic limitations must be considered when designing projects to deploy AR technologies
                     in the city.</p>

                     in urban planning, development, and management to grapple with the severe challenges
                     they face [<a class="ref" href="#elinoff2014">Elinoff 2014</a>]; [<a class="ref" href="#un_habitat2019">UN-Habitat 2019</a>]. That movement results from the neoliberalisation process that seeks to bring the
                     private, and civil society sectors and citizens into urban governance. In that movement,
                     different actors defend the idea that technology can further improve urban governance
                     and, important to this study, public participation. One such technology that has been
                     employed to open-up urban spaces for public engagement is augmented reality (henceforth,
                     AR). This study constitutes an exploratory approach to examining the potential of
                     using AR to increase urban participation and address identified problems in Maputo
                     city, Mozambique, southern Africa. The study seeks to contribute to burgeoning scholarship
                     that focuses on how technologies could enhance public participation and improve urban
                     governance and service delivery with the material from the global south. Specifically,
                     the study intervenes in the scholarship that has taken the name of AR graffiti and
                     AR Activism and examines how AR could be used to engage in politics around urban spaces,
                     urban citizenry, urban arts, and other domains [<a class="ref" href="#geroimenko2014">Geroimenko 2014</a>]; [<a class="ref" href="#gwilt2022">Gwilt and Wilde 2022</a>]; [<a class="ref" href="#kondlo2020">Kondlo et al. 2020</a>].

                  <div class="ptext" id="p2">AR is a recent technology that is part of mixed reality (XR) technologies. Mixed Realities
                     technologies include Augmented Virtuality, Virtual Reality and Reduced Reality [<a class="ref" href="#kwok2021">Kwok and Koh 2021</a>]; [<a class="ref" href="#milgram1994">Milgram and Kishino 1994</a>]. Those designations have to do with how technologies intervene in the real-world
                     and situate the user in the continuum between the virtual and the real-world. Jonathan
                     Linowes and Krystian Babilinski define AR as “a technology and, more importantly, a new medium whose purpose is to improve human
                     experiences, whether they be directed tasks, learning, communication, or entertainment” [<a class="ref" href="#linowes2017">Linowes and Babinlinski 2017</a>, 10]. According to Ronald Azuma, AR systems present the following features: “Combines real and virtual; Interactive in real-time; and registered in three dimensions
                     (3-D)” [<a class="ref" href="#azuma1997">Azuma 1997</a>, 2]. AR does so by relaying computer-generated graphs in the real-world using a smartphone
                     or tablet.

                  <div class="ptext" id="p3">Seeking to explore the affordances of AR, this study looks at AR as more than a technological
                     apparatus that enables the relaying of computer graphics on real-world. Instead, the
                     study frames AR as a form of intervention in the real-world and the perception of
                     the user — in other words, AR creates new phenomenological experiences on the users
                     while also intervening in the real-world [<a class="ref" href="#chevalier2020">Chevalier and Kiefer 2020</a>]; [<a class="ref" href="#gwilt2022">Gwilt and Wilde 2022</a>]. This approach is inspired by AR artist Thiel Tamiko (see [<a class="ref" href="#thiel2017">Thiel et al. 2017</a>])  and the scholarly work of Vladmir Geroimenko [<a class="ref" href="#geroimenko2014">Geroimenko 2014</a>]. Following that approach, then AR is best conceptualized as “real-time computationally mediated perception” [<a class="ref" href="#chevalier2020">Chevalier and Kiefer 2020</a>].

                     in contexts like Mozambique, a Portuguese-speaking country characterised by digital,

                     city’s histories and present predicaments is crucial as a way of contextualizing the
                     affordances that AR can provide — enhancing public participation. Maputo city was
                     constructed during the colonial period by the Portuguese colonial settlers<a class="noteRef" href="#d3e246">[1]</a>. It was elevated to a city on 10 November 1887. It was then constructed for the white
                     settlers. Most black people were moved to the periphery of the city that constitutes
                     today’s shanty areas. That racial and spatial segregation is best captured by what
                     locals called the city: they referred to the city as <em class="term">xilunguine</em>, meaning the land of the whites. Mozambique became independent in 1975, after an
                     armed struggle<a class="noteRef" href="#d3e255">[2]</a>. However, the colonial debris (racial and spatial segregation policies) still shapes
                     the city’s current life. Those colonial legacies intersect with today’s challenges
                     including over-population, overburdened urban infrastructures, poor solid waste management
                     service, climate change impacts, and related to this work, a sense of gaping divide
                     between the government and the citizens. In the survey circulated among fifty-seven
                     residents of the city as part of this project most respondents mentioned that the
                     divide between the municipality and them as being one of their main concerns. The
                     responses also highlighted that solid waste management was one of the most pressing
                     issues in the city that, according to them, negatively affected their quality of life
                     and perception of the city.

                     the issue of solid waste management in the city. The study does so by creating an
                     AR art object called the Trash Snail that the study participants could deploy in the
                     city to make the issues of solid waste management visible using their mobile devices.

                     the surveys and design of the AR experience Trash Snail are explained. Section four
                     is the analysis and results section that examines the responses of the survey participants
                     and shows how the issue of solid waste management is foregrounded in their responses.
                     By drawing on AR arts practices, the study examines the experiments of deploying the
                     Trash Snail App on urban Maputo to make the issue of solid waste management visible.
                     Finally, the discussion and conclusion identifies the main findings of the experiments

                     and Virtual Reality on the African continent. The choice of focusing on both technologies
                     and limiting the geographical emphasis to Africa has to do with the fact that while
                     both technologies are burgeoning in the global north, few studies and projects exist
                     exploring them in the global south. While Virtual Reality presupposes a total immersion
                     of the user into a virtual environment using Gadgets or glasses, AR enhances the user’s
                     reality [<a class="ref" href="#milgram1994">Milgram and Kishino 1994</a>]. This review seeks to foreground the potential of the AR technology as a catalyst

                     scholars and practitioners have proposed using AR to enhance the tourism experience
                     and deal with the existing shortages in the sector. For example, Aphile Kondlo and
                     colleagues observed the need for more tourist guides in the Cape Flats Nature Reserve,
                     situated in the Western Cape, South Africa. The Reserve provides guided tours only
                     once a day. The authors argue that that shortage could be mitigated using AR self-guided
                     tours. That would mean that more self-guided tours could happen and, in the process,
                     generate more income for the reserve [<a class="ref" href="#kondlo2020">Kondlo et al. 2020</a>].

                     the learning experience in the country. Similar exploratory works of AR and VR in
                     education were done in South Africa [<a class="ref" href="#abdul-razak2020">Abdul-Razak 2020</a>]. Also, the University of Witwatersrand in Johannesburg, South Africa, has started
                     a pilot study of VR to teach students in STEM disciplines that they expect to replicate
                     in other schools and universities in the country. However, much like with the explorations
                     in Uganda and South Africa described above not much known about those projects in
                     the present, which limits the understanding of their long-term impacts in the locales

                        to set up funding for AR and VR interventions in the continent. For example, Africa
                        No Filter (ANF) and Meta have recently established a program named “Future Africa: telling Stories, Building Worlds” that aims to increase the use of VR in Africa. The program grants African storytellers
                        up to USD30000 to produce digital media stories (visit <a href="https://africanofilter.org/future-africa-telling-stories-building-worlds" onclick="window.open('https://africanofilter.org/future-africa-telling-stories-building-worlds'); return false" class="ref">https://africanofilter.org/future-africa-telling-stories-building-worlds</a>).

                        Meta organised a continent-wide Hackathon for VR and AR in Africa, bringing enthusiasts
                        and field specialists to explore the continent's technologies. Those embryonic experiments
                        show that VR and AR have a place in the continent and can play a role in solving the

                        by solid waste on the ground. That waste on the ground could be because the municipality
                        only emptied the overflowing containers and did not clean the waste, or urban dwellers
                        did not put the waste into the waste containers. Judging by this photo, it was hard
                        to immediately find “who was to blame” for the current condition in the locale and other similar conditions in the city.
                        As some of the respondents mentioned, the municipality had to do a better job managing
                        solid waste, but the residents also needed to be educated (“sensibilizar”) on how to use public spaces and deal with solid waste.

                        general treatment of solid waste or lack thereof. The study participants also found
                        similar situations in other locales, which will later be described in the analysis
                        and results chapter. Then, animations were added to the Trash Snail that resembled
                        the movements of a snail to give the impression of a living creature — living waste.
                        The gruesome movements served as entry points to showcasing how solid waste was itself
                        a matter with social life, despite it been portrayed as a “matter out of place” that elicits urban dwellers’ and municipality’s responses to get rid of it [<a class="ref" href="#douglas1966">Douglas 1996</a>]. Even though it moved the trash snail never left the locale. It is a though it was
                        stuck in a place. That quality of being stuck represents the respondents’ feelings
                        of solid waste not being properly moved out of the public spaces and lingering in
                        their urban spaces.

                     toward male perspectives about public spaces. Regarding age, 12 respondents were 18-29,
                     and 45 were in the age range of 30-59, meaning that young and adult perspectives were
                     mostly gathered in this study, leaving outside older adults and children. This high
                     number of young participants might be the effect of children and older adults' limited

                     resided in Maxaquene, a peri-urban neighborhood where the author of this study was
                     born. The prevalence of respondents from Maxaquene is likely connected to the fact
                     that the questionnaire was shared via this study’s author’s social media handles with
                     “friends,” some of whom the author lived and grew up with.  Only five respondents were from
                     the city centre, namely Alto Make (2), Bairro Central (1), and Coop (2), which means
                     52 respondents lived outside of Maputo city but had engaged with public spaces in

                        incapability to keep public spaces clean and stop city dwellers’ from littering them.
                        Hence, they stated the need for “raising the urban dwellers’ awareness” (in Portuguese “sensibilizar”) about keeping public spaces clean.

                        Also, they should sensibilise the residents and teach them not to litter.” Using the respondents’ opinions about the main challenges the city faced, the study

                     <div class="ptext" id="p47">The participants were all male, aged between 18 and 29, and all lived in the same
                        neighborhood in Maputo called Malanga. Two of them were students, and the other was
                        unemployed. They all learned about AR after the study. The study participants used
                        the app on the 7th of April 2022. It was a public holiday in Mozambique. The participants
                        were instructed to take a screenshot of waste that was not properly managed and then
                        add the specific name and date after taking the screenshot and sharing a pre-written
                        message with me, saying, “Lixo que precisa ser retirado” [waste that needs to be removed].

                     <div class="ptext" id="p48">One fascinating aspect of the results of such screenshots was that the participants
                        chose to start from their neighborhood, which is a place they knew best. They knew
                        they were very likely to find waste — in this case, in Malanga. That observation highlights
                        the major concerns raised by the study participants about their perception of public
                        spaces. In the first survey, participants reported waste and insecurity as the major
                        problems around public spaces in Maputo (see Figure 1).

                     transformation on different domains [<a class="ref" href="#geroimenko2014">Geroimenko 2014</a>]; [<a class="ref" href="#kondlo2020">Kondlo et al. 2020</a>]; [<a class="ref" href="#thiel2017">Thiel et al. 2017</a>].

                     note that one of the main issues that they faced was the poor management of solid
                     waste that according to them resulted in their experienced negative perception of
                     the city as well as the gaping divide between them and the municipality. To provide
                     an outlet in which the participants could engage in showcasing their concerns, this
                     study created the Trash Snail following the work of AR artists and scholars. That
                     construction was inspired by the fact that AR was “real-time computationally mediated perception” [<a class="ref" href="#chevalier2020">Chevalier and Kiefer 2020</a>]. In other words, it intervened both in the user and the public space by intermediating
                     their interaction.

                     AR has the potential to enhance public participation in urban Maputo. The study participants’
                     engagement with the Augmented Reality showed that Maputo residents live with waste
                     in public spaces. Much like The World Bank reported, some of that waste is “not managed in an environmentally [and socially] safe manner” [<a class="ref" href="#kaza2018">Kaza et al. 2018</a>, 3]. More importantly, it showed that AR could mobilise public participation in urban
                     Maputo city despite the many technical and economic challenges that such an endeavor
                     entails. Using Vuforia Engine to build the AR app required more recent mobile phones
                     (android 7 onwards) to support the application, which in turn limited the number of
                     participants because most used older mobile phone versions.

                     that it was useful to make them think about solid waste in Maputo. Moreover, the screenshots
                     generated could easily be shared on social media. Their sentiment connected to Geroimenko’s
                     idea that “AR is ideal as a social tool to generate conversations in and around the community.
                     It is often experienced in public space at the site of a problem, creating an opportunity
                     to engage people in conversation. AR can create experiences that make people laugh,
                     cry, or think deeply” [<a class="ref" href="#geroimenko2014">Geroimenko 2014</a>, 8]. This was also the case with the use of AR in education in which students reported
                     that they felt that their learning experience was more fun and engaging [<a class="ref" href="#misso2019">Misso et al. 2019</a>]. Those findings are consistent with the ones in other contexts beyond Africa that
                     also suggest how AR has improved classroom experiences and learning process [<a class="ref" href="#chen2017">Chen et al. 2017</a>].</div>

                  <div class="ptext" id="p63">Speaking about the possibility of AR enabling conversations beyond the immediate physical
                     space, after posting one of the screenshots on a personal Facebook story, one of my
                     Facebook “friends” asked me, “how did I know about the waste left in containers in public spaces?” He then stated, “it doesn’t matter how; the waste has to be removed whatever it takes.” The story had 141 views. The Trash Snail made those interactions possible. And more
                     than individual experiences, those interactions could be shared with other people
                     across space and time using new and traditional media [<a class="ref" href="#geroimenko2014">Geroimenko 2014</a>]. This experience connects to Ian Gwilt’s words, when he stated that AR enables us
                     “to switch between a personal and shared experience of an artwork or urban space and
                     to experience both digital and analogue versions of the same environment” [<a class="ref" href="#gwilt2022">Gwilt and Wilde 2022</a>, 227].

                  <div class="counter"><a href="#p64">64</a></div>
                  <div class="ptext" id="p64">The application has a screenshot and sharing button that enables the participants
                     to share their experiences. The screenshots depicted empty and full waste containers
                     surrounded by waste and urine on the ground, mostly close to municipal markets and
                     non-residential and poorly unlit areas. The urine on the ground reflected that those
                     public spaces in Maputo lacked public toilets, a situation that respondents to the
                     residents’ opinions on Maputo public spaces survey also reported.
                     </div>
                  
                  <div class="counter"><a href="#p65">65</a></div>
                  <div class="ptext" id="p65">The study’s findings open room to creatively think the place of new technologies such
                     as AR as being able to increase the much-needed participation of residents and actors
                     on public matters. Similar findings were also presented in studies on education ([<a class="ref" href="#chen2017">Chen et al. 2017</a>]; [<a class="ref" href="#lee2012">Lee et al. 2012</a>]). This means that the policymakers, scientists, and practitioners of AR should carefully
                     consider the affordances of using AR to enhance public participation and deal with
                     today’s severe challenges that cities and other contexts face. However, in the context
                     of the global south certain limitations need to be considered. Those limitations include
                     shortage of technical material, existence of old phone models that do not have the
                     capacity to render AR experiences, the digital divide that characterise the country,
                     poverty, and others. These findings open room to think about how the municipality
                     itself could benefit from employing AR for urban governance and enhance citizens’
                     participation in public spaces in postcolonial Maputo.
                     </div>
                  
                  <div class="counter"><a href="#p66">66</a></div>
                  <div class="ptext" id="p66">The Trash Snail shows how AR could truly enable the empathy of the users and readers
                     of the material by enabling the people to visually bear witness to challenges urban
                     residents face in urban public spaces in postcolonial Maputo [<a class="ref" href="#kummer2012">Kummer et al. 2012</a>]. AR emerges as a way of visually storying life in urban Maputo which opens the public
                     space for multiple interpretations that challenge hegemonic modes of framing and visualizing
                     the city. However, different from tourism examples, AR with the Trash Snail does not
                     present a sanitized reality of space and the relationship between the viewer and the
                     AR experience. Rather, the viewer is invited to visually engage with the issues of
                     solid waste as “matter out of place” in which the discomfort, disgusts, and other related sentiments are elicited in the
                     user of the AR object. This differs significantly from the touristic sanitized modes
                     of visually representing and engaging the public space [<a class="ref" href="#douglas1966">Douglas 1996</a>].

                  <div class="counter"><a href="#p67">67</a></div>
                  <div class="ptext" id="p67">While the study successfully gathered Maputo residents’ concerns over public spaces,
                     it was limited in that it could not bring the perspectives of the municipality. Beyond
                     that, the study could not follow the study participants as they tracked waste in public
                     spaces and deployed the app and, in the process, making evident the littered spaces
                     and their knowledge of the city due to COVID-19 travel restrictions. The other limitation
                     has to do with the fact that the study participants were not selected randomly, but
                     through snowballing effect which could generate bias in the study. However, this study
                     was able to show that despite existing structural challenges, AR can be deployed in
                     cities like Maputo to enhance public participation on public issues.</div>
