                <p>In this paper we run a topic model on over 300 article-length pieces from the
                    extended bibliography of Melissa Terras, Juliette Nyhan, and Edward Vanhoutte’s
                    edited collection <title rend="italic">Defining Digital Humanities</title>. We
                    use this topic model as a way to think through entry into the digital humanities
                    as a negotiation between warm invitation and gatekeeping, the
                        <soCalled>pull</soCalled> and <soCalled>push</soCalled> of digital
                    humanities. We then analyze the metadata we collected about these pieces to
                    explore how the push and pull manifest themselves unevenly across different
                    demographics.</p>

                <p>Digital humanities has a definition addiction. In the decades since the formal
                    inauguration of the term, rather than settle on a shared set of contours that
                    encompass the field, definitions about what digital humanities is (and is not)
                    have only proliferated. By the time Matthew Kirschenbaum wrote his definition in
                    2010, he had noted that pieces like his own were already an established genre
                        <ptr target="#kirschenbaum2010b"/>. One notable collection of definitions is
                    a recent volume edited by Melissa Terras, Julianne Nyhan, and Edward Vanhoutte,
                        <title rend="italic">Defining Digital Humanities: A Reader</title>, which
                    contains about twenty foundational definitions of the field <ptr
                        target="#terras2013"/>. In a useful and extensive addition to their book
                    Terras, Nyhan, and Vanhoutte maintain an online bibliography of <title
                        rend="quotes">Further Reading</title>, which is an ongoing list of
                    definitions for digital humanities <ptr target="#terras2013"/>. We used this
                    bibliography as a starting point to build a corpus of 334 definitions which we
                    topic modeled and visualized in order to get a meta-view of the discipline and
                    its members.</p>
                <p>We were particularly interested in taking this approach in order to analyze the
                    welcome-mat/trapdoor dynamic that Ted Underwood introduced at his 2018 MLA
                    presentation. Underwood describes entry into his sub-field of cultural analytics
                    as encountering <quote rend="inline">a gentle welcome mat followed by a
                        trapdoor</quote>
                    <ptr target="#underwood2018"/>. He argues that there is insufficient academic
                    infrastructure to help new scholars become competent in cultural analytics. This
                    lack of support has resulted in a field that is ostensibly open but is actually
                    only available to those who have prior extracurricular experience in coding and
                    statistics (which, he notes, is unevenly distributed). Underwood carefully kept
                    his critique to cultural analytics, which he does not consider synonymous with
                    digital humanities. However, even in areas of digital humanities that do not
                    involve the <quote rend="inline">massive cultural datasets</quote>
                    <ptr target="#manovich2016"/> of cultural analytics, his argument seems to
                    apply.</p>
                <p>Stephen Ramsay’s well-known MLA talk from 2011 titled <title rend="quotes">Who’s
                        in and Who’s out,</title> exemplifies Underwood’s welcome mat and trapdoor
                    analogy. Ramsay’s talk, which is often read as an example of
                    coding-as-gatekeeping in digital humanities, is more of an example of a
                    simultaneous trapdoor <emph>and</emph> welcome mat. In the most infamous
                    section, Ramsay states, <quote rend="inline">Do you have to know how to code?
                        I’m a tenured professor of digital humanities, and I say <q>yes</q></quote>
                    <ptr target="#ramsay2011"/>. Even though he follows this statement by
                    acknowledging that different advisors might have different answers to this
                    question, this excerpt functions and feels like a trapdoor because it refuses
                    admittance to those who do not program. Elsewhere in the same short piece,
                    Ramsay takes an almost opposite stance, admitting that <quote rend="inline">the
                        coding question is, for me, a canard.</quote> What he thinks sets digital
                    humanities apart is not coding, but building. He is <quote rend="inline">willing
                        to entertain highly expansive definitions of what it means to build
                        something,</quote> which is a statement that functions more like a welcome
                    mat by inviting people to try building of nearly any sort to enter the ranks of
                        <quote rend="inline">who’s in.</quote> Even in the most oft-quoted example
                    of gatekeeping, then, one experiences not just a line drawn around what defines
                    digital humanities for one person, but whiplash between a warm invitation to
                    attempt new ways of building and cold exclusion for not knowing the correct
                    tools to be a digital humanist.</p>
                <p>This simultaneous push and pull, this invitation-in and guarding-of digital
                    humanities exists in both field-wide definitions and individual methods. One
                    technique in which this dynamic is evident is topic modeling. In the past few
                    years, topic modeling has gone from being a <soCalled>hot,</soCalled> new method
                    to existing solidly within the mainstream digital humanities toolkit. Topic
                    modeling is so much associated with digital humanities that, at times, it seems
                    like digital humanities is topic modeling. Scott Weingart and Elijah Meeks use
                    it as a <quote rend="inline">synecdoche of digital humanities</quote> in their
                    special-issue introduction to topic modeling <ptr target="#weingartmeeks2012"/>.
                    Christopher Schöch has stated that <quote rend="inline">Topic Modeling has
                        proven immensely popular in Digital Humanities</quote>
                    <ptr target="#schoch2017"/>. Stephen Robertson even notes that <quote
                        rend="inline">text mining and topic modeling are the predominant
                        practices</quote> within digital literary studies <ptr
                        target="#robertson2014"/>. A myriad of informal introductions walks the
                    novice through what topic modeling is and how one can do it. Explaining what
                    topic modeling is has even become something of another sub-genre. There are many
                    excellent and accessible summaries by prominent digital humanists detailing what
                    the process entails and assumes <ptr target="#weingart2012"/>
                    <ptr target="#posner2012b"/>
                    <ptr target="#jockers2011"/>
                    <ptr target="#underwood2012"/>. These definitions and guides invite newcomers to
                    use the method.</p>
                <p>Despite the abundant and inviting walk-throughs, amateurs are warned away from
                    this method as vigorously as they are invited to try it. Ben Schmidt warns that
                        <quote rend="inline">simplifying topic models for humanists who will not
                        (and should not) study the underlying algorithms creates an enormous
                        potential for groundless — or even misleading — <q>insights</q></quote>
                    <ptr target="#schmidt2013"/>. Andrew Goldstone warns of easy-entry digital
                    humanities tools in general when he writes: <quote rend="inline">DH should be
                        wary of promises of ease: in prepackaged tools, in well-meaning introductory
                        tutorials and workshops that necessarily stop short of what a researcher
                        would need to draw conclusions, in rationalizations of inconclusive
                        arguments as exploration, play, or productive failure</quote>
                    <ptr target="#goldstone2017"/>.</p>
                <p>This simultaneous invitation and warning away is a confounding feature of
                    precisely those areas in digital humanities which established scholars have used
                    to draw lines around the field. One has to learn a little command line, R, or
                    Python to run and visualize the results of a topic model. With all the manuals
                    and textbooks available, topic modeling could be a relatively painless way to
                    earn one’s entry into digital humanities and satisfy any remaining naysayers who
                    demand or imply that digital humanists know how to code. However, approaching it
                    also puts newcomers in the position of the magician’s apprentice: is this going
                    to be a tool that gets out of our control and wreaks havoc on our scholarship
                    and our reputation in the very field we are trying to enter?</p>
                <p>This article explores a series of topic models run by relative newcomers to
                    digital humanities who encountered both a welcome mat and potentially a trap
                    door. At the time of carrying out this project, we were a group of one postdoc
                    and three graduate students in various humanities fields who learned topic
                    modeling together through Matthew Jockers’ introductory book <ptr
                        target="#jockers2014"/> and a DHSI session on topic modeling. Starting from
                    Melissa Terras’ bibliography on <title rend="quotes">Defining Digital
                        Humanities</title> and adding non-redundant entries from Elijah Meeks’
                    conceptual map of DH <ptr target="#meeks2011"/>, we collected and curated a
                    corpus of full-text digital humanities definitions as .txt files as well as 15
                    different metadata fields such as department, career stage, institution, etc.
                    for each definition’s authors. This set of texts is not a comprehensive list of
                    definitions within digital humanities. It does, however, include a breadth of
                    the disciplines involved in digital humanities scholarship, it contains varying
                    forms of media involved in defining digital humanities, and it is large enough
                    for topic modeling to be useful, though it is on the small side of topic
                    modeling corpora. One limitation of the corpus is that the texts we topic
                    modeled were all in English, which might skew the overall corpus’ representation
                    toward North American and English-speaking European scholarship. To clean the
                    texts we removed special (non-UTF-8) characters, front matter, and headers and
                    footers. We then topic modeled this 334-definition corpus using the R package
                        <q>mallet</q> by David Mimno <ptr target="#mimno2013"/>. We then prepared
                    the topic modeling data for analysis in three ways. First, we produced word
                    clouds representing the top 100 words associated with each topic with size
                    representing the preponderance of each word. Second, we produced timeline graphs
                    of the average presence of each topic through time (sum of all the topic
                    presences for each year in a topic-document matrix divided by the number of
                    documents in each year). Third, we mapped the location of the institutions of
                    the first author of each document at the time the document was published. We
                    color-coded the resulting dots to make heatmaps of each topic’s presence in
                    space. Despite the attempt to look at the data in various ways, very few of the
                    timelines and not one of the heatmaps showed discernible trends of topics
                    through time or space. What ended up being more revealing was the metadata we
                    collected about each author at the time of their piece’s publication: academic
                    rank (or job title), department, institution, location, gender, media of
                    publication (blog, article, etc.) and whether or not the piece was
                    co-authored.</p>
                <p>On one level, this project is a straightforward analysis of the results of our
                    topic models and our metadata. We are interested in what types of things people
                    talk about when they define digital humanities. Are there trends through time in
                    how people define digital humanities? Are there detectable national or regional
                    differences in topic distribution? Is there gender or academic rank disparity in
                    who is writing definitions of the field? Most centrally, we wanted to know if a
                    topic model of definitions combined with metadata about the authors of said
                    definitions could tell us about the push and pull of digital humanities and its
                    methods, especially as they are experienced across gender lines: is the push and
                    pull of digital humanities detectable in the topics we produce? Are male and
                    female authors represented proportionally in topics, or are there topics that
                    are dominated by one gender?</p>
                <p>On another level, this is an experiment in learning a quantitative method in
                    digital humanities. Using only an introductory book, can a group of interested
                    humanists run topic models that produce novel insights? What is all the fuss
                    about topic modeling? Is it powerful? Fun? Dangerous? Misleading? Revealing? Or
                    even predictable, merely confirming what we already know? This article serves as
                    an analysis of our own admittance into the field. Writing as junior scholars
                    just entering our disciplines, we feel both the push and pull of digital
                    humanities intensely. We hope we can add to the discussion of the phenomenon by
                    analyzing it from the other side of the disciplinary door from scholars like
                    Underwood.</p>

                <head>How is digital humanities defined?</head>
                <p>While we ran models with a wide range of parameters on this corpus, we finally
                    decided on a run with 55 topics. Briefly, topics are a group of words that tend
                    to co-occur in the corpus, and working with them can feel uncomfortably
                    arbitrary. However, after playing with the inputs for a while, 55 topics seemed
                    to produce topics that were granular enough to be meaningful, but not so narrow
                    as to be overlapping.</p>
                <p>Some of the topics that emerged from this model run were what one might expect.
                    Words about different kinds of tools tended to co-occur in certain entries. We
                    had a <quote rend="inline">tool, tools, web, topic, mapping</quote> topic that
                    included papers discussing the implications of Web 2.0 and web tools in the
                    digital research environment <ptr target="#cohen2008"/>, surveys of projects
                    using digital tools <ptr target="#paradise2015"/>, and articles that claim to
                        <quote rend="inline">focus on conceptual issues rather than particular tools
                        or projects</quote> but that nonetheless mention tool/s 72 times, for
                    example <ptr target="#robertson2016"/>. Some other topics focused on digital
                    humanities as coming out of humanities computing (<quote rend="inline"
                        >computing, mccarty, question, experimental, software</quote>),
                    discipline-specific history-department approaches (<quote rend="inline">history,
                        historian, historians, philosophy, narrative</quote>), and library roles in
                    digital humanities (<quote rend="inline">libraries, librarians, service,
                        library, work</quote>). Others seemed to be words that co-occur when
                    definitions explore digital humanities as it uses, relates to, or critiques
                    social media (<quote rend="inline">twitter, social, network, users,
                        scholars</quote>) or digital humanities in the classroom (<quote
                        rend="inline">students, tools, teaching, college, pedagogy</quote>). These
                    topics fit the kinds of definitions we expected to find.</p>
                <p>While these topics help to generally outline and categorize the range of subjects
                    people address when they define digital humanities, there were four topics that,
                    taken together, seem to encapsulate the push and pull of entry into digital
                    humanities. These topics engage with coding in the context of jobs, digital
                    humanities as a community with shared values, distant reading, and diversity in
                    digital humanities <figure>

                <head>Code</head>
                <p>Given our interest in the gatekeeping around coding and technical skills more
                    broadly, we were drawn to inspecting the topic that emerged with the top words:
                        <quote rend="inline">job, field, scholars, students, degree, code,
                        programming, software, technologists.</quote> The documents that are most
                    highly associated with this topic indeed all address code and coding, especially
                    in relation to the question of jobs. So, what is the consensus? Does one have to
                    code to be a digital humanist or at least to get a job? There is no answer as
                    such within the top documents associated with this topic. Instead, these
                    documents together form more of a discussion of coding itself. The most
                    favorable endorsements of coding range from memoir-like recollections of
                    personal experiences of learning to code <ptr target="#ramsay2016"/> to advise
                    on how and where to learn Ruby <ptr target="#cordell2011"/>. Others argue that
                    coding is potentially the least interesting aspect of what digital humanities
                    practitioners do and should be downplayed on the job market <ptr
                        target="#davidson2011"/> or not required at all in job postings <ptr
                        target="#gailey2011"/>. Others came at coding from the opposite angle,
                    arguing that developers and technologists should be recognized not only for
                    their coding but also for their intellectual contributions to projects <ptr
                        target="#ridge2013"/>. This topic may look like it would be comprised of
                    scholars arguing that digital humanities is about coding, or that one needs to
                    code to get a job. However, there is a range of different views towards coding
                    even among the documents which have a high probability of these words
                    co-occurring. While coding may be an ongoing conversation in the field, there
                    was no consensus that coding was a bar that had to be passed to enter the field.
                    The articles associated with this topic usually brought up questions about
                    coding and digital humanities rather than taking a hard stance about coding’s
                    role in the field. In this case, what appeared at first to be an instance of
                    gatekeeping was actually mostly a discussion about gatekeeping (from both
                    directions) and how to overcome it.</p>

                <head>Community</head>
                <p>In opposition to gatekeeping around to coding, which we thought we might find in
                    the documents associated with the coding topic but did not, another topic seemed
                    to be <soCalled>about</soCalled> defining digital humanities as an inclusive
                    community with shared values. If we expected coding to be the trap door in
                    Underwood’s metaphor, the definition of a community with shared values might be
                    the welcome mat that invites people in. A topic in our model was comprised of
                    the co-occurring, positive words <quote rend="inline">values, community, open,
                        collaboration, openness, ideas.</quote> Documents with a high probability of
                    these words co-occurring included Lisa Spiro’s call for creating a core values
                    statement in a collaborative, open way where everyone can edit and contribute
                        <ptr target="#spiro2012"/> as well as a follow up on Spiro’s initial call
                    proposing no overarching final statement as an outcome but rather a perpetual
                    place to gather ideas on values <ptr target="#hawk2013"/>. Other documents
                    included Scheinfeldt’s definition of digital humanities as a <quote
                        rend="inline">set of overlapping personal communities</quote> with shared
                    interests and shared values like open access and collaboration, among others
                        <ptr target="#scheinfeldt2010"/>. This topic shows the largest spike in
                    2012, the year after Ramsay’s MLA 2011 <title rend="quotes">Who’s in Who’s
                        out</title> talk (Figure 2), which, as we mentioned in the introduction to
                    this article, galvanized a host of responses.</p>
                <p>Overall, investigation of the documents most highly associated with this topic
                    confirms our first impressions of the word cloud. When first faced with the
                        <soCalled>coding</soCalled> cloud of words, however, it was evident that the
                    words themselves failed to divulge the meaning which we eventually drew from
                    them. The <soCalled>coding</soCalled> and <soCalled>community</soCalled> topics,
                    taken together, comprise two ends of a spectrum of topic transparency and
                    underscore the importance of going back to the documents themselves to inform
                    the interpretation of any topic. We had read about the necessity of toggling
                    scales and perspectives in reading <ptr target="#koller2015"/>
                    <ptr target="#janicke2015"/>, but were surprised in how much topics varied in
                    the distance between what they seemed to be <soCalled>about</soCalled> and what
                    ideas the documents were actually addressing.</p>

                <head>Distant Reading</head>
                <p>Among the 334 definitions of digital humanities that we analyzed, there was a
                    discernible <soCalled>distant reading</soCalled> topic. Words like: <quote
                        rend="inline">literary, reading, text, texts, literature, Moretti,
                        criticism, distant, patterns, close</quote> comprised this topic. The texts
                    most associated with this topic tend to mention Franco Moretti. They seem to
                    either equate the digital humanities with text mining <ptr target="#fish2012"/>
                    or let text mining stand as a synecdoche for the whole field <ptr
                        target="#turan2016"/>
                    <ptr target="#benzon2014b"/>
                    <ptr target="#benzon2014a"/>. After all, literary analysis using text mining and
                    distant reading is a major sub-field that sometimes seems to eclipse other forms
                    of digital humanities. In response, Stephen Robertson has written about the
                    disparate genealogy of digital history coming out of oral history, folk studies,
                    and public histories in part to counter the predominant narrative of text
                    analysis in humanities computing being <emph>the</emph> origin story of all of
                    digital humanities <ptr target="#robertson2014"/>.</p>
                <p>What is most striking about this topic, however, is not its robust presence in
                    definitions of digital humanities, but the fact that the documents most highly
                    associated with this topic are predominantly written by men (Figure 3). In fact,
                    19 of the top 20 documents associated with this topic are written by male
                        first-authors.<note>It is important to remember here that the topics and
                        topic distributions spit out by a topic model are not stable entities that
                        exist as concrete reality. These top twenty documents are not a final tally
                        of the people who define digital humanities using distant reading. When
                        choosing a different number of topics for the model, there might still be a
                        recognizable <soCalled>distant reading</soCalled> topic, but the probability
                        that each document features that topic will be different. So, for example,
                        when running our topic model with 70 topics, we found there was still indeed
                        a topic that was recognizable as similarly <soCalled>about</soCalled>
                        distant reading, but the top twenty documents associated with this
                            <soCalled>distant reading</soCalled> topic featured 17 texts written by
                        men and 3 texts written by women. There’s a danger in taking topics and the
                        documents associated with them too much as reflections of reality, and,
                        though any <soCalled>distant reading</soCalled> topic produced
                            <emph>may</emph> be dominated by male authors, we are far from having
                        shown that.</note> There is no other topic in our run of this topic model
                    that so disproportionately features male authors.<note>We discussed, debated,
                        and deliberated on how and whether to incorporate gender into our metadata.
                        Most of the metadata we compiled was a snapshot at the time of publication
                        of the particular piece. So while someone may be a distinguished professor
                        now, if, at the time of their definition, they were a graduate student, then
                        we recorded <soCalled>graduate student</soCalled> as their occupation.
                        Gender is fluid too, in motion and on a spectrum, so we considered
                        recognizing that gender identity can change by recording gender at the time
                        of publication. But, while we wanted to recognize that gender is fluid, we
                        wanted to avoid dead-gendering people. Also, we discussed how we could
                        ethically determine someone else’s gender identity. Especially if the
                        identity changed later, who is to say it hadn’t already changed in most
                        circumstances at the time of publication? We decided to determine gender
                        based on people’s own, current websites. Most of the time we were lucky in
                        that the professional websites people would create for themselves, in their
                        own voice, had bio-blurbs written in the third person. From this, we could
                        get the author’s preferred pronouns, and use those as a key to gender
                        identity. But when this was not available we did base our gender
                        determination on names, which relies on stereotypes of what is a
                            <soCalled>male</soCalled> vs. a <soCalled>female</soCalled> name, and
                        inevitably led to some mistakes. We also debated not including gender at all
                        at the risk of presuming someone’s gender identity or forcefully assigning
                        gender to people. But on the other hand, our interest in definitions of
                        digital humanities sprung from the disorienting push and pull we felt from
                        the field, and a key point of that argument is that when bars are set for
                        entry, they are felt especially by women. Ultimately, we feel it was
                        important to include gender precisely for the results presented here: that
                        more men mention distant reading when defining digital humanities than
                        women. So despite our own discomfort, we have included a consideration of
                        author gender when discussing these pieces.</note> This might not come as a
                    surprise since distant reading has been recognized as a field that has been
                    unreceptive to women and which can replicate the most simple of stereotypes
                    about women writers <ptr target="#klein2018"/>. For example, in <title
                        rend="italic">Macroanalysis</title>, Matthew Jockers separates 19th-century
                    novels by gender and looks at differences in topics addressed by male and female
                    authors. He writes that <quote rend="inline">The gender data from this corpus
                        are a ringing confirmation of virtually all of our stereotypes about gender.
                        Smack at the top of the list of themes most indicative of female authorship
                        is <q>Female fashion.</q>
                        <q>Fashion</q> is followed by <q>Children,</q>

                        <q>Sewing,</q> and a series of themes associated with strong
                        emotions</quote>
                    <ptr target="#jockers2013"/>. The decision to describe the gendered
                    distributions of themes with the unfortunate word choice of
                        <soCalled>confirming</soCalled> gender stereotypes rather than a more
                    felicitous term like <soCalled>reflecting</soCalled> or
                        <soCalled>echoing</soCalled> gender stereotypes of the era leaves Jockers
                    open to critique. But an issue with distant reading that is far more pervasive
                    and important than a captious quibble with phrasing is the tendency to note a
                    gendered (or other socially and historically constructed complex category) trend
                    and move on to the next significant result rather than to sit with the
                    uncomfortable result and think critically about it. A difference in the themes
                    picked up by male and female writers of the 19th century can be the impetus for
                    a discussion of what types of activities were open to women in the first place
                    and the ways that laws, the marketplace, and social norms might restrict themes
                    available to women writers. More often than not, in texts like <title
                        rend="italic">Macroanalysis</title>, the difference in topics is merely
                    noted without critical reflection before the discussion moves on to listing
                    other interesting trends that were also detected. In observing a pattern but
                    skipping further critical examination, the trends uncovered by distant reading
                    methods can, unfortunately, buttress stereotypes that women love fashion, for
                    example. These instances of noting trends without unpacking them can affect how
                    welcoming a field is to other voices. Women entering a sub-field heavily reliant
                    on math, statistics, and rationality, such as text mining, might not feel
                    especially welcome if the field is producing descriptions of women writers as
                    emotional, fashion-obsessed mothers.</p>
                <p>In addition to the reiteration of stereotypes about women writers, Franco
                    Moretti, the founding figure of distant reading, is one of the men publicly
                    named as a result of the #metoo movement. While some have excavated the
                    female-led genealogy of distant reading, offering an alternative to Moretti <ptr
                        target="#buurma2018"/>, others, like Lauren Klein, have argued that this
                    revelation about Moretti merely confirms the critiques that have been leveled
                    against the practice of distant reading for years. Namely, that distant reading
                    fails when it comes to dealing with gender conceptually, rhetorically, and in
                    its models (as well as in the representation of women in the field) <ptr

                    in digital humanities. The topic’s top words are <quote rend="inline">race,

                    of the authors of these pieces (Figure 3) with thirteen of the top twenty
                    documents associated with this topic being authored by women.<note>When we ran
                        the topic model with 70 topics, we also looked at a topic similar to this
                        one. The top twenty documents associated with the analogous topic of the 70
                        topic run had the same gender distribution: 13 female-authored and 7
                        male-authored pieces, but keep in mind the warning of the previous footnote
                        — that topics are not stable entities that reflect the
                            <soCalled>reality</soCalled> of the corpus, but are rather a heuristic
                        which which to think.</note> It may not be surprising that when defining digital
                    humanities, women are leading in bringing up issues of diversity and inclusion.
                    This demonstrates that one of the ways inclusiveness benefits a field is to
                    introduce new areas of research and writing that otherwise may not have been
                    present. In this capacity, it shows that one of the benefits that women have
                    already brought to the field of digital humanities is a critical conversation
                    around diversity and inclusion.</p>
                <p>The texts associated with this topic also pertain to the central theme of this
                    article: the push and pull of the digital humanities, especially in regard to
                    gender and race. This work is critically important in a field that embraces its
                    reputation of niceness and inclusion while historically failing to foster the
                    careers of diverse scholars. For example, the Digital Humanities 2011 conference
                    theme of <title rend="quotes">Big Tent Digital Humanities</title> has been
                    critiqued for simultaneously trumpeting the inclusiveness of the field while
                    failing to recognize that the field might actually fail by many inclusivity
                    metrics. Melissa Terras writes of DH 2011, <quote rend="inline">It is all very
                        well saying that DH is open and welcoming and encourages participation – but
                        despite open platforms such as DH answers, and the DIY approach, it is still
                        a very rich, very western academic field with a limited number of job
                        openings</quote>
                    <ptr target="#terras2011"/>. The conference also featured four male plenary and
                    prize speakers complemented by male chairs for each of these most prestigious
                    events. The 2011 conference may have provoked an ongoing response from the
                    digital humanities community (in addition to that of Terras), as this diversity
                    and inclusion topic increased over time, detectable in the corpus from 2011
                    onward (Figure 4).</p>

                <p>At this point, it bears thinking through what we have been doing so far in this
                    article. Are our objectives and method more aligned with the <q>distant
                        reading</q> topic or the <q>diversity and inclusion</q> topic? Using topic
                    modeling in this paper is most definitely a form of distant reading. Although we
                    have a corpus in the hundreds, not thousands or millions, we are using a
                    computer to put the corpus together and read it in aggregate in order to create
                    new meaning. We also, of course, employ a similar method to the one we critiqued
                    Matthew Jockers for in the previous section; we look at topics and examine the
                    different ratios of male and female-authored papers associated with them. We
                    even learned topic modeling in the first place from a different book by Jockers,
                    the empowering <title rend="italic">Text Analysis with R for Students of
                        Literature</title> which expands the field by teaching those who may not
                    have picked up coding via <q>extracurricular</q> activities how to use R to
                    perform all sorts of analyses on texts. The difference is, at this moment, we
                    are attempting to <emph>use</emph> distant reading to <emph>critique</emph>
                    distant reading. While we may question whether we can critique something using
                    its own tools, we also think that the discomfort in being both a distant reader
                    and the object of distant reading is a productive one. As Nickoal Eichmann,
                    Jeana Jorgensen, and Scott Weingart write in their study on diversity and
                    inclusion in the annual digital humanities conference, <cit><quote rend="inline" source="#weingart2016">by turning our

                    productive in this exercise is exploring the discomfort of turning our gaze on
                    our own work and writing into it. Instead of hiding the discomfort of dividing
                    authors based on gender and looking for differences, or simply noting a gendered
                    difference in topics and moving on, we discussed it, debated it, and ultimately
                    wrote about it in this article (see footnote 2 for a summary of our debate).</p>

                <head>Who is defining digital humanities?</head>
                <p>As is evident from our explorations via topic modeling, we are not only
                    interested in getting a general sense of <emph>how</emph> people define the
                    digital humanities, but <emph>who</emph> is doing the defining. To that end, we
                    collected data on the pieces and their authors. Did, for example, these
                    definitions hold up to digital humanities’ reputation for being a collaborative
                    endeavor? In what ways might those who are writing definitions be a homogeneous
                    or diverse group?</p>
                <p>It turns out that definitional pieces might be one of the types of digital
                    humanities work that is most closely aligned with traditional academic writing,
                    at least with respect to collaboration. Only 12.6 percent of the definitions in
                    our corpus were co-authored. Department of author is another area that is not
                    evenly distributed. While there are a wide variety of departments represented in
                    the corpus, most definitions are written by authors with positions in English
                    departments. English department definitions are nearly twice as numerous as the
                    next most common department-of-origin: digital humanities departments/centers.
                    Out of the people writing definitions from digital humanities centers, half of
                    those have PhDs in English. Library and Information Sciences authors follow,
                    then definitions from History departments. Next-most-numerous are definitions
                    written by people who have no departmental affiliation: journalists, independent
                    scholars, deans, software engineers, etc. (Figure 5).</p>

                <p>Even though about half of humanities PhDs go to women <ptr
                        target="#genderdistribution"/> men wrote about 63 percent of the definitions
                    in our corpus. Even more surprising is the way the male-female percentages break
                    down by job title within academia (Figure 6). Male authors are overrepresented
                    in the more senior academic positions. There are about four times as many
                    definitional pieces written by male full professors than female full professors.
                    Similarly, there are about twice as many definitions written by male Associate
                    Professors, Assistant Professors, and Directors than female. On the other hand,
                    in the pool of definitions written by junior academics, female authors outnumber
                    male. There are more definitions written by female graduate students, postdocs,
                    visiting scholars, and librarians than male. Overall, male full professors are
                    the most prolific definers of the field, suggesting that while definitions are
                    diverse in terms of academic position, they could be more equitable in their
                    distribution among voices.</p>

                <p>In our analysis of the Terras/Nyhan/Vanhoutte bibliography, we only included
                    short-form definitions (no full-length books). In our corpus of 334 definitions,
                    over 200 were blog posts, followed distantly by 60+ academic journal articles.
                    While there are some manifestos, popular articles, journal editorials, and book
                    chapters, it seems that much work in defining digital humanities goes on in the
                    gray literature of blog post, conference papers, and other informal
                    communication. Interestingly, the more informal publication mode of blog posts,
                    was just as uneven in terms of gender distribution of authors as the more formal
                    peer-reviewed academic journal articles. There were 61 women and 138 men
                    authoring blog posts in the corpus, while 17 women and 39 men were first authors
                    in academic journal articles (in both cases, about 30% of the pieces had women
                    as their first or only author).</p>
                <p>This connects with Tara Thomson’s warning that informal and nontraditional
                    formats do not necessarily equate with egalitarianism. Her narrative of her
                    experience at an unconference shows that those with less disciplinary knowledge
                    may feel more exposed and that informal events tend to get led by those with
                    more professional confidence <ptr target="#thomson2015"/>. Those that published
                    definitions on the digital humanities on their blogs felt entitled to take a
                    stab at defining the field on their own, without the feedback of peer review.
                    Blogs might not be more egalitarian a means of publishing digital humanities
                    definitions, at least in terms of gender.</p>
                <p>Finally, our corpus was extremely homogeneous in terms of geographic location of
                    the institution from which the authors were writing. Only three of the authors
                    in the entire corpus came from cities outside of Europe, the United States, or
                    Canada. Our corpus featured a definition by a scholar writing from The Centre
                    for Internet and Society in Delhi, Universidad Nacional Autonoma de Mexico in
                    Mexico City, and American University of Beirut in Beirut. As mentioned earlier,
                    this lack of diversity in geographical origin of these definitions may partially
                    stem from the fact that our corpus was entirely in English, but it also speaks
                    to Melissa Terras’ earlier critique that self-praise for inclusivity misses the
                    fact digital humanities remains a <quote rend="inline">very rich, very western
                        academic field</quote>
                    <ptr target="#terras2011"/>. Apart from the observation that nearly all the
                    definitions were from the United States, Canada, and European nations, regional
                    data did not lead to novel insights. While we analyzed topics by region of
                    origin, no topic showed a preponderance of authors from a single nation or
                    continent. We were expecting to find regional <soCalled>flavors</soCalled> of
                    digital humanities, perhaps North American and European DH, respectively
                    reflecting speculative vs. scientific modes of digital humanities, but mostly
                    topics featured a mix of authors from North American and European institutions.
                    If styles of DH vary by geographical region, our topic model was not a good
                    instrument to detect this.</p>

                <head>Conclusion</head>
                <p>Defining digital humanities is an activity that shows no signs of slowing down.
                    While proliferating definitions can be a good offset to gate-keeping, they can
                    also lead to a sense of whiplash for those interested in entering the field. For
                    our group of early-career academic co-authors, we experienced both excitement
                    and worry at the prospect of using topic modeling to read a corpus of digital
                    humanities definitions. We were excited to learn the technique of topic
                    modeling, but the lack of consensus on how to use and interpret topics left us
                    in a liminal space: we had successfully coded, and yet we had no idea if our
                    efforts yielded meaningful results. It took interpretive work and insider DH
                    knowledge to describe any topic’s connection to the field. To us, the act of
                    interpreting topics mirrored the push and pull that we see within the field,
                    indicating that perhaps less emphasis should be placed on digital competencies
                    and more emphasis on the step of interpretation that comes after the use of a
                    digital tool. If established scholars not only provided manuals on how to use
                    digital tools but also explained how they interpreted their results as
                    meaningful, that would be an immensely useful step.</p>
                <p>The topic model itself proved the least interesting and least difficult aspect of
                    our work. Though the topic model indicated multiple routes that people tend to
                    take when defining digital humanities, the really interesting stories emerged
                    when we combined the topic model outputs with our painstakingly-gathered
                    metadata or after hours of focused reading of the individual documents in the
                    corpus. The model’s breadth of topics did confirm our initial feeling of
                    disorientation — not knowing if we were being welcomed or warned away from topic
                    modeling and digital humanities in general. With definitions that ranged from
                    advice on learning to code to documents that defined the field according to
                    utopian values like <soCalled>openness,</soCalled> the topic model did represent
                    quite a range of ways the field is defined and encapsulated topics that covered
                    both the push and the pull of digital humanities. While some define the field in
                    relation to the subset of work that uses distant reading and text mining, others
                    define the field as a community of people who self-identify as members based on
                    shared values. Still others challenge the field to become more diverse even as
                    they define it. Although temporal and spatial analyses of our 55 topics showed
                    few interpretable trends in definitions across time and none across space, our
                    analysis did produce some novel insights. We detected possible gender trends in
                    the <soCalled>distant reading</soCalled> and <soCalled>diversity</soCalled>
                    topics, indicating the push and pull of digital humanities may be felt
                    disproportionately across gender differences, especially when it comes to
                    particular methods or perspectives on what constitutes DH. In addition, the
                    overall corpus of definitions contained gender and class imbalance, especially
                    in the number of definitions written by tenured men. These insights are
                    important to a field invested in inclusivity, yet grappling with a long history
                    of failing on this front. If definitions of digital humanities are one of the
                    genres that interested parties first encounter when beginning to research the
                    field, then advancing definitions that both include and foster diverse
                    perspectives is of critical importance. Knowing in which types of definitions
                    women’s voices are most underrepresented (and conversely, most robustly present)
                    can help the field address problem areas.</p>
                <p>In terms of technical competencies <soCalled>required</soCalled> for entry into
                    DH versus opening up the field to individuals with a wide variety of
                    experience-levels, it was refreshing that the most useful part of this study for
                    ourselves was not the model itself, with its requisite R proficiency, but the
                    part that one could do with a simple spreadsheet and google charts. What
                    produced the most compelling insights was not the technical wizardry of Latent
                    Dirichlet allocation but our communal spreadsheet. We considered producing the
                    demographic graphs in this article in R as a signal of disciplinary belonging
                    but ultimately decided that the fact that the most interesting figures were made
                    not with a statistical programming language, but with built-in spreadsheet
                    capabilities was an important aspect of what we wanted to say in this paper. As
                    an exercise in learning a much-talked-about digital humanities technique as a
                    foray into the field, we concluded that perhaps both the promise of the power of
                    topic modeling and its dangers might have loomed larger in our imagination than
                    in reality. The push and the pull of digital humanities can feel strong to early
                    scholars interested in the field, but once you dive in, you might realize the
                    waters are both less clear and less perilous than they seem from the shore.</p>
