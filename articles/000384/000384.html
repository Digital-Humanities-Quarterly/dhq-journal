                  <p>The history of human-environment interaction is embedded in stone. Stones are
                     essential components of daily life and their various usage characterize certain
                     areas or chronological periods. The form of a stone object is the result of a
                     long chain of interactions with distinct bodies but the intangible life story of
                     any artefact is partially registered in its original material properties and
                     gradual physical alteration. Digital systems can be adopted for collecting these
                     invisible records and tracing a stone’s history. Chemical imaging and portable
                     spectroscopy are quick and non-destructive remote sensing techniques that can be
                     used to gather empirical data and track production and use of stone artefacts
                     over time. This article reviews the application of Near Infrared Spectroscopy as
                     a method for geochemical characterization of objects and as a tool for
                     provenance studies within the Mobima project, carried out by an
                     interdisciplinary team of archaeologists and chemists at University of Umeå,
                     Sweden.

                  <p>Near Infrared Spectroscopy can be used for acquiring and processing spectral
                     information directly in the field, modelling datasets of big assemblages and
                     classifying objects.

                  <div class="ptext" id="p1">The life story of a stone artefact is an assemblage of events evident in the
                     tangible and intangible attributes of the object. By the term tangible, I
                     generally define that some of these attributes are visible to naked eyes like
                     the color or the shape; other qualities, such as the cultural meaning that the
                     artefact assumed in a certain context, are invisible, and therefore intangible;
                     finally, some attributes related to the geochemical characterization of the
                     material are invisible but can be recorded through analytical methods.
                     Investigating the geochemical characteristics of stone artefacts is essential in
                     order to read the complex network of agents co-occurring in an object’s
                     biography [<a class="ref" href="#kopitoff1984">Kopitoff 1984</a>]. Digital tools can be beneficial in
                     order to decipher some of these evidences. Technology helps with reconstructing
                     narratives from otherwise invisible proofs; in particular, the application of
                     portable Near Infrared Spectrometry and Imaging represented a turning point in
                     the archaeological practice. This technology, particularly useful to gather
                     large geochemical datasets, has been successfully applied to the study of
                     various archaeological features at different scales, from landscapes survey to
                     characterization of lithic tools.

                  <div class="ptext" id="p2">In this paper I discuss the epistemological implications with the study of stone
                     materials referring to new materialistic positions and the broader debate over
                     theoretical issues within archaeological sciences ([<a class="ref" href="#boivin2005">Boivin 2005</a>],
                     [<a class="ref" href="#jones2004">Jones 2004</a>], [<a class="ref" href="#hodder2012">Hodder 2012</a>], [<a class="ref" href="#p%C3%A9tursd%C3%B3ttir2012">Pétursdóttir 2012</a>], [<a class="ref" href="#ruggles2009">Ruggles and Silverman 2009</a>], [<a class="ref" href="#tilley2004">Tilley 2004</a>]). Related to that I describe different case studies
                     in which the use of technology supported the experimentation of new protocols
                     for acquisition and processing of empirical data. From in-field measurements of
                     soils and pigments, to hyperspectral imaging of ancient walls and pedagogical
                     implications in teaching archaeometry, I will consider potentialities and
                     concerns with the use of spectral remote sensing. All the case studies presented

                  <div class="ptext" id="p3">The use of stone materials for various purposes is a constant throughout the
                     entire history of humanity. The mineral world has been quotidian to humans since
                     prehistory. It is a long-term entanglement: from hunter-gatherers’ knapped tools
                     to more recent mines, quarries, and buildings [<a class="ref" href="#foley2003">Foley and Lahr 2003</a>]
                     [<a class="ref" href="#waelkens1992">Waelkens et al. 1992</a>]. From early humans up to this day, stone materials
                     come in different forms, textures, forms, and sizes, and correspond to precise
                     needs. Raw materials are collected and shaped according to technological choices
                     but the selection of particular supply sources is mostly determined by an
                     empirical observation of its chemical and mechanical properties. For example, a
                     certain type of marble has been suitable for a particular sort of art and
                     architecture, obsidian appears to be an appropriate material for blades and
                     spear tips, while pozzolana sand is good for hydraulic mortars. Other contingent
                     factors equally occur in the constitution of a stone artefact such as the range
                     of raw materials naturally available, the network of trades/exchanges and the
                     access to the supply sources. Considering these circumstances we can affirm that
                     a stone artefact is always the product of the joint agencies of human and stone
                     mutually influencing one another.

                  <div class="ptext" id="p4">Since “social relations are simultaneously
                     relations between material forms”
                      [<a class="ref" href="#tilley2004">Tilley 2004</a>, 217], the study of socio-cultural dimensions of stone artefacts should also be
                     based on the analysis of their physical properties. A stone artefact encloses
                     the “objective nature of material culture and
                     the subjective experience of human beings”
                      [<a class="ref" href="#ruggles2009">Ruggles and Silverman 2009</a>, 11], as the product of a long chain of interactions with other bodies
                     generating variations in their material tangible properties: rain, frost, and
                     sun provoke geochemical modifications on stones leading to decay and erosion; a
                     Roman marble inscription celebrating a victorious emperor can be cut and reused
                     as building material for a Romanesque cathedral. Material and physical agents
                     together with social practices are co-occurring in the network of human-stone
                     interaction [<a class="ref" href="#p%C3%A9tursd%C3%B3ttir2012">Pétursdóttir 2012</a>]. Various agencies are entangled
                     and can be categorized by using different chronological and spatial scales. For
                     example, usage of raw stone materials can be mapped by reconstructing the steps
                     of exploitation and colonization of natural resources in a region, while the
                     network of trades and transport is taken into account by tracing movements of
                     people and stone goods over longer distances. Mechanical properties of different
                     stone types are optimized in order to get stable and resistant artefacts in
                     accordance with their available and contemporary technology. Finally, stone
                     artefacts can carry a cultural meaning deeply connected to their physical being
                     as particular objects in ritual contexts.

                  <div class="ptext" id="p5">The combination of a stone’s tangible and intangible properties is better
                     understood via its materiality, defined as: “a notion that encompasses the view that
                     material and physical components of the environmental and the social
                     practices enacted in that environment are mutually reinforcing”
                      [<a class="ref" href="#jones2004">Jones 2004</a>, 330]. Every object is part of a texture of matters, as outlined by [<a class="ref" href="#hodder2012">Hodder 2012</a>], and the interactions between
                     humans-artefacts-environments can be read from the point of view of things. The
                     focus on an object’s materiality shifts the archaeological perspective on
                     cultural interpretation; the artefact is no longer a clue to be decoded but an
                     essential component of the past characterized by material properties that must
                     be explored in detail [<a class="ref" href="#boivin2005">Boivin 2005</a>]
                     [<a class="ref" href="#jones2004">Jones 2004</a>]. To which extent can the study of stone artefacts’
                     materiality depend on the analysis of their physical properties? The
                     socio–cultural environment and the geological characteristics are equally
                     necessary to describe an artefact. In this sense, cultural interpretation and
                     archaeometric data are necessarily entangled.

                  <div class="ptext" id="p6">Various terms have been used to refer to the study of geochemical characteristics
                     of stone artefacts. These terms often carry implicit theoretical connotations.
                     The debate over methods for collecting data concerning the geochemical
                     characteristics of objects is developed in the field named provenance studies
                     and generically defined by [<a class="ref" href="#malainey2011">Malainey 2011</a>] as the study of
                     attributes suitable for tracing the raw material the artefact was made of and
                     where it was manufactured. Although the words provenience or provenance are
                     equally adopted to define this particular branch of archaeology, the use of one
                     or the other term is ambiguous. A debate has been undertaken by scholars
                     suggesting that the terms provenance and provenience actually refer to different
                     concepts and not only a spelling variation<a class="noteRef" href="#d4e263">[2]</a> ([<a class="ref" href="#boivin2005">Boivin 2005</a>], [<a class="ref" href="#joyce2012">Joyce 2012</a>], [<a class="ref" href="#jones2004">Jones 2004</a>], [<a class="ref" href="#malainey2011">Malainey 2011</a>], [<a class="ref" href="#price2011">Price and Burton 2011</a>]). The distinction
                     between provenience and provenance is often related to the context. For example,
                     when associated with museum and archive policy for item acquisition, the word
                     provenance implies “the history, the life of the
                     object” including previous owners, while provenience is the “find spot”
                      [<a class="ref" href="#deangelis2006">DeAngelis 2006</a>, 398]. In relation to archaeological research, provenience is defined by Price
                     and Burton as either “the place of
                     discovery” of an object or its “place of origin”
                      [<a class="ref" href="#price2011">Price and Burton 2011</a>, 213]. Tracing the location of provenience of an object is therefore correlated
                     to the study of natural sources of geological materials. I refer to provenance
                     and provenience as indicating two different methodological and theoretical
                     strands.

                  <div class="counter"><a href="#p7">7</a></div>
                  <div class="ptext" id="p7">In the US, the term provenience is used by archaeologists and chemists
                     principally indicating the place of origin of the raw material an artefact is
                     made from. A consequence of this concept is the provenience postulate that
                     states that: “the chemical differences within a single
                     source of material must be less than the differences between two or more
                     sources of that material, if they are to be distinguished”
                      [<a class="ref" href="#price2011">Price and Burton 2011</a>, 214]. In these terms, the study of an artefact’s provenience poses geochemical

                     Consequently, the success in the application of the postulate is uncertain from
                     case to case and it depends on: type of materials, geographic distribution of
                     sources, analytical techniques, budget/costs, time, and type of artefacts [<a class="ref" href="#price2011">Price and Burton 2011</a>]
                     [<a class="ref" href="#malainey2011">Malainey 2011</a>]. Nevertheless, a strict focus on the analytical
                     issues related to the application of the provenience postulate risks resulting
                     in a never-ending debate on different methods’ technical details. The use of
                     analytical methods must be related to the transformation of the paleo
                     environmental record and the problematics of artefacts’ proveniences need to be

                     materials and are continuously altered, changing their properties and becoming
                     other things [<a class="ref" href="#joyce2012">Joyce 2012</a>, 124].The ecosystems, in which

                     geochemical signature as they are in continuous change. Quarries, mines or
                     outcrops are exposed to weathering and buried sites are influenced by post
                     depositional processes (modification occurring to the sediments once they are in
                     place), both of which are capable of causing a chemical alteration of the
                     geological materials. Environmental and human factors can make objects move.
                     Erosion, water transportation or human activity can carry artefacts far from
                     their place of production. All these movements and transformations might
                     interfere with a clear identification of the geochemical characteristics of

                     provenance. Measuring artefacts’ properties is a fundamental step for
                     understanding the stories of their provenances. This process of mapping

                     modification that may occur to things and that things contribute to. Considering

                     strategies. NIR is a technique based on recording different molecular vibrations
                     in the Near Infrared band of the electromagnetic spectrum. It is a
                     non-destructive method that requires the use of controlled light source and
                     digital captors (like cameras or probes) and that can be implemented in various
                     contexts. NIR covers the spectrum region between 700 and 2500 nm and contains
                     absorption bands corresponding to overtones and combinations of fundamental C-H,
                     O-H, and N-H vibrations. NIR has a scarce sensitivity to minor constituents, as
                     a Near Infrared Spectrum doesn’t present clear peaks but often it shows more
                     broad bands that are the result of aligned peaks [<a class="ref" href="#bokobza1998">Bokobza 1998</a>].
                     Considering NIR properties, the identification of elements from a single
                     spectrum is often not worthwhile and a fingerprint approach is preferable. One
                     big advantage with the use of NIR is the fact that it is a nondestructive method
                     requiring a very simple sample preparation, and performs a long series of
                     measurements in a short time. This makes it a method with interesting
                     possibilities of application in archaeological research, recording spectra from
                     various elements several times. NIR is largely used as a control test in
                     pharmaceutics industries, agriculture, food production and geology. For example,
                     NIR has been applied to a wide range of geologic problems: mineralogical mapping
                     of lunar surface [<a class="ref" href="#mccord1973">McCord and Adams 1973</a>], mineral exploration [<a class="ref" href="#goetz1983">Goetz et al. 1983</a>], mineralogical analysis of drill cores [<a class="ref" href="#kruse1996">Kruse 1996</a>], field mapping of expansive soils [<a class="ref" href="#chabrillat2002">Chabrillat et al. 2002</a>] and field mapping of mineral assemblages for gold

                     the difference in measurements in different conditions over time. In these

                     done associating NIR and Raman spectroscopy for the study of stone materials
                     in the field. Raman is a vibrational non-destructive spectroscopic
                     technique. Like NIR, this method is fast and does not require complicated
                     sample preparation. Raman spectroscopy has been used in geology for sourcing
                     rock materials, as the minerals can be easily identified without major
                     problems [<a class="ref" href="#jehlicka2012">Jehlicka 2012</a>]. It is possible to find on the market
                     miniaturized portable Raman spectrometers, but so far there are few
                     publications evaluating the use of these devices [<a class="ref" href="#edwards2012">Edwards 2012</a>]. In contrast to NIR, Raman spectroscopy requires more technical expertise
                     but results in sharper peaks. The two methods can be considered as
                     complementary as the excitation occurs in different vibrational states and
                     molecular bonds that are not active within one method are generally active
                     in the other one.</span></div>
