                     Mexico). Combines his expertise in Mexican Colonial History, Mesoamerican
                     Archaeology, Computer Science and Geographical Information Systems to develop
                     methodologies for the analysis and dissemination of cultural heritage. One of
                     his main research areas is the application of 3D computer vision and machine
                     learning techniques to automate the recognition, retrieval and classification
                     of archaeological objects, particularly from museum collections and online
                     repositories. His latest project focuses on data mining of texts and pictorial
                     documents from sixteenth century New Spain.</p>

            <p>This article introduces an ongoing Digital Humanities project aimed at leveraging the
               benefits of Natural Language Processing, Corpus Linguistics, Machine Learning, and
               Spatial Analysis for advancing the computational analysis of vast historical corpora.
               As a case study, the project concentrates on the <title rend="italic">Relaciones
                  Geográficas de la Nueva España</title> (1577–1585), one of the key corpora for
               understanding the early colonial period of Mexico.</p>
            <p>Using a computer–assisted methodology called Geographical Text Analysis (GTA), the
               project offers automatic means for parsing historical texts and the markup of words
               referring both to place names (toponyms) and analytical concepts that are then linked
               to their geographic locations. Adding geospatial intelligence to the parsing of texts
               allows exploring hidden geographies and narratives in the historic corpus. The
               article provides a general overview of the corpus, describes the GTA methodology step
               by step, and reports on the progress achieved so far.</p>

                  Mexico: A Large–Scale Computational Analysis of Sixteenth–Century Historical
                  Sources</title>, and describes the progress achieved so far.<note>This project
                  operates thanks to a grant received from the 2017 <title rend="quotes">Digging
                     into Data</title> initiative of the Trans–Atlantic Platform for Social Sciences
                  and Humanities Research (T-AP). T-AP is a consortium supported by research
                  institutions in 16 countries, among them the Economic and Social Research Council
                  (ESRC, UK), the Foundation for Science and Technology (FCT, Portugal), and the
                  National Council of Science and Technology (CONACyT, México). This project is
                  conducted by three teams of historians, archaeologists, geographers, linguists and
                  computer scientists from the following institutions: The Digital Humanities Hub
                  and the History Department of Lancaster University, UK; The Instituto de
                  Engenharia de Sistemas e Computadores, Investigação e Desenvolvimento em Lisboa,
                  INESC–ID, University of Lisbon, Portugal; and the Instituto Nacional de
                  Antropología e Historia in México. The website of the project can be accessed at:
                     <ref target="http://www.lancaster.ac.uk/digging-ecm"
                     >http://www.lancaster.ac.uk/digging-ecm</ref>. </note> The project focuses on
               developing novel methods and tools for mining new knowledge from textual and
               pictorial historical records to facilitate the study of early Latin American history.
               It concentrates on one of the most important corpora related to the geography,
               culture, religion, economy, and history of native and Spanish peoples in Mexico and
               Guatemala, namely the <title rend="italic">Relaciones Geográficas de la Nueva
                  España</title> (Geographic Reports from New Spain), and specifically those
               compiled between 1577 and 1585, hereafter referred to as RGs.</p>
            <p>The proposed methodology — called Geographical Text Analysis (GTA) — enables the
               automatic markup of words referring both to place names (toponyms) and analytical
               concepts relevant to historical research, and adds geospatial intelligence to the
               parsing of texts. This process is useful not only to find the most salient terms in
               textual corpora or to identify and disambiguate personal and geographical names, but
               also to facilitate the discovery of unsuspected data patterns and relationships, such
               as spatial correlation of events, interaction of people, links of persons and themes
               to places, and many others.</p>
            <p>One of the main contributions of this project has been the development of an
               analytical model based on deep-learning and adapted to the specific challenges found
               in texts like the RGs. In order to achieve named entity recognition, disambiguation
               and classification, GTA employs methodologies from the fields of Natural Language
               Processing (NLP), Corpus Linguistics (CL) and Machine Learning (ML). Although NLP, CL
               and ML techniques are used frequently in textual analysis today, they are most
               commonly applied to contemporary texts composed in English. Little work has been done
               to adapt their use to historical corpora written in old language forms like the
               sixteenth–century Spanish.<note>NLP techniques have often been applied to annotated
                  texts written in modern English, and a few have been tried with historical
                  documents composed in earlier forms of speech in several languages <ptr

                  <ptr target="#won2018"/>.</note> The RG corpus additionally contains other
               features that complicate the use of such tools, which makes very difficult the
               automatic <q>reading</q> of the documents. These include the presence of
               multi-lingual expressions in Nahuatl, Zapotec, Otomi, and many other indigenous
               languages <ptr target="#harvey1972"/>, as well vocabulary only used in certain
               regions at the time. </p>
            <p>A second contribution of our project has been to facilitate, using Geographical
               Information Systems (GIS), the automatic linking of the results of these processes of
               textual analysis with locational data. This combination of NLP, CL and ML techniques
               with spatial analysis methods creates powerful resources to discover unsuspected
               geographies in the textual reports. Our model will allow scholars of colonial Latin
               America to learn new information, extract it, cross–link it to other document
               resources, and, most importantly, study significant historical topics, such as those
               we discuss in section 3.5 below. </p>
            <p>Apart from the GTA model itself, we foresee several other products of this project.
               The first is a digital version of the RGs corpus, annotated in accordance with
               analytical categories that can be applied to other corpora through an interoperable
               ontology. The second is a digital gazetteer containing geographic coordinates as well
               as political, cultural, administrative and physical data, not only of the
               sixteenth-century sites mentioned in the RGs, but from other relevant sources and
               historical periods. The third is a set of software tools that link the spatial
               information contained in the gazetteer with the textual and pictorial contents of the
               RGs in order to facilitate the discovery and analysis of geographies not immediately
               apprehended with normal reading. </p>
            <p>In writing this paper, our goal is to raise awareness about the possibilities of
               applying computer-assisted methods to the analysis of historical texts. Thus, we
               describe every step of GTA in the context of our specific study case, hoping that
               this will encourage more Humanities researchers to adopt this kind of approach.</p>

            <head>2. The Sixteenth Century Relaciones Geográficas de la Nueva España</head>
            <p>The compilation of the <title rend="italic">Relaciones Geográficas de la Nueva
                  España</title> was part of a large, long–standing project, sponsored first by
               Emperor Charles V and then by King Philip II, who sought to collect geographic,
               economic, historic and cultural information from all the kingdoms and territories
               under their rule. The initiative emerged not only from the need to control the
               exploitation of resources and resolve important issues such as land possession,
               management of labor and the transfer of privileges to colonists, but also to compile
               scientific knowledge and fulfill intellectual curiosity <ptr
                  target="#delgadolopez2010"/>
               <ptr target="#delagarza1983"/>. This involved both collecting descriptions and making
               maps <ptr target="#mundy1996" loc="1–27"/>. The whole project included Castile,
               Aragon, Italy, the Netherlands, Portugal (since its annexation in 1581), and the
               viceroyalties of Peru and New Spain.</p>
            <p>For the New World enterprise, the Spanish king, through the Council of Indies,
               commissioned his leading cosmographers to gather information by means of
               questionnaires. These were conceived by Juan de Ovando and sent to the Indies in 1569
               (37 questions), 1570 (200 questions) and 1573 (135 questions). The responses that
               came back to Madrid, however, were scarce, probably because the burden of collecting
               data was put on high-level ecclesiastical and government officials who lacked the
               necessary knowledge or were not willing to answer so many questions. </p>
            <p>The project was revived by Juan López de Velasco, cosmographer–chronicler of Philip
               II, who in 1577 devised more feasible enquiries. The first one attempted to gather
               observations about moon eclipses from various parts of the Indies <ptr
                  target="#cline1964"/>. This would allow solving the elusive problem of determining
               longitude coordinates for the American territories, which in turn would make it
               possible to establish correctly the position of the Indies with respect to Europe in
               a universal map <ptr target="#edwards1969"/>
               <ptr target="#mundy1996" loc="17–9"/>. A second independent enquiry sought to
               complete the scarce descriptions received in the previous years, sending only fifty
               carefully formulated questions to be answered not by high-level authorities, as in
               previous attempts, but by <foreign xml:lang="es">corregidores</foreign> and <foreign
                  xml:lang="es">alcaldes mayores</foreign>, the local administrative officials with
               direct knowledge of the situation in towns, villages and hamlets, who also received
               printed instructions on how to answer the survey. <ref target="#figure01">Figure
                  1</ref> shows the first page (out of three) of the printed <title rend="italic"
                  >Instrucción y Memoria</title> sent as a guide to the respondents.</p>
            <p>The questionnaire included very detailed information about the life in New Spain. One
               single query might cover topics such as demography, type of settlements,
               intercultural opinions, and ethnolinguistics.<note>To give a complete picture of the
                  enquiry, we reproduce the questions list in Appendix 1. The questionnaire in

            <p>Responses to the questionnaire were produced between 1579 and 1585 and are now held
               in Spain, Scotland, and the United States. In total there are 168 written reports

                  (<q>head-towns</q> or main districts). These also contain descriptions of 248
               subordinate jurisdictions, 414 towns and many smaller villages and hamlets <ptr

               Relación de Atlatlauhca (present–day Atlatlauhcán, Morelos).</p>
            <p>Alongside the texts, the corpus contains 78 maps. Some were painted by indigenous
               artists following native representations of places and landscape (<ref
                  target="#figure03">Figure 3</ref> and <ref target="#figure04">Figure 4</ref>),
               while others were clearly drawn by creoles or peninsular Spaniards (<ref

                  >Robertson (1972: 243)</ref>, they represent <quote rend="inline">the largest
                  single group of interrelated early colonial pictorial manuscripts which has come
                  down to us.</quote><note> The latest comprehensive analysis of these maps is by
                     <ref target="#mundy1996">Mundy (1996)</ref>.</note> Of these maps, 23 came from
               Mexico; 3 from Michoacán; 1 from Nueva Galicia; 21 from Oaxaca; 18 from Tlaxcala; 3
               from Yucatán and 2 from Guatemala. There are also accounts of 26 manuscripts and 16
               maps lost centuries ago <ptr target="#cline1972c" loc="Table 6"/>; <ptr target="#cline1972c" loc="Table 10"/>
               <ptr target="#robertson1972"/>, as well as an additional map that disappeared more
               recently <ptr target="#mundy1996" loc="226"/>. </p>
            <p>Despite the fact that some authors failed to answer several questions, both the texts
               and the maps offer favorable conditions to test new approaches for the analysis of
               large historical corpora. The corpus of RGs offers highly structured information —
               due to the standardized questionnaire — which gives the reports a degree of
               homogeneity rarely seen in other sixteenth–century collections. The geographic
               descriptions also cover more than half the territory of New Spain and the level of
               detail is remarkable not only in terms of orography, landscape, and natural
               resources, but also the way of life of native peoples and colonists, as well as the
               interactions between different social groups. Such richness, consistency, and span
               facilitate comparative research across small, medium, and large areas on topics of
               social, historical, ethnographic, linguistic, economic, and political interest.</p>
            <p>A further reason for selecting the RGs is a desire to improve the accessibility and
               valorization of the corpus as a main source for historical enquiry. Seminal research
               has been conducted by <ref target="#cline1972">Cline (1972)</ref>, <ref

               the complete textual information of the RGs to perform a matrix analysis oriented to

               approached the corpus by studying how the contrasting — sometimes conflicting —
               worldview of conquistadors and native peoples shaped the responses to the

            <head>3. Methodology and current progress </head>
            <p>As discussed in the introduction, we are developing advanced tools for unveiling new
               information from the RGs corpus by applying a methodology known as Geographical Text
               Analysis (GTA). The resulting digital resources and software tools will be released
               at the end of the project under an open-access license. The methodology was
               originally produced by some members of this project to reveal new, unsuspected
               patterns of information by focusing on the geographic components of the historical
               narrative <ptr target="#cooper2011"/>
               <ptr target="#murrieta-flores2015"/>

               <ptr target="#murrieta-flores2017a"/>
               <ptr target="#gregory2018"/>. </p>
            <p>We are now in the process of refining and extending this methodology with
               contributions from all members of this project and from researchers engaged in
               parallel initiatives (e.g., <ref target="#santos2017">Santos et al. 2017</ref>; <ref
                  target="#santos2018">Santos et al. 2018</ref>; <ref target="#won2018">Won et al.,
                  2018</ref>). In this particular project we followed four phases: obtaining a
               computer-readable corpus, the creation of a gazetteer, the semantic annotation and
               geoparsing of the corpus, and data mining and historical analysis. In the following
               sections, we discuss each stage in detail.</p>
            <div>
               <head>3.1 First phase: Obtaining a computer-readable corpus</head>
               <p>The first phase of the methodology is obtaining computer–readable files from the
                  more comprehensive editions of the RGs. We began with Francisco del Paso y
                  Troncoso’s <title rend="italic">Papeles de Nueva España</title>, which contains a
                  significant portion of the corpus. Transcriptions from the original manuscripts
                  were already available in electronic format, but it was necessary to identify and
                  correct significant errors caused by the Optical Character Recognition (OCR)
                  software. This is a common problem with old documents, to which Alpert–Abrams
                  offers an approach in her 2016 article on the corpus known as <title rend="italic"
                     >Primeros Libros</title>.</p>
               <p>After completing six volumes of <title rend="italic">Papeles de Nueva
                     España</title> (Del Paso y Troncoso 1905), the work continued with the RGs from
                  Yucatán, published in volume 11 of <title rend="italic">Colección de documentos
                     inéditos de las posesiones de España en ultramar</title> (1898). Additionally,
                  thanks to a generous permission from the National Autonomous University of Mexico
                  (UNAM), we were also able to digitize a more recent version of the 54 RGs from
                  Yucatán transcribed and edited by <ref target="#delagarza1983">De la Garza
                     (1983)</ref> and to acquire in a digital format 114 RGs published in ten
                  volumes by <ref target="#acuna1982">Acuña (1982–1988)</ref>. In the end, we
                  obtained two versions of the whole corpus in machine–readable format: the first
                  one includes the notes, references and commentary from the scholars who
                  transcribed and studied the documents, while the second contains only the
                  transcription of the original RGs texts. A third version that includes all the NLP
                  annotations was produced during the third phase of the project.</p>

            <div>
               <head>3.2 Second phase: Creation of a gazetteer</head>
               <p>The second phase starts with a compilation of all the place names that exist in

                  <p>The resulting list was then subjected to a linguistic disambiguation process,
                     during which the most difficult challenges were dealing with place names found
                     in different native languages, as well as resolving name variations and
                     spelling inconsistencies. Important names of cities, like Tlaxcala, have
                     remained in original form since the sixteenth century, but many others have
                     changed significantly over time for a variety of reasons, including: historic
                        causes;<note>For instance, Antequera is now Oaxaca.</note> renaming due to
                     changes in the boundaries of original settlements;<note>In one example,
                        sixteenth–century Cempoala (Hidalgo) moved from a hill to a valley to
                        guarantee access to water, which caused severe alterations on its
                        limits.</note> and addition of words such as the name of a patron saint to
                     an indigenous toponym.<note>Tetlapayac, for instance, is the modern Santiago
                        Teltlapayac.</note> Another problem relates to spelling variations of the
                     same toponym,<note>Quauhyocan is also written as Quacyocan, for example.</note>
                     the application of Castilian transliterations to the names of ancient
                        settlements,<note>For example, ancient Quahnahuac is modern
                        Cuernavaca.</note> or dealing with homonymies.<note>Tetela, for instance,
                        refers both to a town in modern Morelos and to a settlement in Puebla, and
                        towns called Atlatlauhca can be found both in Morelos — origin of an RG —
                        and Oaxaca.</note>

               <p>The third stage comprises four tasks: defining an annotation schema by selecting
                  the most relevant analytic categories for the intended historical analysis;
                  annotating manually, and in accordance with the previously defined annotation
                  schema, two different samples of documents: one for training the NLP deep-learning
                  model and another one to validate it; tuning the deep-learning model to
                  automatically perform name entity recognition, disambiguation and classification,
                  in order to obtain a fully annotated corpus; and assessing the performance of the
                  model in accordance with the gold-standard validated by experts. </p>
               <div>
                  <head>3.3.1 Defining the annotation schema (ontology).</head>
                  <p>The selection of the ontology categories can be done by consensus among expert
                     linguists and historians, or with the help of automatic computer methods that
                     extract a <quote rend="inline">seed ontology</quote> directly from the corpus
                        <ptr target="#eynard2012"/>. The first method is more time-consuming, but it
                     is simpler and on many occasions yields better results, so this was the
                     approach we followed.</p>
                  <p>The RGs ontology contains 21 entity classes and many more sub-categories
                     relevant to social, political, territorial and economic terms appearing
                     recurrently through the RGs (Table 2). For example, the general entity class
                        <q>architecture</q> includes sub-categories such as <q>domestic</q> and
                        <q>religious,</q> which offers the possibility to distinguish between house
                     and convent buildings described in texts. Another class <q>cosmogony</q>
                     includes sub-categories such as <q>ritual,</q>
                     <q>festivity,</q>
                     <q>deity,</q> etc. Each entity type follows the definitions and linked-data
                     standards of DBpedia to ensure the interoperability of our dataset.</p>

                  <p>Using such entity classes we carried out a manual annotation of two samples of
                     18 out of 168 documents (10% of the corpus) from the RGs using the online
                     tagging tools developed by Tagtog, a commercial company that generously

                     annotated samples, five experts tagged the same documents independently. We
                     then obtain statistics on the level of consensus among the experts by using the
                     inter-annotator agreement tool from Tagtog. <ref target="#figure07">Figure

                  <p>Once the training and gold-standard sample data are available, the actual
                     development of the NLP model can begin. Our team in Portugal, led by Bruno
                     Martins, combined two state-of-the-art approaches of deep-learning: neural
                     networks and word embedding.</p>
                  <div>
                     <head>3.3.3.1 Neural networks.</head>
                     <p>A neural network is a computational model, loosely inspired on the neural
                        structure of the brain, that is able to <q>learn by example</q> how to
                        perform repetitive complex tasks. In the NLP and CL fields, it is applied,
                        among other things, to perform word classification, or the assigning of a
                        label to each word in an input text, indicating whether it belongs to a
                        certain semantic category (e.g. toponym, person, animal, plant, institution,
                        cultural concept), or to a <q>part-of-speech</q> syntactic category (i.e.
                        noun, pronoun, adjective, determiner, verb, adverb, preposition,
                        conjunction, and interjection).</p>
                     <p>Modern NLP software libraries leverage such statistical models <ptr
                           target="#goldberg2017"/>, making probabilistic decisions on the best
                        annotations for previously unseen texts. One of the best is SpaCy. To run a
                        deep-learning model in SpaCy we need to conduct a training phase during
                        which the software is fed with the training data sample (in our case 10% of
                        the corpus). This annotated training sample contains many known examples of
                        the kind of words expected in the unannotated text (the remaining 90% of the
                        corpus). </p>
                     <p>Because we know the correct answers — thanks to the gold-standard data
                        sample — , we can give the model feedback on its predictions in the form of
                        an error gradient or the loss function that calculates the difference
                        between the training example and the expected output. If the accuracy of the
                        annotations is not sufficient, then an iterative refining process can be
                        carried out until accomplishing satisfactory results.</p>
                     <p>Then, to link the gazetteer with the corpus texts, it is necessary to assign
                        correct longitude and latitude coordinates to each toponym recognized by the
                        neural network. The Mordecai geoparsing library <ptr target="#halterman2017"
                        /> is a good tool for that job. It takes as input the place names recognized
                        by SpaCy, and uses an index over the contents of the gazetteer to find the
                        potential coordinates of extracted place names. In other words, the names
                        recognized in the text are matched against similar names in the gazetteer.
                        Through this process the gazetteer and the corpus are finally linked and
                        ready for the implementation of query tools.</p>

                     <head>3.3.3.2 Word-embedding.</head>
                     <p>Complementing the above procedures, the word–embedding algorithm makes it
                        easier for the neural network to distinguish all of the different semantic
                        contexts in which a word might be used. This process follows the idea that
                           <quote rend="inline">a word is characterized by the company it
                           keeps</quote>
                        <ptr target="#firth1957"/>. For example, in the phrase <quote rend="inline"
                           >[t]he order of San Francisco was established in these lands in
                           1524,</quote> the term <q>San Francisco</q> refers to an institution, but
                        in <quote rend="inline">[t]he mendicant friars helped the poor following the
                           teachings of San Francisco,</quote> the same term refers to a person. In
                        another context, it could mean a geographic location, as for instance in the
                        sentence <quote rend="inline">San Francisco Tlalcilalcalpan is inhabited at
                           the present by 18,721 people.</quote></p>
                     <p>We specifically pre-trained a word–embedding algorithm in an unsupervised
                        way to statistically predict the meaning of words in the context of real
                        natural language utterances. Thus, we needed training data sufficiently big
                        and varied to tackle the specific challenges of the RGs. One is that the
                        spelling in the corpus varies considerably among the many authors. This is
                        sometimes, in part, because words are spelled in accordance with their Latin
                        origin, rather than their actual pronunciation. Another is that the corpus
                        borrows heavily on vocabulary from indigenous languages, especially place
                        names, and terms to identify flora, fauna, cultural concepts, etc.</p>
                     <p>Given the fact that the structure of modern Spanish still resembles to a
                        high degree the language recorded in the RGs, we decided to combine modern
                        and historical data sources to train our model. Contemporary data came from
                        several Spanish corpora such as ANCora <ptr target="#taule2008"/>, IMPACT-es
                           <ptr target="#sanchez-martinez2013"/>, or the <title rend="italic">Corpus

                        complexities particular to New Spain.</p>
                     <p>By thus leveraging modern and historical data in a combined training
                        dataset, we can simultaneously benefit from having large amounts of
                        contextual information from which the model can learn more easily, together
                        with some data representing the specificities of historical Spanish.
                        Furthermore, to avoid problems with out-of-vocabulary words, such as those
                        brought forward by the inconsistent spelling or cultural expressions, we
                        used a word–embedding method that also creates representations for
                        sub-words, and which is able to reconstruct entire word representations from
                        such sub-words <ptr target="#bojanowski2017"/>.</p>

            <head>4. Future Work: Data mining and historical analysis</head>
            <p>At this stage, several data mining and analysis procedures can be carried out. The
               first is an adaptation of collocation analysis — a technique from Corpus Linguistics
               (CL) — which allows for extracting the most statistically significant phrases that
               are found next to a term or keyword of interest (the <q>collocates,</q> in CL
               jargon). Our variant of the technique is <term>geographic collocation
               analysis</term>, originally developed by the research group at Lancaster <ptr
                  target="#gregory2015"/>
               <ptr target="#murrieta-flores2015"/>
               <ptr target="#murrieta-flores2017a"/>
               <ptr target="#murrieta-flores2017b"/>. This facilitates the recognition and
               retrieval, across the corpus, of all place names that collocate or are close to a
               keyword of interest according to a predefined proximity threshold, usually defined in
               terms of the maximum number of words between the search–term and the collocate. In
               this manner, if a researcher is interested in investigating economic aspects related
               to agriculture, they could retrieve, for instance, all phrases in the context of
               words like <foreign xml:lang="es">maíz</foreign>, <foreign xml:lang="es"
                  >siembra</foreign>, <foreign xml:lang="es">subsistencia</foreign>, <foreign
                  xml:lang="es">mantenimientos</foreign>, <foreign xml:lang="es">comida</foreign>
               (i.e. <q>maize</q>, <q>sowing</q>, <q>subsistence</q>, <q>sustenance</q>,
               <q>food</q>), which would appear linked to a map showing the geographic locations
               where such terms appear. </p>
            <p>Furthermore, by putting words in context through collocation, a historian could
               extract in a few seconds — as opposed to the weeks that it would take to access the
               information without GTA tools — interesting details about the first colonists in New
               Spain. Such a query, for instance, might involve running a collocate search of the
               word “conquistador” (<ref target="#figure08">Figure 8</ref>). Another type of search
               can be conducted using general categories, such as employing the term <q>food</q> to
               retrieve words like <q>beans,</q>
               <q>fish,</q> or <q>bread</q> (<ref target="#figure09">Figure 9</ref>).</p>
            <p>In the following subsections, we highlight several topics of historic analysis that
               we plan to examine through this research.</p>
            <div>
               <head>4.1 Historical phenomena changing the face of New Spain at the end of the
                  sixteenth century</head>
               <p>One area of application for the techniques detailed in this study is understanding
                  the coexistence of competing systems of land ownership and labor in New Spain
                  during the colonial period. In New Spain during the short time of compilation of
                  the RGs, there was a strong debate about the system of <foreign xml:lang="es"
                     >encomiendas</foreign> and the desire to replace it with the so-called <foreign
                     xml:lang="es">repartimientos</foreign>. The <foreign xml:lang="es"
                     >encomienda</foreign> was the right to exploit the labor of indigenous
                  populations, granted by the Spanish Crown to conquistadors, who at the beginning
                  of the colonization held this privilege in perpetuity and could, therefore, pass
                  it to their descendants with little intervention from the royal government in
                  Madrid. In contrast, the <foreign xml:lang="es">repartimiento</foreign> only
                  allocated the labor force of native workers for a fixed period of time in exchange
                  for a meager remuneration. The latter gave the royal government more control over
                  its subjects and resources. Neither the holders of <foreign xml:lang="es"
                     >encomiendas</foreign> nor <foreign xml:lang="es">repartimientos</foreign> were
                  allowed to appropriate lands, as private property was reserved for <foreign
                     xml:lang="es">haciendas</foreign>. These three systems coexisted in the 1570s
                  despite the enactment of the so-called New Laws in 1542, which attempted to
                  protect the rights of the indigenous populations and prevent the dispossession of
                  their lands by abolishing the <foreign xml:lang="es">encomiendas</foreign>.
                  Throughout the texts of the RGs, therefore, it is common to find claims by
                  conquistadors’ descendants of their <foreign xml:lang="es">encomienda</foreign>
                  rights, and others defending the benefits of <foreign xml:lang="es"
                     >repartimientos</foreign>. A comprehensive study of the claims and contentions
                  found in the RG corpus would improve our understanding of the period.</p>

               <head>4.2 The local government organization of New Spain toward the third quarter of
                  the sixteenth century</head>
               <p>A second application of these methodologies has to do with disambiguating local
                  structures of governance in New Spain. The early colonial period was a time when
                  the functions and spheres of influence of the four branches of colonial government
                  were not well defined, and consequently the spatial boundaries of the judicial,
                  administrative, military and ecclesiastical jurisdictions overlapped (<ref
                     target="#figure10">Figure 10</ref>). This was especially true at the municipal
                  level. Consequently, the corpus contains terms associated with several kinds of
                  jurisdictions whose meanings were not consistent throughout the vast territory of
                  New Spain (e.g. <title rend="italic">partidos de clérigos</title>, <title
                     rend="italic">distrito de mision</title>, <title rend="italic"
                  >custodia</title>, <title rend="italic">guardianía</title>, <title rend="italic"
                     >vicaría, presidencia</title>, etc.). The subject has been a matter of ongoing
                  debate among historians <ptr target="#gerhard1972b" loc="66"/>, but we believe
                  that applying collocation analysis for extracting the contextual use of such words
                  would shed light on how those institutions functioned in parallel to <title
                     rend="italic">alcaldías mayores</title> and <title rend="italic"
                     >corregimientos</title> and this would be an important contribution to the
                  knowledge of this period.</p>

            <div>
               <head>4.3 Settlement pattern analysis to elucidate the territorial organization of
                  New Spain </head>
               <p>A third area for future study has to do with demarcating the boundaries of
                  territories in New Spain. By reading the RGs, we could attempt to identify the
                  names and boundaries (<foreign xml:lang="es">linderos</foreign>) of towns
                  belonging to <foreign xml:lang="es">corregimientos</foreign> (territorial
                  demarcations for administrative and judicial purposes) mentioned in the corpus.
                  Circa 1570, there were 200 of such units whose frontiers have been outlined by
                     <ref target="#gerhard1972a">Gerhard (1972a)</ref>. However, the smaller
                  demarcations (towns, villages) suffered adjustments in boundaries and
                  jurisdictions. As Gerhard points out, at the time of the RGs, <quote rend="inline"
                     >[e]arly civil and ecclesiastical divisions lost importance and were
                     eliminated; others came into being as a result of conquest, proselytization,
                     mining activity, and other causes</quote>
                  <ptr target="#gerhard1972b" loc="66–9"/>. The application of a mathematical model
                  that analyzes the maximum available territory around each settlement within a
                  region, like the one proposed by <ref target="#ducke2008">Ducke and Kroefges
                     (2008)</ref>, could provide preliminary hypotheses on such demarcations. These
                  would then be tested against the actual historical information extracted from the
                  corpus through geographic collocation analysis. One of the many ways that such a
                  study could begin is by extracting references on the routes that local
                  administrators take for their visits to towns within their jurisdiction, the
                  distances they traversed, the geographic features and topography of the landscape,
                  etc. (<ref target="#figure10">Figure 10</ref>) This, and much other information,
                  is available throughout the corpus, but more specifically in the answers to
                  questions 7, 8, 11, and 12 (see <ref target="#appendix01">Appendix 1</ref>).</p>

            <div>
               <head>4.4 Analysis of historical diseases</head>
               <p>A fourth research question has to do with our understanding of the outbreak of
                  disease (1576-1581) that took the lives of half the population of New Spain during
                  the early colonial period <ptr target="#acuna-soto2004"/>. This was the second
                  time that <foreign xml:lang="es">cocoliztli</foreign> (as the epidemic was called)
                  had decimated the native population, causing the disappearance of whole
                  communities, shortages in labor-force for the <foreign xml:lang="es"
                     >encomiendas</foreign> and <foreign xml:lang="es">repartimientos</foreign>, the
                  displacement of people over different regions, or, on the contrary, the
                  congregation of survivors (sometimes of different ethnic communities) in new
                  Indian towns, all of which altered dramatically the traditional settlement pattern
                     <ptr target="#gerhard1972a" loc="24"/>. How did this phenomenon vary over
                  different regions? How many people died in each locality? How did this epidemic
                  compare with others in the past? How did the new settlement change in comparison
                  with Prehispanic times? These are all questions that GTA could help to answer by
                  collocating words and phrases related to health (such as diseases, symptoms, and
                  remedies) and analyzing them with spatial mathematical models of disease
                  contagion. </p>

               <head>4.5 The spatial distribution of natural resources (flora, fauna, minerals,
                  etc.) and exploitation practices at the time of the RGs</head>
               <p>A fifth application of our methodology has to do with the study of natural
                  resources. GTA will allow the extraction and analysis of regional historical
                  information on natural resources such as plants. There are already interesting
                  archaeological, historical and ethnographic research related to plants and their
                  use in Mesoamerica, medicinal and otherwise <ptr target="#alboreszarate2015"/>
                  <ptr target="#chavezmejia2020"/>
                  <ptr target="#hersch1999"/>. Some further research has been also dedicated to
                  assessing the importance of the trees and edible plants introduced by Europeans.
                  With the annotation of the RGs in this project and the development of GTA, it is
                  now possible not only to extract information regarding native and European plants
                  introduced in the different regions of New Spain, but also to contribute to
                  further debates. It is known, for instance, that Mesoamerican cultures had an
                  extended knowledge of plants for medicinal use and most of the research about this
                  has been carried out using colonial primary sources. We could now create a map of
                  all the plants mentioned in the RGs and compare this dataset with archaeological
                  data and other primary sources that were dedicated to the recording of medicinal
                  plants, such as the Códice Badiano or the Historia Natural de Nueva España. This
                  would allow researchers, for instance, to assess the continuation in the use of
                  specific plants for remedies and consumption in specific regions of New Spain.
                  Other interesting avenues of possible research with GTA analysis are the
                  availability of food and animals both native and introduced, the use of natural
                  resources, the existence of cultural artefacts, the presence of priests and
                  religious orders in particular regions, as well as types of architecture.</p>

               <head>4.6 Exchange networks, trading practices and communication routes</head>
               <p>An additional topic is the study of exchange networks and trading practices, as
                  well as communication routes, both terrestrial and aquatic, among the populations
                  described in the RGs. One such study has already been conducted by <ref
                     target="#favila-vazquez2019">Favila-Vázquez (2019)</ref>, who successfully
                  reconstructed aquatic communication networks in the Rio Balsas region by
                  extracting information from the responses available to queries 38 to 47 of the RGs
                     (<ref target="#figure11">Figure 11</ref>). These contain crucial data regarding
                  navigation by sea, including location of ports and coastal landscape. Together
                  with data from question 19 (focused on fluvial networks), the extraction of data
                  from the RGs corpus allowed Favila-Vázquez to reconstruct a riverine and coastal
                  system of communication that explains the spatial connectivity of the Valley of
                  Mexico to the Pacific coast.  </p>

            <head>5. Conclusion</head>
            <p>Geographical Text Analysis can make an important contribution to the study of massive
               corpora, like the RGs, by expediting the extraction and analysis of specific
               information that would be too slow or cumbersome to find in big datasets through
               traditional reading methods. It also can provide tools to uncover patterns behind the
               narrative of historical sources and link them to their geographic locations. Thus,
               GTA creates a way for historians to apply what in computational literary studies is
               called <q>distant reading.</q><note>The premise of distance reading is that there are
                  simply too many documents for anyone to read and study simultaneously and within
                  the limits of the human brain and under the time imposed by contemporary academic
                  schedules.</note>
            </p>
            <p>At the same time, the use of geographic collocations and the concept of <q>keywords
                  in context</q> permit a more detailed, granular comprehension of the corpus by
               identifying those parts that deserve a <q>close reading.</q> This flexibility has
               been demonstrated in previous research projects employing GTA <ptr
                  target="#donaldson2017"/>
               <ptr target="#murrieta-flores2017a"/>
               <ptr target="#taylor2017"/>. Having a multiplicity of <q> place names in context</q>
               associated with keywords of interest opens an unprecedented range of possibilities in
               terms of identifying information patterns and hypothesis–testing across large
               corpora, which in turn allows answering historical questions in a way that would be
               impossible otherwise. </p>
            <p>In such a context, the proposal of GTA must not be seen as an attempt to replace the
               careful micro study of historical sources practiced by modern historians. More
               exactly, GTA is a methodology for parsing and crosslinking information at a macro
               scale throughout a whole corpus in a relatively short period of time, so historians
               can use their efforts and time more efficiently to focus on the more important
               documents or fragments of texts.</p>
            <p>One of the main contributions of our project specifically has been adapting named
               entity recognition, disambiguation, and classification techniques to text collections
               that either belong to specific historical periods or might pose a further challenge
               due to their multi–language nature. We have succeeded in developing a new
               deep-learning model to process the language of the RGs despite the orthographic
               variance across the corpus and the high frequency of indigenous vocabulary.
               Nevertheless, there is still much work to be done, especially for the indigenous
               languages of the Americas <ptr target="#mager2018"/>. </p>
            <p>Finally, we have already produced a significant number of digital datasets of value,
               such as the gazetteer, which includes not only sixteenth–century localities but place
               names from other Mexican historic periods. Hopefully, these will prove valuable
               resources for humanists engaged in studying the Latin American historical and
               archaeological past. The methods and tools being developed by the project have the
               advantage of being generic, and therefore, applicable to other corpora. </p>
            <p>We are committed to releasing the digital products and software tools through several
               repositories, including GitHub and our own online platform. Our hope is that scholars
               from diverse fields will be able to identify the desired information, extract it,
               cross–link it to other document resources, and most importantly, answer significant
               research questions: Where do certain phenomena happen more often? Who was responsible
               for certain events? What was happening in specific places at certain times? Such kind
               of enquiry will take historical analysis a step further, contributing significantly
               to advancing research on the colonial period in Latin America, and humanities
               research more generally. </p>

               <item>Firstly: For towns of Spaniards, state the name of the district or province in
                  which it lies. What does this name mean in the native language, and why is it so
                  called?</item>
               <item>Who was the discoverer and conqueror of this province? By whose order was it
                  discovered? In what year was it discovered and conquered, as far as is readily
                  known?</item>
               <item>What is the general climate and character of the province or district? Is it
                  very cold or hot, humid or dry? Does it have much or little rain, and when,
                  approximately, does it fall? How violently and from where does the wind blow, and
                  at what times of the year?</item>
               <item>Is the terrain flat or rugged, clear or wooded, with many or few rivers or
                  springs, abundant in or lacking water? Is it fertile or without pasture, abundant
                  or lacking in fruits and sustenance?</item>
               <item>Are there many or few Indians? Were there more or fewer at other times, and
                  what are the known causes of this? Are they presently settled in planned and
                  permanent towns? Describe the degree and quality of their intelligence,
                  inclinations, and way of life. Are there different languages in the province or a
                  general language that all speak? </item>
               <item>What is the latitude, or the altitude of the Pole Star, at each Spanish town,
                  if it has been taken and is known, or if anyone knows how to observe it? Or on

                  town where the governor to whom it is subject resides?</item>
               <item>Likewise, what are the league distances and the direction of each Spanish city
                  or town to adjacent ones? Are these leagues long or short, through flat or hilly
                  land, over straight or winding roads, easy or difficult to travel? </item>
               <item>What are the present and former names and surnames of each city or town? Why
                  are they so called, if known? Who gave each its name, who was its founder, by
                  whose order was it settled? What year was it founded? How many residents did the
                  settlement first have, and how many does it have now?</item>
               <item>Describe the sites upon which each town is established. Is each upon a height,
                  or low-lying, or on a plain? Make a map of the layout of the town, its streets,
                  plazas and other features, noting the monasteries, as well as can be sketched
                  easily on paper. On it show which part of the town faces south or north.</item>

               <item>In addition, state how far the native towns lie from surrounding native or
                  Spanish towns. Declare for all their direction from these other towns. Are the
                  leagues long or short, the roads through level or hilly land, straight or
                  winding?</item>

                  former and is their present means of subsistence? Were they more or less healthy
                  than now and what are reasons for this that you may know?</item>
               <item>For all towns, both Spanish and native, describe the sites where they are
                  established. Are they in the mountains, in valleys, or on open flat land? Give the
                  names of the mountains, valleys, and districts, and for each, tell what the name
                  means in the indigenous language. </item>
