                  <p>This article introduces an ongoing Digital Humanities project aimed at leveraging
                     the
                     benefits of Natural Language Processing, Corpus Linguistics, Machine Learning, and
                     Spatial Analysis for advancing the computational analysis of vast historical corpora.
                     As a case study, the project concentrates on the <cite class="title italic">Relaciones
                        Geográficas de la Nueva España</cite> (1577–1585), one of the key corpora for
                     understanding the early colonial period of Mexico.

                  <p>Using a computer–assisted methodology called Geographical Text Analysis (GTA), the
                     project offers automatic means for parsing historical texts and the markup of words
                     referring both to place names (toponyms) and analytical concepts that are then linked
                     to their geographic locations. Adding geospatial intelligence to the parsing of texts
                     allows exploring hidden geographies and narratives in the historic corpus. The
                     article provides a general overview of the corpus, describes the GTA methodology step
                     by step, and reports on the progress achieved so far.

                     It concentrates on one of the most important corpora related to the geography,
                     culture, religion, economy, and history of native and Spanish peoples in Mexico and

                     concepts relevant to historical research, and adds geospatial intelligence to the
                     parsing of texts. This process is useful not only to find the most salient terms in
                     textual corpora or to identify and disambiguate personal and geographical names, but
                     also to facilitate the discovery of unsuspected data patterns and relationships, such
                     as spatial correlation of events, interaction of people, links of persons and themes

                     analytical model based on deep-learning and adapted to the specific challenges found
                     in texts like the RGs. In order to achieve named entity recognition, disambiguation
                     and classification, GTA employs methodologies from the fields of Natural Language
                     Processing (NLP), Corpus Linguistics (CL) and Machine Learning (ML). Although NLP,
                     CL
                     and ML techniques are used frequently in textual analysis today, they are most
                     commonly applied to contemporary texts composed in English. Little work has been done
                     to adapt their use to historical corpora written in old language forms like the
                     sixteenth–century Spanish.<a class="noteRef" href="#d4e352">[2]</a> The RG corpus additionally contains other
                     features that complicate the use of such tools, which makes very difficult the
                     automatic “reading” of the documents. These include the presence of
                     multi-lingual expressions in Nahuatl, Zapotec, Otomi, and many other indigenous
                     languages <span class="error"><a class="ref" href="#harvey1972">#harvey1972</a></span>, as well vocabulary only used in certain

                     Information Systems (GIS), the automatic linking of the results of these processes
                     of
                     textual analysis with locational data. This combination of NLP, CL and ML techniques
                     with spatial analysis methods creates powerful resources to discover unsuspected
                     geographies in the textual reports. Our model will allow scholars of colonial Latin
                     America to learn new information, extract it, cross–link it to other document
                     resources, and, most importantly, study significant historical topics, such as those
                     we discuss in section 3.5 below.

                     The first is a digital version of the RGs corpus, annotated in accordance with
                     analytical categories that can be applied to other corpora through an interoperable
                     ontology. The second is a digital gazetteer containing geographic coordinates as well
                     as political, cultural, administrative and physical data, not only of the
                     sixteenth-century sites mentioned in the RGs, but from other relevant sources and
                     historical periods. The third is a set of software tools that link the spatial
                     information contained in the gazetteer with the textual and pictorial contents of
                     the
                     RGs in order to facilitate the discovery and analysis of geographies not immediately
                     apprehended with normal reading.

                     economic, historic and cultural information from all the kingdoms and territories
                     under their rule. The initiative emerged not only from the need to control the
                     exploitation of resources and resolve important issues such as land possession,
                     management of labor and the transfer of privileges to colonists, but also to compile

                     <span class="error"><a class="ref" href="#delagarza1983">#delagarza1983</a></span>. This involved both collecting descriptions and making
                     maps [<a class="ref" href="#mundy1996">Mundy 1996</a>, 1–27]. The whole project included Castile,
                     Aragon, Italy, the Netherlands, Portugal (since its annexation in 1581), and the
                     viceroyalties of Peru and New Spain.

                     questionnaires. These were conceived by Juan de Ovando and sent to the Indies in 1569
                     (37 questions), 1570 (200 questions) and 1573 (135 questions). The responses that
                     came back to Madrid, however, were scarce, probably because the burden of collecting
                     data was put on high-level ecclesiastical and government officials who lacked the
                     necessary knowledge or were not willing to answer so many questions.

                     observations about moon eclipses from various parts of the Indies [<a class="ref" href="#cline1964">Cline 1964</a>]. This would allow solving the elusive problem of determining
                     longitude coordinates for the American territories, which in turn would make it

                     (CL) — which allows for extracting the most statistically significant phrases that
                     are found next to a term or keyword of interest (the “collocates,” in CL
                     jargon). Our variant of the technique is <em class="term">geographic collocation
                        analysis</em>, originally developed by the research group at Lancaster [<a class="ref" href="#gregory2015">Gregory et al. 2015</a>]
                     [<a class="ref" href="#murrieta-flores2015">Murrieta-Flores et al. 2015</a>]

                     [<a class="ref" href="#murrieta-flores2017b">Murrieta-Flores and Gregory 2017</a>]. This facilitates the recognition and
                     retrieval, across the corpus, of all place names that collocate or are close to a
                     keyword of interest according to a predefined proximity threshold, usually defined
                     in
                     terms of the maximum number of words between the search–term and the collocate. In
                     this manner, if a researcher is interested in investigating economic aspects related
                     to agriculture, they could retrieve, for instance, all phrases in the context of
                     words like <span class="foreign i">maíz</span>, <span class="foreign i">siembra</span>, <span class="foreign i">subsistencia</span>, <span class="foreign i">mantenimientos</span>, <span class="foreign i">comida</span>
                     (i.e. “maize”, “sowing”, “subsistence”, “sustenance”,
                     “food”), which would appear linked to a map showing the geographic locations
                     where such terms appear.

                        the coexistence of competing systems of land ownership and labor in New Spain
                        during the colonial period. In New Spain during the short time of compilation of
                        the RGs, there was a strong debate about the system of <span class="foreign i">encomiendas</span> and the desire to replace it with the so-called <span class="foreign i">repartimientos</span>. The <span class="foreign i">encomienda</span> was the right to exploit the labor of indigenous
                        populations, granted by the Spanish Crown to conquistadors, who at the beginning
                        of the colonization held this privilege in perpetuity and could, therefore, pass
                        it to their descendants with little intervention from the royal government in
                        Madrid. In contrast, the <span class="foreign i">repartimiento</span> only
                        allocated the labor force of native workers for a fixed period of time in exchange
                        for a meager remuneration. The latter gave the royal government more control over
                        its subjects and resources. Neither the holders of <span class="foreign i">encomiendas</span> nor <span class="foreign i">repartimientos</span> were
                        allowed to appropriate lands, as private property was reserved for <span class="foreign i">haciendas</span>. These three systems coexisted in the 1570s
                        despite the enactment of the so-called New Laws in 1542, which attempted to
                        protect the rights of the indigenous populations and prevent the dispossession of
                        their lands by abolishing the <span class="foreign i">encomiendas</span>.
                        Throughout the texts of the RGs, therefore, it is common to find claims by
                        conquistadors’ descendants of their <span class="foreign i">encomienda</span>
                        rights, and others defending the benefits of <span class="foreign i">repartimientos</span>. A comprehensive study of the claims and contentions
                        found in the RG corpus would improve our understanding of the period.

                        structures of governance in New Spain. The early colonial period was a time when
                        the functions and spheres of influence of the four branches of colonial government
                        were not well defined, and consequently the spatial boundaries of the judicial,
                        administrative, military and ecclesiastical jurisdictions overlapped (Figure 10).
                        This was especially true at the municipal level. Consequently, the corpus contains
                        terms associated with several kinds of jurisdictions whose meanings were not
                        consistent throughout the vast territory of New Spain (e.g. <span class="hi italic">partidos de clérigos</span>, <span class="hi italic">distrito de mision</span>, <span class="hi italic">custodia</span>, <span class="hi italic">guardianía</span>, <span class="hi italic">vicaría, presidencia, </span>etc.). The subject has been a matter
                        of ongoing debate among historians (Gerhard, 1972b: 66), but we believe that
                        applying collocation analysis for extracting the contextual use of such words
                        would shed light on how those institutions functioned in parallel to <span class="hi italic">alcaldías mayores</span> and <span class="hi italic">corregimientos</span>

                        territories in New Spain. By reading the RGs, we could attempt to identify the

                        belonging to <span class="foreign i">corregimientos</span> (territorial
                        demarcations for administrative and judicial purposes) mentioned in the corpus.
                        Circa 1570, there were 200 of such units whose frontiers have been outlined by

                        demarcations (towns, villages) suffered adjustments in boundaries and
                        jurisdictions. As Gerhard points out, at the time of the RGs, “[e]arly civil and ecclesiastical divisions lost importance and were
                        eliminated; others came into being as a result of conquest, proselytization,
                        mining activity, and other causes”
                        [<a class="ref" href="#gerhard1972b">Gerhard 1972b</a>, 66–9]. The application of a mathematical model
                        that analyzes the maximum available territory around each settlement within a
                        region, like the one proposed by <a href="#ducke2008">Ducke and Kroefges
                           (2008)</a>, could provide preliminary hypotheses on such demarcations. These

                        corpus through geographic collocation analysis. One of the many ways that such a

                        administrators take for their visits to towns within their jurisdiction, the
                        distances they traversed, the geographic features and topography of the landscape,
                        etc. (Figure 10) This, and much other information, is available throughout the

                        with Prehispanic times? These are all questions that GTA could help to answer by
                        collocating words and phrases related to health (such as diseases, symptoms, and
                        remedies) and analyzing them with spatial mathematical models of disease

                        information on natural resources such as plants. There are already interesting
                        archaeological, historical and ethnographic research related to plants and their
                        use in Mesoamerica, medicinal and otherwise [<a class="ref" href="#alboreszarate2015">Albores Zarate 2015</a>]

                        assessing the importance of the trees and edible plants introduced by Europeans.
                        With the annotation of the RGs in this project and the development of GTA, it is
                        now possible not only to extract information regarding native and European plants
                        introduced in the different regions of New Spain, but also to contribute to
                        further debates. It is known, for instance, that Mesoamerican cultures had an
                        extended knowledge of plants for medicinal use and most of the research about this
                        has been carried out using colonial primary sources. We could now create a map of
                        all the plants mentioned in the RGs and compare this dataset with archaeological
                        data and other primary sources that were dedicated to the recording of medicinal
                        plants, such as the Códice Badiano or the Historia Natural de Nueva España. This
                        would allow researchers, for instance, to assess the continuation in the use of
                        specific plants for remedies and consumption in specific regions of New Spain.
                        Other interesting avenues of possible research with GTA analysis are the
                        availability of food and animals both native and introduced, the use of natural
                        resources, the existence of cultural artefacts, the presence of priests and
                        religious orders in particular regions, as well as types of architecture.

                     identifying those parts that deserve a “close reading.” This flexibility has
                     been demonstrated in previous research projects employing GTA [<a class="ref" href="#donaldson2017">Donaldson et al. 2017</a>]

                     terms of identifying information patterns and hypothesis–testing across large
