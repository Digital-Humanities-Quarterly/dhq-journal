            <p>This article identifies some of the popular and historical contradictions inherent to
               the very notion of close reading digital literature, and puts forth an updated
               conception of what the author argues continues to be a vital practice of literary

               historical conception of close reading and the sort of materially-conscious
               hermeneutics that digital textuality requires. The author applies the updated
               conception of close reading digital literature to Steve Tomasula's <title rend="italic">TOC</title>

         <head>The Materialities of Close Reading: 1942, 1959, 2009</head>

         <p>Contrary to the practice of reading <soCalled>hypertext</soCalled> in a critical vacuum
            as a revolutionary technology with untold implications for the production and reception
            of texts, it is the close analysis of actual works of digital literature — literary
            works written on and for the computer screen — that marks what has come to be known as a
            second generation of digital-literary scholarship.<note>Referring to Joan Campàs'
               observations about digital literature being <q>more often browsed
                  than read,</q> N. Katherine Hayles writes, <cit>
                  <quote rend="inline" source="#hayles2008">although, recently, in what we might call the second
                     generation of hypertext criticism as practiced by such critics as David
                     Ciccoricco, Terry Harpold, Matthew Kirschenbaum, and Jessica Pressman,
                     electronic literature <emph>is</emph> read, and read very closely</quote>
                  <ptr loc="190 n31" target="#hayles2008"/>
               </cit>
            </note> A growing body of <soCalled>digital born</soCalled> literature is uniquely
            positioned in its ability to use new and still relatively unfamiliar tools to mobilize
            formal and material innovation in expressly literary fashion while using the same tools
            to reflect on a cultural moment of great technological change. Scholars moreover are
            uniquely positioned to extend contemporary literary and narrative theory given this new
            mode of cultural production. Nevertheless, I would argue that if there is any trouble
            with second generation digital-literary criticism it would be the celebration of both
            the practice and the very possibility of close reading works digital literature, while
            at the same time failing to adequately articulate what <soCalled>close
               reading</soCalled> means, or must come to mean, in digital environments.</p>
         <p>Some attempts to address this problem have deepened it: first, close readings of digital
            literature have a tendency to collapse into a strictly visual semiotics — by which I
            refer to analyses of both pictographic material and text treated iconographically
               <emph>at the expense of</emph> its verbal or referential qualities.
               <soCalled>Reading</soCalled> images and animations and celebrating text-as-image is
            undeniably necessary when reading media-rich, visually dynamic works of digital
            literature; the interplay between media elements is indeed a definitive characteristic
            of the field. But in this view <soCalled>reading skills</soCalled> refers primarily to
            an interpretation of image and animation and comes to unnecessarily dominate an emerging
            conception of digital literacy. In this view, close reading elides conceptual
            understanding that arises from the verbal and the textual. I grant the need to employ
            the term and the practice of <soCalled>reading</soCalled> in such a way as to
            accommodate not only visual texts but participatory ones as well. N. Katherine Hayles,
            for instance, refers to textual installations in digital environments that <cit>
               <quote rend="inline" source="#hayles2008">create an enriched sense of embodied play that complicates and
                     <emph>extends</emph> the phenomenology of reading</quote>
               <dhq:citRef> (emphasis added), <ptr target="#hayles2008" loc="152"/>
               </dhq:citRef>
            </cit>. <quote rend="inline" source="#hayles2008">Reading in this view,</quote> she writes, <cit>
               <quote rend="inline" source="#hayles2008">becomes a complex performance in which agency is distributed
                  between the user, the interface, and the active cognitions of the networked and
                  programmable machine</quote>
               <ptr target="#hayles2008" loc="153"/>
            </cit>. But one cannot help but notice when such an extension becomes an
               elision.<note>There are sufficient examples of such elision, and any cursory survey
               of notable digital literature collections, such as the <title>Electronic Literature
                  Organization Collection Volume I</title>, or the early <title>Electronic
                  Literature Directory</title>, or even special journal editions devoted to the
               field, such as <title rend="italic">Dichtung Digital</title>'s <title rend="quotes">New Perspectives on Digital Literature,</title> will tend to reflect the same
               situation: the number of primarily text-based or narrative-driven titles is small,
               compared to the number of other (generative, algorithmic, primarily visual, or video
               game) titles under consideration. Meanwhile, conferences and events devoted to
               recovering the importance of text and reading in digital art and culture can
               perpetuate the very elision they are trying to move beyond. For example, a 2009
               conference on <title rend="quotes">Reading Digital Literature</title> emphasized that
               digital literacy <cit>
                  <quote rend="inline" source="#simanowski2009">after all is still inevitably based on reading skills</quote>
                  <ptr target="#simanowski2009"/>
               </cit> while the analyses it elicited often concerned installation art in which, for
               example, <quote rend="inline" source="#simanowski2009">one mostly does not engage in the reading process, but
                  rather plays with the rain of letters. The text has been transformed into visual
                  objects,</quote> or <cit>
                  <quote rend="inline" source="#simanowski2009">if you step back from the screens and take in the
                     installation as a whole, you're not really reading anymore; you're perceiving
                     this plethora of text as part of a trance-like experience</quote>
                  <ptr target="#simanowski2009"/>
               </cit>. While the situation is not a problem in itself (and may indeed simply reflect
               the ontology of what we call digital literature), it is highly relevant in guiding
               our understanding and application of close reading in digital environments. </note>
            The practice of "reading" dynamic images does not need to signify the only or even the
            primary kind of interpretive work that is done on digital fiction and poetry, and will
            not, on its own, answer the question of what close reading means for digital literature. </p>
         <p>Another reason why attempts to answer the question of what close reading means for
            digital literature fall short is the tendency to apply an overbroad and uncritical
            notion of <soCalled>close reading</soCalled> itself. We know that, on the surface, the
            popular — or what we might call the <emph>institutionalized</emph> — conception of close
            reading conflicts dramatically with the object in question here: a multi-medial
            multi-modal digital artifact that simply refuses to stay still. And, of course, this is
            what makes digital literature so valuable for shaking up literary studies. But the
            closer we look, the more we find that close reading <emph>in the historical sense</emph>
            serves up an even greater set of contradictions for digital literature. </p>
         <p>The application of an overbroad and uncritical notion of <soCalled>close
               reading</soCalled> is by no means restricted to those working in the field; the
            institutionalized conception has become, for better and for worse, an atomized one. But
            if we are going to redefine this figure in any productive way in light of digital media,
            we need a ground from which to work. This need to revisit and re-animate close reading
            is, furthermore, much more than a matter of terminology. If one agrees with Jane Gallop
            who argues that the practice of close reading is not only what defines literary study as
            a discipline and methodology, but also amounts to our single most effective <cit>
               <quote rend="inline" source="#gallop2007">anti-authoritarian pedagogy</quote>
               <ptr target="#gallop2007" loc="185"/>
            </cit>
            <note>Gallop frames close reading as inherently opposed to both older authoritarian
               models of learning and contemporary models in other disciplines that rely on a <soCalled>banking model</soCalled> of <q>depositing</q>
               knowledge directly into the student. Close reading, as inherited from New Criticism,
               not only affords literary studies with a transparent methodology but also enables a
               form of active learning <ptr target="#gallop2007" loc="1845"/>. </note> then literary
            studies would be foolish to forfeit its power to wield such a practice <emph>beyond the
               confines of print</emph>. In short, <soCalled>close reading</soCalled> demands our
            devout and continued intellectual oversight. </p>
         <p>In what follows, my intention is to work through some of the prevailing popular and
            historical contradictions inherent to close reading digital literature, and put forth an
            updated conception of what is ultimately a vital practice of literary study. In the
            process, I'll establish some line of continuity — or perhaps more appropriately for a
            hypertextually-minded project — insert a link between a pre-digital historical
            conception of close reading and the sort of materially-conscious hermeneutics that
            digital textuality requires. Finally I'll use Steve Tomasula's <title rend="italic">TOC</title>
            <ptr target="#tomasula2009"/>, a self-described <quote rend="inline" source="#tomasula2009">new media
               novel,</quote> as a model to apply such a conception of close reading to digital
            literature.</p>

         <div>
            <head> The Matter of Historical Close Reading </head>
            <p> On the surface, there are good reasons to presume that New Criticism, the critical
               and pedagogical impulse most often associated with close reading, would be highly
               compatible with the enterprise of digital-literary scholarship.<note>Close reading
                  was not concomitant with the criticism that New Criticism professed; rather, as
                  Wellek describes, <cit>
                     <quote rend="inline" source="#wellek1995">the method of close reading became the pedagogical weapon
                        of the New Criticism</quote>
                     <ptr loc="65" target="#wellek1995"/>
                  </cit>. </note> For one, the New Critics were open about their desire to make
               literary criticism, in the words of Ransom, <cit>
                  <quote rend="inline" source="#ransom1937">more scientific, or precise and systematic</quote>
                  <ptr target="#ransom1937"/>
               </cit>. Many of them, Allen Tate especially, even saw poetry, above and beyond
               science, as the only vehicle that could provide a unique and complete form of
               knowledge <ptr target="#wellek1995" loc="65"/>. It is clear, moreover, that they
               wanted to create a cohesive field, however crass Ransom's own admittedly
                  <soCalled>distasteful</soCalled> conception of <soCalled>Criticism Inc.</soCalled>
               may have conveyed itself over the years.<note> We know that the substance of close
                  reading is somewhat sullied. The alleged myopia of the New Critics and their
                  legacy has proved catastrophic, in this debasement narrative, for our
                  understanding of race, class, gender and, more broadly, our deeper historical
                  consciousness. In short defense of the debased conception of close reading, it can
                  be said that New Criticism was wittingly blind to what has been called extrinsic
                  textual factors so that the intrinsic factors of the text itself could have their
                  own day in the sun. There is also no shortage of secondary scholarship that
                  opposes the notion of the New Critics as resolutely or absolutely ahistorical.
                  Spurlin and Fischer's 1995 edited collection on <title rend="italic">The New
                     Criticism and Contemporary Literary Theory</title>, for one, dismantles this
                  broad-stroke ahistoricism by either excavating evidence of historical
                  consciousness in the New Critical oeuvre or contextualizing the more radical calls
                  for history's exclusion as a direct response to the "Old Historicism" that left
                  literary criticism without a clear mandate and in need of a disciplinary home in
                  the first place. But one does not need to offer an extended apologia for the New
                  Critics in order to establish that close reading, and everything it stands for,
                  has survived. It has survived both the theory boon and the New Historicism that
                  followed it (meanwhile, we can thank Paul de Man for showing us that
                  deconstruction never really threatened the sanctified realm of close reading but
                  rather <cit>
                     <quote rend="inline" source="#gallop2007">infused it with new zeal</quote>
                     <ptr target="#gallop2007" loc="182"/>
                  </cit>). </note>
            </p>
            <p> But, notwithstanding the inherent difficulty of speaking about any diverse group of
               scholars as a collective, the New Critics were under no illusion that they were going
               to create a positivistic discipline that could adopt the same brand of (scientific)
               method albeit in the service of a different brand of truth. Rather, it can be said
               that they were employing the very word <q>scientific</q> in a
               literary way; for them, close reading in particular was far from a technical endeavor
                  <ptr target="#wellek1995" loc="65"/>. In Ransom's own often-quoted plea for a
                  <q>scientific</q> criticism, his own much less often quoted
               qualification follows: <cit>
                  <quote rend="inline" source="#ransom1937">It will never be a very exact science, or even a nearly exact
                     one… It does not matter whether we call them sciences or just systematic
                     studies; the total effort of each to be effective must be consolidated and kept
                     going</quote>
                  <ptr target="#ransom1937"/>
               </cit>. The New Critics were on the whole unlikely candidates for proto-technologists
               or budding digital humanists. Indeed, New Criticism was marked by suspicion of an
               increasingly industrialized and technologized society to the point of
                  insularity.<note> This insularity was perhaps epitomized in the 1930
                  manifesto-laden collection <title rend="italic">I'll Take My Stand: the South and
                     the agrarian tradition</title>, in which twelve <q>Southerners</q> penned essays celebrating rural life and traditional
                  values while flirting with Neo-Confederatism. Despite its reactionary rhetoric,
                  even for the day (it would not fare well under postcolonial eyes), the collection
                  was highly influential. Many of its contributors — among them John Crowe Ransom,
                  Robert Penn Warren, Allen Tate, and Donald Davidson — had by then already made a
                  name for themselves as part of the Fugitive poets, writing poetry for the magazine
                  of the same name in the early 1920s. In order to truly foster the arts, their
                  argument went, we would need to rehabilitate an agrarian society that valued
                  tradition, history, and self-sufficiency over the dehumanizing effects they felt
                  bearing down on them from the growing urban economies of the North. </note> As the
               literary historian M.A.R. Habib writes, the New Critics <cit>
                  <quote rend="inline" source="#habib2005">attempted to foster an elite which might safeguard culture

               and modernization would mean for literary art and criticism: they were even
               suspicious of what they saw as an overly technical approach to literary criticism
               preceding them in the Russian formalists, whose <soCalled>mechanistic</soCalled>

               reading digital literature.</p>
            <p> An elaborate example of New Criticism's problems with scientism plays out in Richard
               Palmer's 1969 <title rend="italic">Hermeneutics</title>, where he claims that despite <cit>
                  <quote rend="inline" source="#palmer1969">all its humanistic pretensions and flamboyant defenses of
                     poetry in an <q>age of technology,</q> modern literary
                     criticism has itself become increasingly technological. More and more, it has
                     imitated the approach of the scientist</quote>
                  <ptr target="#palmer1969" loc="6"/>
               </cit>. While Palmer grants that the New Critics were <quote rend="inline" source="#palmer1969">essentially right about the autonomy of the literary work of art</quote> and the
               pitfalls of the intentional fallacy,<note> On these points Palmer is actually much
                  more sympathetic to New Criticism than Wellek's reframing of Palmer's position as
                  an <quote rend="inline" source="#wellek1995">indifferent scientism</quote> would allow <ptr target="#wellek1995" loc="66"/>. </note> they are here guilty by implication.
               And though he later provides similar qualification that New Criticism <cit>
                  <quote rend="inline" source="#palmer1969">constitutes in some ways an exception</quote>
                  <ptr target="#palmer1969" loc="225"/>
               </cit> to this technological approach, he ultimately faults their emphasis on

                  <ptr target="#palmer1969" loc="247"/>
               </cit>. He further charges that in treating the literary text as an autonomous
               object, it becomes an entity to be mastered, and since complete mastery or control
               does not equate to a complete understanding of the work, this is a false goal <ptr target="#palmer1969" loc="226"/>. Palmer concludes that New Critical readings

               moving target — has spared New Criticism from a more direct attack.<note> A more
                  recent critique (albeit one no less reactionary on the topic of technology and the
                  humanities) argues that despite their attempt to construct a literary safe-house
                  within which to practice and preserve their craft, New Criticism in fact
                  internalized the technoculture it sought to escape: <cit>
                     <quote rend="block" source="#russo1998">The New Critics of the 1940s and 1950s attempted to protect
                        the verbal artifact from the pressures of historical necessity and mere
                        utility; yet their method was a direct reflection of those pressures. New
                        Criticism was a kind of synecdochic condensation of the technological system
                        in its antihistoricism; its objective neutrality and treatment of the poem
                        as a clinical specimen; its quasi-scientific emphasis on specialization and
                        method together with a meager, mostly inconsequential theorizing; its myths
                        of synthesis and autolechy; its metaphors for organization. The New Critics
                        fostered a straightforward, roll-up-your-sleeves approach to criticism that
                        valued technocratic expertise, teamwork, bureaucratized efficiency, and
                        anonymity (though a few top stars always get the prizes).</quote>

            </p>
            <p> Palmer's discussion of textual autonomy leads us to a related reason why we might
               expect a high degree of compatibility between New Critical close reading and close
               reading in the domain of digital humanities. The New Critical commitment to reading a
               literary work on its own terms as a literary work (not biography, not history, not
               cultural or political critique), along with their mantra of <soCalled>the text
                  itself,</soCalled> would appear to point toward a deeper interest in the text as
               just that: a text, which is to say, a material artifact. Any focus on materiality
               would make them kindred scholars with those who would later confront the materiality
               of a new medium with the rise of digital culture. Their intense preoccupation with
               form would likewise suggest a potential affinity with theorists of digital
               textuality, who inevitably find themselves indulging in a new kind of Formalism when
               reading texts on the screen whose own internal tensions are networked and
               programmable. </p>
            <p> But this sense of kindredness and affinity overlooks a crucial quality of the New
               Critical attitude toward their object. The text, for these scholars, was both much
               more and much less than the tangible product of the prevailing inscription
               technologies of the day. In their search for paradox, irony, ambiguity, and — above
               all — meaning, the site of interplay of these elements effectively became the textual
               object, or rather supplanted it. The body of the <soCalled>text itself</soCalled> was
               a function of what Jane Newman describes as <quote rend="inline" source="#newman2010">the fundamental
                  Platonism</quote> of the New Critics' conception of close reading: <cit>
                  <quote rend="inline" source="#newman2010">The preferred 'object' of [New Criticism's] affection is in
                     fact an abstract creation. The embrace of the Idea of the Text</quote>
                  <ptr target="#newman2010"/>
               </cit>. The body of the text for the New Critics was thus an abstract, dematerialized
               body. It is true that any hermeneutical process will involve the creation or
               recreation of some kind of abstract model, but the point is that for the New Critics
               the medium was not the message nor even a part of it. We are left with an inherent
               contradiction for close reading digital literature: one simply cannot close read
               digital text in the New Critical sense, for reading a text as a text does not work
               when you can no longer take the <soCalled>text</soCalled> to be an idealized abstract
               site of formal interplay. </p>
            <p> If history presents some contradictions for close reading digital literature, then
               history can also surmount them. In fact, the figure who moves us out of and beyond
               this impasse is also the same one often positioned at the headwaters of New Criticism
               itself — I.A. Richards. Widely considered first among those influencing the New
               Critical tradition, Richards (much like his student and fellow Englishman William
               Empson after him) never fit comfortably in it. Richards attempted to negotiate a path
               between affective interpretations by readers and the formal elements that inhere in
               literary texts and structure a more or less appropriate or accurate interpretation. A
               clear example of this negotiation is his 1929 <title rend="italic">Practical
                  Criticism</title>, in which he conducts an experiment by asking students to
               respond to a series of unidentified poems (in the mold of what would come to be
               called Reader Response theory) then proceeds to categorize that data set using
               principles that reflect the New Critical method. Outside of the fortified
               disciplinary perimeter of literary criticism, Richards also rode the two-cultures
               debate with more courage and panache than most if not all of his peers, even if his
               attempt to instill scientific rigor in literary criticism while at the same time
               insisting that poetic language was non-referential and able to access only
               pseudo-truths was indeed having it both ways in the end. </p>
            <p> As a literary critic, Richards certainly contains multitudes, and literary
               historians are quick to point out when his theories were undermined by his practice
               (see, for instance, <ptr target="#habib2005" loc="626"/>). He was, however,
               remarkably unique in the way his work — both in theory and in practice — recognized
               and embraced the materiality of literary texts and literary criticism. In terms of
               his theory, he famously meditated on the ontology of his own book, <title rend="italic">Principles of Literary Criticism</title>, as a <quote rend="inline" source="#habib2005">machine to think with,</quote> then did it over again in a revised preface for
               the same work two years later. The two prefaces differ in their choice of machine. In
               the first: <cit>
                  <quote rend="inline" source="#richards1926">A book is a machine to think with, but it need not attempt to
                     emulate a force-pump</quote>
                  <dhq:citRef>1924 Preface, <ptr target="#richards1926" loc="1"/>
                  </dhq:citRef>
               </cit>. And in the second: <cit>
                  <quote rend="inline" source="#richards1952">A book is a machine to think with, but it need not,
                     therefore, usurp the functions either of the bellows or the locomotive. This
                     book might better be compared to a loom on which it is proposed to re-weave
                     some ravelled parts of our civilization</quote>
                  <dhq:citRef>1928 Preface, <ptr target="#richards1952" loc="1"/>
                  </dhq:citRef>
               </cit>. In both iterations, we see a distinction drawn between the machinations of
               literary criticism and those more crude though perhaps more precise operations of
               industrial machinery (his literary machine need not emulate or usurp these other
               functions); and, by extension, we can also see a re-inscription of Richards' division
               of poetic and scientific modes of thought. In the second instance, moreover, he
               introduces yet another machine that offers a better analogue for the type of
               functions his text performs: the loom, which productively invokes the Latin etymology
               of <q>text,</q> from <foreign>texere</foreign>, to weave. </p>
            <p> But by pushing these metaphors even further, Richards' simple editorial exercise
               also lends itself to an even fuller reading along cybernetic lines. First, even
               though we understand Richards' famous analogy to imply that his book is a machine
               that we, his readers, can think with, it is of course also something he himself is
               thinking with as he creates, and re-creates it. It is this process of re-creation in
               a slightly amended preface that enacts a kind of cybernetic feedback loop. In effect,
               we have a reflexive description of a system that is itself also simultaneously, and
               iteratively, at work: books are machines to think with, a process which in turn
               produces more machines to think with, which in turn… and so on. </p>
            <p> In addition, with his slight revision we no longer simply have <title rend="italic">Principles of Literary Criticism</title>, the <emph>work</emph>; rather, we have
                  <title rend="italic">Principles of Literary Criticism</title>, the
                  <emph>network</emph>. Some would be inclined to call this bibliography or textual
               criticism, which would be entirely justified. Though one crucial difference remains
               in the fact that there is really not much point in arguing for a definitive version
               of the preface; the network, by definition, remains decentralized. The significance
               instead resides in the fact that the internal and inter-textual relations of the
               prefaces — of the network — are open for reading and, indeed, close reading. </p>
            <p> In the process of feeding the concept of close reading digital literature itself
               through the work of New Criticism in general and Richards in particular, one
               furthermore encounters a sort of density of activity — or, in more hypertextual
               parlance, what we might describe as a significant hub in the network topology —
               around the year 1942. That year marked the publication of Richards' <title rend="italic">How to Read a Page: A Course in Effective Reading with an
                  Introduction to a Hundred Great Words,</title> its very title indicating a
               deliberate attention to textual anatomies. The introduction, moreover, yields yet
               another revisitation of his preface, in which we are able to further contextualize
               his choice of machines. <quote rend="inline" source="#richards1954">Some books,</quote> he writes, <quote rend="inline" source="#richards1954">endeavor to transport their readers or drag them passively hither
                  and thither</quote> (the locomotive); whereas <quote rend="inline" source="#richards1954">others aim to
                  stuff them, with facts or other supposedly fattening matter</quote> (the force
               pump and the bellows); and, finally, he adds a few more machines to the mix,
               including pulverizers, consolidators, and the microscope, <cit>
                  <quote rend="inline" source="#richards1954">which can take the most familiar things and lay scraps and
                     details of them before us, so transmuted by the new conditions under which we
                     see them that we lose all power of recognizing or putting them together
                     again…</quote>
                  <ptr target="#richards1954" loc="10"/>
               </cit>. In perhaps a proto-hypertextual spirit privileging reader choice, however,
               this time he makes it clear that readers of the present book will have to <quote rend="inline" source="#richards1954">choose for themselves which sort of machine they will compare this
                  book to,</quote> adding that <cit>
                  <quote rend="inline" source="#richards1954">I do not believe a washing machine or a combination harvester
                     is the right one</quote>
                  <ptr target="#richards1954" loc="10"/>
               </cit>. </p>
            <p> In addition, in that 1942 text, Richards began his peculiar typographical experiment
               of using specialized quotation marks. These meta-semantic signifiers were an attempt
               to redress what Richards called the <quote rend="inline" source="#richards1954">inordinately heavy
                  task</quote> that quotations typically take on in critical writing <ptr target="#richards1954" loc="67"/>. For example, a superscripted pair of <q>w's</q> indicated that a word is being talked about as a word
               while a pair of <q>n's</q> indicates that <quote rend="inline" source="#richards1954">the word is the name that is being used… though we may not think it is a good
                  name</quote> — similar to the phrase <cit>
                  <quote rend="inline" source="#richards1954">the so called ______</quote>
                  <ptr target="#richards1954" loc="68–9"/>
               </cit>. Insertions such as these, he had hoped, would <cit>
                  <quote rend="inline" source="#richards1954">abridge both the intellectual and optical labor of the
                     reader</quote>
                  <ptr target="#richards1954" loc="67"/>
               </cit>. While his readers may have found this typographical affectation curious, and
               his publishers certainly found it intolerable, Richards, nonetheless, in the very act
               of scripting meta-signification, might have been signaling a pre-historic,
               externalized form of HTML as well. </p>
            <p> After all, if Richards toyed with intervening in basic typographical conventions to
               facilitate reading practices, hypertext technology demanded it. The standard HTML
               design typography for Web browsers are, of course, not in the form of superscripts
               but underlined and color-coded text. One would expect, for instance, underlined text
               that appears in a web interface to be the site of a hyperlink, and its color will
               communicate further basic information to the reader: blue suggests that <quote rend="inline" source="#richards1954">you can go somewhere else from here,</quote> while purple suggests
               that <quote rend="inline" source="#richards1954">you've already been there.</quote> Richards' experiment,
               clearly, involves a circumscribed and somewhat idiosyncratic system; that is, these
               scripts were pointing not to some universal understanding of linguistic categories,
               but back to his own inescapably stylized explanations of them (hence, the very need
               for his own <title rend="quotes">Key</title>). Nonetheless, it anticipates the
               tension between universal typologies and a context-based pragmatics that would emerge
               with the varied projects of categorizing hyperlinks (as evidenced in Susanna Pajares
               Tosca's <title rend="quotes">A Pragmatics of Links,</title> or, in relation to
               hypertext and narrative fiction, Jeff Parker's <title rend="quotes">A Poetics of the
                  Link</title>). Moreover, Richards' endeavor anticipates other experiments by those
               scholars working in digital environments who similarly have found that the standard
               HTML adornments have likewise taken on an <soCalled>inordinately heavy
                  task</soCalled> for critical readers and writers. In his hypertext essay <title rend="quotes">Hypertext Syntagmas,</title> Adrian Miles, for example, uses
               different text link colors to refer to different strands of scholarly reference,
               including blue for <soCalled>canonical,</soCalled> red for
                  <soCalled>commentary,</soCalled> and green for <soCalled>quotation.</soCalled>
            </p>
            <p> Some readings of Richards' intervention have been unsympathetic; Paul Fry, for one,

            <p> Richards undertook another important experiment in 1942. About a decade prior, his
               colleague C. K. Ogden proposed the idea of formalizing a pared-down, instrumentalized
               version of English to serve as an international second language and aid in language
               acquisition. He called it Basic English. Richards, during his involvement in the
               project, saw a potential synergy between this simplified standardized language and
               the affordances of contemporary mass media. He started conceiving of ways that their
               simplified language set (which included 850 key words along with a number of
               fundamental grammatical patterns) could be represented in visual form, and
               subsequently reproduced — or, indeed, mass-produced — in varied media forms. In 1942
               he went to Disney Studios, which would assist him with the design and production of a
               series of stick figure drawings of people, places, and things that would eventually
               appear in his multi-volume <title rend="italic">Language Through Pictures</title>, an
               expansion of the Basic English project <ptr target="#russo1998"/>. As John Paul Russo
               notes, <cit>
                  <quote rend="inline" source="#russo1998">the series eventually went into record, tape, television and
                     computer, easily adapting itself to the evolving media</quote>
                  <ptr target="#russo1998"/>
               </cit>.<note> Russo's own criticism of the project follows: <cit>
                     <quote rend="inline" source="#russo1998">While Basic offered an ideal of technological efficiency —
                        it was supposedly quick and easy to learn — it tended to reduce language
                        from a complex instrument of intellectual analysis into a collection of
                        purely functional or operational phrases</quote>
                     <ptr target="#russo1998"/>
                  </cit>. It helps to recall Richards' own dualistic understanding of
                  literary/poetic and non-literary language in light of such dismissals, and instead
                  consider the endeavor prescient for anticipating a problem that lies at the heart
                  of experiments in Artificial Intelligence and natural language processing, which
                  were then gaining tremendous momentum with advancements in modern computing.
               </note> Here we have a multi-modal, multi-medial experiment in language acquisition
               and an attempt to technologize the word, no less one done in conjunction with that
               bastion of pop-cultural production — Disney. </p>
            <p> Thus, 1942 provides a logical place to anchor one link that will allow us to
               reconcile some of the contradictions implicit in a historically minded application of
               close reading to digital literature, and help establish a pre-digital critical
               genealogy for digital literature (one that, moreover, stretches back further than a
               beleaguered <soCalled>hypertext theory</soCalled> of the early 1990s). Nevertheless,
               when it comes to close reading in dynamic digital environments, further modifications
               to methodology are necessary. How do we productively redirect a conception of the
               well-wrought urn toward, say, the well-wrought node, or, for that matter, the
               well-wrought code?</p>

            <p>In 1976, lamenting the perceived threat of technology to literary art and study, E.D.
               Hirsch wrote, <cit>
                  <quote rend="inline" source="#hirsch1976">The jargon of the technocrat whose terms of 'input' and

               indeed, a foundational difference between print and digital textuality. Moreover, we
               are quite comfortable — albeit not passively uncritical — of the fact that Hirsch's
               description of us as metaphorical machines has in some ways crossed into the literal
               realm. That is, we do not have to adopt Marvin Minsky's popular reduction of the
               human to a <soCalled>meat machine</soCalled> in order to realize that we now operate
               in a rich site of posthuman — and arguably posthumanist — textual activity. We become
               part of an integrated circuit that runs between body, text, and machine, and
               completes the feedback loop in a way that print literature does not.<note>See also

            <p>There is certainly no denying the complexity of the (intellectual, ethical, emotive)

               that accounts for textual mobility, autonomy, and materiality in new ways.</p>
            <p>A first step in close reading digital literature is abandoning the classical notion
               of organic wholeness and unity, for it is neither present as a criterion in the mode
               of New Criticism nor <emph>absent</emph> in the sense that poststructuralist
               criticism has always already <q>told you so.</q> It would seem
               to be a fairly straightforward observation to say that the notion of the text as an
               autonomous and autotelic object is untenable in digital environments because the
               boundaries of the text itself are so often fluid, nebulous, or at least difficult to
               discern. Furthermore, it is difficult to determine the status of navigational tools
               such graphical maps (common in stand-alone hypertext applications such as Storyspace)
               or splash page graphics, which often double as contents pages without privileging any
               singular point of entry. Online texts raise even further questions given that they
               can potentially link to any other text on the Web, a potential realized for
               transgressive ends in many digital-literary works (Deena Larsen in <title rend="italic">Disappearing Rain</title> and Lance Olsen in <title rend="italic">10:01</title> among them). Clearly, digitally-mediated textual links explode
               Genette's concept of the paratext, those liminal devices of books that reside both
               internally and externally to it <ptr target="#genette1997" loc="1–15"/>. Genette
               divides paratexts (which include anything from titles, forewords, epigraphs, and dust
               jackets, to reviews, press releases, or correspondence written to or by the author)
               in two categories based on the relative proximity of these devices to the text. Such
               an exercise proves to be problematic in digitally networked texts where all nodes are
               experientially equidistant. There are in fact several works of digital literature
               online that relish the opportunity to enfold their paratexts within themselves
               (including <title rend="italic">253</title> by Geoff Ryman and, in perhaps the most
               excessive example, <title rend="italic">The Unknown</title> by William Gillespie et
               al., which links to reviews written by the authors about their own work).<note> See
                     <ptr target="#ciccoricco2007" loc="139–42"/> for a close reading of <title rend="italic">The Unknown</title> and the poetics of excess. </note>
            </p>
            <p>But despite these challenges to a traditional conception of textual form, digital
               literature is by no means formless. In fact, in some ways close reading digital
               literature requires a new mode of literary-critical Formalism.<note> One expects
                  certain stock objections to any critical approach that is strikingly Formalist,
                  and digital-literary criticism is no exception. But the defense would go beyond a
                  stock response for digital literature: one must be Formalist to an extent when
                  talking about new forms. After all, a whole generation of theory misconstrued the
                  form — and the materiality — of digital textuality, whether we were talking about
                  flickering signifiers or a virtual text conceived in terms of purely light and
                  electricity. Part of the challenge for scholars in the field is that the further
                  they move away from their specialized circles, whether in articles or conference
                  papers, the more they must <emph>start</emph> with very formal or definitional
                  approaches because of the audience's lack of familiarity with not simply a given
                  text, but its form. Either way, a focus on form is always a means to an
                  (interpretive) end; and here we can follow art historian Yve-Alain Bois, who
                  writes that <cit>
                     <quote rend="inline" source="#bois1996">even one's most formal descriptions are always predicated
                        upon a judgment and ... the stake of this judgment is always, knowingly or
                        not, meaning ... [T]he reverse is also true: it is impossible to lay any
                        claim to meaning without specifically (and I would say initially) speaking
                        of form</quote>

                  </cit>. </note> For instance, while J. Hillis Miller has described the practice of
               (cartographically) accounting for wholes as an inheritance from New Criticism <ptr target="#miller1982" loc="17–8"/> and, with regard to its pursuit of panoptical
               perspective, adds that it <cit>

                  <ptr target="#miller1982" loc="24"/>
               </cit>, scholars of digital textuality are determined to move away from the dominant
               paradigm of a textual <emph>topography</emph>, and instead speak more accurately of
               textual <emph>topology</emph> (see <ptr target="#aarseth1997" loc="43"/> and <ptr target="#berressem2002" loc="29"/>). Given that the connectivity of points defines
               a digital network, not our ability to locate those points in space or map their
               relative distance from each other, it is more accurate to discuss the structure of
               networked forms of digital literature in terms of topology. Textual borders are thus
               not erased in digital environments; rather, they are continually renegotiated and
               redefined in a topological conceptualization.</p>
            <p>Close reading digital literature also involves close analysis of the individual
               components that comprise its topology: hypertextual nodes. In turn, we should
               recognize the possibility of close reading <emph>new bibliographical units</emph>
               that are peculiar to digital environments. In such environments you can close read an
               entire novel or poem, or an entire node. You can also close read an idiosyncratic
               path of nodes, one that will include a reading of the links that both separate and
               connect them. In digital environments, you can furthermore close read images (either
               static or dynamic) and sound (be it music or noise) in relation to the text. Of
               course, you can do the same in print environments to an extent, but <emph>only</emph>
               to an extent, for print texts do not perform, which is to say they do not execute
               their code in a material sense.<note> This passage is adapted from my contribution to

            </p>
            <p>In turn, you can close read the kinetics of the digital text <emph>in relation
                  to</emph> the text; you can close read digital literature with and against its
               interface / navigation;<note> See <ptr target="#ciccoricco2007" loc="161–87"/> for a

                  and interface of Michael Joyce's <title rend="italic">Twilight, A
                  Symphony</title>. </note> and you can close read digital literature in relation to
               its application and — its ontological bedrock — programming code.<note> The obvious
                  problem for reading code, of course, is that of accessibility; as Bootz puts it, <cit>
                     <quote rend="inline" source="#bootz2006">reading does not allow one to access all of the aesthetic
                        layers of the programmed work of a digital medium.</quote>
                     <ptr target="#bootz2006"/>
                  </cit> Some forms of digital literature — and poetry in particular — will invite
                  the practice of reading code by conspicuously introducing programming language
                  into the surface level of the text, making the code itself accessible or visible,
                  and in some cases even allowing readers to alter the code themselves (see Alan
                  Sondheim's discussion of the main forms of <soCalled>codework</soCalled>). In
                  fact, many programmers are quite willing to endorse aesthetic notions of code
                  itself that transcend the fundamental qualities of clarity and economy (see <ptr target="#mateas2006"/>). Other, more resistant texts might require
                     <soCalled>transgressive</soCalled> readings, such as exporting the individual
                  nodes of a multi-linear text and reading them in a fixed order (as Espen Aarseth
                  famously did with Michael Joyce's <title rend="italic">afternoon</title>). See
                     <ptr target="#ciccoricco2007" loc="193–5"/> for my own — admittedly somewhat
                  accidental — transgressive reading of the <soCalled>missing</soCalled> text in the
                  code of Judd Morrissey's <title rend="italic">The Jew's Daughter</title>. </note>
               (Here again, the application of topology is apt in its concern for the
                  <emph>movement</emph> of points in a dynamic field). The presence of a mobile
               material plane certainly has profound implications for how we read and interpret
               literary texts. Moreover, it might seem that close reading — if we are to think of it
               in terms of careful, deliberate, patient reading, is doomed when words and windows
               tend toward perpetual movement. In Richards' own <title rend="italic">How to Read a
                  Page</title>, he states plainly that <cit>
                  <quote rend="inline" source="#richards1954">[a]nything that is worth <emph>studying</emph> should be read
                        <emph>as slowly</emph> as it will let you, and read again and again till you
                     have it by heart"; and he chides the reader who strives for speed in the
                     attempt to read more: "Whom are they fleeing from, these running
                     readers?</quote>
                  <ptr target="#richards1954" loc="42"/>
               </cit>. Speed reading of course connotes both business-oriented bureaucratic skill
               and a bureaucratized pedagogy whereby students read for general comprehension or the
                  <soCalled>main idea.</soCalled> But despite its own penchant for kinetic text that
               can truly test human ability to read at all (a good example would be the Flash poems
               of <title rend="italic">Young-Hae Chang Heavy Industries</title>), digital literature
               does not necessarily require (or indeed allow) slow reading in the service of close
               reading. It does, however, still require that the literary work — to use Richards'
               own phrase — <quote rend="inline" source="#richards1954">be read again and again</quote> — a statement that
               is true perhaps now more than ever before. Michael Joyce (cited in <ptr loc="129" target="#sloane2000"/>), for one, has advocated the practice of <quote rend="inline" source="#sloane2000">successive attendings</quote> in texts that privilege multiplicity
               and poly-vocality, whereby we perceive coherence in terms other than that predicated
               on a singular organic whole, a notion that would apply across a wide range of digital
               fiction and poetry.</p>
            <p>It follows then that close reading digital literature is inevitably close re-reading.
               Granted, close reading of any literary text involves re-reading, but narrative and
               poetic texts in digital environments take the practice of re-reading to a higher
               power or second-order. Such texts, because of their changeability, recursivity, and
               multi-linearity <cit>
                  <quote rend="inline" source="#ciccoricco2007">rely on reiteration for their iteration; that is, re-reading
                     can no longer be thought of as an epiphenomenon of reading in a network text
                     since the re-reading of textual elements, via the recycling of nodes, is
                     fundamental to (hyper)textual comprehension</quote>
                  <ptr target="#ciccoricco2007" loc="23"/>
               </cit>. Furthermore, although many works in print can claim to have no definitive
               ending at the level of discourse, many works of digital literature make the promise
               of return at the material level, which is to say they loop on the level of their
               macro-structure, customarily ending at the beginning only to begin again. Thus, the
               practice of re-reading is here hard-wired, so to speak. <ptr target="#ciccoricco2007" loc="23"/>
            </p>
            <p>Digitally networked narrative texts, in particular, can enact meaningful re-readings
               in two distinct ways: (1) reading the same node in new surroundings — a new
                  <soCalled>semantic neighborhood</soCalled> — can endow it with new meaning; and
               (2) a reader may return to a node much later on and find some of its elements
               foregrounded by information accumulated since first reading it, a process that can be
               said to augment the way memory works when reading a work of print. That is, our
               engagement with the interface can unexpectedly bring information back into
               consciousness and, unlike the first scenario, its context is recast in a strictly
               cognitive sense. Both scenarios demonstrate the network's capacity to generate new
               meaning through a recombination of elements already read. <ptr target="#ciccoricco2007" loc="29–30"/>
            </p>
            <p>The notion of re-reading has broader implications for the interpretive community of
               digital literature and the literary establishment it is creating, effectively, from
               the inside out. As Tabbi writes: <cit>
                  <quote rend="inline" source="#tabbi2009">In print, the credentialing process ends when the contract is
                     signed; in e-media, the work is vetted continuously (or could be) and lives or
                     dies depending on the readings it attracts, the re-writings it inspires, and
                     how these are presented</quote>
                  <ptr target="#tabbi2009"/>
               </cit>. Therefore, <cit>
                  <quote rend="inline" source="#tabbi2009">Whatever transformations the Humanities undergo in new media,
                     a condition for the field's possibility has to be the ability to re-read, and
                     the freedom to cite, the work of peers and precursors…</quote>
                  <ptr target="#tabbi2009"/>
               </cit>. </p>
            <p>For all these reasons, digital literature prompts a revisitation, re-articulation,
               and re-animation of the very concept of close reading, one that attends to the
               material context of its process and product. Despite the contradictions inherent in
               an application of the prevailing historical and popular conception of close reading
               to digital literature, Richards' own insights have already opened up that very
               possibility. Techno-literary criticism, however, must recognize a work of digital
               fiction as both a literal and a literary machine, one that is inevitably and iterably
               reliant on code for its execution/performance. That means critics must consider the
               formal, material, and discursive elements of each work as at once distinct and
               inseparable, each integrated toward the production of meaning. </p>

            <head>The Practical Matter of Close Reading </head>
            <p>Steve Tomasula's digital narrative <title rend="italic">TOC: A New Media
                  Novel</title>
               <ptr target="#tomasula2009"/> offers a productive test case for what a close reading
               of digital literature might look like. Written by Tomasula and designed by Stephen
               Farrell (along with Matt Lavoy on animation, and Christian Jara on DVD authoring,
               programming, sound engineering, additional animation, and some narration, and a host
               of others contributing everything from voice work to paintings used for many of the
               graphics throughout the text), <title rend="italic">TOC</title> is published by
               Fiction Collective 2 (FC2) under the auspices of University of Alabama Press, and is
               available only on DVD, playable only on computer. </p>
            <p>As the text's promotional material suggests, <title rend="italic">TOC</title> is,
               above all, a meta-narrative about time: <q>the invention of the
                  second, the beating of a heart, the story of humans connecting through time to
                  each other and to the world.</q> The narrative is divided into two main
               sections. The <title rend="quotes">Chronos</title> section tells the story of one
               woman whose husband is horribly disfigured in a car accident, and who becomes
               pregnant after having sex with her twin brother during her husband's convalescence.
               The <title rend="quotes">Logos</title> section provides the prehistory of an exiled
               people ruled by a <soCalled>Queen Ephemera</soCalled> on a mythical island
               nation. Of course, if we were to consider this initial description as the basis for a
               closer reading of the text, it would remain inadequate, as it is yet to acknowledge
               the novel's textual condition — its digital ontology as an internally networked and
               programmable artifact. What is missing so far is the recognition of an interplay
               between the formal, material, and discursive elements of the text — in short,
               something that would explain why the narrative needs a screen in the first place.</p>
            <p>A different approach to reading of <title rend="italic">TOC</title> might follow the
               trend of over-emphasizing the technical innovations of digital literature and the
               materiality of the textual medium. Equally problematic but for the opposite reason,
               such a reading might describe <title rend="italic">TOC</title> as a dynamic visual
               narrative published on DVD only and read / viewed on the computer screen. It would
               mention that it uses QuickTime animation software for its introductory sequence, as
               well as subsequent animations that are interspersed among the text, images, and
               music. It would explain that the navigational structure stems from a central page
               where users can click and drag a pebble icon on top of one of two boxes, labeled
                  <q>Chronos</q> or <q>Logos</q>; that
               the Chronos section will play audio narration with accompanying graphics that the
               user can zoom in on by clicking on them; and that the Logos section will open text
               segments. Such a reading might even go into forensic detail about the programming
               language(s) used to script the text's performance, which is important, but
               insufficient on its own.<note> The adjective <q>forensic</q>
                  invokes Matthew Kirschenbaum's <title rend="italic">Mechanisms: New Media and the
                     Forensic Imagination</title>
                  <ptr target="#kirschenbaum2001"/>, which attends to the bibliographical
                  specificities of software and hardware — the materiality — of cultural production
                  in digital media. With regard to reading code in particular, it is worth noting
                  that the practice can yield insights into how the text's programming both enables
                  and circumscribes interpretation. That is, if the affordances of programmable
                  texts allow for certain functional or operational features which can in turn
                  inform the text's themes and meaning, the same programmability can also place
                  certain limitations on the production of meaning. For example, responding to
                  questions about <title rend="italic">TOC</title> following his demonstration of
                  the text at the 2010 Electronic Literature Conference (ELO) at Brown University,
                  Tomasula explained that the somewhat arbitrary interactive cross-hairs function in
                  the Logos section of the interface, which allows users to select scenes by
                     <soCalled>targeting</soCalled> the colored slots in the moving image of a
                  player piano roll, resulted from a late compromise at the level of programming;
                  and he concedes that this compromise was <cit>
                     <quote rend="inline" source="#private">not as apt to the text's wider themes as would be the
                        original conception of holes in a player-piano roll that would have stood in

                  </cit>. </note> A tendency to focus on technological prowess or the newness of new
               media is common in both the critical and popular writing on digital literature. But
               it fails, much like the first case, to recognize the vital interplay between the
               text's formal, material, discursive elements, and further leaves us with the simple
               question: what's the story here? Or, is there even one to begin with? </p>
            <p>With reference to a single one of <title rend="italic">TOC</title>'s bibliographical
               units, the node titled <title rend="quotes">Under the Influence, 1959,</title> we can
               consider what a more complete close reading might entail. </p>

               <quote rend="block" source="#tomasula2009">At a time when the world lived under the influence of the
                  machine, there was a woman, who was a woman, who was a woman, who was a woman, who
                  felt like a telescoping box of women, each birthday adding another woman that all
                  the rest fit within like Russian dolls. When she laid them all out, looking at
                  pictures that showed her first as a baby, then a girl, then an adolescent, then a
                  young woman, then a middle-aged woman, she didn't know which of them to ask, "Who
                  are you?" But then she became pregnant — and the pun became literal and it amazed
                  her to think of the smaller her that was in her, the smaller her adding a her that
                  could be nestled inside that her though none of them, not even herself, was really
                  her. She thought of her own mother, a larger version of her/not-her, and her
                  mother's mother, and her mother's mother's mother, and the larger versions of

            <p>A more complete reading, then, would reflect on the text's materiality and form as it
               engages its verbal and conceptual complexity. Starting again with some general
               context, then moving to the scene in question, it might look like this: </p>
            <p>Steve Tomasula's <title rend="italic">TOC</title>, a <soCalled>new media
                  novel</soCalled> published on DVD only and read / viewed on the computer screen, is a
               story about time. The story moves from an epic sibling rivalry, a fight between the
               twin sons of the Queen Ephemera, both potential heirs in their new island nation of
               exiles. Their feud is as eternal as their names would suggest: chronology itself —
               literally the science of time — has been split: there is Chronos, the figure for
               time, and Logos, the figure for logic and its essential vehicle — language. Readers
               must <soCalled>vote</soCalled> for one twin or the other in the main navigational
               screen by casting a pebble (via a click and drag) into a box marked Chronos, which is
               filled with sand, or Logos, which is filled with water. The Chronos section will play
               an audio narration with accompanying graphics that tells the story of one woman whose
               husband is horribly disfigured in a car accident, and who becomes pregnant after
               having sex with her twin brother during her husband's convalescence. The Logos
               section will open text segments such as the one above, which provide the prehistory
               of Chronos, Logos, and Queen Ephemera and the people of the island nation. The text's
               topology is encased by a broader hierarchical structure, thus merging multi-linear
               reading at the local level with a linear progression that occurs globally:
               specifically, after exhausting the nodes at the Chonos/Logos level of the interface,
               readers eventually advance <soCalled>up</soCalled> to another level of the story,
               which occurs on the island itself, long after the time of the mythical twins. On this
               level, a menu of node titles is organized according to moons arranged around an image
               of the island nation. </p>
            <p>In <title rend="quotes">Under the Influence, 1959,</title> a woman contemplates her
               own identity and what might actually constitute its persistence over time. The
               opening recursive refrain (<q>there was a woman, who was a woman,
                  who was a woman</q>) recalls the refrains that appear earlier in the text
               during the voiceover narration in the opening sequence (<q>sun sets
                  before sun rises before sun sets before sun rises</q>), evoking the sense of
               circular time. These micro-narratives also recall John Barth's <title rend="quotes">Frame Tale</title>
               <ptr target="#barth1988"/> in print (<q>Once upon a time there was
                  a story that began once upon a time there was a story that began...</q>);
               although here Tomasula can employ both the screen's potential for kinetic, transient
               text and a seemingly spherical substrate to animate this recursion: the top of a
               glass globe image around which the text runs.</p>
            <p>The same globe that appears here and in the animated prologue encases the text in all
               the textual nodes of the Logos interface. It is ostensibly the top of a bell jar, a
               standard piece of laboratory equipment. Typically used for the protection or
               preservation of an artifact from the elements, or simply the ravages of time, the
               fact that a weathered scroll is the protected artifact in this context offers a rich
               commentary on the evolution of writing technologies. Historically, bell jars were
               also commonly used as vacuum chambers for scientific experimentation; removing the
               atmosphere, again, fundamentally alters the effects of time. One suggestion here then
               is that the narrative is indeed timeless, or at least circular as in the case of the
               pregnant woman. But the bell jar interface is a <soCalled>time machine</soCalled> in
               yet another way. Later in the story (or earlier, depending in what order one reads)
               we learn that Ephemera, the Queen of Exile, has glass fingernails that are in the
               shape of an hourglass, as do all of her descendents. Inside those fingernails is a
               tiny channel of sand that runs toward their fingertips when they go about their
               business during the day. At night, for reasons best left to magical realism, they
               sleep with their arms in slings so that the sand runs back toward their palms,
               refilling the opposing end of their hourglass fingernails and, in turn, balancing out
               their nights and days. For the reader, however, the glass fingertip we see on the
               screen contains not sand, but rather the words on the papyrus-styled scroll. And it
               is only by scrolling down to the end of each segment of this digital narrative that
               we too are in some sense experiencing the measure of time through language.</p>
            <p>Finally, we cannot close read this node, or any node for that matter, without close
               reading its title: <title rend="quotes">Under the Influence, 1959.</title> Even
               though a reading of titles (of chapters or of entire novels) is common to traditional
               hermeneutics, we know that <emph>nodes</emph> are not equivalent to
                  <emph>pages</emph> and one of the plainest distinctions between the two is the
               fact that pages are numbered whereas nodes are titled. In fact, in any networked
               fiction, it is possible and often necessary to read node titles in relation to the
               titles that precede and follow them and in relation to the text of the node itself (a
               practice foregrounded in Stuart Moulthrop's <title rend="italic">Victory
                  Garden</title>, in which titles often complete the movement from one node to the
               next both grammatically and semantically).<note> See <ptr target="#ciccoricco2007" loc="104, 111–2"/> for examples from Moulthrop's text. </note>
            </p>
            <p>Keeping within the context of the <soCalled>bell jar,</soCalled> and given a scene
               depicting a woman's troubled musings on her own sense of self, Sylvia Plath is
               certainly present. Just a few years before publishing <title rend="italic">The Bell
                  Jar</title>, she herself would have been <q>under the
                  influence</q> not only of that enormous task in 1959, but also that of Robert
               Lowell's poetry tutelage, not to mention the camera of Rollie McKenna, who took one
               of the most famous (and haunting) photographs of the writer in Boston that year. The
               weightiest influence for Plath, however, might have been the fact that she was then
               pregnant with her first child, Frieda, thus establishing the clearest connection
               between her and the woman with a <q>smaller her that was in
                  her.</q> Intra-textually, the meditations of the pregnant woman moreover
               anticipate or, depending on the order of reading, <emph>echo</emph> the grotesque
               plight of the pregnant woman in the Chronos sequence, illustrating the sort of
               repetition and recombination typical in digitally networked fictions. </p>
            <p>A more immediate reading of the title is of course the colloquial and somewhat
               comical evocation that we are all intoxicated by something, perhaps our modern
               technologies — <q>under the influence</q> of our machines. But
               for the all the machines that feature so prominently in the text, either in its
               discourse or its interface, from pre-history through Victorian-styled steam-punk to
               the present day, the most dominant machine is not a real machine at all. That is, the
                  <soCalled>Influencing Machine</soCalled> evoked implicitly here in this title and
               explicitly elsewhere throughout was a collective hallucination reported by a number
               of schizophrenic patients attending the psychoanalyst Viktor Tausk during the early
               1900s. (He published his findings in the <title rend="italic">Psychoanalytic
                  Quarterly</title> in 1933 with an article titled <title rend="quotes">On the
                  Origin of the <soCalled>Influencing Machine</soCalled> in
               Schizophrenia.</title>)</p>
            <p>These patients suffered from a paranoid delusion whereby they believed they were
               being influenced — or controlled — from a distance by a machine that they could
               describe to some extent but whose technical operation was always beyond the grasp of
               their understanding, aside from the human heart at the center of the machine
               described, incredibly, by the vast majority of subjects. Significantly, the
               description of the individual parts of the machine changed over time according to the
               changes in the popular technologies of the time. Not surprisingly, the descriptions
               in the latter cases had increasingly evident parallels to television. One can only
               wonder how Tausk's case studies would read if he published his article today, or for
               that matter, in 1959, the year indicated in the title. After all, that year marks the
               beginning of what is known as the <soCalled>second generation</soCalled> of modern
               computing, when improvements in transistors and circuitry crossed a threshold that
               made these machines much smaller, faster, and smarter. They were the first computers
               that could accept commands that started to resemble what I.A. Richards might have
               called <soCalled>basic English.</soCalled>
            </p>
            <p>Thus, this well-wrought node has an apparent autonomy. It is, after all, a
               semantically self-contained unit, open to a discrete close reading in itself. But
               even the most devout New Critic must concede that the meaning of this text is
               dependent not simply on the broader narrative network in which it resides but also
               the material support that contextualizes our close reading project in peculiar ways.
               From the bell jars and glass finger nails which tell us more of the represented
               world, to the computer screen itself which permits the reflexive reading that
               positions us under the influence of the ubiquitous machines of personal computing, we
               cannot simply look through the interface to the language it conveys. At the same
               time, the language cannot be reduced to merely one mode of signification among many
               or, in the words of Brian Kim Stefans, a mere <cit>
                  <quote rend="inline" source="#stefans2005">participant in a recombinant universe jointly occupied by
                     sounds, images, videos and the user's interactions</quote>
                  <ptr target="#stefans2005"/>
               </cit>; rather, language-driven work is crucial to the very notion of digital
               literature. The point is to privilege neither language nor materiality outright — it
               is simply to underscore the possibility of a productive communion between the
               literary and the machinic in our media rich culture — in much the same spirit of
               Theodor Nelson's own vision of computers as <soCalled>literary
                  machines.</soCalled>
            </p>
            <p>In fact, if our critical consideration of machines brings us from the textual (after
               Richards and Hayles) to the organic (after Minsky) and back again, then perhaps the
                  <soCalled>Influencing Machine</soCalled> of Tomasula's <title rend="italic">TOC</title> can be understood as a figure for close reading itself, one that
               persists over time and across media. Close reading is, after all, a process by which
               a reader is under the influence of a textual — and indeed technical — machine, a
               machine that changes over time according to the changes in popular technologies of
               the time. Furthermore, much like Tausk's patients, who could never wholly grasp the
               operation of the strange machine they saw, we too continually struggle to grasp the
               machines that enable digital textuality, both in the mundane sense, as users enduring
               hardware or software upgrades that are — if only momentarily — just slightly beyond
               our comprehension, and as theorists invested in understanding the varied ways in
               which we are drawn into the circuitry.<note> I am indebted to the insightful comments
                  of one of my anonymous reviewers in expanding this passage. </note>

            <head> Techno-literary Criticism: So Close and So Far </head>
            <p>Such an exercise in close reading and, for that matter, the entire present essay,
               rests on a vital assumption: that digital media do not dispossess us of an
               interpretive reading practice. Close reading in digital environments still involves
               analyzing linguistic, structural, semiotic, intertextual, and semantic elements, but
               it also involves digital literacy. Digital literacy is not necessarily in place of
               and is in some ways in addition to interpretative practice in print, but is in all
               ways attendant to the materiality of the digital medium. All in all, it should come
               as no surprise that literary theory and criticism is becoming and must become more
               formalist and materialist in orientation in the midst of our digital and networked
               culture; and this is not just to accommodate digital texts and textuality into the
               fold. Book history and textual criticism is enjoying its own revival with not only
               this newfound focus on materiality but also new technological tools with which to
               study its object. (It is also no surprise that the spike in academic interest in the
               history of the book coincides with the ascendancy of the personal computer. <title rend="italic">The Society for the History of Authorship, Reading and
                  Publishing</title> [SHARP], in fact, held their first conference in 1991 the same
               year Tim Berners Lee got his pet project off the ground). This re-definition of close
               reading is indeed in line with developments in the realm of print. Witnessing the
               fading gap between analytical methods that attend to the <soCalled>text
                  itself</soCalled> versus those materials outside of it, Newman writes, <cit>
                  <quote rend="inline" source="#newman2010">A <soCalled>new,</soCalled>
                        post-<soCalled>Modernist</soCalled> close reading ought to turn to the more
                     full-bodied objects that texts always are by recognizing that, as
                     historian-of-the-book, Roger Chartier, famously wrote, <quote rend="inline" source="#newman2010">to
                        read is always to read something</quote>
                  </quote>
                  <ptr target="#newman2010"/>
               </cit>. Thus, digital literature has much to gain from recovering New Criticism's
               sensitivity to language and technique along with Richards' own sensitivity to its
               technical and material supports.</p>
            <p>More broadly, the same line of inquiry has profound implications for the future of
               literary studies and the very conception of the <soCalled>literary</soCalled> itself
               in contemporary cultural production. I grant that the very word itself is vague,
               contestable, and to a large extent determined — in the Wittgensteinean sense — on how
               it is employed as a word. But one point that needs to be addressed — or redressed —
               is the fact that any close reading of digital literature needs to attend to the
                  <soCalled>literary</soCalled> as composed <emph>of words</emph>,<note>Scholar and
                  theorist of digital literature Astrid Ensslin echoes the same sentiment when she
                  writes that <cit>
                     <quote rend="inline" source="#ensslin2010">we can only use the term <soCalled>digital
                           literature</soCalled> if and when the reception process is guided if not
                        dominated by <soCalled>literary</soCalled> means, i.e. by written or orally
                        narrated language rather than sequences of images — no matter how short and
                        allusive text chunks, or lexias, may be</quote>
                     <ptr target="#ensslin2010" loc="145"/>
                  </cit>.</note> otherwise whatever <emph>is</emph> literary in the World Wide Web
               and digital environments more generally will — like a Flash poem that is just a bit
               too flashy — certainly pass us by.<note>I'd like to formally acknowledge the
                  Leverhulme Trust for their generous support of the Digital Fiction International
                  Network (DFIN), of which this research was a part, and to the members of that
