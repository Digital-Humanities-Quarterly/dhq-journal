                  <p>Although Digital Humanities (DH) has become more established
                     in recent years one of the main issues that remains is the
                     true internationalization of DH as an academic discipline.
                     Up to this point the DH community has been mainly focused on
                     scholars from a handful of English speaking countries and
                     there is little or no participation from other regions of
                     the world. This paper discusses the experience of setting up
                     a DH community in Mexico. The aim is to describe the
                     multi-faceted approach used for DH community building as
                     well as discussing different strategies employed,
                     difficulties encountered, produced results as well as areas
                     for future growth. We propose that this may serve as a model
                     for similar initiatives in other countries.

                     establishment of new DH associations both regional and
                     national. 2011 saw the establishment of the Red de
                     Humanidades Digitales (RedHD), Humanidades Digitales
                     Hispánicas (HDH) and the Associazione per l’Informatica

                     2013 the Associação das Humanidades Digitais (AHDig),
                     Asociación de Humanidades Digitales en Argentina (HDA) and
                     Ruach Digitalit – Digital Humanities Israel [<a class="ref" href="#galina2014">Galina 2014</a>]. These organizations should
                     contribute to an increasingly complex global DH landscape.
                     However, the DH international community and in particular
                     the Alliance of Digital Humanities Organizations (ADHO),
                     established in 2002 and arguably the largest professional
                     society of Digital Humanities and/or the initiatives its
                     sponsors, has been criticized in recent years [<a class="ref" href="#fiormonte2012">Fiormonte 2012</a>], [<a class="ref" href="#dacos2013">Dacos 2013</a>]
                     for a narrow representation of worldwide DH: "... from the point of view of the
                     scientific results, research projects, and institutional
                     presence, Informatica Umanistica, like most of the
                     'other' DH practiced in the world, practically
                     doesn’t exist"

                     here and they must be addressed on many different levels.
                     However, one small step which may contribute towards knowing
                     and recognizing "other" DH in the world
                     is to better understand how DH communities are formed and
                     what their particular characteristics and trajectories are.
                     In this way we can address the issue of how to improve their
                     visibility, participation, and recognition in the field of
                     Digital Humanities as a whole. In this paper we will discuss
                     the experience of setting up a DH community in Mexico. The
                     aim is to describe the multi-faceted approach used for DH
                     community-building as well as to discuss different
                     strategies employed, difficulties encountered, and results
                     produced as well as areas for future growth. This article
                     has a necessarily descriptive aspect but still we propose
                     that this may serve as a learning example or model for
                     similar initiatives in other countries.

                     Universidad Nacional Autónoma de México (UNAM) with the
                     principal aim of studying the current situation of digital
                     resources for the humanities. The methodology for this
                     research project included the organization of a series of
                     workshops. It was during these that the idea to form a DH
                     network was proposed by the participants. This article will
                     not report on the results of the research project that have

                     rather on the work done from the workshops onwards to form
                     and establish the Red de Humanidades Digitales (RedHD), the
                     resulting DH organization that was established.

                        studies in the UK. There are a number of self-reflective
                        articles on the role, organization and future of Digital
                        Humanities which is typical of an emerging field and
                        they attempt not only to define but also to understand
                        the role, impact and challenges of developing digital
                        projects as part of research and teaching in the
                        Humanities [<a class="ref" href="#svensson2009">Svensson 2009</a>]. With this in
                        mind from the onset it was considered that DH literature
                        would provide a suitable framework for developing the
                        research project.

                        June 2011 under the name "Digital Humanities". The
                        aims of the first two workshops were: to share
                        experiences in the development of digitization and
                        digital resource creation in the Humanities; identify
                        the main difficulties and limitations for DH; discuss
                        and identify the necessary skills for human resources,
                        and to define concrete actions to strengthen and improve
                        digital projects in the Humanities. The last two
                        workshops were specifically aimed at consolidating the
                        RedHD.

                     <div class="ptext" id="p6">One of the first challenges was selecting the
                        participants for the workshops. The aims of the workshop
                        required that the participants have some experience
                        working with digital projects in the Humanities. They
                        were not just informative but also participative. As
                        part of the research project a database of digital
                        projects within the UNAM web space — <a class="ref" href="http://www.unam.mx" onclick="window.open('http://www.unam.mx'); return false">www.unam.mx</a> — had
                        previously been compiled. This was done by selecting the
                        web pages of all the Humanities-related schools and
                        institutes and navigating through the different links
                        finding and registering digital resources created by
                        university members. This database was used to contact
                        the creators of these resources and invite them to the
                        workshops when possible. Additionally, they were
                        strongly encouraged to invite colleagues with similar
                        backgrounds, creating a snowball effect. Although
                        originally the workshop was only UNAM members,
                        colleagues from other universities became interested in
                        participating and they were included.

                        used to framework the research. The first workshop began

                        concepts, communication channels, publications and
                        discussions. We defined DH as "an
                        area of research and teaching at the intersection of
                        computing and the disciplines of the
                        humanities," which was taken from the Digital
                        Humanities Wikipedia entry. The principal researcher
                        did, however, previously attempt to find a more concise
                        definition, but this proved problematic. A member of an
                        established DH centre responded to the following when
                        asked for a definition of DH: "a

                        it all into one teaching text that goes 'there is

                        DH. This was due to a sabbatical in the United States.
                        However, by the fourth workshop two more participants,
                        PhD students in Spanish Literature from the University
                        of Western Ontario in Canada, were familiar with DH. It
                        is worth adding that they had heard of the efforts to
                        establish the RedHD through the participation of several
                        workshop members in March 2011 of <em class="emph">Day of DH</em>

                        which focused on the experiences that participants had
                        when developing a digital project. In order to provide a
                        framework for the conversation, we identified seven key
                        topics from the DH literature. These key topics were
                        then addressed in the form of questions that

                     <div class="ptext" id="p12">The results of these two initial workshops have been
                        reported in much more detail elsewhere [<a class="ref" href="#galina2012b">Galina 2012b</a>], but in summary a common
                        characteristic was that participants felt that there was
                        little infrastructural and institutional support for the
                        development of their digital projects and no policies or
                        guidelines in place. Some enjoyed this marginality as it
                        allowed them to work more independently, while others
                        remarked on the difficulties of investing time in a
                        project that was not recognized as
                        "proper" research. Everyone felt
                        that there was little recognition of the value of their
                        work from colleagues and evaluation committees. Contrary
                        to what was expected, participants had few difficulties
                        obtaining funding (albeit small amounts) but in general
                        had more trouble finding and retaining students or
                        research assistants with the appropriate combination of
                        digital skills and a Humanities background to help with
                        the work. Projects were generally a personal initiative,
                        were not properly documented due to lack of time, and
                        there was concern about what would happen to them once
                        the funding run out. As put by one participant, "When does a project become the
                        university’s service and somebody else’s
                        responsibility?" The long-term future of most
                        of these resources was not assured as hosting and
                        maintenance was precarious for almost all projects.

                     <div class="ptext" id="p13">As our discussion focused on general issues related to
                        working on a DH project, we did not find significant
                        differences amongst disciplinary backgrounds. We found
                        that we had similar problems despite the different
                        topics of the digital projects. Although most
                        participants had not previously heard of DH, there was
                        considerable interest in hearing about this field and
                        how it could help them out with their own digital
                        projects. In particular, participants reported a sense
                        of marginality in their workplace and they felt that
                        they benefited from talking to "other people like
                        me." In this sense the knowledge that there was a
                        larger community of scholars with similar interests and
                        challenges was revealing. At this particular point,
                        participants were interested in how as a local group we
                        could collaborate together towards the
                        "professionalization" of the type
                        of work we were doing as well as address our common
                        challenges together. We did not however, reflect on the
                        nature of Digital Humanities or go into too much depth
                        about its definition. Rather, it served as a useful
                        umbrella term that helped group us together. Possibly
                        the most notable result was that although originally
                        only two workshops were planned, at the end of the
                        second one the group decided to continue to meet in
                        order to address pending issues. It was concluded that
                        the best way forward was to create a DH association that
                        would allow us to deal with them collectively, rather
                        than individually. This was the focus of the next two
                        workshops.

                     <div class="ptext" id="p14">One of the first challenges was moving from a workshop
                        atmosphere to establishing a more formal but still
                        dynamic network of DH practitioners. As mentioned
                        previously the workshops had already attracted the
                        attention of participants from outside the UNAM, so it
                        was clear that the network would be geographically
                        dispersed. No funding was available so we did not want
                        to incur travel costs. It was necessary and practical to
                        think from the start of a virtual community with few or
                        no face-to-face meetings. One of the main concerns
                        during the third and fourth workshop was that although
                        we noted a lot of enthusiasm, we feared that personal
                        workloads, geographical dispersion, and different
                        disciplinary backgrounds would lead to a weakening of
                        our initiative. A virtual community is defined as a
                        situation where "people carry on
                        public discussions long enough, with
                        <em class="emph">sufficient human feeling</em>, to form
                        webs of personal relationships"
                        [<a class="ref" href="#rheingold1993">Rheingold 1993</a>]. We therefore wanted to
                        ensure good communication channels to talk, organize and
                        work with relevant people on particular topics.

                     <div class="ptext" id="p15">It was agreed that it was important for us to focus on
                        concrete actions and outcomes rather than just on good
                        intentions or overambitious plans. We therefore
                        developed a concrete agenda that would serve to focus
                        our attention. Initial plans were reported at DH 2012
                        [<a class="ref" href="#galina2012a">Galina 2012a</a>] but the following
                        expands and updates the work done. Referring back to
                        Rheingold’s definition, our main priorities were to:
                        establish our communication channels, define
                        participants, and state our topics.

                     <div class="ptext" id="p16">It was decided that digital technologies could easily be
                        employed for our communication channels, especially with
                        the high degree of computer use by all the participants.
                        The success of the Humanist Discussion group and its key
                        role in the establishment of the Anglo-American DH
                        community led us to decide to establish a listserv as
                        our primary communication channel, despite the fact that
                        there are currently more modern approaches in particular
                        with social networking sites. The listserv was a proven
                        method and in addition it did not require participants
                        to have to belong to a particular social networking
                        site. All participants had access to email thus creating
                        a low barrier entry. We currently have over one hundred
                        and sixty registered participants. Presently
                        participants are asked for their name, institution and
                        country but this was not always the case. We are
                        currently working towards completing the missing
                        information. In general terms there are people from
                        Archaeology, Art History, Computing, Conservation
                        Studies, Culture Studies, Pedagogy, Graphic Design,
                        History, Library Studies, Linguistic Engineering,
                        Philology, and Philosophy. Around a third of the
                        subscribers are from outside Mexico from the following
                        countries: Argentina, Chile, Colombia, Perú, Uruguay,
                        USA, Germany, Italy, Netherlands, Portugal, Spain,
                        Switzerland, UK and Signapore. The second step was to
                        set up a webpage. We were fortunate to be able to have
                        one web programmer from the research project to help.
                        The webpage was considered a space for hosting the
                        projects and tools that we wished to develop and not
                        just as an informative page. Both the establishment of
                        the listserv and the webpage required us to make a
                        series of decisions about our aspirations as a group,
                        albeit in a roundabout way, as we made decisions about
                        hosting and domain names. As a starting point we
                        realized that although the workshops had been held at
                        the UNAM already, there were participants from other
                        Mexican universities and from non-academic
                        organizations. We also knew that at least at that time,
                        there was no other Latin American organization. In terms
                        of language, although we were aware of DH type work
                        being done in Spain [<a class="ref" href="#rojas2013">Rojas2013</a>] there was
                        still no formal association in place. We therefore
                        agreed that the aims of the RedHD are: 
                        <blockquote>
                           <p>to promote and strengthen work on
                              humanities and computing, with special emphasis on
                              research and teaching in Spanish speaking countries
                              as well as the Latin American region in general. The
                              RedHD supports better communication between digital
                              humanists in the region, the formation of human
                              resources, preparation of documentation and good
                              practices, the promotion of DH projects,
                              dissemination of DH related events as well as
                              promoting the recognition of the field.
                               Additionally we seek to promote regional projects
                              and initiatives on an international
                              level.
                           </p>

                     <div class="ptext" id="p17">In terms of domain names we did not want to associate the
                        DH community to any institution in particular.
                        Additionally, we were thinking not only on a national
                        scale but also on a regional Latin American one. We took
                        the decision to get a .mx and .net domain (<a class="ref" href="www.humanidadesdigitales.mx/" onclick="window.open('www.humanidadesdigitales.mx/'); return false">www.humanidadesdigitales.mx</a> and <a class="ref" href="www.humanidadesdigitales.net/" onclick="window.open('www.humanidadesdigitales.net/'); return false">www.humanidadesdigitales.net</a>) and pay for
                        external hosting. These costs were absorbed by some of
                        the members of the group, as they are relatively low.
                        However, although costs have gone down considerably this
                        may not necessarily be the case for other countries, and
                        this should be taken into consideration.

                        restrictive in terms of who could participate (for
                        example, had to formally belong to a university). The
                        workshops had caught the interest of a diverse range of
                        people from researchers with PhDs to young programmers
                        not interested in traditional academic careers or people

                        also had some from government and private companies. We
                        decided to maintain an open and dynamic structure and
                        anybody who joined the listserv would automatically
                        become a member of the community. This allowed us to
                        grow rapidly without too many restrictions. In recent

                  <div class="ptext" id="p21">One of the workshop results indicated that there was little
                     documentation available about DH in Spanish. Additionally
                     there was modest and dispersed information about the work
                     that had been done in Mexico and other Latin American
                     countries. This situation has changed considerably in the
                     past four years and there is a fast growing corpus of DH
                     literature in Spanish<a class="noteRef" href="#d4e664">[3]</a>.
                     However at that time, one of our first objectives was to
                     document and provide documentation related to DH in Spanish
                     and about the work that we had already done. We also wished
                     to maintain a database of DH projects. The discontinuation
                     of similar projects from other countries such as AHDS,
                     Intute and similar DH resource discovery systems was
                     discouraging<a class="noteRef" href="#d4e670">[4]</a>.
                     However, it also presented us with the opportunity to focus
                     on different approaches to long-term sustainability. We are
                     currently looking at grass root development and working in
                     partnership with libraries. We are also in talks with other
                     ongoing projects, such as DH Commons, in order to share
                     information. We have found, however, that up to now, despite
                     the maintenance issues, the databases have been useful in
                     giving an initial important sense of production and of
                     critical mass to move forwards as a community.

                     Almost all the projects experienced difficulties finding and
                     retaining human resources — in particular research
                     assistants and programmers — that had the right combination
                     of both technical skills and subject knowledge to develop
                     the projects. The lead researchers themselves were also in
                     need of specific training that simply was not available.
                     Most work was done through trial and error and
                     self-training. This is similar to what has been reported in
                     other parts of the world but the growing number of DH
                     courses and DH degrees at the postgraduate level seeks to
                     address this. Therefore, teaching and training were one of
                     our focus points.

                     to TEI" within the framework of continuing
                     education and human resource development. These courses,
                     however, were usually done on an ad hoc basis and did not
                     have the overall impact that we were looking for. We were
                     more interested in getting DH into the official curriculum
                     in order to formalize and establish in a more definite
                     manner the presence of DH teaching.

                  <div class="ptext" id="p24">At the UNAM we worked on a syllabus proposal for a DH
                     <em class="emph">diplomado</em><a class="noteRef" href="#d4e708">[5]</a>. In order to develop this we consulted
                     syllabi from other countries.<a class="noteRef" href="#d4e711">[6]</a> Although the topics we proposed to cover
                     were similar, we sought to emphasize the use of a more
                     diverse set of DH project examples. We hoped that this
                     <em class="emph">diplomado</em> could become the basis for a
                     future MA course. We originally assumed that setting up an
                     MA in Digital Humanities would be simple as we believed it
                     to be an attractive topic, especially considering the
                     popularity in other parts of the world, but we have
                     encountered numerous obstacles. From anecdotal evidence we
                     feel that this is the same experience of early DH adopters
                     in Anglo-American countries. A recent New Zealand report on
                     passing a DH curricula through a national board notes that
                     the "final form reflects not only the
                     'state of the art' in the
                     discipline in question, but the 'state of the
                     art' as parsed through academic staff,
                     informed (and uninformed) reviewers, institutional
                     context (and necessity), national educational policies,
                     and the shifting sands of methodological and critical
                     best practice"
                     [<a class="ref" href="#smithies2013">Smithies 2013</a>]. New DH courses are,
                     therefore, shaped and influenced by a variety of different
                     actors and interests. Political and cultural issues are
                     definitely at stake.

                  <div class="ptext" id="p25">More recently we worked on another academic course known as
                     <cite class="title italic">Especialización,</cite> which is
                     available to undergraduate students and looks to inform
                     students in a particular area (for example, paleography or
                     art appraisal) on the subject of Textual Culture and
                     Documentary Heritage, and again we proposed <cite class="title italic">Humanidades Digitales</cite> as one of
                     the courses. Both the <span class="hi italic">diplomado</span> and
                     the <em class="emph">especialización</em> included an important
                     practical component and both focused on doing a DH project
                     as an end result. The <em class="emph">especialización</em> was
                     accepted but it was necessary to change the name to "Digital projects in the
                     Humanities." On this occasion we faced objections
                     to the term Digital Humanities. The term was unfamiliar to
                     most of the people on the commission and because there were
                     no precedents<a class="noteRef" href="#d4e753">[7]</a>, except for the RedHD, we had
                     difficulties justifying its use. Although we made references
                     to the work done in other countries we were unable to
                     convince the program committee to take the risk of proposing
                     something so new. Proposals go through a complex
                     bureaucratic process and it is quite likely that the
                     commission did not want to put the whole <cite class="title italic">Especialización</cite> in jeopardy by
                     proposing an unknown subject. Additionally, at the time we
                     ourselves as RedHD had not fully discussed what we meant by
                     DH except as a broad definition and possibly we were not
                     sufficiently prepared. As stated by [<a class="ref" href="#terras2010">Terras 2010</a>], digital humanists must be ready
                     to explain "what we do and why we matter
                     and why we should be supported and why DH makes
                     sense." This will be discussed in more detail
                     further along.

                  <div class="ptext" id="p26">As well as training and formal courses we also noted an
                     absence of information about DH in Spanish, although as
                     mentioned previously this has changed notably over the past
                     four years. One of our first actions was a special issue of
                     the <cite class="title italic">Revista Digital
                        Universitaria</cite> (RDU) in July 2011<a class="noteRef" href="#d4e773">[8]</a>, a successful online peer-reviewed general
                     interest journal published by the UNAM on the subject of
                     Digital Humanities. In September of that same year we set up
                     a blog of the RedHD<a class="noteRef" href="#d4e779">[9]</a>
                     and we have been publishing fairly regularly every two
                     weeks. The blog now has over 100 entries from 27
                     collaborators both from Mexico and international covering
                     topics from open access, open culture, collective
                     intelligence, preservation, philosophy and technology,
                     digital objects among others all in relation to DH. Almost
                     all entries are original Spanish creations, although we have
                     included a few translations. We have not as yet initiated a
                     planned translation program, but rather the ones we have are
                     a result of interest by some of our bloggers. We are
                     currently in talks with other blogs about setting up
                     reciprocating translations. The blog has been key in gaining
                     attention and distributing information. In April 2013 we
                     also began to publish a monthly newsletter (<cite class="title italic">Boletín RedHD</cite>) which includes a
                     few news items plus information about one of the blog
                     entries of that moment. We currently have almost two hundred
                     subscribers and the number is still growing. Unfortunately
                     the system only requires email address so we do not have
                     further information about the subscribers.

                     Recently a number of DH readers have been published ([<a class="ref" href="#berry2014">Berry 2014</a>]; [<a class="ref" href="#gold2012">Gold 2012</a>]; [<a class="ref" href="#terras2013">Terras 2013</a>]) and to our knowledge there is

                     provide more general DH books. There are currently several
                     DH journals (for example, <cite class="title italic">Digital
                        Scholarship in the Humanities</cite> and <cite class="title italic">Digital Humanities Quarterly</cite>) that
                     are published in English. In Spanish some journals have
                     published DH articles (for example <cite class="title italic">Caracteres</cite> and <cite class="title italic">El
                        Profesional de la Información</cite>) but as of yet
                     there is not to our knowledge a dedicated DH journal.

                  <div class="ptext" id="p28">Another strategy for the human resource formation has been
                     the organization of DH events, namely a biannual conference.
                     Academic events provide visibility of DH as well as promote
                     the formation of human resources and foster collaboration
                     between the community members. As the community grows we
                     feel that these events are key to identifying and bringing
                     together fellow digital humanists. In May 2012 we organized
                     the 1er Encuentro de HD (Digital Humanties Conference) in
                     Mexico City, co-hosted by CONACULTA, the ministry of art and
                     culture, and again in 2014 additionally held in conjunction
                     with GO:DH (Global Outlook: Digital Humanities), a special
                     interest group of the ADHO (Association of Digital
                     Humanities Organizations). In both cases the events have
                     been free as we have wanted to be as inclusive as possible,
                     and due to administration problems regarding funds that will
                     be described later. The venue was provided by Conaculta and
                     catering and other amenities were kept simple. The work for
                     the conference has been done mainly by members of the RedHD
                     and student volunteers. In 2012 we had 31 presenters and
                     almost all were from organizations within Mexico. For 2014
                     there were over 70 presentations and although there was a
                     predominance of speakers from the hosting country, which is
                     to be expected, almost half of the authors were from other
                     countries namely Argentina, Canada, Colombia, Costa Rica,
                     Cuba, Germany, Italy, Portugal, Spain, United Kingdom and
                     the United States. The program was divided into talks on:
                     Libraries and archives, Social networking, Teaching, Theory,
                     Applications, Language and corpora, Cultural studies,

                     project evaluation. As mentioned previously among workshop
                     attendees we found that lack of recognition of their work
                     was a constant grievance. DH scholars felt that evaluation
                     committees and peers tended to dismiss digital resources as
                     inferior to "real" publications (i.e., on
                     paper). Criteria for evaluation both at the UNAM and at
                     national level do not take into consideration digital
                     resources and until only recently have incorporated digital
                     publications, especially in the Humanities.

                  <div class="ptext" id="p30">Most DH projects are not presented in traditional research
                     output formats such as articles or books, but take on
                     various formats such as development of metadata, textual
                     markup, tools, websites and others [<a class="ref" href="#schreibman2011">Schreibman 2011</a>], so many evaluation
                     committees are at a loss with how to deal with these
                     materials. At the same time, people developing a DH project
                     do not necessarily know what elements should be included.
                     Although much work has been done to convince our colleagues
                     that digital research is worthy, a pending problem is that
                     they do not necessarily have the knowledge or tools to
                     evaluate DH work [<a class="ref" href="#rockwell2011">Rockwell 2011</a>].

                     and best practices for DH resources. In addition we wanted
                     to provide an online checklist that allowed users to
                     evaluate a particular resource using an interface that
                     displays the results of the evaluation, indicating areas of
                     weakness and strength. The aim of this tool would be
                     threefold: step-by-step evaluation tool for committees, a
                     resource for developers, and an informal compliance of a
                     minimum standard.

                     around the topics that we set out to solve. In this process
                     several general issues arose. As mentioned previously, the
                     workshops used the term Digital Humanities. However, during
                     the workshops we discussed whether this was an appropriate
                     term. We looked at the terms used in English over time (at
                     that point Humanities Computing was still used by some) and
                     different options in Spanish, specifically <em class="emph">Informática
                        para las Humanidades</em>, which had been used in
                     Spain and is similar to the long standing term
                     <em class="emph">Informatica Umanistica</em> used by the
                     Italians. In the end we decided to settle for
                     <em class="emph">Humanidades Digitales</em> due to its emphasis
                     on "digital" rather than
                     "informatics" and because of its
                     similarity to the English term. This discussion was led
                     mainly by the participants who had had contact with the
                     international DH community. Outside the workshops however,
                     this term has created some controversy and even opposition.
                     Although Digital Humanities has gained growing popularity in
                     academic sectors around the world [<a class="ref" href="#pannapacker2009">Pannapacker 2009</a>], it is still true that many
                     digital humanists continue to have the need to explain and
                     sometimes defend the type of work they are doing [<a class="ref" href="#pannapacker2009">Pannapacker 2009</a>] as there is by no means a
                     universal acceptance or recognition of the value of DH [<a class="ref" href="#fish2011">Fish 2011</a>], [<a class="ref" href="#kirsch2014">Kirsch 2014</a>]. In
                     Mexico where, as previously mentioned, Digital Humanities is
                     fairly unknown, it seems that the RedHD probably
                     underestimated the need to introduce and discuss in a more
                     structured manner the impact of Digital Humanities. We are
                     now more aware that lobbying will be a fundamental part of
                     our future work.

                     particular needs and challenges we face that are different
                     from other DH communities around the world. It is not just a
                     question of importing but of establishing our own agenda. In
                     order to do so, however, we have had to work on defining
                     ourselves. At the beginning we had settled on being very
                     open in order to be as inclusive as possible, but in recent
                     months we have started to consider in a more detailed manner
                     what the RedHD is, what it does, who belongs and what our
                     relationship is to other emerging and established DH

                     linguistic issues which we would like to work on in the near
                     future. To this effect we participated in the organization
                     of el Día de Humanidades Digitales (DíaHD)/ Dia das
                     humanidades digitais modeled on the well known project Day
                     of DH. The event has been held twice, in June 2013 and then
                     again in October 2014, and it sought to identify and bring
                     together the work of Spanish- and Portuguese-speaking
                     digital humanists. The idea behind creating a separate event
                     to the Day of DH was to see if we could identify particular
                     characteristics that differed from the main event, in
                     particular because Day of DH is characterized by a
                     predominant participation of digital humanists from the USA,
                     Canada, and the United Kingdom. From the 2013 edition, 97
                     blogs were analyzed in order to document and transcribe how
                     there is an emerging discourse, in the Foucauldian sense, as
                     Portuguese and Spanish speaking communities undergo a
                     process of semantic change in order to accommodate the
                     language and terminology used in the Digital Humanities. The
                     results are reported elsewhere [<a class="ref" href="#priani2014">Priani 2014</a>]
                     and focus on the discourse as a space of disciplinary
                     construction in the way we name, describe and explain as
                     well as giving an overview of some initial characteristics
                     we detected. Another result of this exercise is the the
                     creation of MapaHD (DH Map) an "exploration of the features and intersections among
                     those who self-identify as HD practitioners and their
                     characteristics beyond language affiliation"
                     which not only evidences the existence of this DH community
                     but also some of its characteristics [<a class="ref" href="#ortega2014b">Ortega 2014b</a>].

                     workshops and that has been important in the creation of the

                     community. Our work has coincided with a particularly
                     self-critical period for DH as a field and increasing
                     international participation has become a key priority. As
                     mentioned previously there are also a number of other
                     regional and/or linguistic initiatives have that been
                     created over the past few years. It is important that as a
                     community we define how we want to fit in with other DH
                     communities around the world. As the global DH community is
                     expanding, many aspects about the organization are being
                     renegotiated and this is an important moment to participate
                     in the discussion.

                  <div class="ptext" id="p37">From our own experience at the RedHD the use of English as
                     the predominant language in DH international events is an
                     obstacle for further participation. Although this is a
                     common problem in academia in general, in DH we have found
                     this to be particular troublesome due to the makeup of
                     participants. Although further research would still be
                     necessary it is quite common in the Sciences that PhD
                     holders will generally have a good working knowledge of
                     English as it is usually indispensable to their field. In
                     the Humanities however, this is less common as many work on
                     particular subjects where English is not necessarily the
                     <em class="emph">lingua franca</em>. Moreover, for DH projects
                     there is usually the participation of graphic designers,
                     programmers and a wide variety of people that do not
                     necessarily have a traditional PhD academic track where
                     English is more common. How do we incorporate these new
                     types of participants? This issue is complicated but must be
                     addressed. For the time being we have participated in a
                     number of translation initiatives. For example: the
                     translation of the Call for Papers for the international
                     Digital Humanities conference and the "I
                     whisper" translation campaign for DH2014 [<a class="ref" href="#ortega2014a">Ortega 2014a</a>].

                  <div class="ptext" id="p38">Funding has been a particular ordeal for us. Originally we
                     set ourselves up as a loosely formed network as this allowed
                     us great flexibility in setting up our community. However,
                     this less rigid structure does not allow us to exist
                     "officially" and this leads to
                     difficulties in obtaining funding. We have decided to form a
                     legally constituted association. However, forming an
                     association in Mexico is both complicated and expensive.
                     Currently it costs about $1000 dollars in bureaucratic and
                     legal fees just to set up the association, and the process
                     takes several months. Apparently this is a similar situation
                     in other Latin American countries. We do not know if this is
                     the case for the USA or European countries, but anecdotal
                     evidence seems to suggest that this is not an obstacle.
                     Through a donation scheme we have managed to collect the
                     necessary amount and we are currently setting up the
                     association. However, bureaucracy and expensive legal and
                     notary fees are a problem for this kind of initiative. We
                     are aware, again through anecdotal evidence, of other
                     difficulties such as international transfers and payments
                     for some countries (for example, Cuba) that greatly hamper
                     participation.

                     critical issues through the DH framework exercise, has been
                     key to the success of the project. In retrospect, developing
                     specific tasks and areas to be addressed helped the
                     formation of the RedHD and as a community gave us a sense of
                     direction and purpose. In the DH spirit of building and
                     making things [<a class="ref" href="#ramsay2011">Ramsay 2011</a>], the RedHD has
                     achieved quite a lot in a short period of time. Digital
                     Humanities proved to be a useful term that grouped us
                     together and helped us resolve our commons goals in a very
                     pragmatic sense. These past four years' work has been
                     achieved with little funding and a great deal of enthusiasm.
                     However, this is not sustainable over a longer period and if
                     we are to grow any more we definitely require a more
                     institutionalized scheme. We would in the future be
                     interested in the establishment of DH centres or other types
                     of institutional recognition for further strengthening our
                     community both in research and in teaching. We are well
                     aware that part of our work will now involve a great degree
                     of lobbying and promotion. However, we do think that this
                     should change gradually over the next few years as DH
                     becomes better known within academic circles and in
                     particular university authorities in the country and the
                     region. Part of this work is to establish DH within the
                     curricula both at undergraduate and graduate level.

                  <div class="ptext" id="p42">We have entered now though, together with other people in DH,
                     a period where there is a need for reflection on how we
                     understand the term Digital Humanities, who we are as a
                     community, our objectives, and the way we relate to other DH
                     communities both regional and international. Defining
                     Digital Humanities and our role as a community is an ongoing
                     and continuing process. It is important at this stage, as we
                     are trying to more formally institutionalize and implement
                     our projects to better phrase what we are doing and what we
                     want to achieve. Additionally, collaboration and
                     communication with other DH communities around the world is
                     fundamental and we must find ways of addressing this. We
                     will be working towards that and other issues described here
                     in the near future.
