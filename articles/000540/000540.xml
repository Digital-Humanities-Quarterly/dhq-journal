            <!--Include a brief abstract of the article-->
            <p>By bringing forward and interpreting the results from a collaborative research
               project that used contemporary computing techniques to investigate Giovanni Morelli’s
               nineteenth-century method for making stylistic attributions of old master paintings,
               this article examines how humanists make claims to knowledge and how this process may
               or may not be modellable or mechanizable within the context of classical,
               deterministic, digital computation. It begins with an explanation of the rationale
               behind choosing the Morellian practice of attribution, continues with a survey of
               another effort at computationally implementing Morelli’s method, and then presents
               our own computational techniques and results. The article concludes with what we have
               come to understand about the roles of responsibility, trust, and expertise in the
               social practice of art attribution, and the dangers in assuming that such human
               entailments are native to digital computers. </p>

            <p>On 15 November 2017, the art world was rocked by a momentous event: Christie’s sold a
               painting for the staggering sum of $450.3 million dollars, shattering every record
               for an art auction and thrusting the painting well beyond every other possible
               claimant for the mantle of <quote rend="inline">most expensive painting in the
                  world</quote>
               <ptr target="#lewis2019"/>. The painting is, compared to other auction house
               blockbusters, quite unassuming (see <ref target="#figure01">Figure 1</ref>).</p>
            <figure xml:id="figure01">
               <head>Christie's employees pose in front of a painting entitled <title rend="italic"
                     >Salvator Mundi</title> by Italian polymath Leonardo da Vinci at a photocall at
                  Christie's auction house in central London on October 22, 2017 ahead of its sale
                  at Christie's New York on November 15, 2017. <ref

            <p>It depicts Christ in half-length, holding a crystalline orb in his left hand while
               blessing with his right. Christ seems to lock eyes with the beholder, suggesting that
               he is in fact blessing us, which gives the picture a striking sense of immediacy. But
               assuming that the painting was made around the year 1500, as suggested by the auction
               house, this kind of interpersonal interaction with Christ was nothing new; painters
               like Antonello da Messina and Giovanni Bellini had at that point been experimenting
               with the interpersonal dynamic between images of the godhead and the individualized
               beholder for at least a quarter century. So, if <q>novelty</q> is not what drove the
               auction price to such extremes, what did? The social practice of art attribution. The
               painting has been attributed by the auction house (with the support of some art
               historians) to Leonardo da Vinci, one of the unrivaled masters of the Italian
               Renaissance. </p>
            <p>There are somewhere between 10 to 20 extant paintings reasonably attributed to
               Leonardo, so the emergence of another picture would increase that corpus by 5 to 10
               percent, a significant expansion. Quickly after the initial attribution, though,
               expert opinion began to divide. On the one hand, a number of scholars spearheaded by
               Martin Kemp, a professor at Oxford who specializes on Leonardo’s artistic production,
               steadfastly supported the attribution <ptr target="#kemp2019" loc="142–7"/>. On the
               other, curators like Carmen Bambach (Metropolitan Museum of Art) insisted that the
               painting is the work of one of Leonardo’s assistants, Giovanni Antonio Boltraffio
                  <ptr target="#bambach2019" loc="2: 278–83"/>.<note> On the possible legal
                  repercussions of Bambach’s opinion, see <ptr target="#alberge2019"/>. </note>
               Somewhere in the middle stood Luke Syson, currently Director of the Fitzwilliam
               Museum in Cambridge, England. In his previous position at the National Gallery in
               London, Syson had curated a blockbuster show on Leonardo that included the Salvator
               Mundi largely as a hypothesis, asking whether or not the painting held up to other
               autograph works by Leonardo <ptr target="#syson2011" loc="300–3 (cat.
                  91)"/> and <ptr target="#lewis2019" loc="73–213"/>. Syson believed
               parts of the painting were done by Leonardo, but that much of it was painted by
               assistants, as was common practice in Renaissance workshops where works done almost
               entirely by workshop assistants often went out under the imprimatur of <quote
                  rend="inline">the master</quote>
               <ptr target="#golden2004"/>
               <ptr target="#omalley2007"/>
               <ptr target="#williams2017" loc="173–258"/>
               <ptr target="#neilson2019"/>.</p>
            <p>These contrasting opinions can seem dizzying. If three major scholars who have
               dedicated their lives to the study of Leonardo cannot come to a consensus about this
               one painting, whom do we trust? What does it say about the state of knowledge
               production in the humanities that such a crucial question fails to find consensus
               among leading experts and yet the painting still commands an astronomical price?
               Should there, or should there not, be a relatively straightforward answer to the
               question, <q>Did Leonardo paint this picture?</q> If so, and if human connoisseurs
               cannot satisfactorily answer it, perhaps computers might be enlisted to clarify the
               problem and address it more empirically. After all, a well-programmed computer
               algorithm will produce results that are based only on the inputs it is given; a
               computer cannot swindle in the way that unscrupulous art dealers often have. So,
               might it be possible to model, computationally and mathematically, a problem as
               difficult as the attribution of a painting to an individual? Imagine for a moment a
               computer algorithm that could produce consistent assertions about the authorship of
               the Salvator Mundi. How might that change what it means to be an art historian or,
               even, an artist? </p>
            <p>This essay is about the possibilities and impossibilities inherent to embedding
               computation within a social practice like art attribution. It examines how humanists
               make claims to knowledge and how this process may or may not be modellable or
               mechanizable within the context of classical, deterministic, digital computation. The
               example of the recent attribution and sale of the <title rend="italic">Salvator
                  Mundi</title> is exceptional in its economic scope, of course, but we argue that
               the event pinpoints an important question about the stakes of bringing computation
               into the realm of art attribution: Is it possible for a computer to <q>make an
                  attribution</q> in any meaningful sense, or are attributions always and only
               possible within the realm of human judgment? We argue that the practice of art
               attribution is not solely about <q>being correct,</q> that is, <q>finding the
                  answer,</q> but is equally about being able to assign responsibility for the
               success and/or failure of such influential decisions to an intelligent agent. We wish
               to underline that such responsibility must be granted by human communities to digital
               computation; computers cannot take responsibility for their actions on their own.</p>
            <p>To begin to shed light on these questions, this essay brings forward results from a
               collaborative research project that used contemporary computing methods to
               investigate Giovanni Morelli’s nineteenth-century method for making stylistic
               attributions of old master paintings <ptr target="#morelli1893" loc="1–63"/>. As
               digital art historians, we saw in Morelli’s attributional practice a method that
               could be easily transposed into the language of the digital computer because it
               describes a set of quasi-computational operations (more on which below). But we did
               not begin this project expecting — or even trying — to prove Morelli’s method
                  <q>correct</q> or <q>accurate,</q> nor were we interested in finding out if
               Morelli’s system could successfully and accurately attribute art works in the context
               of digital computing. Indeed, we knew from the start that such efforts would be a
               logical impossibility because of the way the notion of <q>style</q> has been
               constructed and reconstructed over a century and a half since Morelli began
               publishing his findings.<note>Art history has moved on from the foundational ways
                  that Morelli envisioned the historical operation of artistic production and the
                  value of <q>style</q> within the field. There are numerous studies offering
                  analyses of this historical shift. Among them, we find the following most
                  informative: <ptr target="#driscoll2019"/>

                  <ptr target="#zerner2014"/>. </note> Instead, we wanted to use the computer to
               force us to come to grips with the details of this foundational, highly formative art
               historical practice, and to look at it fundamentally anew through the process of
               computational formalization. We know computers to be excellent at supporting this
               practice. Because computers are sticklers for details, they serve as a type of
                  <q>computational mirror.</q> They are able to show only what they have been asked
               to reveal — which is not necessarily the same as what the researcher
                  <emph>wants</emph> to see. We knew that the use of the computer would require us,
               at each step, to have an <q>honesty chat</q> about Morelli’s (and our own) methods. </p>
            <p>It was a revelation to discover the precise ways in which the Morellian techniques
               unfolded themselves in response to our computational approaches. We quickly came to
               re-contextualize Morelli’s original procedure as a nineteenth-century form of
               dimensionality reduction and proxy generation that was inseparable from his native
               human powers of judgment rather than something that parallels a twenty-first-century
               computational approach to formalizing the world. This unlocked for us the potential
               broader significance of his method both for art history and also the art market. In
               doing this work, we came to recognize that what truly lies at the heart of a
               successful (or failed) art attribution is not simply endorsing the accuracy of formal
               comparisons, but the ability to participate in a community of trusted experts and to
               take full responsibility for one’s own inferences and judgments. </p>
            <p>This paper will begin with an explanation of the rationale behind choosing the
               Morellian practice of attribution rather than any other. After briefly surveying
               another effort at computationally implementing Morelli’s method, we shall present our
               own computational techniques and results. We will then discuss what we have come to
               understand about the roles of responsibility, trust, and expertise in the social
               practice of art attribution, and how it would be dangerous to assume that such human
               entailments are native to digital computers.</p>

               <head>Morelli and His Method</head>
               <p>Giovanni Morelli (1816-1891) was one of the foremost connoisseurs — masters of art
                  attribution — in the history of art, and the method he proposed for identifying
                  and authenticating old master pictures has had enormous impact on the discipline
                     <ptr target="#agosti1993"/>
                  <ptr target="#hinojosa2009"/>
                  <ptr target="#caglioti2018"/>
                  <ptr target="#barni2016"/>. Morelli’s career trajectory spanned the fields of
                  medicine, politics, and art criticism, and could perhaps have only been fostered
                  in the bubbling cauldron that was the European nineteenth century <ptr
                     target="#anderson2020"/>. Born in Italy to parents of Swiss origin, Morelli
                  moved to Munich at age 17 to study medicine at the Ludwig Maximilian University.
                  Although Morelli never practiced medicine, his training in that field would prove
                  foundational for the method of art attribution that he developed later in his
                  career. After graduation, Morelli traveled throughout Europe fostering his love of
                  art and a network of associations in the European art market. In 1848 he was swept
                  up in the revolutionary fervor that was overtaking the Continent and, as a
                  consequence, began a long and somewhat complicated involvement in the emergence of
                  the Italian Republic. He was a senator in the early Republic and served on the
                  committee that established the system of Italian national museums that is largely
                  still intact, albeit in a modified form.</p>
               <p>It was only in 1874, at the age of 58, that Morelli began publishing the rudiments
                  of his method for attributing old master paintings. From that moment, until his
                  death in 1891, Morelli wrote numerous volumes, which quickly gained a wide
                  audience. His interventions were published in German under a double-pseudonym: the
                  writings purported to be the work of a Russian man named Ivan Lermolieff, which
                  were then translated into German by Johannes Schwartze, itself a translation of
                  the Italian name <q>Giovanni Morelli</q> into German. These publications took the
                  form of dialogues in which Lermolieff converses with an anonymous Italian
                  aristocrat. What we now think of as the <q>Morellian Method</q> for attributing
                  artworks emerges as the Italian helps Lermolieff see paintings in a new way.
                  Importantly, the <q>Morellian method</q> was not laid down in normative terms;
                  rather, it emerges as the product of dialogic exchange that allowed Morelli to
                  give voice to the discomforts provoked by his new method. The Lermolieff/Morelli
                  figure plays the role of the rube: he is a foreigner who has come to Italy in
                  search of great art. The dialogue’s other character serves as his educated guide,
                  introducing this revolutionary new mode of connoisseurial analysis based on the
                  revealing detail.</p>
               <p>The rudiments of Morelli’s method are familiar to art historians operating in all
                  European language traditions <ptr target="#davis2011" loc="86–96"/>. Prior to his
                  work, the attribution of paintings was a chaotic enterprise entangled in questions
                  of nationalism, capitalism, prestige, and the decline of European aristocracy.
                  Generally speaking, claims to authorship and authenticity were made on the basis
                  of a painting as an integral whole: every piece of the painting was believed to
                  work together to reveal the identity of the artistic agent responsible for having
                  made the picture. This approach is predicated on what Morelli described rather
                  derisively as the <quote rend="inline">general impression</quote> of a picture,
                  and he developed his own method consciously in opposition to this approach <ptr
                     target="#morelli1893" loc="22–3"/>.</p>
               <p>Morelli’s wager was that individual details were key, not this <quote
                     rend="inline">general impression.</quote> His method assumed that painters
                  revealed their true identity in the small places where they — and by extension
                  also the beholders — were paying the least attention. Anatomical features like
                  fingernails, earlobes, toes, and noses became the locus of authorial identity.
                  Morelli argued that painters were consistent in the way that they painted these
                  features throughout their careers and that these elements became something akin to
                  a personalized pattern. He came to describe these patterns as
                     <term>Grundformen</term>, or <q>ground forms,</q> and he offered line-drawn
                  examples in his publications (see <ref target="#figure02">Figure 2</ref>).<note>
                     It should be noted that Morelli did not always use his own method. This has
                     been noted by numerous scholars. While this is an important historical truth,
                     our paper takes the computational implementation as a hypothesis and is not
                     ultimately concerned with the question of whether or not Morelli obeyed his own
                     method. On this question, see <ptr target="#uglow2014"/>, <ptr

               <p>In his 1890 (English trans., 1893) dialogue on the Italian paintings in the
                  Borghese and Pamphili collections, Morelli offers an excellent example of how to
                  use <term>Grundformen</term> to make an argument about the attribution and dating
                  of an artwork. In this passage, Morelli stages a scene in which the anonymous
                  Italian companion outlines his method quite clearly for Lermolieff while they are
                  standing in the presence of a portrait of Bishop Ludovico Beccadelli, signed and
                  dated by Titian in 1552. The solidity of this attribution allows Morelli to use
                  the painting as a tool for recognizing the <term>Grundformen</term> that truly
                  distinguish Titian’s art and might thereby be used to solidify other attributions:
                        <cit><quote rend="block">It is my object to make you notice everything in a
                        work of art, and in time you will come to see that even details, in
                        themselves insignificant, may lead us to the truth… Look at the hand in this
                        portrait, particularly at the ball of the thumb, which is too strongly
                        developed and at the round form of the ear. In all his <emph>early</emph>

                        1540-1550, Titian adheres to the same round form of ear... This peculiarity
                        in the ball of the thumb also frequently occurs in his other paintings and

               <p>That Morelli’s texts illustrate the <term>Grundformen</term> through line drawings
                  and not full illustrations that more faithfully reproduce the actual
                  image-in-the-world under scrutiny was not a technical limitation of the day. By
                  the time that Morelli was publishing his books, it was possible to mass produce
                  art historical volumes with full page illustrations of original works of art using
                  a number of techniques, including lithography, engraving, and etching. His choice
                  emphasizes his use of abstraction as a central technique and in so doing also
                  reveals something disconcerting in Morelli’s method, which is that it is
                  predicated on what we might think of as a kind of aesthetic dissection of the
                  painting itself, a shredding of its holistic integrity and a disregard for the
                  particulars of pictorial representation as instantiated in a given painting. </p>
               <p>Indeed, the reduction of the entire work of art to the telling detail is one of
                  the more charged elements of Morelli’s method, and he recognized it as such.
                  Rather than see full-page illustrations of the paintings, the reader, like
                  Lermolieff, is asked to encounter an odd array of noses, earlobes, and fingers
                  organized as a grid to facilitate the process of differentiation between artists.
                  With this approach, Morelli’s method challenged the sensibilities of what was, at
                  that point, traditional art history, and the Lermolieff/Morelli character
                  expressed repulsion at the aesthetic violence to which the painting is subjected
                  by his Italian companion, as it is subdivided into hands, ears, and mouths,
                  bemoaning that the <quote rend="inline">general impression</quote> of the overall
                  work of art is declassed to an afterthought <ptr target="#morelli1893" loc="19–22"
                  />. </p>
               <p>The <term>Grundformen</term> isolated features of the artwork and was a
                  disorientating approach at the time, but for Morelli, the cost was worth the
                  benefit. These schematizations facilitated attribution by staging comparisons, and
                  this step-wise workflow in part helps explain why Morelli’s method is almost
                  irresistible to those interested in algorithmic logic.<note>William Vaughan, the
                     pioneering digital art historian, also linked his work to Morelli’s name in the
                     late 1980s and early 1990s. His research on early digital imagery and their
                     possible role in art historical study, while very valuable and notable in our
                     field’s history, took up a fundamentally different research direction from
                     ours, indeed as he notes, <quote rend="inline">...there is really no connection
                        between [my] computer system and the method devised by the nineteenth
                        century art historian</quote>

                        target="#vaughan1987"/>.</note> Morelli’s method was to reduce paintings to
                  a limited set of discrete patterns, and in so doing, locate proxies for authorship
                  in meaningful details he believed had been unconsciously embedded in the pictures.
                  The effectiveness of the <term>Grundformen</term> could not be revealed by a
                  casual look at the entire picture, but instead became potent only through their
                  isolation, extraction, and comparison. </p>

               <p>In the same way that the results of Big Data analyses are at their most thrilling
                  when they arise from patterns that are <emph>not</emph> obvious during data
                  collection, Morelli also strove to reveal invisible patterns of reality that are
                  actually hidden in plain sight.<note>This now-long-standing cultural attraction to
                     the wonder and surprise of revealing the unseen using information in plain
                     sight has been investigated in the context of digital computing, and even
                     likened to a fetish <ptr target="#chun2011" loc="15–9"/>. Revealing the
                     invisibly visible is also related to the concept of <q>clues</q> that Carlo
                     Ginzburg discusses — using Morelli himself as evidence — in the context of the
                     humanities <ptr target="#ginzburg1980"/>.</note> The connection to Big Data
                  here is not simply coincidental. In the twenty-first century, Morelli’s approach
                  might read to the astute technologist like a description, although imprecise, of a
                  set of functions that, once formalized, could be effectively and successfully
                  performed by a digital computer. For example, a supervised system of digital
                  Morellian classification might begin with the identification of
                     <term>Grundformen</term>, that is, the image-based features that typify a
                  particular artist. It might then computationally select and extract those
                  detail-features from a dataset of digital images. Next, it might identify a
                  procedure that would best group these details, and classify them into artist-based
                  clusters. With this trained system in hand, <term>Grundformen</term> could then be
                  extracted from <emph>unattributed</emph> paintings. By comparing these
                  unattributed features to the computationally classified set, one could produce a
                  probabilistic attribution of this unattributed work of art to an artist, or
                  distribute that probability over a set of artists, all by directly implementing
                  Morelli’s assumption that similarities in the appearance of the
                     <term>Grundformen</term> are effective proxies for an artist’s stylistic
                     <q>hand.</q><note>There are at least three layers to the meaning of
                        <q>hand.</q> The first and most basic is what we might think of as the hand
                     as a piece of semantic content; under discussion here is a human hand as
                     rendered in paint and then reproduced photographically. Second, the claim to
                        <q>hand</q> also refers to the fact (or inference) that Titian spread the
                     paint on the picture surface using his own hand. Third, we have the hand as the
                     historical construct of Titian’s style as constituted by the field of art
                     history. It is important to disentangle these different layers of meaning in
                     order to understand which aspects of Morelli’s method might be rendered
                     computational. For more on the use of effective proxies in the digital

                  question that can be <q>answered once and for all,</q> misses a critical point.
                  Art attribution is a practice fully embedded in sociality. Indeed, as contemporary
                  art historians, we have found Morelli's method to be most useful not to answer the
                  question, <q>Who painted this?</q> but rather as a tool for better understanding
                  all the complex, human-facing components that make up the question itself. </p>

               <head>Finding the Answer Means First Defining the Question</head>
               <p>Our project is not invested in attempting to operationalize Morelli’s system, in
                  part because previous scholars have already shown that this is indeed already
                  possible, if one proceeds with the assumption that art attribution is a problem to
                  be solved. Adrian J. Ryan, in a 2009 dissertation produced for the Department of
                  Classics at the University of KwaZulu-Natal in South Africa, produced just such a
                  system, and we have found that his research offers a fruitful case study for
                  comparison. Ryan is a computer scientist/technologist by training, who, in
                  returning to school for his degree in Classics, created a formalized, digital
                  system designed to imitate and reproduce the Attic vase-painting attributions of
                  Sir John Beazley. We have found his work especially useful for revealing a number
                  of differences between a digital-art-historical understanding of the utility of
                  Morellian method and a computer-scientific one. Most critically, Ryan’s work
                  highlights what it looks like when Morelli’s methods are used to <q>look for
                     answers,</q> rather than to situate the work of attribution within a social,
                  art-historical context.</p>
               <p>The guiding star for Ryan’s computational system of art attribution is not
                  Giovanni Morelli himself, but instead one of the most important scholars in the
                  history of the humanities to have implemented a Morellian Method: Sir John Beazley
                  (1885-1970). Beazley has long served as a disciplinary figurehead for Morelli’s
                  style of artistic attribution, not only in his home field of Attic vase-painting,
                  but also beyond <ptr target="#davis2011" loc="86–96"/>

                  <ptr target="#neer2005"/>
                  <ptr target="#smith2005"/>. Ryan states that his overall goal in implementing a
                  computerized system of art attribution is to discover whether or not, <quote
                     rend="inline">a computer may be taught to attribute in the same way that an art
                     historian can</quote>
                  <ptr target="#ryan2009" loc="56"/>. He is clear, both in this passage and
                  throughout his study, that his aim is not to design a classifier that can
                  attribute paintings in some natively computational way, or to justify <quote
                     rend="inline">the practice of connoisseurship by means of statistics</quote>
                  <ptr target="#ryan2009" loc="14"/>, but instead, <quote rend="inline">to prove or

                     expert]</quote>
                  <ptr target="#ryan2009" loc="2"/>. The system Ryan would come to produce is, for
                  all intents and purposes, a <q>Beazley Machine,</q> that is, a supervised machine
                  learning system designed to mimic and/or agree with any and all of Beazley’s
                  attributions. </p>
               <p>Ryan’s data-hungry algorithms function, almost exclusively, by winkling out
                  patterns from examples, and the more examples, the better. For this reason,
                  Beazley seems a very sensible choice for this research. The amount of data and
                  documentation remaining from Beazley’s attributions is impressive by the standards
                  of the humanities. Beazley used in his practice, just as Morelli had, hand-drawn,
                  schematic renderings of the details/features that he deemed emblematic of each
                  Attic vase-painter’s style, drawings that he published in his articles and books
                  (see <ref target="#figure04">Figure 4</ref>). </p>

                  the five published, monumental, volumes of Beazley’s attributions, as well as the
                  archival record of Beazley’s dimensionally-reduced line drawings, convinced Ryan
                  that there might be sufficient data to computationally model Beazley’s method <ptr

                  Beazley created on Attic vases is truly excellent and extensive by art historical
                  standards, Ryan found that they proved insufficient to support the types of
                  machine learning approaches that he had hoped to implement.</p>
               <p>The method that Ryan used to solve this problem of data scarcity interests us
                  greatly for what it reveals about the necessary role of human beings in the
                  process of art attribution even implemented computationally. Ryan elected to
                  address it by producing <q>artificial data sets</q> that increase the amount of
                  data available for training. That is, Ryan <emph>himself</emph> sketched a number
                  of prototypical mouths, knees, and ears in the manner of a number of Antique
                  painters, digitized them, and included his own line drawings as part of the
                  Beazleian training data. This technique served very specific computer-scientific
                  ends for Ryan, namely to help discover if training the classification engine on a
                  combination of both original and artificial data reduces the risk of overfitting
                  to a small design set significantly enough to justify the risk of adding
                  non-essential information <ptr target="#ryan2009" loc="100ff"/>. But, critically,
                  he went so far as to argue that the inclusion of his own drawings — insofar as
                  they gesturally re-enact the work of a trained, human connoisseur — made his
                  computational experiment <emph>more</emph> accurate.<note><quote rend="inline"
                        >However, since the method proposed in this chapter is meant to be, to put
                        it colloquially, an automation of the instinct of a skilled art historian
                        rather than an objective method for identifying painters, artificial form
                        sets by a skilled art historian are arguably more valuable [than other forms
                        of data], since they better encode the intuition of the art
                        historian</quote>
                     <ptr target="#ryan2009" loc="123"/>.</note> This is, interestingly, in line
                  with Beazley’s own practice. Drawing inspiration from Morelli’s method, Beazley
                  produced schematic line drawings of the forms and figures he observed on Greek
                  vases in the belief that the identity of the artist responsible for painting a
                  given vase might become clear when comparing these schematic surrogates against
                  one another. But occasionally, Beazley begged for the reader’s indulgence as he
                  produced line drawings that were more reflective of his own hand than that of the
                  Greek artist he was attempting to ventriloquize <ptr target="#beazley1922"
                     loc="97"/>. By inserting his own humanity into his datasets, we find that Ryan
                  is not only following Beazley’s example, but also asserting that trained human
                  actions and decisions play an unassailable role in the process of art attribution.
                  It is Ryan’s judgment that makes this all work, not Beazley’s and not the
                  computer’s.</p>
               <p>And yet, when Ryan offers a number of justifications for his work, we feel that
                  most of them are more consonant with the traditions of computer science than the
                  humanities. Crucially, he argues that one of the most fundamentally positive
                  contributions of such a system would be to make the practice of art attribution
                  more <emph>efficient</emph>, that is, to save human time. Rather than focusing on
                  the central importance of human expertise, Ryan suggests that his system could
                  save connoisseurs from wasting precious time performing <quote rend="inline"
                     >painstaking, difficult</quote> operations, and could free them up to focus on
                  any larger issues at hand <ptr target="#ryan2009" loc="36"/>. This move to assert
                  that the value of computation in any field is to save time and increase efficiency
                  may function well in domains such as engineering or business, but we find it
                  largely unconvincing in the context of the humanities.<note>For example,
                     efficiency and effectiveness are crucial to the work at the intersection of
                     computer science and medicine, see <ptr target="#register2019"/>. Computer
                     science also prizes efficiency and effectiveness as an independent field, see
                        <ptr target="#shin2019"/>. There are also works at the intersection of the
                     humanities and computer science that prize these characteristics, however we do
                     not believe our project is subject to those same demands, see <ptr
                        target="#zlabinger2019"/>.</note>
               </p>
               <p>For Ryan, the opposite of an efficient system is a slow, painstaking one. However,
                  in the context of the humanities, this analogy simply does not hold. For a
                  humanist, slow is not necessarily bad and it is certainly not the opposite of
                     <q>efficient.</q><note> In recent years, the concept of <q>slowness</q> has
                     undergone something of a revival among mindful practitioners in art history and
                     the academy more broadly, see <ptr target="#berg2016"/>, <ptr
                        target="#roberts2013"/>, <ptr target="#tishman2017"/>. </note> The value of
                  the humanities does not directly reside in how quickly it can be done, and indeed
                  the work can be considered un-finishable: full of difficult, fundamentally
                  unanswerable questions that each human generation reassesses anew. We believe that
                  the value of the intellectual work of the humanities partially resides in the fact
                  that it takes time both for human beings to gain trust in one another and also to
                  be trained to make scholarly judgments. Will it, or even can it, <q>save
                     connoisseurial time</q> to delegate the practice of, say, visual comparison, to
                  a computer program? Ryan brings no evidence to bear to demonstrate that there are
                  other ways to produce this kind of domain-specific knowledge other than the very
                  practice he is automating, that is, having a human being perform these <quote
                     rend="inline">painstaking, difficult</quote> tasks, especially those that
                  require <quote rend="inline">very narrow expertise,</quote> as he himself notes
                     <ptr target="#ryan2009" loc="36"/>. </p>
               <p>We do not believe that such a demonstration is possible, and it would be
                  irresponsible to find out simply by trying. The question of whether or not a
                  certain painter painted a given part of a picture is, ultimately, unverifiable.
                  While there is a reality to it, we cannot replicate it as an experiment: we do not
                  have a time machine. What an act of hubris it would be to think that we could at
                  any one point solve the problem of art attribution once and for all! Disagreement
                  and a lack of complete consensus in an interpretive community is not a sign of its
                  failure, or lack of <q>efficiency;</q> they are signs of its correct functioning
                  as this community goes about its work of continually producing meaningful, cogent
                  knowledge. </p>
               <p>In our digital work with the Morellian Method, we focused not on issues of
                  efficiency, novelty, or even the extent to which we could fully mechanize art
                  attribution, but instead on using the computer to help slow our thoughts down,
                  pick apart what we were seeing, show us some of our assumptions in pain-staking
                  detail, and to dive deeper into the system we were formalizing. Rather than hoping
                  that the computer system would partially mechanize our trained judgement, we hoped
                  the process would allow us to use it more judiciously. We wished to engage with
                  what it would mean to implement the Morellian method within the context of digital
                  computing while maintaining our focus on the intellectual priorities of the
                  humanities, hoping to take advantage of the <q>computational mirror</q> to come to
                  learn things about Morelli’s methods and our own. We therefore proposed a
                  technical collaboration with the Extreme Science and Engineering Discovery
                  Environment (XSEDE) group, an NSF-funded, computational and collaborative
                  infrastructure built on top of the United States’ national network of
                  supercomputers, for the development of a proof-of-concept “Morelli Machine” that
                  would take advantage of the team’s interdisciplinary composition to use digital
                  techniques to apply Morelli's method to a large set of images of artworks. </p>

               <head>Our Engagement with the “Morelli Machine”</head>
               <p>We were keenly aware that the reward structure that would surround the
                  technologist assigned to us by the XSEDE infrastructure would differ greatly from
                  our own as academics, and we wanted to design the details of the project so that
                  it could accommodate both our desire to create recognizable humanistic research as
                  well as fit the requirements of grant-funded technologists who would need to show
                  computational innovation and novel results.<note>In the computing and information
                     sciences, <q>novel results</q> are the coin of the realm, even serving as a
                     major criterion for tenure and promotion. On this, see <ptr target="#cra"/> and
                        <ptr target="#luzonmarco2000"/>. On the alignment of priorities and reward
                     structures in interdisciplinary work, see <ptr target="#berg-fulton2018"/>.
                  </note> Therefore, after our initial proposal was accepted, we designed a
                  two-phase project plan with the input of the XSEDE technologist-consultants Paul
                  Rodriguez and Alan Craig. First, we would apply Morelli’s method in a somewhat
                  strict historical manner. We would ask the computer to extract the eyes, mouths
                  and hands from a dataset of images and then cluster them into formal categories,
                  that is, we would ask the machine to follow the same workflow detailed in
                  Morelli’s writings.<note>As detailed in the workplan of Paul Rodriguez, the lead
                     technologist/consultant on this project, we planned to, <quote rend="inline"
                        >apply existing image processing techniques and procedures for segmentation
                        and object border detection, current state-of-the art methods like
                        convolution neural networks for object detection and classification, and
                        open source tools for face detection and facial feature identification in
                        order to divide [a dataset of] old-master paintings into a variety of
                        segments</quote>
                     <ptr target="#rodriguez2018"/></note> We would then look to see what groupings
                  the computer might find, in part to compare the results to the known clusters of
                  artistic similarity, but also to see if the computer was able to group these
                  features into any other sorts of meaningful groups that may not (yet) hold any
                  resemblance to art-historical opinion. We chose to apply a standard computer
                  vision technique known as Histogram of Oriented Gradients for Phase One, rather
                  than either a supervised or unsupervised machine learning system, for two reasons:
                  first, as we will note below, Phase Two was earmarked for such approaches, and
                  second, Histogram of Oriented Gradients, as a feature descriptor that operates
                  similarly to edge detectors, works by isolating dramatic shifts within digital
                  images, an approach that seemed to map well to the process that Morelli
                  proposed.</p>
               <p>It was recognized from the very beginning that this work, like Ryan’s, would
                  require <term>data</term> and a great deal of it. We had initially hoped that we
                  could amass between two and five thousand images drawn from a handful
                  institutions, such as the Kress Foundation, The Metropolitan Museum of Art, and
                  the National Gallery. Our plan was to gather this relatively large number of
                  images, or perhaps even more, from ArtSTOR’s collection of digitized and digital
                  images of artworks. While our initial conversations with ArtSTOR seemed promising,
                  in the end, the red tape surrounding the large-scale use of multi-institutional
                  images proved insurmountable to solve in the time we had to address it. </p>
               <p>However, Nygren and Langmead knew, because of prior digital humanities work their
                  students Andrea Maxwell and Sarah Reiff Conell had done with the images of the
                  Samuel H. Kress Collection, that the Kress Foundation is very generous in sharing
                  their collection of digital images for computational use, and moreover, offered
                  dependable metadata. After our initial conversations with ArtSTOR faltered, we
                  approached the leadership of the Kress Foundation with a request to use their
                  images for the purposes of this project, and they happily agreed, while noting
                  that perhaps the easiest way to acquire the files would be, ironically, through
                  ArtSTOR. With the help of the Foundation, ArtSTOR was able to provide us with the
                  digitized images of the Kress Collection, a dataset that amounted to 1,866 files,
                  not <q>Big Data</q> by computer-scientific standards, but too large and at
                  too-high a resolution for a laptop to process, and was sufficient to kickstart our
                  work.</p>
               <p>For the second phase of the project — one we will not have space to fully detail
                  in this essay — we recognized that Morelli’s approach of decomposing the images
                  into distinct human-recognizable features would not be the way that contemporary
                  technologists might choose to approach this work if the goal was clustering and
                  classifying images by artist. It is currently quite difficult and time-consuming
                  to ask a computer to do the work of extracting human-defined, visual details from
                  images, and it only has marginal computer-scientific novelty to approach the
                  problem in this manner. And so, Langmead, Nygren, Rodriguez and Craig collectively
                  designed a plan for Phase Two that would compare and cluster the images in this
                  same dataset using machine learning approaches that let the computer select the
                  important features, rather than forcing the use of human-defined ones.<note>It did
                     not pass by us unnoticed that this second approach returns, in a sense, to
                     looking at the painting as a whole which holds an interesting parallel to
                     taking in the <q>general impression</q> of a painting to classify/attribute it
                     — an approach directly derided by Morelli.</note> Even though we will not
                  detail the process or the results of this second phase in this paper, we mention
                  it here because we feel that it is important to present the entire scope of the
                  collaboration and the balance we tried to strike between serving the working needs
                  of the humanists and the technologists on this project. Our results from Phase Two
                  will be the focus of a separate study at a later date, and has already been
                  presented by Rodriguez to the XSEDE community and received with
                     interest.<note>Partial results from both Phase One and Phase Two can be found
                     in <ptr target="#rodriguezetal2020"/>.</note>
               </p>
               <p>Phase One of the <title rend="quotes">Morelli Machine</title> project began in
                  August 2018 and concluded in January 2019. Given that the off-the-shelf digital
                  technologies for facial recognition were, and are, far more advanced than any
                  other type of human body-part-detection, we focused on the process of extracting
                  facial features such as eyes and mouths from the data set, rather than hands or
                  feet. Step one on this path was, therefore, to extract faces from the images.
                  Rodriguez began by trying the Dlib Face Detector and OpenCV Face Recognition
                  libraries, but found in the end that the Google Vision API was the most successful
                  at identifying the faces within our dataset.<note>For more on the dlib face
                     detector, see <ptr target="#ponnusamy2018"/>. For more on OpenCV, see <ptr
                        target="#rosebrock2018"/>. For more on the Google Vision Detect Faces API,
                     see <ptr target="#google2020"/>.</note> Google’s technology was then applied to
                  the entire collection, and succeeded in extracting 3,205 faces. This API also
                  returned facial landmarks — that is, polygons that outlined its best guesses as to
                  where the eyes, nose and mouth were located on each face it identified — and
                  Rodriguez used this information to post-process the results and extract our
                  desired facial features as individual, cropped images (see <ref target="#figure05"
                     >Figure 5</ref>). </p>

               </figure>
               <p>To fine-tune this process of feature extraction, Rodriguez applied pose (i.e.,
                  head turn) estimates, again using the Google Vision API, to adjust the size and
                  shape of these boundary polygons. We wanted to be as careful as possible to
                  extract only our desired facial features, knowing that applying Morelli’s method
                  requires accurate feature extraction. Overall, to the human eye, the results
                  appeared quite good. Rodriguez estimated that around 71% of the faces found within
                  our image files were successfully identified, and within that result set, we were
                  able to extract all of the eyes and mouths <ptr target="#rodriguez2020b"/>.</p>
               <p>Sufficiently satisfied with the accuracy of the feature extraction, the team then
                  moved to the task of clustering. The team began by focusing on the mouths and
                  Rodriguez turned to the Histogram of Oriented Gradients technique to begin work.
                  Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG) is a feature descriptor that operates
                  similarly to edge detectors, that is, rather than treating images as color values,
                  it works by identifying the direction and magnitudes of relative difference
                  between pixels. These differences can then, in turn, be used to detect the edges
                  of and/or identify the human-recognizable objects represented in the
                     images.<note>As a technical side note, in this project, summarization was used
                     to ensure that Histogram of Oriented Gradients was implemented in a manner that
                     was rotational invariant <ptr target="#rodriguez2020c"/>.</note> At each pixel,
                  the algorithm calculates a vector for the <q>gradient,</q> that is the amount of
                  numeric change between that pixel and the other pixels adjacent to it horizontally
                  and vertically. Those vectors are then added together to create a main direction
                  and magnitude for each pixel, that is, its oriented gradient (see <ref
                     target="#figure06">Figure 6</ref>). </p>

                     black box centered on a single pixel. At right, that same area of the image
                     marked by the black box magnified further, with the red arrows denoting the
                     change in pixel value in the horizontal and vertical dimensions, and the purple
                     arrow being their sum. Image courtesy Paul Rodriguez.</head>

               </figure>
               <p>When implementing HOG, the meaning of <q>change in pixel value</q> can be tweaked
                  by the technologist to best identify those features of an image that may be more
                  important to the study at hand. This could be color detection, saturation
                  detection, or any other fundamental, numerically represented, feature of a digital
                  image. To work effectively, therefore, a bit of data pre-processing on the images
                  is required to highlight those characteristics that it has been decided are
                  important to the assessment at hand, and to deemphasize those felt to be
                  extraneous. Deciding what was and was not visually important to implementing the
                  Morellian method computationally became something that our team needed to identify
                  at the outset. As art historians focused on implementing Morelli’s method as
                  closely as we could, Nygren and Langmead were very concerned with maintaining as
                  much color information in our analysis. Rodriguez took this request into deep
                  consideration and opted to normalize the eye-images so that the total illumination
                  was constant but relative color values were still present.<note><q>Relative</q>
                     here means that, for a three-channel RGB image, the sum of all pixels in each
                     channel will consistently add to 1 and the sum of all pixels at any given image
                     location will also add to 1 across channels <ptr target="#rodriguez2019"
                     />.</note>
               </p>
               <p>As a next step in the HOG process, all pixels in the image are clustered into
                  blocks of four and the vectorized gradients for each of them are then used to
                  calculate nine summary gradients as measured from the block center (see <ref
                     target="#figure07">Figure 7</ref>). These nine summary vectors are then counted
                  and visualized as a histogram showing the distribution of the sum of their
                  magnitudes, categorized by their orientation. The greater the count in any given
                  bin, the <q>stronger</q> the gradient is said to be. </p>

               <p>The penultimate result of the Histogram of Oriented Gradients feature descriptor,
                  then, is that the images have been decomposed into a set of clustered, oriented,
                  summarizing, nine-dimensional vectors that describe the relative numeric change in
                  pixel values across the image, one that also retains information about the
                  relative direction in which that change occurs (see <ref target="#figure08">Figure
                     8</ref>). </p>

               <p>These vectors can then be visualized as a histogram that can be taken to assert
                  the relative <q>strength</q> and <q>weakness</q> of the gradients across the
                  image. To conclude the process of applying the Histogram of Oriented Gradients
                  technique, a summarization method is applied: one final feature vector is
                  calculated by taking all of these nine-dimensional vectors and summarizing them
                  into a single, large, ten-dimensional vector that represents, in some ways, the
                  image in its entirety <ptr target="#rodriguez2020a"/>.</p>
               <p>Once this process had been run on our extracted features, it was time to arrange
                  them into clusters of similarity. The ten-dimensional HOG feature vectors that
                  summarized each image were used as input into a K-means clustering algorithm to
                  gather the images into (hopefully meaningful) groupings. To visualize this
                  information, the original ten-dimensional feature vectors were projected into
                  two-dimensional space using the t-SNE technique, and each point on the resulting
                  graph was then color-coded according to their K-means clustering assignments (<ref
                     target="#figure09">Figure 9</ref>).<note>For more on t-SNE, please see [van der

               <p>The initial clustering results for mouths did not inspire anyone on the team to
                  assert that our computational method was successfully grouping the images by any
                  clear, meaningful art-historical metric whatsoever (see <ref target="#figure10"
                     >Figure 10</ref>). Above and beyond the fact that the team had clearly produced
                  an excellent Old-Master-Painting mouth extractor, the clustering results produced
                  by the combination of the t-SNE and K-means procedures was not anywhere near to
                  clustering these features by artist. None of us were even particularly struck by
                  any amount of above-average visual similarity within the clusters. The results for
                  eyes were no better.</p>

               <p>It was becoming clear that HOG was not sorting these images into groups that held
                  visual interest for the team. But even so, because our own research questions
                  asked us to make some form of art-historical, or even visual, sense of the
                  clusters of disembodied mouths, Langmead and Nygren were afforded the time and the
                  opportunity to acknowledge and respond to their own immediate and visceral
                  recognition of the aesthetic violence of Morelli’s method, one perhaps magnified
                  by the scale offered by the digital computer. This moment offered us an
                  experiential taste of what it means to extract recognizably visual features from
                  art objects and array them like so many specimens in a row. Moreover, it suggested
                  how hard it can be to visually interpret these isolated images at this scale, one
                  orders of magnitude more massive than Morelli could have possibly imagined.
                  Morelli himself suggested that it was overwhelming to confront dozens of sketches
                  of fragmented body parts, and seeing thousands of them proved no less
                  disconcerting (see <ref target="#figure11">Figure 11</ref>). </p>

               <p>When comparing Morelli’s published line drawings of disembodied hands and ears to
                  our data, Langmead and Nygren had been considering these visually comprehensible
                  images as the computational analogs to Morelli’s <term>Grundformen</term>.
                  However, during a team meeting, as Rodriguez took a moment to narrate his process
                  in greater detail, he also shared the set of pre-processed images created for the
                  HOG feature descriptor. It was at that moment, with the grids of mouths in mind,
                  that Nygren and Langmead were suddenly struck with the realization that these
                  pre-processed images — not the disembodied, recognizable mouths that had been
                  extracted by the Google Vision API — were the objects analogous to the
                     <term>Grundformen</term>, the dimensionally-reduced line drawings used by
                  Morelli (see <ref target="#figure12">Figure 12</ref>). These (to human eyes)
                  yellow and white, almost wholly abstracted forms, were the more fundamental visual
                  evidence of the extreme computational abstraction necessary to make claims about
                  sameness and difference within a computer, not the grid of human-identifiable
                  mouths. </p>

               <p>To explain what we mean let us return to the Beccadelli portrait we introduced
                  above, because it is in the illustration accompanying his discussion of that
                  painting that the ultimate stakes of the <term>Grundformen</term> become clear.
                  Through working with Morelli’s method within the context of digital computing, we
                  came to understand that it is predicated on a misdirection that leads us away from
                  the painting-in-the-world toward an abstract, schematic rendering conjured into
                  existence by the connoisseur. Closely comparing Morelli’s line drawing to the
                  Beccadelli portrait, we noticed that his sketchy rendering is quite deceptive and
                  does not appear to duplicate either hand found in Titian’s painting. To a trained
                  art historian, the hand seen in Morelli’s line drawing actually seems much closer
                  to the hands found in numerous other TItian paintings executed around this same
                  period in Titian’s career (1540-50), such as the <title rend="italic">Crowning of
                     Thorns</title>, <title rend="italic">The Allocution of Alfonso
                     d’Avalos,</title> or the <title rend="italic">Portrait of Vincenzo
                     Cappello</title> (see <ref target="#figure13">Figure 13</ref>). For a man
                  focused on details, Morelli appears entirely uninterested in offering direct
                  visual parallels between his line drawings and the particulars of this portrait

               <p>Elsewhere in his volume, Morelli suggested that the <hi rend="italic"
                     >Grundformen</hi> should resolve into a <quote rend="inline">physiological
                     treatise</quote>
                  <ptr target="#morelli1893" loc="10"/>. Having trained as a physician, Morelli’s
                     <term>Grundformen</term>
                  <q>identify</q> the author of a painting in the same way that a diagnostic manual
                     <q>identifies</q> a disease: if diagnosis relies on inference based on
                  symptoms, so too does attribution mobilize evidence in the service of inferential
                  reasoning that is ultimately metonymic.<note>Carlo Ginzburg also famously
                     addresses the <quote rend="inline">medical semiotics</quote> of Morelli’s work,
                     alongside that of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle and Sigmund Freud, in <ptr
                        target="#ginzburg1980" loc="esp 12ff"/>.</note> It is important to
                  understand that despite Morelli’s insistence that the <term>Grundformen</term>
                  constitute a form of ground truth on top of which he constructed his attributions,
                  his practice made apparent that they are significant personal abstractions
                  intended for use by trained professionals who have a great deal of pre-existing
                  visual expertise. The <term>Grundformen</term> do not exist in any real sense,
                  that is, the <term>Grundform</term> of a Titian hand is not the same thing as a
                  photographic detail of Beccadelli’s hand as painted by Titian. Rather, the
                     <term>Grundformen</term> were, in Morelli’s account, a wholly schematic
                  rendering of the type of hands formulaically produced across Titian’s entire
                  pictorial corpus, which existed firstly in the mind of the scholar and only
                  secondarily as line drawings.</p>
               <p>This realization forced us to consider Morelli’s texts in a new light. On the
                  basis of what we learned by attempting to computationally recreate Morelli’s
                  method, it was no longer clear to us that we were making correct assumptions about
                  how he expected his books to be read and what role he intended the
                     <term>Grundformen</term> to play in the process of attribution. On the one
                  hand, Morelli could have expected his readers to take copies of his book to the
                  unattributed painting and compare his line drawings to the image <hi rend="italic"
                     >in vivo</hi>. On the other, his books could have been taken as an invitation
                  to the reader to produce abstracted line drawings of their own, only comparable to
                  Morelli’s published drawings, to use in the service of their own attributions.</p>
               <p>At this point we feel it is worthwhile to underline what we consider one of the
                  major findings of this project, at the level of both art-historical and
                  computational analysis: Morelli’s <term>Grundformen</term> are not simply
                  dimensional reductions of visual data. The <term>Grundformen</term> are embodied
                  renderings of human judgment, the result of hundreds (if not thousands) of hours
                  of deliberatively looking at early modern paintings with the larger intention of
                  developing a method for describing artistic style. Simply looking at an array of
                  extracted images would never result in the production of a <term>Grundform</term>;
                  to do this work, a human must exercise trained judgment to identify precisely what
                  is and what is not important to their own informed understanding of the notion of
                  artistic style and then use those concepts to extract only what is necessary to
                  them. There is no promise that the <term>Grundformen</term> of one scholar would
                  match those of another. Similarly, asking a computer to replicate this workflow
                  cannot be achieved by training the computer to recognize, say, every human hand
                  painted by Titian; rather, it would require the computer to produce its own
                  abstracted rendering of Titian’s <q>hand,</q> which encompasses both the hands he
                  painted and his stylistic <q>hand,</q> and then to deploy successfully that
                  abstraction identifying artistic style. While current computer techniques are
                  becoming capable of achieving the first step in this process, as represented by
                  the yellow-and-white abstractions made for the Histogram of Oriented Gradients
                  workflow, the higher order function of articulating how these abstractions make
                  meaning in the context of the scholarly community remains beyond its reach without
                  human intervention. For the machines to be able to attribute artwork on their own,
                  we would need to allow them to join our intentional community and delegate some of
                  the responsibility for our judgment to their mechanical processes.</p>

               <p>We set about this collaboration because we were curious to see what it would
                  require to implement an art historical method of connoisseurship computationally.
                  We have determined that, for the moment at least, computational techniques cannot
                  attribute artworks without the support of human judgement and expertise.<note>It
                     may be more successful in the realm of graphic works, as suggested by <ptr

                  relationship to technology transforms over time, our core belief remains that
                  looking to a computer for the <q>answer</q> to the question <q>who painted this
                     picture?</q> is currently not only misplaced but can also have noxious
                  implications. </p>
               <p>Although we did not initiate this collaboration with the art market in mind, it
                  quickly became clear to us that our project would not be perceived as agnostic by
                  that market itself and the stakes of this work partake of this larger ecosystem

                     possible roles that computers might take up in this ecosystem, and what may be
                     at stake. Ahmed Elgammal is also a co-founder of Artrendex, LLC, a company that

                  </note> This perhaps should not have come as a surprise, since Morelli’s method
                  has had a marked impact on the art market <ptr target="#agosti1993"/>. Because the
                  price of an object on the market is interlinked with other concepts like historic
                  import and artistic <q>value</q> (however defined), any mode of verifying the
                  authenticity or attribution of a work of art that is deemed to be trustworthy
                  will, almost as if through capillary motion, flow into the surplus value of the
                  work of art. Over the course of the twentieth century, increasing preference has
                  been given to the evidence produced through technological processes to determine
                  authorship <ptr target="#carrier2003"/>

                  Analytical, making them the first auction house to create an in-house scientific

                  refuge in the seemingly dispassionate results of scientists, a form of evidence
                  that takes on the air of objectivity and thereby is granted authority, especially
                  by those outside of the scholarly community. </p>
               <p>Carrying this tradition forward, computer science researchers have recently been
                  promoting their technical skills with computer vision to hold out the promise of
                     <q>art verified by AI.</q><note>Two of the three authors of a recent study that
                     proposed to use automated analysis of drawings to determine their authenticity
                     listed their primary affiliation as Artrendex, LLC, a startup that promises to
                     use computers to verify works available on the market <ptr
                        target="#elgammal2018"/>.</note> Such interventions draw on the same desire
                  for <q>objective</q> data as earlier attempts to incorporate scientific results of
                  pigment analysis and carbon-14 dating, but this time wrapped in the rhetoric of
                  artificial intelligence. The assertion that an attribution has been <q>computer
                     verified</q> is likely to increase the value and prestige of old master
                  paintings. Would collectors be more likely to wager the GDP of a small nation, as
                  in the example of the <title rend="italic">Salvator Mundi</title> above, on the
                  conflicting opinions of embodied art historians or on the declarative output of a
                  computer algorithm? We cannot claim to know with certainty, but it seems as likely
                  as not that a buyer will trust the definitive answer produced by the black box of
                  a computer algorithm over a cacophonous exchange of interpretations between the
                  competing voices of art historians. The art market demands answers, not a series
                  of questions.<note>For a truly cutting assessment of the anti-ethical disposition
                     of the market for old master paintings, see <ptr target="#burke2020"/>.</note>
               </p>
               <p>As humanists, however, we believe that such questions are truly important. What
                  does the insertion of a computer change about, or add to, the traditional
                  humanistic process of looking at objects and providing well-founded, inferential
                  statements about the past? Is it the immense speed of calculation? Is it the size
                  of the data sets? Could it be that people might trust a computer in a way that
                  they no longer trust intellectual forebears such as Morelli? We have engaged in
                  academic research, and to the extent possible we have attempted to sever our
                  inquiry from the <q>umbilical cord of gold</q> that links art, art history, and
                     capitalism.<note>We are indebted to Paul Jaskot for reminding us of this phrase
                     originally used by the art critic Clement Greenberg <ptr target="#jaskot2019"

                  However, our community’s efforts in this domain must remain ongoing. </p>
               <p>Research in this field should not only resist instrumentalization by the art
                  market, but also offer perspectives on the serious stakes of what it would mean
                  for human beings to vest computers with the sole responsibility for making
                  attributions. Let us return once again to the thought experiment proposed in the
                  introduction in order to make a specific point. To whom would the purchaser of the
                  work purportedly by Leonardo make recourse in the event that the algorithm that
                  produced a computational attribution of the painting to the master was proven to
                  be faulty? The culpable might include: the computer programmer who developed the
                  algorithm; the art historians (if any) who contributed to the construction of the
                  algorithm; the lines of code in the algorithm; the piece of hardware that ran the
                  algorithm; the auction house that countenanced the results; the buyer who believed
                  the results; or the insurance agency that indemnified the results. In this day and
                  age, it is not possible to imagine that, from such a list, anything other than a
                  human being can be held accountable for such an error, and yet the decision would
                  have been “made” by a machine.<note><quote rend="inline">The conclusion
                        generalizes. We should not delegate to reckoning systems, nor trust them

               </p>
               <p>The difficulties faced in attempting to respond to this scenario point, we
                  believe, to the unavoidable truth that computers have not earned their place in
                  the conversation about artistic attribution because the linkage between
                     <q>style</q> and authorship is not some immutable law of physics that is easily
                  computable, but rather a humanistic commitment that requires human judgment. To
                  make the practice of art attribution anything else besides a necessary
                  collaboration between the physical object and trained human beings would require a
                  fundamental reassessment of the practice, not simply its mechanization. We would
                  like to argue that all such systems will currently fail to produce convincing
                  results, not because they are incapable of mimicking the formal methods of art
                  attribution, but because they have not (yet) been accepted as members of the
                  community that make up attribution’s social practice, and cannot take
                  responsibility for their conclusions. The computer can present the art historian
                  with a series of statistical probabilities related to authorship, but it is
                  important to note that simply choosing between a menu of options presented by the
                  computer is not sufficient for producing a genuine attribution: art attribution
                  cannot be reduced to decisionism; it requires judgment. We affirm that it is
                  necessary for the community of experts called upon to make these judgments be made
                  up of a broad and representative population of human experience that goes beyond
                  the demographics that have traditionally dominated the space of attribution. It is
                  precisely because <emph>human judgment</emph> is necessary to the process of
                  attribution that, to make effective meaning, the community must reflect the
                  breadth of the human experience. </p>
               <p>While the results of our Phase One workflow were not designed to <q>give
                     answers</q> to the problem of attribution, and were certainly not successfully
                  responding to that imperative in any way, they have illuminated the ways that the
                  mechanical processes of abstraction that, at first, seemed similar between our
                  computational approaches and Morelli’s, were in fact utterly different, once
                  contextualized within a social system. When they are presented as abstract
                  entities on the page, Morelli’s <term>Grundformen</term> appear reified; through
                  rhetorical force, they seem to take on an existence that was independent of the
                  paintings in which they may be found. This presents an occasion for “verification”
                  and cross-reference that can be described as quasi-computational and therefore
                  formalizable. But the process of art attribution does not begin and end with the
                  physical materiality of the painting. </p>
               <p>Attributing a work of art has always been the work of narrative explication rather
                  than mere reckoning about stylistic markers. It currently <emph>requires</emph>
                  human judgment, expertise, and trust to become an effective truth in the world.
                  Morelli, too, gestured towards this state of affairs by presenting his method in
                  his text as a product of dialogue, as a conversation embedded in expertise and
                  interpersonal persuasion. Morelli’s <term>Grundformen</term> existed to help his
                  interlocutors see the paintings <emph>as he saw them</emph>, as a way to convince
                  others of his judgments. Even granting that computational methods eventually rise
                  to the level of being able to make believable assessments of stylistic markers,
                  for their outputs to become truly effective, they would need to earn their place
                  as full participants in the social process of art attribution, and human beings
                  would need to delegate some power of judgment to them. </p>

               <p>When we began this project, we took a leap of faith that we would uncover
                  interesting areas of art-historical inquiry by computationally mechanizing
                  Giovanni Morelli’s method of art attribution. While it was to be expected that our
                  system could match Morelli’s own at the level of the workflow — extract a set of
                  details and compare them — we did not anticipate how our work would show us the
                  complexity of Morelli’s historical process at a more fundamental level. Where
                  Morelli used his native human powers of abstraction and judgement to reduce old
                  master paintings to a series of published line drawings, we found ourselves using
                  the computer’s power of abstraction to create seemingly analogous,
                  dimensionally-reduced representations. In so doing, we recognized that Morelli’s
                  abstractions were effective because they worked in parallel with his human
                  judgment in a way that mechanical processes could never replicate alone.</p>
               <p>Our investigation has also suggested to us that there is a fundamental question
                  that the field of art history has not yet addressed and that computers might
                  actually help clarify: to what extent are personalized, identifiable artistic
                  traces, however they are defined (forms, brushstroke, pigment, craquelure,
                  etc...), registered at the level of pixels? Because, insofar as these traces are
                  so registered, they <emph>will</emph> be legible computationally and therefore
                  computers <emph>can</emph> identify them, perhaps even more effectively than human
                  beings. We nevertheless argue that pixel-level information, on its own, would be
                  insufficient to produce a credible attribution. That work is done as a social
                  practice; it is a matter of an interaction between the physical traces of the past
                  on the canvas and the trained judgment of human beings. It is an ecology that
                  includes the physical history of the work of art, the archive of historical
                  knowledge external to the work itself, and the particular training of each expert
                  working in a community that has the power to make their findings real and
                  effective in the world. </p>
               <p>Classical, deterministic, electronic, digital computers are designed to produce
                  certain results based on the input given and their own physical and logical
                  programming. They only show you what you have set them up to show you — not
                  necessarily what you wanted, needed, or even expected to see. Humanists natively
                  operate in a different space than this, which might suggest that the world of
                  computation cannot speak to the world of the interpretive expert. However, we
                  argue here that this is not the case. Working with the computer, and with trained
                  technologists, has provided us with the opportunity to gain important perspectives
                  by allowing us to produce and manipulate an art-historical model of the world. A
                  truism that has become particularly self-evident during the COVID-19 pandemic is
                  that all computer models are, in some senses, wrong, but some models are
                     useful.<note>The dictum, <q>All models are wrong, but some are useful,</q> is
                     associated with the statistician George Box <ptr target="#box1979"/>. On the
                     utility of the (wrong but useful) models used in the Covid-19 pandemic, see
                        <ptr target="#holmdahl2020"/>. For more on the utilities of computational
                     models within the humanities, see <ptr target="#langmead2020"/>.</note>
                  Recognizing the ways that our computational model did and did not implement the
                  older art-historical approach was, for us, like both looking through a microscope
                  and a mirror onto the history of our discipline. This exercise forced us to slow
                  down and look at Morelli’s method in minute detail, but in the end, it also
                  reflected our own assumptions back to us, providing us with clear critical
                  distance. Using digital techniques to think through even historically distant
                  modes of art history indicates one path by which our field can do the ongoing work
                  of reshaping its own practices from within while also reaching out and
                  collaborating with other expert communities that see the world differently.
                  Bridging those gaps, we believe, is crucial to developing art history for the
                  digital age. </p>
