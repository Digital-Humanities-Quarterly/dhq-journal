                     Lives Matter movement following the murders of Trayvon Martin, George 
                     Floyd, and Breonna Taylor. Naming names has always been about 
                     remembrance, connections, relationships, and identities. “The act of 
                     naming is an act of power”, writes Katja Guenther. 
                     “Parents naming children, conquerors naming new lands, and 
                     organizations naming themselves all involve the assertion of author and control. Names
                     
                     allow us to communicate through the development of shared meanings” 
                     [<a class="ref" href="#guenther2009">Guenther 2009</a>, 412]. Naming names has also always been seeped in power. 
                     The power to name is the power to claim, which is why naming and renaming practices
                     
                     seem to be so central to enslaved people and their descendants.

                     internet-based platforms the names of people of African descent who were enslaved
                     before 
                     states mandated abolition and those who were liberated by policies restricting the
                     slave 
                     trade. The authors in this special issue raise issues that have resonance with 
                     internet-based historical studies of other oppressed and vulnerable populations by
                     
                     considered several key questions: do historians face unique ethical considerations
                     when 
                     making named enslaved people known on publicly accessible websites? When publishing
                     
                     historical findings about enslaved people on the internet, what are our obligations
                     to the 
                     subjects of our studies? Should historians who identify enslaved historical actors
                     by name 
                     online be concerned about the thoughts and feelings of their descendants today? Should
                     we 
                     consult with descendant communities? In brief, the authors of this collection 
                     examine some of the ethical implications of studying enslaved people in the Internet

                  <div class="ptext" id="p5">Scholars who are taking their studies of named enslaved people to the internet display
                     a commitment to values long espoused by social historians. As a field of study, social
                     history emerged in the 1960s and 1970s in reaction to fields that focused on politics,
                     diplomacy, and great men and that ignored the lived experiences of common people.
                     Social historians embarked on studies of populations the world over. Among the histories
                     they sought to tell were those of Africans and people of African descent in diaspora.
                     In so doing, they responded to the demands of Black activists and university students,
                     who spearheaded the Civil Rights Movement, to create a more inclusive history of the
                     U.S. and the broader Atlantic world. In studies of enslaved populations, social historians
                     examined resistance to oppression, social lives, family structures, cultures, labor,
                     suffering, and resilience. They debunked myths rooted in racist ideologies and showed
                     that Black populations contributed to the creation of the world we have inherited
                     (Stuckey 1969; Zunz 1985; Hawthorne 2018; Stanizani 2023).</div>

                  <div class="ptext" id="p6">Since enslaved people of African descent penned precious little about their own lives,
                     social historians developed new methodologies to tell their histories. The violence
                     of enslavement ruptured Black life around the Atlantic. Enslavers tore Africans from
                     their natal homes, transported them far away, renamed them, and structured their lives
                     and the lives of their descendants around labor for capitalist economies. In records
                     they kept, enslavers reduced the enslaved to commodities, erasing much of their history.
                     Therefore, to understand changes in enslaved people's lives over time social historians
                     have methodologies centered on the collection of oral history, analysis of language,
                     study of material culture, and quantification of data found in records recorded by
                     enslavers. In the late 1960s and 1970s, quantitative approaches to the study of slave
                     populations involved the extraction and standardization of data from records enslavers
                     recorded and the creation of large datasets. The approach was exemplified by Philip
                     Curtin's seminal work, The Atlantic Slave Trade: A Census (1972), and Robert William
                     Fogel and Stanley L. Engerman's <span class="hi italic">Time on the Cross: The Economics of American Negro Slavery</span> (1974). What resulted were studies of broad populations, but beyond a relatively
                     small number of biographies of exceptional enslaved people, histories of slavery did
                     not often lend themselves to a focus on named individuals. Observing this, Jennifer
                     L. Morgan describes the “maddening synchronicity of erasure and enumeration” that
                     has rendered enslaved individuals–especially enslaved females in Morgan's account
                     — silent and absent from the historical record and from written histories. Quantitative
                     methods, she continues, have resulted in “prisons of meaning … [making] a certain
                     kind of scholarship possible while rendering another quite impossible” (Morgan 2021;
                     Law 2002; Miller 2014; Klein 2014).</div>

                     enslaved people in historical studies and reconceptualizing the history of slavery.
                     As they do so, they are challenged by ethical considerations that are unique to publication
                     on the internet. An obvious difference between publishing findings about enslaved
                     populations — including lists of names — in print scholarship versus digital scholarship
                     is that digital scholarship, assuming it is open access, is more readily available,
                     free to anyone with a computer and internet connection. Digital projects about named
                     enslaved people are also designed to be searchable — to facilitate the identification
                     of people quickly and easily. Digital projects take history directly to the public,
                     making information about slavery and the named individuals who suffered under it widely
                     available — not only in the United States but anywhere in the world. Further, digital
                     dataset projects often allow for the download of data that researchers can manipulate
                     and analyze with digital tools. And internet-based dataset projects that apply linked
                     open data principles facilitate the rapid identification of people who appear in more
                     than one dataset and the combining of data about them, which facilitates the telling
                     of fuller life histories (for example, <a href="https://enslaved.org/" onclick="window.open('https://enslaved.org/'); return false" class="ref">Enslaved.org</a>). </div>

                     about named enslaved individuals. Such sites are important to African Americans undertaking
                     genealogical research; names are tangible links to a family's past, giving people
                     who have long thought slavery erased their family history an opportunity to uncover
                     aspects of it. For some, proven descendancy from enslaved people has been the basis
                     for claims for reparations. Further, educators seeking to diversify their lesson plans
                     by relating the history of slavery through explorations of the lives of named enslaved
                     individuals have benefitted from open-source scholarly websites. Internet sources
                     for the study of slavery can also fill a void in places in the United States that
                     have implemented laws banning books and teaching about race, racial oppression, and
                     critical race theory. Teachers in Florida might be hesitant to teach their students
                     about the named enslaved people who James Monroe sold from his plantation in Virginia
                     to Florida to pay debts in the early nineteenth century, but through open-source internet-based
                     datasets, students can explore the lives of Dudley and Eve McGuire, Toby and Betsy,

                  <div class="ptext" id="p9">By compiling data extracted from primary sources into datasets, digital historians
                     of slavery have pursued some of the methods of quantitative and statistical historians.
                     But when sources reveal them, they have valued the recording of enslaved people's
                     names so that datasets can be used for broad studies of populations and for the writing
                     of biographies and family histories. To be sure, source material usually provides
                     only scant information — shards and fragmentary data — about enslaved individuals,
                     so we will never be able to write rich cradle to grave biographies of the overwhelming
                     majority of those who toiled under enslavement. But the act of naming enslaved people
                     in internet-based scholarship writes them into history; it centers them and indicates
                     that their histories are as important as the histories of elite enslavers. Naming
                     names is a small step toward countering racist narratives of Africans and their descendants
                     as people without history. It makes clear that we can know more than that generalized
                     “slaves” suffered under oppression and violence; we can know the names of the enslaved
                     and, if other information is recorded in columns beside names in datasets, get a glimpse
                     into the lives enslaved individuals forged under conditions that were not of their
                     own choosing. Naming names can humanize those who enslavers sought to dehumanize.
                     It also advances a social agenda to “say their names” — to shout the names of those
                     who have died as the result of violence stemming from racism and oppression. </div>

                  <div class="ptext" id="p10">That said, naming names raises thorny ethical and analytical issues. The names historians
                     list in their datasets are not often names that enslaved Africans had been given in
                     their homelands or that enslaved people of African descent in the Americas chose for
                     their children. As wealthy Virginia planter Robert “King” Carter wrote in 1727 after
                     purchasing enslaved Africans from a trader in the state, “I name'd them here &amp; by
                     their names we can always know what sizes they are of &amp; would readily answer to them.”
                     When he handed the Africans over to his overseers, he instructed that the “negros
                     both men &amp; women… always go by the names we give them” (Berlin 1996, p. 251). The
                     stripping of enslaved Africans of their names happened around the Atlantic, as did
                     the process of enslavers naming enslaved children born to women they held in bondage.
                     This raises questions about the ends that historians achieve in listing the names
                     of enslaved people in online datasets. To what extent does the naming of names that
                     appear in sources recorded by enslavers obscure as much as it clarifies? Do names
                     tell us more about enslavers' proclivities — about how they identified those they
                     enslaved — than it does about how the enslaved identified themselves? If we see ourselves
                     as ethically obliged to make the histories of our subjects known, are we fulfilling
                     that obligation by listing names forced upon them by those who oppressed them?</div>

                  <div class="ptext" id="p11">The reality that enslavers created the archive that we as social historians of slavery
                     rely on raises other ethical considerations. Does the act of transcribing and mounting
                     on a website data from an enslaver's account book, which grouped the enslaved into
                     racial categories meant to indicate inferiority based on descent, used demeaning and
                     derogatory language, and assigned monetary values to people based on age, sex, skills,
                     injuries, illnesses, and childbearing capabilities, perpetuate racism from the past
                     into the present? Could our attempts to humanize the enslaved in studies we post online
                     reify again the dehumanizing efforts of enslavers? If so, how can we read against
                     the grain of our sources, explain to our readers the historical context in which they
                     were produced, and use enslavers' records to tell new histories of the enslaved? In
                     the Internet Age, what are our obligations to the dead and especially to those who
                     were marginalized?</div>

                  <div class="ptext" id="p12">A related question is what are our obligations to the living — to descent communities,
                     many of which are marginalized today because of institutional racism that is rooted
                     in the past? Following Jessica Marie Johnson's call, to what extent should historians
                     who explore the lives of named enslaved individuals on the internet “infuse their
                     work with a methodology and praxis that centers the descendants of the enslaved” (2018,
                     p. 71). In some parts of the world, descent communities have applauded internet-based
                     source material that facilitates research into and the teaching of Black history.
                     And Black genealogists have benefitted from access to open-source data linking them
                     to named ancestors. But, as the authors of articles in this collection show, not all
                     descent communities welcome the telling of histories that link them to slavery. Indeed,
                     in certain places a family's descent from named enslaved individuals carries today
                     a social stigma that can cause harm in the present. With this in mind, to what extent
                     should members of descent communities shape how professional historians tell — or
                     purposely silence — the writing and dissemination of history in the Digital Age? What,
                     if anything, should historians consider before making accessible and searchable on
                     the internet information about long-dead named individuals whose stories could give
                     us new insights into the past? Should historians' scholarship first and foremost do
                     no harm? Should we seek to protect the most vulnerable? </div>

                     combine and interact to [generate] systems of oppression…” (Tierney 2019, p. 127-28,
                     cited in Henrik et al 2020, p. 2). The term itself –vulnerability — is derived from
                     the Latin <span class="hi italic">vulnus</span>, which means wound and has come to mean the condition of being susceptible to harm
                     in a physical as well as social, psychological, moral, spiritual sense (Turner 2008,
                     p. 656). Both individuals and groups are vulnerable to harm, but systemic oppression
                     is most often directed against groups. Groups most subject to systemic oppression
                     are those who are defined by the dominant groups as others or as different. The United
                     Nations section on Fighting Racism lists those groups considered most vulnerable.
                     People of African descent, especially the descendants of the victims of the transatlantic
                     slave trade or more recent migrants face “discriminatory structures and institutions,
                     legacies of the injustices of enslavement and colonialism” that result in “the people
                     of African descent being among the poorest and most marginalized groups who also face
                     alarmingly high rates of police violence, and racial profiling.” The UN's list of
                     vulnerable groups includes indigenous peoples, Roma, Sinti, Travelers, persons belonging
                     to national, ethnic, religious and linguistic minorities, migrants, refugees, asylum
                     seekers, internally displaced people, people living in extreme poverty, LGBTQI+ people,
                     and women. Because of their gender, women and girls face additional discrimination
                     making them “extra vulnerable” (Fight Racism 2023; von Benzon and van Blerk 2018).
                     Precisely because the descendants of enslaved ancestors are subject to systemic oppression,
                     those of us working with digital projects dealing with these communities need to be
                     especially engaged with the complex and often contradictory ethical issues involved.

                     our work also “surfaces new moral quandaries” that demand deeper exploration of our
                     moral commitments as researchers and our responsibilities to the communities we study.
                     In engaging with these new moral quandaries, Nicholas Proferes draws a distinction
                     between compliant and contemplative ethics. In Proferes's terms, compliant ethics
                     are shorthand for compliance with the Institutional Review Boards at research universities
                     and centers that provide a utilitarian baseline for the treatment and protection of
                     human subjects in research projects. The IRB ethics compliance framework is derived
                     from broader moral and legal discussions about the uses and abuses of human subjects.
                     Compliant ethics also serve to mitigate risk and liability to the institution. Ethics
                     as contemplation, Proferes argues, is an “ongoing practice of inwards reflection about
                     our own actions and about what is right and just” and to identify a plurality of values
                     in order to promote respect for persons, justice, and beneficence (2020, pp. 416-18,

                  <div class="ptext" id="p15">Precisely because digital humanities provide for the possibilities of widely sharing
                     data, they also raise a host of ethical issues that emerge from wider accessibility.
                     Proferes identifies three specific areas where ethical considerations are paramount
                     in digital humanities: data collection, data use, and data sharing. Data collection
                     involves privacy issues; data use involves interrogating the intentions of the creators
                     of the data as well as reflections on its fair use;  data sharing involves reflecting
                     on the original intent of the actors involved by means of sharing output with the
                     impacted individuals and communities and assessing whether sharing may cause harm
                     to those communities. Digital tools that promote wider sharing thus have their own
                     embedded “values,” which also need to be interrogated. Proferes calls for an “expanded
                     practice of moral contemplation in relationship to digital humanities projects” in
                     order to identify and confront these embedded “morally opaque practices” that surround
                     the values of sharing versus the potential to harm (2020, pp. 420-26). </div>

                  <div class="ptext" id="p16">Particularly when dealing with vulnerable groups and communities, the potential for
                     harm must be central to ethical considerations. Vulnerability is not necessarily fixed
                     or static, but changes over time. We have to understand vulnerability on two levels:
                     the first is the designation of being a vulnerable group; and the second is when individuals
                     feel vulnerable. Even for individuals within vulnerable groups, their experiences
                     of vulnerability may wax or wane depending on their changing relationships to inequality
                     and power (Shaw et al 2020, p. 279). In our collection of essays, Kelly Duke Bryant
                     raises the special situation of unaccompanied minors in colonial Senegal, many of
                     whom were likely trafficked. Duke Bryant argues persuasively that this group merits
                     special protections precisely because they were most vulnerable (see also Moitt 2024).
                     Matthew Hopper, in his essay, focuses on another group of vulnerable people:  those
                     who were forcibly liberated from slave ships in the Indian Ocean by European antislave
                     trade squadrons. Hopper argues that these liberated Africans did not give their consent
                     voluntarily to being liberated, although we can assume that many did not fully understand
                     that their “liberation” often meant entering into long periods of indenture or apprenticeship
                     (see also Anderson and Lovejoy 2020).</div>

                     consent and confidentiality. In research with living subject, informed consent certainly
                     mitigates potential harm; it would be naïve to assume that subjects giving informed
                     consent do so in situations not marked by significant power imbalances (White, Miescher,
                     and Cohen 2001). Some informants, however, feel empowered by being included in research
                     projects. The compliant ethical commitment to confidentiality thus also needs to be
                     interrogated. Katja Guenther argues that one of the basic principles in the social
                     sciences is protecting individuals through the use of pseudonyms, which Guenther refers
                     to as the “politics of naming.”  Far from feeling protected by confidentiality, the
                     vulnerable and marginal group of activist women in a male-dominated society, who were
                     Guenther's research subjects, “wanted to be heard…. Yet by guaranteeing their confidentiality,
                     I was in effect denying my respondents the right to be heard; in renaming them through
                     the use of pseudonyms, I was denying them the basic right to be who they are. Equally
                     problematic, I was silencing their challenges of systems of oppression and injustice”
                     (2009, pp. 411, 414). In a contemplative section of her essay, Guenther reflected
                     that her interest in protecting her subjects from a range of harms that they could
                     not possibly imagine was a “patronizing concern.”  Guenther concludes that scholars
                     need to better recognize the complexities of the politics of naming and question the
                     general assumption that confidentiality is always the best practice (2009, pp. 414,
                     420). Shaw et al underscore the risks of doing no harm. </div>

                     is a universal feature of the human condition, we think that ethical, emotional and
                     psychological risk is a normal part of doing research with human participants, who

                     the issue of naming or anonymity contextually. Empowering participants would also
                     challenge notions of what constitutes vulnerability and protecting the vulnerable
                     means. In invoking the do no harm principle as a paternalistic notion of protection,
                     Niamh Moore focuses on the harm actually done. “For much of history anonymity did
                     not protect the vulnerable, but excluded women and others from authorship and ownership
                     of their own words, erasing them from the archive, even from history, and in the process
                     creating vulnerability through rending people nameless.” Particularly in regard to
                     the potentialities of re-using data so crucial to digital humanities, Moore notes
                     that one of the consequences of anonymization in the presentation of primary data
                     is abstraction of the data that have lost their situatedness or context (2012, pp.
                     332, 336). It falls to the researcher to take seriously the intentions of the actors
                     in historical primary sources and those of human subjects in ongoing research.</div>

                  <div class="ptext" id="p20">The issue of naming names in vulnerable and marginal groups has significant political
                     as well as ethical ramifications. To ensure confidentiality and to disguise or change
                     the settings or context may protect vulnerable people from potential harm, but it
                     also leaves intact systems of inequality and oppression. In his research on the discrimination
                     racial minorities face in higher education, Benjamin Baez notes that “the failure
                     to disclose important information may have perpetuated the kinds of experiences racial
                     minorities ‘keep having again and again.'” Baez likens confidentiality to secrets;
                     both imply concealment. “[A]s with all secrets, there were negative consequences.
                     In failing to expose racism and sexism at the institution, I contributed to the many
                     ways in which the institution and their colleagues harmed the very ‘persons' I sought
                     to protect.” In his call for making research socially transformative, “transformative
                     research, if it is possible, must expose and resist oppression, which is often hidden.
                     To do so, it requires openness and risk-taking” (2002, pp. 41, 46). By adhering to
                     compliant ethical standards of doing no harm — essentially by keeping secrets — researchers
                     may actually be complicit in maintaining systems of oppression, which entail their
                     own “constitutive vulnerability” for vulnerable and marginal groups (Bok 1989).</div>

                  <div class="ptext" id="p21">Doing no harm is clearly neither easy nor ethical in all situations. Several of our
                     contributors in this special issue disagree about the way forward in regard to naming
                     names of enslaved people in Senegal and Mali. On the one hand Duke Bryant argues that
                     enslaved and trafficked minors need extra protection, but Duke Bryant also argues
                     that scholars should be respectful of the prevailing ethos in which raising issues
                     about enslaved status or descent may cause harm. In their roles as scholars of education
                     and pedagogy in Senegal, Mamadou Yéro Baldé,  Djibrirou Daouda Ba, and Ismaïla Mbodji
                     seek a middle ground in designing curriculum for middle school students between the
                     requirements of Senegalese national standards to train students in critical research,
                     historical skills, and digital literacy that focus on the country's past and the “conservative”
                     nature of Senegalese society that encourages social stability. Encouraging social
                     stability may, however, result in concealing social inequalities. In response to calls
                     from marginal and subaltern groups to be included in the continent's history, Ibrahima
                     Thioub, the recently retired rector of the Cheikh Anta Diop University in Senegal
                     and a leading Senegalese historian, has called for the recognition of a new public
                     space in Senegal and throughout Africa. In particular, Thioub sees these emerging
                     public spaces as opportunities to “break the silence surrounding slavery [in Africa]
                     and put on the defensive those in power and those groups who defend the status quo”
                     (2021, p. 20). In their contribution to this collection, Marie Rodet and Mamadou Cisse
                     explore in part how descendants of enslaved people in Mali have been mobilizing politically
                     to tell their history, to claim their dignity, and to assert their freedom (see also
                     Hahonou and Pelckmans 2011). Roberts and Wall, in their essay in this collection,
                     recognize the potential harm that naming names of enslaved people may have on their
                     descendants but argue that those enslaved people who actively sought their freedom
                     in Senegal wanted formal certificates of liberty in their names and to be inscribed
                     in a register of liberations. They conclude that naming the names of these people
                     honors their actions and contributes to a more complex interpretation of French West
                     African history.  </div>

                  <div class="ptext" id="p22">Enslavement and the slave trade, as we have argued, were predicated upon the violence
                     of rupture. Enslavement ruptured a person's connections to family, kin, and community,
                     and almost always involved the brutal transfer of the enslaved person far from home
                     and homeland. On top of the physical violence of capture, owners subjected their newly
                     acquired slaves to the symbolic violence of renaming. Renaming the newly acquired
                     person was a central part of asserting domination. Renaming also served to erase the
                     previous identity of the enslaved person. Such erasure was not always absolute, and
                     retentions of previous identities often persisted despite efforts to impose domination
                     through naming. This was certainly the case in the classic slave narrative, discussed
                     by  Paul E. Lovejoy in this collection, in which Equiano recounts how one of his owners
                     gave him the name Gustavus Vassa. Equiano used both names — Olaudah Equiano or Gustavus
                     Vassa — as the author of his <span class="hi italic">The Interesting Narrative of the Life of Olaudah Equiano, Or Gustavus Vassa, The African</span>, first published in 1789. The use of both names stimulated a lively debate regarding
                     the author's birth, his identity, and the authenticity of the narrative (Carretta
                     2005; P. Lovejoy 2006). This debate led to a reassessment of the fixedness of names
                     and identities in the Atlantic world during the early modern period. Drawing from
                     his study of Domingues Alvares, James Sweet argues that “the Atlantic represented
                     a series of social deaths and rebirths, a repeating circuit of dislocation and dismemberment,
                     marked by an unceasing desire to reconstitute the self through family, friends, and
                     community. His was a history without end, quite literally a feedback loop of subjection
                     and social subjectivities” (2009, p. 304). Far from being fixed and indelible, identities
                     and names were “overlapping, shifting, and situational….” (2009, p. 298). </div>

                  <div class="ptext" id="p23">Naming and renaming are about power even where the power of owners was incomplete.
                     In her study of enslaved people in central Mali, Lotte Pelckmans notes that renaming
                     by owners “consisted of the imposition of a completely new, often degrading identity”
                     (2017, p. 257-58). In the southern United States, owners regularly renamed their acquired
                     people, but almost always by first names only. In a study of the largest same day
                     slave auction in South Carolina in mid-March 1835, the enslaved people up sale included
                     named only Humphrey, Hannah, Celia, Charles, Esther, Daniel Dorcas, Dye, London, Friday,
                     Jacob, Daphne, Cuffee, Carolina, Peggy, and Violet (Hawes 2023). These names were
                     likely only temporary ones. As enslaved people were bought and sold, they were often
                     subject to multiple renamings by their owners as acts of power and possession. Naming
                     and renaming were thus part of the sequence of trauma that slavery imposed on people.</div>

                  <div class="ptext" id="p24">But the power to name does not always reside in the owner. We think that it is important
                     to differentiate between who was renaming whom and under what conditions. Owners renamed
                     their acquired people to claim ownership and to erase their genealogy. Enslaved people,
                     however, were not powerless in this process. Many, no doubt, retained their names
                     and their genealogies despite what owners did and such retentions became sites of
                     struggle and resistance. Others used aliases as Kelly Duke Bryant in this collection
                     argues. Especially for enslaved people and their descendants, changing their names
                     was central to a broad “repertoire of social possibilities” according to Gregory Mann's
                     analysis of names and name changing in colonial French West Africa (2002, pp. 309-12).
                     Lotte Pelckmans refers to enslaved people's acts of changing names in Mali as providing
                     “passports” for social mobility (2017, pp. 257-58).</div>

                  <div class="ptext" id="p25">Changing names was not without consequences. In many parts of the world, social knowledge
                     resides in names. Surnames or patronyms are charters for social identity that link
                     individuals to communities and communities to history. While in West Africa many newly
                     enslaved people kept their patronyms, which served as markers of enslaved status in
                     their owners' communities, children of enslaved people often carried the patronym
                     of their owner, whether he was the father of the enslaved mother's children or not.
                     In West Africa, enslaved males lacked rights of paternity, enslaved female also lacked
                     “legal husbands,” and children born to enslaved women always belonged to their owners
                     (Pelckmans 2017, p. 262; Klein 1989, p. 213; Mann 2002). Carrying the patronyms of
                     their owners did not mean that enslaved children born in their owners' communities
                     were fully integrated into their owner's community. As Martin Klein writes “Slaves
                     are often reluctant to talk about their origins if they know them at all. This means
                     that any family the slave has is the master's family and any history is the master's
                     history” (Klein 2005, p. 838). Reflecting on Klein's argument twenty-five years later,
                     Marie Rodet argues that if “slaves and their descendants preferred in some instances
                     to forget their traumatic past,” it was because “colonial and local ideologies at
                     the time of abolition prevented the stigma of slavery from disappearing” (2013, p.
                     28). Even if the descendants of enslaved ancestors may have preferred to forget their
                     histories, many still retained vivid oral histories and memories. Rodet challenges
                     scholars to learn how to listen better to their informants and to learn how to ask
                     better questions that would elicit these memories. Similarly, Roberts and Wall argue
                     in this collection that place matters in how persistent the stigma of former enslaved
                     identity is: moving away from the community of former owners' risks subsistence security
                     but provides for social mobility.   </div>

                  <div class="ptext" id="p26">As James Sweet argues, in a world where identities were fluid, name changing was political
                     and personal (2009). The world of fluid identities was, however, gradually narrowed
                     through the expansion and consolidation of nation states interested in the “conquest
                     of illegibility.”  James Scott and his colleagues examine this in their exploration
                     of the invention of fixed names, which was a modern invention designed to suppress
                     the “utter fluidity of vernacular naming practices” (Scott, Tehranian, and Mathias
                     2022, p. 6). Emerging in the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries, the use of surnames
                     surrounded efforts to clarify grants of land and for noble families to protect their
                     properties. Surnames also helped to register baptisms and payments of poll taxes.
                     Precise names were also essential to inheritance, especially inheritance of large
                     estates and property, and to massive military conscription (Forrest 1989, chapter
                     2; Scott, Tehranian, and Mathias 2022, p. 11, 15). Entering such information into
                     written registers emerged coincidentally with the consolidation of state power (see
                     for example Scott 1998; Delsalle 2018). 	</div>

                  <div class="ptext" id="p27">During and after the Napoleonic Wars, the British aggressively pursued treaties with
                     European powers to suppress the maritime slave trade first in the Atlantic and then
                     in the Indian Ocean. Under these treaties, British Vice-Admiralty courts and by the
                     Mixed Commissions established by treaties to support the suppression of the maritime
                     slave trades. Mixed or so-called joint commissions sat in Freetown, Luanda, Cape Town,
                     Boa Vista in the Cabo Verde Islands, Havana, Rio de Janeiro, Surinam, Spanish Town,
                     New York, and Saint Helena and their tasks were to adjudicate the capture of the slave
                     ship, to liberate the enslaved people, and to disperse the prize money to the captain
                     and its crew of the ship that captured the slave ship (Bethel 1966;  Martinez 2012;
                     Anderson and H. Lovejoy 2020; Misevich 2019;  P. Lovejoy and Schwarz 2015;  Pearson
                     2016;  H. Lovejoy and Anderson 2020). For the first time in over three centuries,
                     registers of enslaved Africans containing names as well as individual demographic
                     information were more or less systematically maintained. To date, the most sustained
                     research on registers of liberation of enslaved people from Africa have focused on
                     those produced by these courts and commissions, which operated between 1808 and 1871
                     and presided over nearly 600 cases (Misevich 2019, p. 248).<a class="noteRef" href="#d4e546">[2]</a>  According to Henry Lovejoy's compilation of evidence on liberated Africans, we can
                     estimate that nearly 200,000 were liberated by Vice-Admiralty courts and the Mixed
                     Commissions. In addition, Lovejoy's network of ongoing research projects suggests
                     that scholars may have access to records regarding 700,000 liberated Africans (<a href="https://liberatedafricans.org/about/essays.php?id=1" onclick="window.open('https://liberatedafricans.org/about/essays.php?id=1'); return false" class="ref">Liberated Africans</a>).  The courts and commissions kept records of individual liberated Africans because
                     most of them were “freed” into various forms of indenture, military service, guardianship,
                     or resettlement depending upon gender, age, and perceived health. In Sierra Leone,
                     the courts and commissions liberated 99,752 Africans. Nearly 72% of those liberated

                     Indian Ocean, as Matthew Hopper describes, the registers of liberated Africans were
                     modeled on registers of indenture and served equally as forms of surveillance because
                     of the individually identifying information collected for each enslaved African liberated.
                     By collecting biometric evidence including scarification, these registers provided
                     a useful tool in cases when liberated Africans absconded from their indenture contracts.
                     As such, they became according to Kelly Duke Bryant, points of contact between the
                     state and individuals.  </div>

                  <div class="ptext" id="p29">Central to the process of creating legibility and identity, these registers included
                     names of the enslaved people. With the exception of Muslim societies and Abyssinia,
                     most African societies during this period had tonal languages and did not utilize
                     writing. Thus, the very act of rendering an African's phonetic name into a written
                     form was an act of transformation. In the case of the registers of Liberated Africans
                     in Sierra Leone and Havana, literate clerks most of whom were European relied on African
                     interpreters to helps transcribe African tonal names into the registers. In his study
                     of the Havana registers of Liberated Africans, Henry Lovejoy argues that what names
                     clerks entered into the registers reflected the tonal structures of their own native
                     languages (2010, pp. 107-35). In her study in this collection, Rachel Petrocelli argues
                     that this process yielded significant variety in spelling of even common names. </div>

                     people is listening to what they tell us. In reflecting on decades of research on
                     slavery in French West Africa, Martin Klein notes that “Perhaps the most striking
                     conclusion from these interviews is that in these societies those of slave descent
                     do not like to recognize their slave origins even where the person's origins are well-known.
                     This contrasts to the Afro-America quest for ‘roots'” (1989, p. 211). In West African
                     societies where slavery was not racially based, but based on status, the persistent
                     discrimination that those of slave descent faced was based on that sigma of their
                     ancestors' enslavement. With the end of slavery, enslaved people the world over struggled
                     against former owners for more autonomy, for the means to secure and protect their
                     families, and for the rights to work for themselves. Where former owners controlled
                     the state and legal access to land and where slave-owning elites continued to shape
                     social and political ideologies, the social mobility of recently freed people was
                     sharply constrained. Even in West Africa, where slave-owning elites did not control
                     the colonial state, political ideologies and fears of social upheaval helped to sustain
                     existing social hierarchies, social mobility of the recently freed was also limited.
                     In many cases, the stigma of enslaved status persisted sometimes for generations,
                     becoming as Benedetta Rossi notes a “public secret” encouraging ongoing subservient
                     practices of descendants of enslaved people and descendants of former owners (2009,
                     p. 10). Such conservative political ideologies persist to this day in many West African
                     societies and especially in rural areas. Mamadou Yéro Baldé, Djibrirou Daouda Ba,
                     and Ismaïla Mbodji stress this issue in their discussion about how the conservative
                     elements within Senegalese society set limits on the potential of new public-school
                     curriculum regarding the history of slavery and the slave trade in Senegal to address
                     issues of social inequality.   </div>

                  <div class="ptext" id="p31">The very nature of maintaining the public secret of a person's enslaved past has harmful
                     consequences not only to those suffering from the stigma of an enslaved past, but
                     also the host society perpetuating these secrets. In her classic study of secrets,
                     the philosopher Sissela Bok noted “Long-term group practices of secrecy … are especially
                     likely to breed corruption and to spread…. When power is joined to secrecy, therefore,
                     and when the practices are of long duration, the danger of spread and abuse and deterioration
                     increases. (1989, p. 110). Long-term secrecy is also linked to self-deception. “[I]it
                     is secrecy,” Bok writes, “that lies at the center of such self-deception…. In deceiving
                     ourselves… we keep secret from ourselves the truth we cannot face” (1989, p. 60).
                     The public secrets of enslaved pasts thus are complicit with perpetuating inequalities
                     and discrimination that continue to harm all of society.  </div>

                     slavery by charting new paths in data preservation and data sharing, they must also
                     confront the political and ethical challenges involved.. Throughout the Atlantic and
                     Indian Ocean worlds, archives detailing the lives of people of color have been neglected.
                     This is in part because many such archives exist in parts of the world that struggle
                     to fund them, and it is in part because nowhere have archives been immune to the institutional
                     racism that permeates the societies that created and maintain them (National Archives
                     and Records Administration 2021). As a result of underfunding and neglect, much primary
                     source material about the lives of enslaved people has been lost and much that survives
                     is uncatalogued and decaying. Digital social historians have often preserved primary
                     source materials by digitizing them and making the images available on the internet
                     with accompanying datasets, which can serve as a finding aid to facilitate the identification
                     of individuals listed in the documentation (see especially <a href="https://www.slavesocieties.info/" onclick="window.open('https://www.slavesocieties.info/'); return false" class="ref">Slave Societies Digital Archive</a>). The preservation and dissemination of data helps the community of scholars write
                     social history today and could be foundational for the writing of social history for
                     generations to come. </div>

                     historians implement data stewardship plans. In other words, creating datasets with
                     information about named enslaved individuals and posting that information online accomplishes
                     the historian's goals of data preservation and access if and only if websites are
                     designed with an understanding of the questions users might ask of the data housed
                     on them and are properly backed up and kept current so that data is not lost and remains
                     findable. Historians can be reasonably sure that their published print scholarship
                     will be maintained in libraries for generations to come. But do they have commitments
                     from their institutions to maintain their digital scholarship into the future? Put
                     another way, if we have a professional obligation to preserve endangered data about
                     the lives of our subjects, are we taking steps to ensure that preservation continues
                     after we are gone? Contrary to the cliché, “the internet is forever,” in practice
                     digital resources require continual maintenance, human effort, and financial resources.

                     broader goals of digital

                     delves into the trajectory of liberated enslaved people who transitioned into indentured
                     servants in the 
                     Indian Ocean. Hopper leverages an extensive dataset encompassing details like 
                     children's names, parents' names, age, height, scarification, and even photographs.
                     Given the distinctly 
                     identifiable biometric quality of the data, combined with persistent stigma attached
                     to having enslaved 
                     ancestors in many parts of the Indian Ocean, Hopper considers aligning the ethical 
                     responsibilities of historians with the considerations associated with biometric data
                     employed by 
                     geneticists. In doing so, he draws on an intriguing project pursued by ethically minded

                     regarding the 
                     anonymization or naming of their enslaved ancestors and that living close to former
                     enslavers impacts this 
                     preference. They argue that ethical considerations, while very real, should not deter
                     research, but the 
                     preferences of the original enslaved or freed person should be paramount if they are
                     discoverable. For the 
                     registers of liberation that they work with, Roberts and Wall conclude that because 
                     the enslaved people identified in the registers actively sought their freedom by presenting
                     themselves before 
                     French colonial officials and receiving certificates of liberty in their names, they
                     wanted themselves so 
                     recognized. To complicate matters, however, many enslaved people sought their liberation
                     together with minor 
                     children, who could not give their consent.
