                  <div class="ptext" id="p1">In an interview with <cite class="title italic">Harper’s Bazaar</cite>, Issa Rae, the
                     creator of the web series <cite class="title italic">The Misadventures of Awkward Black
                        Girl </cite> and the television show <cite class="title italic">Insecure </cite> said:
                     “So much of Issa's [the character on the show] journey has
                     been about denying who she is, not being honest about her feelings, and just
                     really being obviously insecure about so much of her life. So, a happy ending to
                     me would just be Issa feeling happy and satisfied to give her <em class="emph">whole self to
                        the world.</em>”
                     [<a class="ref" href="#betancourt2020">Betancourt 2020</a>]. Rae’s retrospective and foreshadowing pontification
                     about the upcoming fifth and final season of her hit series, <cite class="title italic">Insecure</cite>, exemplifies the journey fans found themselves on alongside Rae
                     and in community with each other on social media platforms. <cite class="title italic">Insecure</cite>, created by Issa Rae for HBO in 2016, is a comedy/comedy-drama
                     that chronicles a thirty-year-old, Black heterosexual woman who, at beginning of the
                     series, is dissatisfied with her career and love life. The show explores dating,
                     family, friendship, sex, career issues, and race through “Issa Dee” as a
                     character, which borrowed Rae’s first name as the protagonists’ name, and her best
                     friend Molly’s relationship. <cite class="title italic">Insecure</cite> is loosely based
                     on one of Rae’s earliest YouTube produced web series, <cite class="title italic">The
                        Misadventures of Awkward Black Girl</cite>, that premiered in 2011. <cite class="title italic">The Misadventures of Awkward Black Girl</cite> — also referenced in
                     this article as <cite class="title italic">Awkward Black Girl</cite> or <cite class="title italic">ABG</cite> — features Issa acting as the character “J” with a
                     similar premise. The protagonist “J” chronicles her career, friendships, and
                     romantic life under the comedic guise of being awkward. Her awkwardness propels the
                     comedy’s conflict and character development much like Issa’s insecurities does for

                     the creator’s intention, and the digital fandom expressed on social media. Following
                     in the footsteps of televisions shows from the 1990s and early 2000s, such as <cite class="title italic">Living Single</cite> and <cite class="title italic">Girlfriends</cite>,

                     relationships. Rae’s foray into producing the web series on her own on YouTube and
                     her usage of fan engagement to continue producing and prop up its popularity that
                     eventually turned into the iteration of <cite class="title italic">Insecure</cite> on HBO

                  <div class="ptext" id="p3">I focus on the intimate relationships characters have with each other and those
                     developed by fans in social media spaces. Black familial and relationship studies
                     emphasize the ways Black Americans forefront their intimate relationships as a
                     foundational tenet and an affective motivating factor to continue to fight oppressive
                     systems. Scholars of a journal special issue on Black Love state “…what sustained black Americans was love — communal, familial, and
                     carnal…”
                     [<a class="ref" href="#jelks2019">Jelks and Hardison 2019</a>]. Amidst all the turmoil and triumphs, relationships have
                     sustained Black communities. Combined with Black feminisms, my research develops the
                     affective mode to interrogate how Black communities have sustained themselves.
                     Specifically, Black feminism grounds my affective theoretical approach through
                     womanism’s assertion of love as a central tenet. Womanism’s definition of love is
                     “a woman who loves other women, sexually and/or nonsexually.
                     Sometimes loves individual men, sexually and/or nonsexually. Committed to survival
                     and wholeness of entire people, male and female”
                     [<a class="ref" href="#walker1983">Walker 1983</a>]. The emphasis on community, love, and sexuality within
                     womanism’s description attends to how I am examining Black affect through intimacy
                     and how Black communities have deep roots in love for self, others, and the community
                     that continues in online spaces. It is the pursuit of wholeness as praxis — as
                     sustaining and eventually thriving in Black communities’ personal lives. I assert
                     that one way to trace this pursuit is in the active discussions about fandom. Fans
                     have a specific understanding and relationship to their objects that center romantic,
                     communal, and familial storylines. Rather than speculate and theorize about these
                     processes through only examining the cultural productions themselves, we can turn
                     to
                     the words of fans as well as their reflections on the characters and their own lives
                     as evidence of the affective struggles and triumphs in Black interpersonal
                     relationships.</div>

                  <div class="ptext" id="p4">Fandom studies is the lens by which Black feminisms and digital studies combine in
                     my
                     research. Fandom scholars have traditionally centered the affective and intimate
                     through demonstrating fandom as inherently participatory. The two definitions of
                     fandom, affirmative and transformative, are central to how I am conceptualizing
                     digital participation and fandom engagement as well as how the cultural productions
                     are informing how their fans are analyzing their interpersonal lives. Affirmative
                     fandom is that fans like, or affirm, the productions they center their fandom on.
                     Transformative is defined as taking the interest and creating a new work inspired
                     by
                     the fandom. Fandom scholars, especially fandom scholars of color, have evolved and
                     taken up this question in various ways, and I intervene through combining both
                     definitions into an amalgamation that states that Black fans demonstrate affirmative
                     transformative fandom in digital spaces. Further, fans shared their insights about
                     the characters and storylines and the overlap with their own lives through witnessing
                     the pain, joy, growth, setbacks, stagnation, and transitions explored in both shows
                     through character arcs and narrative choices. Rae’s usage of the YouTube as a new
                     media platform fueled by fan engagement spurred the popularity of the television
                     series where the characters showcased their whole selves, and fans responded
                     enthusiastically on social media to Rae’s creation of complicated characters that
                     struggle with their inner worlds and how it affects their relationships. Centering
                     the community that Black digital fandom spaces create, I engage Black studies,
                     digital humanities, and fan studies to examine connections fans make to Rae’s media
                     output and their own interiority and intimate lives amongst each other using the
                     comments on YouTube and hashtags on Twitter.</div>

                  <div class="ptext" id="p5">This article is driven by several interlocking questions: What does the digital
                     fandom of the <cite class="title italic">Misadventures of Awkward Black Girl</cite> and
                     <cite class="title italic">Insecure</cite> reveal, complicate, and demonstrate about
                     romance, friendship, and community? Further, how does the representation of these
                     stories effect their fans interior lives? How does the expression of their interior
                     lives on social media build community and challenge notions of hegemonic intimacy
                     that is both expressed in the interpersonal sense and in online spaces? I posit that
                     by examining interpersonal intimacy and interiority in cultural productions and
                     digital fandoms, we see the demonstration of the pursuit of love, wholeness, and
                     intimacy as labor that sustaining acts for and by Black communities. Within the
                     quotidian acts of social media usage and the small moments of reflection they
                     provoke, Black fans pursue much needed forms of rest and respite in these public
                     communities and find ways to self-make to imagine a different world within their own
                     relationships and interrogating processes taken to heal from generational trauma,
                     patterns, and actions. Black fans contend with their familial and romantic lives
                     through the expression and labor for themselves of simultaneous affective and
                     transformative fandom in collective digital spaces. I examine how these interactions
                     serve two capacities. First, they do the meaningful and important work of recovery
                     and healing for Black fandom communities to examine how hegemonic narratives about
                     the intimacies of friendship, family, and romantic relationships are reinscribed
                     through popular media and are challenged in the storylines and expressive digital
                     fandom. Secondly, pleasure and play in fandom communities continues to foster
                     personhood, worldmaking, and reimagining for Black people in the face of the
                     dehumanizing power structures that they navigate daily.</div>

                  <div class="ptext" id="p6">Intimate partnerships are an extension of where we encounter and negotiate our
                     interior selves and how they are expressed outwardly. Thus, our digital selves are
                     an
                     extension of these intimate negotiations and are a site to examine how our hegemonic
                     ideals about our interpersonal relationships are reinscribed, challenged, and
                     co-created with others in a public domain. Affect and queer theorist Lauren Berlant’s
                     theoretical framing of intimacy as an intersection of interpersonal relationships
                     that reverberate publicly situates my framework on Black relationships, the digital,
                     and fandom. Berlant’s definition of intimacy is “an aspiration
                     for a narrative about something shared” and that “the
                     inwardness of the intimate is met by a corresponding publicness”
                     [<a class="ref" href="#berlant1998">Berlant 1998</a>]. Berlant’s assertion is that institutions that were
                     supposed to teach us “democratic publicness” — a la
                     Habermas — evolved and were fostered into “collective experience
                     (s)” like cinema and other entertainment forms where there is “the desire for entertainment taken for pleasure”
                     [<a class="ref" href="#berlant1998">Berlant 1998</a>]. Yet intimacy also operates outside of these
                     institutional realms in everyday mundane practices — such as my argument of logging
                     into social media — that reproduce, challenge, and produce the stories that hegemonic
                     ideals encourage us to follow concerning our intimate lives. As Berlant asserts we
                     impact each other in these public ways and thus, I theorize that it also effects our
                     intimate lives directly: both interpersonally and with each other in public in online
                     networks.</div>

                  <div class="ptext" id="p7">Further, utilizing Berlant’s “inwardness”, I turn to
                     definitions from Black studies and Black feminist scholars of interiority to assist
                     in forming my critical intervention about Black digital fandom practices. As <cite class="title italic">Awkward Black Girl</cite> and <cite class="title italic">Insecure</cite>
                     center a Black female protagonist, I utilize Joan Morgan’s “politics of pleasure” that is invested in “<em class="emph">black
                        female interiority</em>” as it is exemplified in the storylines and
                     their fandoms [<a class="ref" href="#morgan2015">Morgan 2015</a>]. Morgan frames pleasure in analyzing
                     cultural texts through different interventions such as the advent of social media
                     and
                     digital discourse for the possibilities of expressing interiority. Morgan’s
                     definition of interiority is “to excavate the broad range of
                     feelings, desires, hearing, (erotic and otherwise) that were once deemed
                     necessarily private by the ‘politics of silence’”
                     [<a class="ref" href="#morgan2015">Morgan 2015</a>]. Morgan grounds her argument in Black feminist Evelynn
                     Hammonds’ “politics of articulation” rather than the

                     denial of their exchange value does not negate their existence. How does one value

                     on Black lived experience online. Especially, because “another

                     [<a class="ref" href="#brock2020">Brock 2020</a>]. Black digital fandom is a meaning making strategy because
                     it is also libidinal as it “offers a release from considerations

                     digital practice is then inherently intimate. Black digital practices that are fandom
                     based is entertainment taken for pleasure and thus “pleasure-knowledge creates problems for the notional rationality with which

                     production and engagement: the affirmative and transformative. In the introduction

                     the <cite class="title italic">Fan Studies Reader</cite>, Karen Hellekson and Kristina
                     Busse offer a definition of the difference between affirmative fandom and
                     transformative fandom. They explain, “affirmative fans tend to
                     collect, view, and play, to discuss, analyze, and critique. Transformative fans,
                     however, take a creative step to make the worlds and characters their own, be it
                     by telling stories, cosplaying the characters, creating artworks, or engaging in
                     any of the many other forms active fan participation can take ”
                     [<a class="ref" href="#busse2014">Busse and Hellekson 2014</a>]. Hellekson and Busse emphasize that many academics focus
                     on the transformative creations of fandom as they are new creations and sites for
                     identity formation. I argue that Black fans demonstrate an amalgamation of both
                     affirmative and transformative fandom as defined by the field to morph and become
                     <em class="emph">affirmative transformative</em> works of fandom expression. It is
                     affirmative through casual engagement with fellow fans — or those that dislike the
                     cultural productions or antifans — and content creators while also being
                     transformative through the creativity of Black social media users and their
                     identification with fandom objects. Black digital fandom reflects both. I argue for
                     a
                     simultaneous configuration of both because the ways representation, identity, and
                     function operate for Black fans. Further, the communal aspects of fandom expressed
                     comprise Black digital intimacies where affective interiority and transformative
                     ideals through world making and affirming are enacted. Black fans affirm the cultural
                     productions because of the representation they demonstrate but also transform them
                     into something else through creative usage of hashtags, podcasts, and other modes
                     of
                     creative fandom. This also works interpersonally as the feel affirmed through the
                     representations they see and express personal transformation as they encounter what
                     they are seeing on screen and how it reflects interpersonally in their romantic,

The amalgamation demonstrates the ways Black
                     fans digitally practice fandom in ways outside of the intended or widely adapted
                     usage. Black fandom practice at times connotes a different relationship to fandom
                     for
                     several reasons. This is in part due to a dearth of representation and/or at times
                     harmful stereotypical depictions of Black people in media. Fandoms of the <cite class="title italic">Misadventures of Awkward Black Girl</cite> and <cite class="title italic">Insecure</cite> are case studies for Black digital intimacies and affective
                     transformative fandoms because of the dearth of Black representation at the time of
                     their debut and the ways the show continued the comedic traditions of the Black shows

                     Black digital intimacies work through centering fandom. To support my analysis of
                     Black fandom fully, I preface Black feminist thought, Black digital studies, and
                     queer analysis of intimacy. Berlant centers marginalized identities that have had
                     to
                     create new ways of being intimate by emphasizing that they have, and we must “rethink intimacy” and to do so is “to
                     appraise how we have been and how we live and how we might imagine lives that make
                     more sense than the ones so many are living”[<a class="ref" href="#berlant1998">Berlant 1998</a>].
                     Or as Stuart Hall asserts that Black popular culture is where “we
                     discover and play with the identifications of ourselves, where we are imagined,
                     where we are represented, not only to the audiences out there who do not get the

                     the breadth of thoughts Black Twitter encapsulates due to their networks that produce
                     high engagement. The users who have public tweets with a higher follower count expect
                     to have a larger audience with their tweets circulating more heavily, especially with
                     the usage of hashtags related to the popular cultural productions I am examining.

                     Black digital fan expression of affirming and identifying with this iteration of
                     “awkwardness” and then “insecure” interiority connote affirmative
                     transformative fandoms through Black digital intimacies on social media platforms.
                     Some examples of the interiority expressed in the shows include the main character
                     “J” narrating parts of the show, or Issa — the character on <cite class="title italic">Insecure</cite> — talking to herself in the mirror and her mirrored
                     self, talking back to her. <cite class="title italic">Insecure</cite> also includes many
                     daydream flashbacks as aesthetic and to aid plot development for the 30-minute
                     comedy. Fans responded to this expression of interiority with their own thus creating
                     intimate digital spaces through affirmative transformative fandom expression. </div>

                     exploration of sexuality focuses on the plot’s themes and construction of the web

                  <div class="ptext" id="p18">Additionally, Rae took advantage of YouTube’s new media promise through their slogan
                     “Broadcast Yourself” through passing some of the
                     constraints and challenges that come from pursuing a greenlight from traditional
                     media may have posed. Aymar Jean Christian’s book <cite class="title italic">Open TV:
                        Innovation Beyond Hollywood and the Rise of Web Television</cite> examines the
                     ways in which web series become sites where producers and content creators can
                     connect directly due to the digital nature of the comment section [<a class="ref" href="#christian2018">Christian 2018</a>]. Christian’s argument is that web series allow for Black
                     creators, who have been marginalized from the process of producing shows on
                     mainstream television, to produce original content without the “single-story/cookie-cutter” narrative mainstream producers perpetuate. By
                     examining the digital ways fans interact and reflect on their fandom object,
                     specifically focusing on the interiority expressed, I trace how digital community
                     intimacy is built and how fans reflect interact with their fandom objects. YouTube
                     prefaces audio-visual consumption due to its platform affordances and the commentary
                     and interaction happens after an episode airs unless it is a live streaming event
                     as
                     opposed to Twitter where one can tweet simultaneously. Therefore, comment sections
                     often reflect affirmative fandom which is the fandom that discusses and analyzes [<a class="ref" href="#busse2014">Busse and Hellekson 2014</a>]. Analyzing representation alongside platform affordances,
                     Christian continues, “She (Issa) created an original
                     representation and then experimented with distribution in ways that deviated from
                     and continued a tradition beginning with BET. <cite class="title italic">Awkward Black
                        Girl</cite> proposes to represent its community of fans — primarily but not
                     exclusively black women — in a way unseen on legacy television, and does so
                     convincingly”
                     [<a class="ref" href="#christian2018">Christian 2018</a>]. The web series allowed for Rae to “push the boundaries of normative Black female representation”
                     [<a class="ref" href="#christian2018">Christian 2018</a>]. I argue that mainstream television has seen awkward
                     Black girls in mainstream television before 2011. Characters such as Sinclair from
                     <cite class="title italic">Living Single</cite>, Lynn from <cite class="title italic">Girlfriends</cite>, Kim Parker from <cite class="title italic">Moesha</cite> and
                     <cite class="title italic">The Parkers</cite> can arguably be seen as source references
                     for J’s character. However, to build upon Christian’s point, new media allowed Rae
                     the opportunity to circumvent censorship of legacy media by expressing explicit
                     sexuality, as Cruz analyses [<a class="ref" href="#christian2018">Christian 2018</a>][<a class="ref" href="#cruz2015">Cruz 2015</a>].
                     To reiterate, the awkward mediation adds another layer of interiority and thus
                     identification with fans while YouTube provides a platform for fans to comment.</div>

                     Sign” which was uploaded to YouTube on February 3, 2011, fans readily affirm the show
                     and relate to Issa’s short pilot episode — only 3 minutes and 40 seconds — where she
                     introduces us to her awkward relationships with her coworkers, ex-boyfriend, and
                     ultimately herself. The episode introduces us to J’s world where she states that she
                     is Black and awkward which are “the two worst things anyone can
                     be”” [<a class="ref" href="#rae2011">Rae 2011</a>]. To sum the episode: J pretends to be in a
                     music video when she’s by herself in the car, tries to avoid her co-worker at
                     stop-signs as they both drive in their respective cars to work, shows a montage of
                     her boyfriend breaking up with her, J’s subsequent sleeping with the co-worker she’s
                     trying to avoid because of her heartbreak, and making up rap lyrics disparaging the
                     ex-boyfriend as coping mechanisms. J narrates the episode with rhetorical questions
                     to set up her awkward misadventures. J’s awkwardness and Rae’s scripting drew the
                     audience in and resulted in fans affirming the series through their comments. As
                     representation for a new audience in the landscape of Black media in the early 2010s,
                     women identified with a representation that reflects their interiority and could
                     express it to the creator and others on YouTube. Under the first episode, a
                     commenting fan wrote,

                     These other interior expressions of the fans’ life are both affirmative of the show,

                     platform affordances, but also transformatively understands its impact on the
                     industry, and to a certain extent, other fans through sharing. I also recognize this
                     comment to express affective ownership of the show as they identified so closely and
                     enjoyed the web series, while also wanting it to do well without losing authenticity.
                     Black fans have had a contentious relationship to media forms regarding
                     representation. Alfred L. Martin’s describes the political ways Black fans engage
                     with their fandom objects. The four interlocking discourses Martin introduces are:
                     must-see blackness, economic consumption, pedagogical properties, and understanding
                     the machinations of the culture industries [<a class="ref" href="#martin2019">Martin 2019</a>]. The comment
                     about the show not being censored but desiring it to make a lot of money collapses
                     three of Martin’s assertions: the move to television and the potential economic boost
                     underscores fan understanding the precarity of Black media such that it becomes
                     must-see by knowing that money talks to produce more representations of Black media.
                     The comment also prescribes Martin’s fourth way that Black fans engage through
                     pedagogical properties which are the ways Black fans examine “how
                     fit fan objects are for learning and role modeling” or “what can be learned from a particular fan object” about how to move
                     throughout the world as a Black person [<a class="ref" href="#martin2019">Martin 2019</a>]. Relatedly, to
                     Martin’s exploration of Black fans I assert that the pedagogical properties for Black
                     fans where pleasure and interiority allow them to learn more about their own
                     interpersonal lives through transformative affective fandoms. Simply, what can fans
                     learn about themselves with each other and from these cultural productions to

                     on a woman when heterosexual storylines are depicted. The audience is also privy to
                     how issues in her relationship affected how she also interacted in her career and
                     friendships. <cite class="title italic">Insecure</cite>’s characters are educated
                     30-somethings that run in a tight circle with each other due to romantic,
                     professional, and friendship connections in present day Los Angeles. As viewers, we
                     can explore the main character’s motivations through the long arc of many of the
                     ancillary characters and how they navigate their many insecurities with themselves,
                     their relationships, and their careers.</div>

                  <div class="ptext" id="p23">One evening on Twitter resulted in a flurry of conversation as a major turning point
                     in the plot of <cite class="title italic">Insecure</cite>. The comments happened in
                     response to a conversation between Lawrence, Issa’s ex, and his new romantic
                     interest, Tasha, on the third episode of the second season “Hella
                     Open” where she calls him out on his actions, which inevitably ends their
                     connection. The first season chronicled how Issa and Lawrence’s relationship devolved
                     from what appeared to be Lawrence’s retreat into himself after losing his job and
                     subsequently the loss of intimacy in their relationship. Instead of ending it, Issa
                     cheated, and Lawrence enters a rebounding “friends with benefits” relationship
                     with Tasha who he met at his bank. He told Tasha that he would return to help her
                     with her family’s cookout and doesn’t return from leaving to drink with his new
                     co-workers. Tasha calls out the ways his intentions, both in words and actions, don’t
                     align and is evident when he attempts to apologize for his actions by citing that
                     he
                     wasn’t ready for a serious relationship. She calls out his lack of accountability
                     by
                     stating that he is “a fuck nigga…who is worse than fuck nigga.
                     You a fuck nigga who thinks he’s a good dude.”
                     [<a class="ref" href="#insecure2017">Insecure 2017</a>]. Lawrence’s “good guy” credibility is questioned.
                     I found myself engaging with the dialogue on my timeline as I follow many fans of
                     the

                     the fans and Twitter users that might click on the hashtag. This could be due to not
                     wanting to engage in the dialogue about the show that centers hegemonic
                     representations of relationships as she instead pushes the boundaries of these

                     oration and church culture — and discusses her views about the scene. In a thread
                     with over 30 tweets, she discusses accountability and relationships needing core
                     values as well as for a relationship to change you with the desire to change for the
                     better [<a class="ref" href="#peoplesoracle2017">@peoplesoracle 2017</a>]. She expounds upon relationship requiring
                     skills and that Lawrence’s lack of self-reflection meant that he did not possess
                     those skills by stating: “If being a ‘good guy’ or ‘not
                     one of those chicks’ means that you can get to stay exactly who you are,
                     then you can stay exactly by yourself”
                     [<a class="ref" href="#peoplesoracle2017">@peoplesoracle 2017</a>]. At the end of the thread, she mentions how she

                     [<a class="ref" href="#peoplesoracle2017">@peoplesoracle 2017</a>]. This thread is an example of affirmative

                     about relationships, and refers to her own experience. Her tweets garnered a modest
                     amount of engagement and several people responded with various affirmative memes to
                     her comments about the show and relationships. Her interior life as expressed on
                     Twitter exemplifies Black digital intimacies as others joined in by affirming her
                     comments. It is also transformative as other fans possibly learned something new
                     about themselves building upon Martin’s argument about the pedagogical aspects of
                     Black fandom [<a class="ref" href="#martin2019">Martin 2019</a>]. They could reflect about their own

                     thread on her blog, which is another iteration of Black digital intimacies where she
                     can engage another audience. The thread is an example of self-making and the

                     through mutual friends and situations that keep them in each other’s orbits. They

                     The recaps of the show are another place of intimacy where fans can immerse
                     themselves further as a fan practice to produce self-making. By naming it “<cite class="title italic">Insecuri</cite>tea”, Rae signals that
                     the podcast is a Black fan space to further explore the real world and fictional
                     implications of the show. “Spilling tea” is a Black American queer lexicon of

                     This tweet garnered over 3,300 retweets and over 8,600 likes as it centered the more
                     mature characterization the fans were seeing in the development of the characters.
                     While much of the conflict and drama in the series consisted of the characters acting
                     out of their insecurity, fans anticipated this episode as they saw the reconciliation
                     of the main characters through relationship closure and them ending the show by
                     engaging in sex after their conversation. While retweets and likes do not necessarily
                     signpost agreement, they do demonstrate popularity and engagement with the sentiment
                     and discourse surrounding the show. As a popular podcaster and the official show’s
                     podcaster @crissles is also asserting and advertising her insider positionality to
                     promote the show, the podcast, and continue to create community around both by using
                     the hashtags. While the first tweet about the nature of the show is not affirmative
                     transformative fandom, it does connote Black digital intimacy. Temporally, the show
                     acted as a reprieve from the news cycle for Black Twitter users who “come together as a family” — an oft repeated phrase — for
                     livetweeting Black cultural productions.</div>

                     fosters fan engagement and growth from fans, thus fans can continue to engage with
                     the content beyond the episodes. The podcast is corporately sponsored by HBO;
                     however, the emphasis is on what the episode can do transformatively for audiences
                     in
                     the crisis of the protests and recognizing continuing police brutality. To that end

                     in the same way @peoplesoracle’s thread is in that it is expressing commentary on

                  <div class="ptext" id="p28">By focusing on Black digital intimacies in Black Digital Humanities we can delve into
                     the ways in which culture can assist in identity development beyond hegemonic
                     representations and center the quotidian. Another aspect of my research, and other
                     Black digital humanists, contend that Black life is not always about recovering and
                     responding to the injury of white supremacy, but that the mundane and quotidian
                     aspects of life, like social media usage, should be considered as well. This is a
                     project of Black DH as Kim Gallon writes, “Black studies as a
                     unique role to play in dismembering how we think about humanity and the digital
                     humanities by extension. A black epistemology will generate questions about the
                     relationship between the racialization of humanity and the digital as power,
                     ultimately fostering new inquiries and deeper understandings about the human
                     condition”” [<a class="ref" href="#gallon2016">Gallon 2016</a>]. As evidenced through studying
                     digital fandom, epistemologies of interiority as expressed in cultural productions
                     and fueled by Black digital intimacies opens a world of understanding about the human
                     condition. As evidenced by @crissles stating that watching the show would be a break
                     from the world in 2020. In a <cite class="title italic">Cosmopolitan</cite> article, Rae
                     was asked about the intention of centering the mundane. The interviewer states “<span class="hi italic">Insecure</span> also proves that it’s OK to just
                     show the mundaneness of black lives — not everything needs to be about harrowing
                     black suffering, which can be overwhelming”” [<a class="ref" href="#jerkins2017">Jerkins 2017</a>].
                     Rae replies, “It’s important to show the mundaneness because it
                     shows us as human, and we don’t get to have those moments of celebrating
                     ourselves. We have a very specific struggle even in the mundane, like with
                     microaggressions. But that doesn’t mean the world stops. We still keep moving.
                     We’re so trained to continue”
                     [<a class="ref" href="#jerkins2017">Jerkins 2017</a>]. Affirmative transformative usage of the digital and
                     understanding of fandom practices centers how we continue and open ourselves up to
                     the world to foster new connections online and in our personal lives. The small ways
                     Black people experience joy and heal their intimate relationships drives my interest
                     in this subject. I center Black intimacies because I believe by centering affect and
                     how communities relate to each other and attempt to express joy, healing,
                     forgiveness, and pleasure that the propensity for activism against oppression is
