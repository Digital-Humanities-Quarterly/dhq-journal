                  <p>In this article it is argued that one of the major
                     transformative factors of the humanities at the beginning of
                     the 21st century is the shift from analogue to digital
                     source material, and that this shift will affect the
                     humanities in a variety of ways. But various kinds of
                     digital material are not digital in the same way, which a
                     distinction between digitized, born-digital, and
                     reborn-digital may help us acknowledge, thereby helping us
                     to understand how each of these types of digital material
                     affects different phases of scholarly work in its own way.
                     This is illustrated by a detailed comparison of the nature
                     of digitized collections and web archives.

                  <div class="ptext" id="p1">For decades the challenges and crises faced by
                     the humanities have had an impact on debates about their
                     status and future. In his seminal article "Beneath and
                     Beyond the 'Crisis in the humanities,'" Geoffrey Galt
                     Harpham even talks about "the perennial crisis in the
                     humanities" that has characterized the humanities
                     "over the
                     past half-century" [<a class="ref" href="#harpham2005">Harpham 2005</a>, 21], and he continues:
                     
                     <blockquote>
                        <p>Sometimes the crisis — whose dimensions can be
                           measured by declining numbers of enrollments,
                           majors, courses offered, and salaries — is described as a
                           separate, and largely self-inflicted, catastrophe confined
                           to a few disciplines; sometimes it is linked to a general
                           disarray in liberal education, and sometimes to the moral
                           collapse and intellectual impoverishment of the entire
                           culture. But one point emerges with considerable regularity
                           and emphasis: humanistic scholars, fragmented and confused
                           about their mission, suffer from an inability to convey to
                           those on the outside and even to some on the inside the
                           specific value they offer to public culture; they suffer,
                           that is, from what the scholar and critic Louis Menand calls
                           a "crisis of rationale." [<a class="ref" href="#harpham2005">Harpham 2005</a>, 21–22]

                     1960s and that is now emerging rapidly on a large scale,
                     namely the introduction of "the digital" in the

                     digital computer and the humanities have by and large taken
                     place under the umbrella term "Digital Humanities." The
                     humanities have become digital by making the objects of
                     study available in digital form, by introducing digital
                     analytical tools, and by establishing digital means of
                     communication for collaborating during the research process,
                     for discussing and disseminating research results, and for
                     interacting with society at large. A more self-reflexive
                     approach to the Digital Humanities has also emerged, ranging
                     from manifestos such as the <cite class="title italic">Digital

                     However, there have not been many attempts to systematically
                     identify (some of) the driving force(s) behind the
                     introduction of the digital in the humanities: if the
                     digital is actually becoming more and more predominant
                     within the humanities, what could be the reason for
                     this?

                  <div class="ptext" id="p5">Undoubtedly, a major and irreversible shift has
                     taken place at the very heart of the humanities, since the
                     sources and the data that are studied in many of the
                     humanistic disciplines have changed from analogue to
                     digital. A few figures may illustrate this. In 2000, 75% of
                     all stored data was analogue (paper, film, photographic
                     prints, vinyl, magnetic cassette tapes, etc.), but in 2007
                     this had shrunk to 7%, and in 2012, to 2% [<a class="ref" href="#mayer-sch%C3%B6nberger2013">Mayer-Schönberger 2013</a>, 8–9].
                     From 1453 to 1503, after the introduction of the printing
                     press, eight million books were printed, thus doubling the
                     amount of written material in the world in 50 years. Today
                     the volume of digital data doubles a little more than every
                     third year, whereas the volume of analogue data hardly grows
                     at all [<a class="ref" href="#mayer-sch%C3%B6nberger2013">Mayer-Schönberger 2013</a>, 8–10]. Google processes more than 24PB
                     of data per day, thousands of times the quantity of all
                     printed material in the Library of Congress. Facebook gets
                     +10 million photos uploaded every hour, and over an hour of
                     video is uploaded on YouTube every second [<a class="ref" href="#mayer-sch%C3%B6nberger2013">Mayer-Schönberger 2013</a>, 8].

                  <div class="counter"><a href="#p6">6</a></div>
                  <div class="ptext" id="p6">Although these figures may be questioned, the
                     tendency is undoubtedly clear: within the last decade we
                     have been witnessing a major shift from analogue to digital
                     material, and we have probably only seen the beginning of
                     this. Thus, it can be argued that one of the major
                     transformative factors of the humanities in the 21<span class="hi superscript">st</span> century is the move from
                     analogue to digital source material (obviously, other
                     factors also play a role, cf. [<a class="ref" href="#svensson2011">Svensson 2011</a>, 42]). Before the year
                     2000 the introduction of the digital in the humanities in
                     the form of digitized collections, tools and communication
                     platforms may have been an additional choice, but this may
                     not be the case in the future. Since more and more source
                     material comes in digital form — and in more and more cases in
                     digital form only — there is no opting out of the digital, and
                     the fundamental question for the humanities is probably not
                     <em class="emph">if</em> the digital should be
                     introduced in the humanities, but rather <em class="emph">how</em>. And it is worth noting that as a function of
                     the transformation of source material from analogue to
                     digital, the analytical, tools and the means of
                     communicating about scholarly activities will in many cases
                     also have to change, since the use of digitally- supported
                     methods that were previously just a possibility tend to
                     become a necessity when interacting with digital objects of
                     study.

                     conceptualized, how it will affect the humanities, and to
                     what degree the humanities will become digital.

                     general questions by focusing on the core question, namely
                     the nature of digital source material. The main argument is
                     that all kinds of digital material are not digital in the
                     same way, just because they are digital. To support this
                     argument a distinction is introduced between digitized,
                     born-digital, and reborn-digital sources. With this

                        for the development of digital artefacts and culture:
                        "The common element in all digital technologies, the
                        unifying aspect of the cultures, arts, and media that we
                        call <span class="hi italic">digital</span>, is the discrete,
                        binary code."  [<a class="ref" href="#evens2012">Evens 2012</a>, 7]. Thus, the binary code is a
                        condition of possibility for technological artefacts
                        (Barry also stresses the digital by focusing on software
                        and drawing on work in software and critical code
                        studies), but without defining the digital [<a class="ref" href="#berry2012">Berry 2012</a>, 4–6]. Evens understands the binary code of 0s and 1s as
                        numbers that can be calculated [<a class="ref" href="#evens2012">Evens 2012</a>], but
                        another possibility would be to understand 0s and 1s as
                        letters, thus displacing the digital from being a matter
                        of mathematics to being a matter of text. The latter
                        approach can be found in Finnemann’s definition of the
                        digital computer.

                        computer is characterized by three invariant traits: 1)
                        a mechanical alphabet composed of a finite number of
                        letters, each of which is void of meaning, 2) an
                        algorithmic syntax, and 3) an interface which determines
                        the semantics of the syntax [<a class="ref" href="#finnemann1999">Finnemann 1999</a>], see also [<a class="ref" href="#br%C3%BCggerandfinnemann2013">Brügger and Finnemann 2013</a>, 68–69]. The idea that the 0s and 1s can be understood as
                        letters and not numbers is based on the assumption that
                        numbers are not void of meaning — 0 means "zero," 1 means
                        "one" — but in order to be able to combine them via the
                        algorithmic syntax they must be void of meaning, like
                        other kinds of letters that are combined into words. All
                        three invariant traits are necessary as such, but they
                        are not necessary in any specific form. Today the
                        mechanical alphabet composed of a finite number of
                        letters is the binary alphabet with the two letters 0
                        and 1, the algorithmic syntax comes in a number of
                        forms, from machine to user level, and the interface can
                        be any kind of device that can handle the digital
                        alphabet and its algorithmic syntaxes, ranging from PCs
                        and handheld devices to mainframe and networked
                        computers.

                        computer can be understood as a "writing machine," with
                        the letters being combined to form "texts" on all the
                        levels of the computer, and these texts are editable at
                        any time, down to the individual bit. In line with the
                        point made above by Evens, it is important to include
                        the fundamental digitality of computers in the
                        understanding of the Digital Humanities since it
                        constitutes the condition of possibility of all the

                        see this as an indication of the fact that "the

                        common definition of what it is. Nevertheless, it is
                        possible to identify a number of themes that are often

                        Should, for instance, law be considered part of the

                        a set of predominant theoretical and methodological

                        advance of mankind and of human culture, or be of a more

                        with institutional affiliation determining what the
                        humanities are (the humanities are simply what belong to

                        constitute recurring issues in most attempts to define
                        the humanities. Thus, any such definition constitutes a
                        specific constellation of answers to the questions
                        raised within each of the four themes: what are the
                        boundaries, the object(s) of study, the theories and
                        methods, the aims, and the institutional affiliation?
                        And these constellations of answers vary throughout
                        history and may depend on the national setting.
                        Therefore, it is difficult to identify "the humanities"
                        in an unequivocal manner with a view to using this
                        definition as a stepping stone in an understanding of
                        the Digital Humanities. Instead, one must content
                        oneself with the idea that the humanities constitute a
                        fuzzy and complex field, constantly under construction,
                        and that the humanities vary a good deal. And therefore
                        any understanding of the Digital Humanities should start
                        by being very specific about how the humanities that
                        become digital are understood.

                        is worth noting that the fuzziness and complexity of the
                        "humanities" does not disappear or dissolve just because
                        the term is combined with "digital." On the contrary,
                        the many differences remain and may even multiply, and
                        any attempt to define the Digital Humanities without
                        having defined the humanities will rebound into

                        Such an approach does not solve the complexities of the
                        humanities, but it gives a minimal common ground for
                        debating how the interface between the humanities and

                        on how they define themselves as "humanities," their
                        research questions and their practices. The advantage of
                        this definition is that on the one hand it offers a
                        shared common ground for any detailed definition of the
                        Digital Humanities — that is, the conceptualization of
                        digitality — while on the other hand it is open and
                        flexible enough to incorporate the variety of detailed
                        understandings of the humanities that have been
                        established in theory or by the concrete scholarly
                        practices, and instantiations of the use of the
                        computer. It is important to stress that the interplay
                        between "the digital" and "the humanities" is not
                        regarded as a one-way deterministic logic from "digital"
                        to "humanities." Instead, it is understood as a
                        dialectical interplay of shaping and re-shaping between
                        "digital" and "humanities" — the two are
                        interdependent.

                     digital is related to the material to be studied in a very
                     fundamental way, in the main because the use of digital
                     analytical tools does not make any sense if the object of
                     study does not somehow exist in digital form. What follows
                     in this section are three approaches to understanding the importance of the different
                     digitalities of digital
                     material. First, a general typology of three types of
                     digital material is presented, based on the assumption that
                     although all kinds of digital material share the same
                     digital alphabet, they are not identical in all respects
                     just because they are digital — digital material is not just
                     digital material. Second, a systematic approach is
                     introduced as to where exactly we can locate "the digital"
                     in the humanistic scholar’s research process. And, third, a
                     brief outline of the historical development of the interplay
                     between the humanities and the digital is presented.

                        material share the same feature, namely that they are
                        digital. But on the other hand, this digitality is
                        always already embedded in a set of semantic, technical
                        and academic structures, which implies that digital
                        material is not just digital, but that it is digital in
                        a variety of ways (a similar argument of embeddedness in
                        already existing structures is put forward in relation
                        to digital tools in [<a class="ref" href="#collins2011">Collins 2011</a>]). In the
                        following section a general
                        typology of digitality is suggested, based on the

                        material, and on a distinction between three main types

                        radio and television, and even pictures or 3D-models of
                        artefacts. The process of digitization is any form of
                        transformation of analogue material into digital form,
                        be it the laborious keyboarding of written documents to

                        sound and moving images. The main characteristic of
                        digitized material is that its "becoming digital" is
                        based on an original that was not digital — an original

                        research process. But before going into more detail
                        about how this unfolds in the digital world, let us have
                        a look at a schematic representation of how the research
                        process usually unfolded before the advent of the
                        digital (<a href="#figure01">Figure 1</a>). This very general model does not
                        necessarily fit all parts of the humanities, but it
                        provides a good idea of where the digital can later be
                        located within the research process of most disciplines.
                        In addition, it has to be stressed that what are
                        presented as two distinct worlds — an analogue and a
                        digital — are in practice in today’s digital world very
                        often intermixed in the sense that even scholars
                        claiming to be Digital Humanists switch between analogue
                        and digital in various phases of their research. But for
                        the sake of argument, they are presented as two distinct

                        later disseminated. This may be an iterative
                        process, for instance, the analysis may mean that new
                        material has to be procured, the debate may lead to
                        corrections of the analysis, and the dissemination may
                        affect all the previous steps (the iterative nature is

                        the nature of the material to be studied to a large
                        degree determines — or at least sets up a range of
                        possibilities for — each of the four steps. Analogue
                        material has to be collected in an "analogue" way, which
                        may imply that the scholar has to visit the collections
                        or objects by moving physically to where they are; the
                        analysis must rely on ancillary tools such as printed
                        indexes, records on index cards, and on how things are
                        ordered in some of the physical buildings and
                        institutions holding the collections (e.g. in "GLAM"
                        institutions, which stands for galleries, libraries,
                        archives and museums). Discussions generally have to
                        take place either face-to-face, for instance at
                        conferences, or in pre-publications such as conference
                        papers, with the process of dissemination taking place
                        in print media such as books, journals or newspapers, or
                        possibly in electronic media (radio, television).

                     <div class="ptext" id="p35">But not only does the analogue nature of
                        the objects of study affect each of the four phases of
                        study. Their nature also has an impact on a more
                        detailed level. Therefore, a systematic distinction is
                        introduced between, on the one hand, semiotic and
                        non-semiotic objects of study, and on the other hand
                        material that is either handed down to, found or created
                        by the scholar. Semiotic documents that are handed down
                        from the past could, for instance, be objects carrying
                        semiotic systems, based on discrete units (e.g.
                        documents, books, newspapers with writing or still
                        images, or film/television with writing, sound and
                        moving images), whereas non-semiotic objects that are
                        handed down are any kind of artefact. As to the objects
                        of study that have been created by the scholars
                        themselves, this type of material can also be either
                        semiotic (for instance a taped interview, field study
                        notes, surveys on paper, or the like), or non-semiotic,
                        such as design mock-ups, or reconstructions of artefacts
                        from the past (e.g. experimental archaeology). It has to
                        be stressed that the two sets of distinctions are
                        analytical distinctions that are made with a view of
                        identifying the most predominant feature of the
                        different types of objects of study. Thus, the clear
                        distinction between semiotic and non-semiotic plays down
                        the fact that semiotic materials are also artefacts
                        (books are also artefacts), and that artefacts also mean
                        something in themselves, although they do not "carry" a
                        semiotic system, such as written letter for instance (an
                        ancient weapon can be a sign of cultural power); and
                        with regard to the latter distinction, material handed
                        down from the past is never approached unbiased but is
                        always selected by the scholar with a view to creating
                        his or her own object of study, whereas the scholar’s
                        own creation of the material of study here and now often
                        relies on material that was handed down.

                        disseminating and interacting (e.g. computer files,

                        the three main digital types mentioned above. Digitized,

                        overlaps may occur: digitized material can be collected,
                        analyzed, debated and disseminated in ways that are
                        specific to this material’s digitality, whereas

                        affect the research process in various ways, but there
                        are other questions worth raising here as well: is the
                        material semiotic or non-semiotic, and has it been
                        handed down/found or created? With regard to digitized
                        material, one main issue is that analogue artefacts and
                        objects created by researchers cannot become digital as
                        such but have to be transformed into images of some
                        kind. And with regard to born-digital material, the
                        non-semiotic objects are probably not entirely digital,
                        but only come with digital components. As to
                        reborn-digital material, each of the four subtypes of
                        material will probably differ because they are most
                        likely to be transformed in different ways when they are

                        digital can be identified (for other types of

                        new research fields such as humanities computing,
                        literary computing, computational linguistics, and later
                        digital history emerge [<a class="ref" href="#schreibman2004">Screibman</a>],

                        disciplines are initially based on the use of
                        stand-alone mainframe computers; later, proprietary
                        computer networks are introduced, and later again, the
                        open internet. In terms of digital material, these
                        traditions are in the main focused on digitized
                        material.

                        when two partly overlapping new research fields emerge,
                        namely "New Media Studies" and "Internet Studies." New
                        Media Studies as well as Internet Studies are often not
                        considered part of the Digital Humanities, but probably
                        they should be, if the focus is on how the humanities — or
                        at least a number of humanistic disciplines — have
                        integrated the digital as an object of study. New Media
                        Studies and Internet Studies are very broad fields of
                        study, including a range of disciplines, but they all
                        converge in the study of new media and of the internet
                        (cf. [<a class="ref" href="#br%C3%BCgger2005">Brügger 2005</a>, 106–107] for a brief account on the Digital
                        Humanities and internet studies). In contrast to the
                        first wave, the second wave has had a digital object of
                        study from the very outset, and therefore it is focused
                        on born-digital material.

                        historical studies of the internet within internet
                        studies emerge in the early 2000s. One of the main

                     following section, the case of the archived web will be introduced
                     because it illustrates the importance of identifying the
                     differences between digital material, despite its being
                     digital, and consequently it may illustrate the importance
                     of approaching digital materials in different ways. The
                     archived web is compared to digitized material, since both
                     types are transformations of already existing material,
                     analogue and born-digital, respectively, but the material
                     that is being transformed as well as the processes of
                     transformation are very different, and so are the results.
                     Thus, contrasting the two will highlight these differences
                     (for a more detailed discussion of this topic, please see

                     and [<a class="ref" href="#masan%C3%A8s2006">Masanès 2006</a>]). However, it has to be
                     stressed that since the process of digitization can range
                     from keyboarding written documents to punched cards, text
                     encoding, scanning documents to image files, or the digital
                     recording of sound and moving images, digital collections
                     are more complex and varied than the general presentation
                     below indicates. Thus, a more detailed analysis of digitized
                     collections in their own right should take into account the
                     many differences characterizing these collections, including
                     a focus on the provenance of as well as access to the

                        ways that will each result in genuinely different
                        versions. For instance, it has to be decided where the
                        archiving should start and stop, if specific file types
                        should be included/excluded, if the archiving should be
                        allowed to retrieve material on other servers, etc.
                        Thus, the question of what to archive also applies to a
                        web archive, but what is even more important is
                        <em class="emph">how</em> to archive the web. The
                        consequences of this are (1) that strictly speaking the
                        archived web does not exist as such before it is
                        archived, but is only created in the process of
                        archiving; and (2) that if two archiving institutions
                        decide to archive the same website at the same point in
                        time, the results are very likely to be different, due
                        to the different archiving settings. Thus, in contrast
                        to digitized collections, where differences as to

                        of the same analogue object will probably only lead to

                        web archives often creates two unique, but different
                        versions (it is also necessary to add that differences
                        in assembling the archived bits and pieces in the
                        archive may even complicate these differences).

                        knows exactly what happens "out there," once the
                        archiving software has been launched. Technical problems
                        may occur, for instance the archiving process may simply
                        stop, it may get off track, for instance, when
                        encountering crawler traps such as calendars, or bot
                        traps such as pages generating new links (both cases
                        create an infinite circuit of requests to the
                        webserver), or it may encounter file or software formats
                        that cannot be archived (streamed video, java scripts,
                        etc.). And a phenomenon that is specific for web
                        archiving may add to the opacity, namely what can be
                        termed "the dynamics of updating" (cf. [<a class="ref" href="#br%C3%BCgger2005">Brügger 2005</a>, 22–23]),
                        that is the fact that the website being archived may
                        change during the very process of archiving, and we do
                        not know if, when, and where this may happen — as if the
                        pages of a newspaper were continuously being edited
                        while the newspaper was being digitized. And we cannot
                        rely on going back and checking the original, since it
                        may be either gone or changed.

                        any website has been archived all the time, for instance
                        every day, which means that the scholar will be missing
                        some of the material that was initially online (in

                        several times at very short intervals, so there may be
                        several versions from (almost) the same point in time.
                        Thus, it is very likely that the scholar who wants to
                        study material in a web archive does not only have one
                        copy of each document. Instead, the processes and
                        strategies of archiving the web and the preservation of
                        the web in the web archive entail that in some cases a
                        lot of what was once online is missing; whereas in other
                        cases there may be too much material that is partly
                        identical, but not exactly a duplicate. Finding one’s
                        way through this network of (possibly) overlapping
                        versions is especially difficult because the various
                        extra versions of "the same" may not be versions of the
                        same. There may be partial overlaps between, for
                        instance, a webpage on a website archived in the morning

                        case in a web archive, namely if the web archive creates
                        metadata for each archived website (as does, for
                        instance, the Australian web archive Pandora,

                        especially in web archives that use the so-called bulk
                        archiving strategy, where vast amounts of websites are
                        archived, either based on a list of all the domain names
                        to archive (e.g. the Danish Netarkivet) or on following
                        links from what has already been archived (e.g. the
                        US-based Internet Archive). In these cases the mere
                        number of domain names makes it impossible to manually
                        register the websites being archived. For instance, the
                        UK country code top level domain .uk consists of
                        approximately 10 million domain names. In these cases
                        the only types of register are either the list of
                        archived domains or the technical crawl log, where
                        information about the archiving can be found, although
                        the first of these two does not tell much, and the
                        latter has to be transformed into information that makes
                        sense to a scholar, and manually added information is
                        still not an option.

                        hyperlinks can be added to digitized newspapers or radio

                        the hyperlink is an optional add-on, the hyperlink is an
                        inherent part of the online web: in the main "no
                        hyperlink" is the same as saying "no web." And for the
                        very same reason it is not optional to include the
                        hyperlink in a web archive. At first sight one may not
                        consider the necessity of including
                        hyperlinks in a web archive a problem, but on a closer
                        inspection it becomes evident that the inclusion of
                        the online web’s hyperlinks in the web archive may
                        challenge the scholarly use of the archive in ways that
                        are unseen in digitized collections, basically because
                        in digitized collections there is only one copy of each
                        entity, and the publication of the material has already
                        taken place in the past, at a specific and identifiable
                        point in time.

                     <div class="ptext" id="p68">The necessity of including
                        hyperlinks in a web archive is a challenge, partly
                        because archiving takes time (e.g. it takes two months
                        to archive the entire Danish web on .dk), and partly
                        because all web entities are not necessarily archived in
                        the same depth below the front page (due to deliberate
                        choices in the archiving settings, or to unexpected
                        problems). Therefore, the presence of hyperlinks creates
                        two sorts of inconsistencies in the web archive as a
                        whole. First, a temporal inconsistency, because there
                        may not be temporal coherence between the link source
                        and the link target, that is the webpage where the link
                        is found and the webpage to which the link points — they
                        may have been archived with an interval of several days,
                        weeks or even months. Second, when comparing the
                        hyperlinks from a subset of archived websites, for
                        instance in a network analysis, this hyperlink network
                        may be inconsistent as such if the websites in question
                        were not all archived in the same depth. Some may appear
                        to have many links whereas others do not, as if we were
                        comparing digitized newspapers which only had a front
                        page in some cases but which had several sections in
                        others; or comparing radio programmes which only had the
                        first 30 seconds in some cases but only 10 seconds every
                        minute in others. All in all, the compulsion to include
                        hyperlinks in a web archive tends to make the collection
                        temporally and spatially inconsistent when focusing on
                        the software-based relations between websites or other
                        web entities.

                     homogenous, web archives are by and large heterogeneous,
                     messy and opaque at the outset. And this is true of web
                     archives in ways that are much more fundamental than other
                     types of collections, partly because the online web that was
                     initially archived is in many ways also heterogeneous, messy
                     and opaque; and partly because the archiving process itself
                     as well as the preservation and access to the web in the web
                     archive adds yet another layer of heterogeneity and
                     messiness to the archived web. In short, the fundamental
                     heterogeneity cannot be removed or resolved by technical
                     means because it is a constitutive part of the web and of
                     the web being archived. And to add insult to injury, the
                     heterogeneity of the web archive also has a history of its
                     own because the web and the web archive continue to develop,
                     thus accumulating previous heterogeneities.

                        because very often the only way to search the archive is
                        to search for a specific URL, which is the web domain

                        challenging, partly because it is unclear what entity to
                        show, partly because there may be many overlapping
                        versions of "the same" thing in terms of time and space.
                        Imagine a search for the term "humanities" in a
                        collection of digitized newspapers: the result page will
                        show all the pages where the word appears, and the
                        results may be filtered further by the name of the
                        newspaper, the date range or other parameters. But no
                        matter what, there is only one copy of each of the pages
                        on which the word is found; in other words, there is no
                        temporal depth of each page. If we search for the term
                        "humanities" in a ten-year-old web archive, the result
                        page may show the individual webpages on which the term
                        was found, and we may also be able to filter by the URL
                        of the websites to which each page belongs, by date
                        range, etc. But the results page also has to handle the
                        existence of several — often overlapping — versions of "the
                        same" webpage, since in the web archive "one found page"
                        does not necessarily equal "one copy from each point in
                        time," but rather, as outlined above, something like
                        "one webpage" equals "several versions." In other words,
                        each webpage may come with its own temporal and spatial
                        depth in the form of partly overlapping versions,
                        overlapping in both time and space (size). In addition,
                        if the web archive does not have any metadata to
                        display, it can be very difficult for the scholar to
                        evaluate different versions.

                        case in a web archive, but before doing this one has to
                        perform a step that is usually not necessary in
                        digitized collections: deciding which of the many
                        possible versions of "the same" should be included in
                        the object of study.

                     <div class="counter"><a href="#p77">77</a></div>
                     <div class="ptext" id="p77">As mentioned above, there are a number of
                        reasons why a web archive may contain a large number of
                        versions of "the same" web material; but it is important
                        to stress that these versions are usually not identical
                        duplicates, but genuinely different versions, and the
                        differences may range from being very important to being
                        insignificant. Therefore, the scholar using a web
                        archive has to perform the tasks of identifying,
                        evaluating and selecting the possible versions to
                        include in the study. An example: we may want to study
                        the BBC website (<a class="ref" href="http://bbc.com" onclick="window.open('http://bbc.com'); return false">bbc.com</a>), for instance the front page
                        and the two sub-sections News (<a class="ref" href="http://bbc.com/news" onclick="window.open('http://bbc.com/news'); return false">bbc.com/news</a>) and Sport
                        (<a class="ref" href="http://bbc.com/sport" onclick="window.open('http://bbc.com/sport'); return false">bbc.com/sport</a>). The front page may have been archived
                        eight times per day, the front page of News and Sport
                        three times every day, and the sub-pages at varying
                        intervals (once every day, every second day, etc.). We
                        then have many versions of some of the pages, fewer
                        versions of others, and no versions of others; so the
                        task is to decide which of these versions to choose to
                        combine to form our object of study, even though one
                        should be aware that because of the temporal and spatial
                        inconsistencies of the archived web elements, one cannot
                        reconstruct the website’s front page and the two
                        sub-sections exactly as they looked at a specific point
                        in time, but only as they may have looked at several
                        points in time. Identifying, evaluating and selecting
                        versions can be quite difficult, and it is therefore
                        important that tools are developed to help the scholar
                        to perform this task in such a way that his or her
                        choices are as informed as possible. This will include
                        tools that can provide as much information about each of
                        the versions as possible (e.g. starting/stopping time of
                        the archiving), along with visualization tools to make
                        it possible to display the different versions in a
                        manageable manner, and tools to help select — or maybe
                        even combine — which version should be used as the object
                        of study.

                        to study, it is time to return to the step mentioned
                        above, which involves isolating the material for later
                        study. In a digitized collection this is in general a
                        trivial task, mainly because each document is clearly
                        identifiable as one (or more) file(s), and in general it
                        is not linked to other documents (and if it is, this is
                        usually done in a very unequivocal manner). For
                        instance, digitized newspapers are usually kept as pdf
                        files, whereas radio programmes are often preserved as
                        avi files. Therefore, the relevant files can either be
                        taken out of the collection and analyzed outside the
                        archive, or bookmarked, put into a folder etc for
                        further study.

                     <div class="ptext" id="p79">Again, things work differently in a web
                        archive, mainly because of the existence of hyperlinks
                        as an inherent part of most web documents, since the
                        hyperlink makes it slightly more complicated to remove
                        the files from the archive. An example: in the study of
                        <a class="ref" href="http://bbc.com" onclick="window.open('http://bbc.com'); return false">bbc.com</a> we have identified the versions to be studied,
                        but if we then remove them from the archive, for
                        instance by exporting them to our own computer, we also
                        remove them from the communicative environment in which
                        they were initially embedded in the archive, and
                        suddenly things may appear either not to work anymore or
                        to behave strangely. Links may no longer work because
                        the link target is not part of our corpus, and this is
                        true of the links that are immediately visible on the
                        webpage and the more invisible links that make the
                        webpage look as it does, for instance links to adds,
                        images, or embedded videos located on other servers. Or
                        links may work, but in strange ways if the material is
                        removed from a web archive with no access to the live
                        web and placed on a computer with online access. For
                        instance, if a script on the front page of the archived
                        version of bbc.com requests today’s weather from the
                        server of the national meteorological service, this
                        server-side information may still be displayed if the
                        server is still online, thus displaying today’s weather
                        and patching the website of the past with today’s web
                        (cf. [<a class="ref" href="#br%C3%BCgger2008">Brügger 2008</a>, 159]).

                     <div class="ptext" id="p80">Thus, the best way of isolating archived
                        web material for study is to do this within the archive,
                        for instance by generating an index of what has been
                        chosen, and then limiting the study to this index.
                        However, for technical reasons this may not be
                        straightforward. For instance, the so-called
                        deduplication procedure has to be taken into
                        consideration; that is the fact that the web archive
                        continually checks if a file is already in the archive
                        (e.g. a pdf file), and if it is, it is not archived
                        again with a view to saving disk space. But if a scholar
                        later delimits a corpus to a certain date range, and the
                        file was archived before the starting date of this date
                        range, the file will not be displayed, even if it is in
                        the archive. There are technical solutions to this, but
                        the phenomenon illustrates that a web archive is a
                        rather complex collection because of the existence of
                        hyperlinks.

                        the scholar can start analyzing it. It is not possible
                        to go into much detail about the great variety of
                        analytical tools that can be applied in analyses of
                        archived web material, but the main challenge for all
                        these tools is that their possible use is a function of
                        how the web archive has been constructed as well as
                        how the concrete construction of the object of study
                        within the web archive has been performed, and with what
                        result. Thus, in a very fundamental way the nature of a
                        reborn-digital collection such as a web archive
                        constitutes the condition of possibility of the

                        overcome the challenges. However, this should not leave
                        the humanities scholar paralysed, because one of the
                        most important tools in the traditional humanities
                        toolbox is the skill of dealing with sources and their

                        and translated to fit a new digital environment. For
                        instance, the task of comparing versions outlined above
                        is in many ways similar to traditional philology, which
                        means that a future "web philology" does not have to
                        start from scratch but can be developed to fit the
                        specific nature of the archived web by identifying and
                        focusing on the differences between texts written on
                        parchment or paper and texts archived on the web (for an

                        acknowledge the specific digitality of archived web, and
                        to recognize that access to the digital code may even be
                        a great help to the scholar, since this layer of
                        invisible text beneath the visible text holds a lot of
                        important information and metadata, among others about

                     the shift from analogue to a great variety of digital source
                     material, it has been argued that this shift will affect the
                     humanities in a variety of ways. To conclude, I shall
                     briefly return to the question asked at the outset: to what

                     the possibility of using digitally supported methods that
                     this material allows and increasingly renders necessary.
                     Thus, this spread of the digital will probably push the
                     humanities closer to becoming the Digital Humanities.

                     largely remain unchanged, despite the widespread digitality

                     Digital Humanities do not in themselves constitute an
                     entirely new paradigm. Instead, they open up an array of
                     possibilities either for doing what was previously done in
                     new ways, or for rethinking well-known practices of the

                     humanities need not become Digital Humanities, but most
                     humanities will not remain unchanged since they are
                     challenged by the digitality of the object of study in
                     itself or of the digitally supported methods and tools to be
                     used within the humanities — or both. Therefore, in the 21<span class="hi superscript">st</span> century the difference
                     between the humanities and the Digital Humanities is
                     quantitative rather than qualitative: all parts of the
                     humanities will become digital to some extent, but not all
                     will become digital to the same extent. Thus, the main
                     question is not one of being digital or not, but rather one
                     of being more or less digital.
