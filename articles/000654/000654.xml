				<head>Introduction</head>

			<p>Algorithmic image sorting and its visualisation are increasingly used as tools in
				digital art history and image science. These include, among others, their use as
				hermeneutic and epistemic engines in art historical image search <ptr target="#bell2018"/>, in the organisation of museum or collection-specific image
				datasets <ptr target="#googleartsandculture2011"/>, or in digital cultural analysis
				<ptr target="#manovich2020"/>. For this reason, for example, machine learning algorithms can
				be used to automatically develop dimensions of image similarities. In
				particular, human-computer interactions are enabled in the mode of <soCalled>distant
					viewing</soCalled> <ptr target="#moretti2000"/>. The visualisation of abstract data allows the
				identification of trends and correlations in the data. A main component of
				distance representation lies in the rapid recognition of optical patterns on the
				part of the recipient <ptr target="#dork2018"/> <ptr target="#dork2020"/>. Graphical and image-specific methods of data representation are thus
				given increased attention in DH research for knowledge production and
				organisation â€“ as opposed to primarily used textual methods. In our article we
				discuss the development of methods for a semi-automated comparison <ptr target="#schnapp2012"/>.</p>
			<p>The starting point for these questions is our research project on intercultural
				comparison of climate images on the World Wide Web. Using the Internet search
				engine Google Images, we collected images from different regional cultural areas
				based on specific keywords related to climate change. Using machine learning as
				a digital method, we want to find out how globalised or differentiated the
				visual language of climate change is. For this purpose, we use a method of
				dimensionality reduction (t-SNE) based on machine learning algorithms, which
				enables human interaction with huge amounts of images by making them accessible
				to the human eye in the form of a data visualisation. Within our mixed-methods
				approach of quantitative computer science and qualitative image science,
				qualitative image analysis and reflection thus begins with data visualisation,
				which thus takes on a central role. However, our focus is not only on
				visualisation as a quantitative end product or phenomenon. Rather, we focus on
				the process of data processing and its curation, to which diverse data-shaping
				decision-making processes are subjective: from collecting, to clustering, to
				visualisation. Following Johanna Drucker's statement â€“ <q>distant reading isn't</q>
				<ptr target="#drucker2017" loc="634"/> â€“ we would like to emphasise that computer-assisted image
				analysis including data visualisation is not only a distant viewing method in
				the supposed sense of viewing: </p>
			<p>Machine learning as a method is promisingly applicable within the digital
				humanities, as it promises the analysis or comparison of large amounts of data.
				However, the automated processes only ever consider the isolated structural
				levels of the images. They are subject to unseen steps (black box) and
				qualitative-curatorial decisions. The visualisation of the data as
				visualisations of the distance within an operable interface is only a part of
				it. Although the qualitative interpretation of the automated image sorting
				starts from this distance view, we understand distanced seeing as the critical
				dialogue between the pure image artifacts and the abstracted data visualisations
				of computer vision <ptr target="#offert2021"/>. With being distanced we focus on the
				presupposition and technical standards that are used to abstract image data.</p>
			<p>In the following, we would like to use the metaphor of the pipeline to critically
				explain the development process of the t-SNE method. In individual steps, we
				describe the process of method development and reflect on the central
				qualitative as well as quantitative influences. Rather than focusing on the
				added value of machine learning as a new method, we want to reveal how much the
				structure of data and information is subject to constant decision-making
				processes and how interdisciplinary difficulties emerge in the process. In this
				deliberately open and critical handling of (visualised) image data, we see the
				central added value of mixed-methods or DH research. </p></div>
			<div>
			
				<head>Methods pipeline</head>
			
			<p>Within Google's image policy, one encounters a very standardised visual language,
				which at the same time reveals considerable differences in the preferred image
				types (e.g. photos, maps, curves, documents, comics) and in the framing of
				climate change. Our present study on the cross-cultural comparison of climate
				images is based on the framing approach from a qualitative image science
				perspective <ptr target="#rodriguez2013"/>, which was tested by means of
				automated image analysis. We focus on the development of a technically
				constructed gaze, which we critically explore in our study as part of the
				pipeline. Its importance is particularly evident in corpus creation and Google's
				page rank algorithms, as well as in image analysis based on the definition of
				the machine learning algorithm. This led to our central research questions: What
				is the role of automated image searches in terms of pre-sorting and ranking
				climate images? What do machine learning algorithms <ptr target="#vandermaaten2008"/> accomplish as a digital method for analysing image collections? To what
				extent are qualitative human image sorting and t-SNE visualisation
				interdependent? </p>
			<p>As noted in the introduction, by distanced vision we mean the constant dialogue of
				quantitative and qualitative decision-making processes. This already becomes
				clear in the methodological orientation of our research project. As an
				interdisciplinary mixed-methods research team, we oriented ourselves to the
				so-called embedded design of mixed-methods research according to John W.
				Creswell (<ref target="#creswell2007">2007</ref>). Here, the quantitative and qualitative approaches are
				considered separately, but in a consciously conceived interdependence in
				dialogue. The focus is on the quantitative image data and their machine image
				comparison using t-SNE as algorithmic image sorting and visualisation and the
				subsequent qualitative reading of the resulting data images.</p>

			<head>1 â€“ Parametrisation - Thinking technically about cultural spaces </head>
			<p>In this first step of project design, primarily qualitative distinctions are drawn
				and decisions are made as to which phenomena of the object of study are
				analytically and statistically usable. We call this basic step of formalising
				the research project<term> parameterisation</term>.</p>
			<p>Specifically, to describe intercultural climate image communication, two basic
				aspects had to be formalised for our study: on the one hand, cultural spaces <emph>per se</emph>, and on the other hand, the spaces in which
				climate images circulate. Thinking technically about cultural spaces turned out
				to be a challenge. Our study looks at the most global arrangement of climate
				communication possible, made possible by infrastructures such as the internet.
				The political order of nation states is too reductionist in this structure, as
				neither networked nor intercultural spaces can be thought of with the rigid
				state model. The question, then, was how cultural spaces can be conceived on the
				Net. After discussions with cultural scholars, we decided on the concept of <term>locales</term> as a unit of cultural space. A <term
					>locale</term> combines the idea of a specific language with a region or
				country. </p>
			<p>The second question about the representability of climate images related primarily
				to their technical media spaces, since the global reality of image communication
				on climate change is impossible to represent in its entirety. However, the
				global technology of the internet allows us to consider the cultural
				implications of this interconnectedness as a simplified model for cross-cultural
				climate communications. Compared to social media such as Instagram or Tik Tok,
				we were interested in the largest possible, extensively used, and highly
				formalized media spaces. The focus therefore fell on the search platform Google
				and Google Images as the largest manifestation.</p>
			<p>So, in order to do justice to the technical idea of cultural spaces in the WWW and
				Google as a search engine, we used the notion of <term>locales</term>.
				We are aware that a <term>locale</term> does not correspond to the
				idea of a cultural space, but is a heuristic for our research questions. </p> </div>
			<div>
			<head>Setting the locales</head>
			<p>
				The next step was to clarify which <term>locales</term> should be
				compared with each other. We developed a focus list of eighteen <term>locales</term>. These <term>locales</term> form a
				purely subjective selection based on previous research, contacts with
				international researchers, and climate policy relevance. To counteract a
				perceived biased perspective, we supplemented this with a number-based analysis
				of climate indices, so that qualitative and quantitative approaches were mixed.
				To do this, we created a two-dimensional mapping of the rankings for nation
				states of two climate indices: the ND-GAIN index from the Notre Dame Global
				Adaptation Initiative and the TCI indicator from the Stockholm Environment
				Institute. In a subsequent identification of groupings, we captured five
				clusters that outline focal points in each country's climate policy. The
				following seven countries were exemplary selected: USA, Brazil, Germany, Kenya,
				United Arab Emirates, Bangladesh, and Australia. Their <term
					>locales</term> were generated using simulated VPN searches. </p>

			<div>
				<head>Google image search â€“ keywords</head>
			<p>Our conducted image search via Google works by keywords. We were therefore
				confronted with the problem of differentiating the climate change discourse into
				a few but essential terms. In a highly iterative and qualitative process, we
				randomly evaluated different keywords in different languages related to climate
				change discourse in Google Image Search. We coordinated the exact definition of
				the keywords with experts working in the field of climate research and
				communication. In the end, we decided on eight terms to use as keywords and
				search terms: (1) climate change, (2) climate change disaster, (3) climate
				change impacts, (4) climate change risk, (5) climate emergency, (6) climate
				crisis, (7) climate collapse, and (8) global warming.</p>

				<div>
			<head>2 â€“ Google's image structure as a corpus</head>
			<p>To create the image corpus, we extracted the essential data using the method of
				web scraping via a Python script (via Beautiful Soup package). Web scraping
				describes an automated procedure that makes it possible to retrieve specific web
				pages and to retrieve previously defined elements of these pages. The data was
				thus filtered by algorithms from the information architecture of Google Images.
				This procedure is equivalent to an automated, qualitative curation of images
				since it has to be manually decided which items from a website are taken. On the
				basis of the Tor browser and its VPN tunnelling capabilities we technically
				imitated search queries from different cultural regions concerning climate
				issues. </p>
			<p>For seven <term>locales</term>, we agreed on a subjectively determined quantity
				of 250 images per keyword, since too many images would have limited the
				qualitative evaluation of the image analysis at the level of perception. As a
				tendency, it can be said that each technical arrangement benefits from more
				data, but must remain manageable for the human eye to ensure qualitative
				intervention. In addition to the image artifacts themselves, meta data of the
				images and the source of origin were also collected.</p>
			<p>The challenge that arose in our work with Google, understood by us as an epistemic
				search engine, is which perspective of research with or about Google results
				from this. According to the media scientist Richard Rogers, two approaches can
				be described as <q>medium research</q> and <q>social research</q> <ptr target="#rogers2017"/>. Medium
				research asks about algorithmic mechanisms and political motivations, i.e., how
				a web application is designed and for whom. As a critical research strand, the
				technical limitations and ethical-social implications of Google and its
				non-public page ranking algorithms are discussed here in detail. In contrast to
				medium research, we have decided in favour of the second strand, social research
				according to Rogers. This seeks not so much to expose the secret structures of
				search algorithms, but rather to productively read the given structures of the
				algorithm. For example, Google's rankings can be understood as indicators of
				social trends, and questions about the popularity of search words and regional
				emphases can be examined. Following this principle, we made a conscious decision
				to use the t-SNE technology to visualise Google's ordering structures that
				express the current social interest of global climate communication - i.e., our
				research subject.</p></div>
				
				<div>
			<head>3 â€“ Automated image analysis and its opacity</head>
			<p>Our web scraping process resulted in a corpus of approximately 16,000 images. To
				analyse this dataset, we searched for algorithms capable of formulating, at
				best, their own criteria of similarity according to which image motif
				recognition could be automated.</p>
			<p>We used the artificial neural network method, specifically the Convolutional
				Neural Networks (CNN) architecture <ptr target="#lecun1999"/>. Another big resource
				factor in neural network learning is the amount of data sets required. Our
				16,000 images from Google Image Search are too few to make them usable for a
				CNN. Again, for resource reasons, we therefore decided to use a pre-trained CNN
				following Google's Inception v3 architecture <ptr target="#szegedy2015"/> based on
				ImageNet's image dataset <ptr target="#stanford2020"/>. In the practical
				application, we had the approximately 16,000 images from Google Image Search
				pre-processed by a Python script (via TensorFlow library) and obtained
				multi-dimensional similarity vectors (2048 dimensions) for each image in
				relation to the learned images and keywords from ImageNet by the pre-trained
				neural network <emph>Inception</emph>. </p>
			<p>The identification of image similarities is central to our intercultural image
				comparison. It is based in the method of image comparison, which is thought of
				in a technical way compared to an art-historical orientation. Regarding the
				exploration of the quantitative technical view, similarity means the structural
				relation based on the trained ImageNet dataset. This can be structured in
				colour, shape, but also semantic content. Only differences can be made that are
				already created in the taxonomy of ImageNet. Since ImageNet is not specifically
				designed for climate change imagery and Inception has not been explicitly
				trained for this application, inaccuracies are to be expected. Thus, all images
				are compared to the broadest classification system embedded within <title
					rend="italic">ImageNet</title> rather than particular climate image settings.
				In addition, due to the structural complexity of neural networks, it is
				difficult to identify the basis on which the algorithm has made decisions
				<ptr target="#distillpub2017"/>. In addition to the black box in Google Images, another major
				discordance is evident in the work with automated image analysis using
				pre-trained neural networks.</p></div>
				<div>
			<head>4 â€“ Dimension reduction or to be spoilt for choice</head>
			<p>The 2048 dimensions of structural similarity resulting from the neural networks
				are difficult to imagine for the human eye, which is why we applied techniques
				for dimension reduction to an imaginable level in the next step. As statistical
				methods, such methods have been developed in many different forms and focuses.
				Established algorithms are, for example, principal component analysis (PCA) or
				newer approaches, such as UMAP (Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection).
				Due to its effectiveness, performance, and resource-efficient implementation, we
				decided to use a t-SNE (T-distributed Stochastic Neighbour Embedding) algorithm
				<ptr target="#vandermaaten2008"/>. t-SNE is a machine learning algorithm that
				models high-dimensional objects through a two- or three-dimensional space in
				such a way that, in principle, structurally similar objects are modelled by
				nearby points and dissimilar objects by more distant points. These models can
				then be represented by plots on a surface.</p>
			<p>While t-SNE plots often appear to represent groupings, these visual clusters can
				be strongly influenced by the calibration chosen, so a good understanding of the
				variables for t-SNE is necessary. Thus, the creation of a t-SNE algorithm is
				primarily a qualitative decision by the programmer about the variable values.
				Calibrating the variables is a particularly consequential step within our
				pipeline because it is on the basis of their data that the subsequent
				visualisation is created: Reducing the high-dimensional relations to a two- to
				three-dimensional space by the t-SNE algorithm creates distortions in the data
				representation in every case. They manifest themselves in the fact that very
				similar artefacts in a low-dimensional visualisation do not necessarily have to
				be in spatial proximity to each other.</p>
			<p>For our analysis, we created a t-SNE calculation for each <emph
					>locale</emph> and for each keyword. We calibrated the variables the same for
				each <emph>locale</emph> due to the number of calculations and for
				comparability reasons. In case of doubt, however, not every t-SNE is thus
				optimally set up for the specific dataset. It is possible, in addition to the
				general bias due to dimensionality reduction, that apparent groupings are not
				present in the actual clustered data and thus may be spurious findings. This is
				a principal challenge when working with automated dimension reduction and
				subsequent visualisation. t-SNE visualisations cannot be simply read, but should
				be understood primarily as a dynamic image under the calibration dependencies
				described.</p></div>

					</figure>
					
			
			<p>To merge the computational methods and the visualisation of the statistical
				results, we created a web interface based on Yale University's PixPlot tools
				with an interactive layout arrangement of the image corpus <ptr target="#yale2017"/>. The web-assisted visualisation (WebGL) consists of a
				two-dimensional projection in which similar images are grouped based on the
				similarity vectors computed by the Inception v3 neural network. </p>
			<p>In a further step, we complemented a k-means clustering in the t-SNE reduced
				two-dimensional space of the images. Clustering is applied for the purpose of
				identifying major centres of the t-SNE array by numerically comparing the
				dimension-reduced similarity vectors. In the image analysis, these centres were
				referred to as <emph>hotspots</emph>. It should be noted, however,
				that t-SNE operates in continuous space, i.e., it does not group in a strict
				sense. Thus, not every image in t-SNE corresponds to a complete and unique
				centre, and thus there are no unique membership boundaries. The k-means
				clustering does not perform the clear identification of clusters within the
				t-SNE array, since the t-SNE data is not structurally meant to be clustered by
				proximity. From a quantitative perspective, it serves only as an additional
				statistical procedure to present the results for human perception in such a way
				that one can orient oneself in the following t-SNE visualisation.</p>
			<p>At this point, the important dual role of interfaces becomes clear: On the one
				hand, only the visual representation allows access to the digital data
				structures, which are thus imperceptible to human viewers. On the other hand,
				the final representation allows little or no insight into the many
				decision-making processes, constraints, and (subjective) interventions that led
				to this representation. </p>
			<p>From a humanities perspective, in the further course of the pipeline we asked
				ourselves whether and to what extent the algorithmic t-SNE procedure can be
				understood as a framing method for image masses. Because from the technical
				sorting of Google's climate images, groupings of similarities resulted in this
				pipeline that allowed thematic image focusses.</p>
			<p>Overall, despite <emph>locale</emph>-specific differences, we were able
				to identify the following dominant or concise main motifs and image genres in
				the collected images, which expressed themselves either as technically generated
				image clusters or qualitative image groups. They can be understood as the result
				of climate image communication in relation to Google's ranking and image
				structures. In terms of image science, so-called <q>catch images</q> <ptr target="#diers1997"/>
				could be identified within the identified image groups, which were characterised
				by recurring motifs and formal stylistics. These appeared more frequently in the
				Google query due to their similarity and are reflected, among other things, in
				the technically generated <term>hotspot</term> images. The following
				overview shows the most dominant image groups with central catch images as
				single images.</p>

			<p>It could be determined that the t-SNE algorithm thus does not sort the images
				exclusively according to image types and juxtaposes the image-text documents
				with the photographs as central image clusters, but according to similar motifs
				or image contents. In the t-SNE visualisations, images motivated by content â€“ as
				far as one can speak of content in computer image recognition â€“ are placed next
				to image clusters of another image type. This observation is significant because
				it shows how similar technical-automated image vision and cultural-scientific
				vision are on this level.</p>

			<head>6 - Digital image swarms as a Gestalt</head>
			<p>The qualitative assessment of the algorithmically sorted image motifs within the

					</figure>		
					
			
			<p>Thus, far from any visual content, initial hypotheses about the composition of the
				visual landscapes could be detected on a structural level. For example, in the
				t-SNE of the search query for the Brazilian <term>locale</term>, a
				total of five image groupings could be identified: a very large and colourful
				one (centred), an isolated conspicuously dense and bright group (far upper
				right), two image groups of heterogeneous colourfulness (centred right and lower
				right), of which the centred one seems to merge into the large image group, and
				a conspicuously strongly isolated elongated and dense image group in the colour
				blue (lower left). </p>
			<p>In addition, a very high similarity of the formation of the shape of the t-SNE
				visualization from the Australian image query with that of the USA could be
				found. Both image landscapes were similar in terms of density and distance or
				scatteredness as well as colourfulness of the image landscapes. It was
				reasonable to assume that despite different VPN tuning, these two <term>locales</term> were very similar in their Google image content
				due to the same language of search terms.</p>

			</list>
			<p>Thus, the three perceptual patterns already allowed a comparison of the
				country-specific t-SNE visualisations based on their different size ratios,
				colour occurrence, and homogeneous or heterogeneous distribution of images. </p>
			<p>With regard to the evaluation of the similarity of the images among each other,
				hypotheses could be derived: The closer or denser the elements, the higher their
				commonality is interpreted. The more elements are condensed into groups, the
				more likely it is a common connection. This finding was expected after the
				description of the technical clustering. However, it can be emphasized because
				it is an expression for the actually invisible t-SNE-algorithm. Its logic of
				image sorting becomes perceptible and operable as cluster visualisation for
				content-related statements. </p></div>
				<div>
			<head>7 â€“ Toggling as a digital image experience</head>
			<p>On a qualitative level, the process of human perception of the climate images
				versus the automated pattern analysis of the machine learning algorithm was
				characterised by constant zooming in and out, a <q>toggling</q> process, within the
				country-specific interfaces <ptr target="#schnapp2012" loc="39"/>. In order to be able to
				compare the image clusters according to their size and their content, it was
				necessary to switch between individual images from a close view and the image
				landscapes from a distant view. The procedure of the distance view, if
				understood literally, offers the recipient an overview of the image collection
				and helps to recognise patterns and structures, but it stands in contrast to the
				individual viewing of objects: <quote rend="inline">At the same time, distance views, due to their
					quantitative methods, are visually more abstract and more detrimental</quote> <ptr target="#dork2020" loc="120"/>.</p>
			<p>Using toggling, the individual <term>hotspot</term> images were
				displayed by the machine learning algorithm as representative of a cluster in
				the visualisation and qualitatively indexed with terms. The twenty
				algorithmically evaluated <term>hotspots</term> were thus given a name
				according to human classification and interpretation of the image object. The
				qualitative naming of these <term>hotspots</term> served us as a first
				step to get to know the image objects and to be able to name them descriptively.
				It was done intuitively, but it was done iteratively by three different people.
				This is because the indexing partly demanded a uniform and general naming of the
				picture subjects or motifs (e.g., CO2 emission, polar bear, glacier), since
				these occurred repeatedly in the intercultural country queries.</p>

			<head>8 â€“ Cluster versus image group</head>
			<p>In the designation of the <term>hotspots</term> and their technical
				image clusters, methodological differences between quantitative and qualitative
				clustering emerged that had to be considered for the further course of the
				qualitative image analysis: </p>
			<list><item>a) <term>Hotspot</term> images detected by the algorithm did not
				correspond to any or only a very marginal cluster in the sense of an image group
				according to qualitative assessment. </item></list>
			<p>Methodologically, the question arose with regard to the t-SNE algorithm as to how
				the computer technically defines a cluster and thus also detects the <emph>hotspot</emph> image. As the hotspot image of Greta Thunberg
				from the Brazilian t-SNE visualisation, which occurred twice, showed, it was an
				image that qualitatively did not take on any status as an image group. Rather,
				the portrait of Greta Thunberg seemed to exhibit a high similarity factor
				precisely in its duplicity.</p>

					</figure>
					
		
			<list><item>b) At the same time, the problem arose that some images, which qualitatively
				showed a high motivic similarity and evidence, were not detected as a <term>hotspot</term> by the algorithm. For example, the algorithm
				identified images of the Earth as a colour contrasting globe within the t-SNE
				visualisation of the <term>locale</term> Bangladesh as an <term>hotspot</term> image, while the same motif was merely a section
				of the general cluster of Earths within the t-SNE-visualisation of the Brazil
					<term>locale</term>. </item></list>

					</figure>
					
					
		
			<p>Accordingly, it can be stated that the determination of a t-SNE cluster
				technically does not necessarily result from a high number of images, but due to
				a high similarity rate of sometimes only two images. </p>
			<p>The German translation of the word cluster as accumulation or group therefore does
				not find its fundamental meaning technically. We therefore used the word cluster
				as a technical term in the sense of the t-SNE clustering algorithm, the word
				image group as a qualitative determination of dominant motifs in their
				frequency. Thesis-wise, it can be stated on a technical level that the higher
				the similarity factor of the images, the more likely it is a technical cluster
				with a <term>hotspot</term>. The higher the similarity value, the
				closer the images tend to be to each other and the stronger the separation of
				the cluster from the rest of the image swarm. On the level of human perception,
				it can be stated that the higher the frequency of motifs with a common
				similarity criterion, the more likely it is to be an image group. </p></div>
				<div>
			<head>9 â€“ Screenshot tableau</head>
			<p>The distribution of denotatively determined main image content manifests itself
				through observable variation among <term>locales</term>. We
				qualitatively created a screenshot tableau that sorted and contrasted the
				concise and central image clusters or groups of main motifs per <term>locale</term>. Methodologically, the systematic comparison of
				the 90 screenshot clusters was a quantitative process within the qualitative
				image analysis. As a procedure, the tableau in the form of a tiled overview
				allowed us to determine size distributions, commonalities, and differences among
				the clustered climate images.</p>

			<p>The determination of the group sizes only took place in the form of tendencies.
				The formation of the images according to iconographic similarity criteria is
				partially interrupted by the algorithm due to formal-technical structural
				differences. For example, the photographs of artificially created contrast
				representations diverged strongly in the visualisation of the Google images
				according to the U.S. American <emph>locale</emph>. While from a
				semiotic and iconographic perspective the green-orange contrast represents the
				symbolic and evidential similarity feature for the dichotomy of healthy versus
				dystopian climate futures, the algorithm separates this into two image clusters
				distant from each other by structural image properties (structure of the tree
				versus that of the landscape).</p>

				<head>Conclusion</head>
	
			<p>In the previous critical description of our pipeline, the qualitative inscription
				and strong influence of the technical method of machine learning by us as image
				researchers and due to 'external' software became clear. In contrast, the
				qualitative view of the evaluation regarding the location of image groups was
				strongly influenced by quantitative measurement and counting methods, such as in
				the creation of the screenshot table. Becoming aware of this difficulty of
				insight and technical complexity through the juxtaposition of different
				algorithms is an essential building block in this form of mixed-method and thus
				DH research. It is a circumstance that we will call <term
					>more-than-distant viewing</term> for our study, building on Franco Moretti's
				(<ref target="#moretti2000">2000</ref>) concept of distant reading and following Johanna Drucker's (<ref target="#drucker2017">2017</ref>)
				countering approach of <quote rend="inline">distant reading isn't.</quote> </p>
				<div>
			<head>Discussion of the methods: potentials and limits</head>
			<p>While our automated image analysis described here is based on machine learning,
				the algorithms are based on a lengthy and highly qualitative interpretation and
				decision-making process. Thus, it became clear to us how our methodological
				approach and use of Google as an access point to the universe of climate imagery
				revealed more about current imagery occurrence in Google and how machine
				learning algorithms can be made applicable to our topic, namely culturally
				distinct climate imagery communication. The many preconceived technical
				standards and qualitative inscriptions inherent in any computational process
				became conspicuous at different levels and had a drastic effect on the entire
				research process, including qualitative image analysis. We conclude with citing
				four examples that illustrate this shift:</p>
			<p>The basic parameterisation as a first step, for example, fundamentally shifted our
				research question. In our example, the initially content-driven research
				question about the globalisation of the visual language of climate change became
				a formal description problem of how intercultural image communication can be
				made measurable in itself. Such research then describes not so much the actual
				object of research as the constraints and dynamics through abstraction for a
				numerical logic. This statistical description and reductionist ordering of the
				research object is the conceptual foundation for the so-called digital methods
				in general, because every computer-based process needs the concrete distinction
				and knows no spaces in between.</p>
			<p>In a second step, we had to curate our image corpus of a global climate
				communication. We are interested in mainstream image communication in cultural
				spaces and, therefore, deliberately decided on the largest possible, extensively
				used and highly formalized image space â€“ Google Image Search. The so-called <title
					rend="italic">PageRank</title> algorithm that orders the search results via
				Google Images was responsible for the type and diversity of climate images that
				we analysed. It is known that around 200 factors <ptr target="#searchengineland2010"/> are
				influencing this algorithm, while some are known the most relevant are kept well
				hidden. This is why such a technical framework is often referred to as a <term>black box</term>. Ultimately, this means that we do not know
				the intrinsic ideas and models of the algorithms used and intentionally
				reproduce them. In the end, what we ultimately analysed was not a neutral
				perspective on climate communication, but the one shaped by google engineers.
				One open challenge, therefore, is how to deal with the obvious but undetectable
				biases of machine learning as a service applications.</p>
			<p>Another challenge was the choice of algorithms for automated image analysis. We
				decided to use machine learning algorithms for similarity comparison due to the
				amount of climate images collected. This proved an important decision on several
				levels: On the one hand, the productivity and the pure image volume that can be
				processed were greatly expanded by automating the image analysis, as expected.
				On the other hand, the calibration (<term>training</term>) and data
				requirements of such machine learning algorithms are very expensive in
				acquisition and maintenance, and thus far exceeded the resources of our project.
				Therefore, we decided to use a pre-trained neural network called Inception v3 by
				Google, which was trained based on the ImageNet dataset. The concrete
				implications for the study are that the computed similarity between images is
				not based on a dataset explicitly designed for the climate imagery corpus, but
				is searched using a very generalist image corpus tagged with unknown motifs and
				models. In addition, the machine learning architecture makes it not impossible,
				but very difficult, to trace in detail the basis on which similarity relations
				between images were found. We know that such algorithms develop a structural
				view. We can thus deduce approaches, but not understand them in their
				entirety.</p>
			<p>Finally, the choice of dimension reduction had a decisive impact on the
				qualitative reading of the visualisation. It decided on the definition of the
					<term>hotspots</term> as well as the image clusters and,
				connected to this, their reception in terms of content. The process of
				qualitative perception and interpretation of the various image clusters or
				groups turned out to be a challenging moment within the pipeline. In order to be
				able to make content-related statements about Google's intercultural climate
				image occurrence, it was necessary to permanently switch between distance view
				and close view. Thus, a purely quantitative reading suggested by the t-SNE
				technology and its visualisation could not be fulfilled. The quantitative
				influence that the automated image analysis had on the qualitative image
				analysis was unambiguous. For example, the indexing of the <term
					>hotspot</term> images manifested itself in a counting of recurring similar
				terms and their comparison among the <term>locales</term>. In
				addition, the creation of the screenshot table finally provided a measurement
				method to decompose the t-SNEs into comparable components, to design order
				tableaus, and to be able to make cross-cultural statements about climate image
				occurrence.</p>
			<p>Through the examples summarised, it is clear that our approach evolved over the
				course of the study into <term>more than distant viewing</term> that
				profoundly changed the epistemic practice of image analysis. Here, the
				methodological combination of automated image analysis and qualitative reading
				of data visualisation manifests itself as a challenging yet productive method
				for examining large image datasets. The combination of machine learning and
				visualization offers an alternative to graph-based layout methods and an
				alternative to purely keyword-based image research, where clusters emerge via
				language alone. The approach helps in the search for framings and the
				exploration of images themselves. Ultimately, the following questions stood at
				the end:</p>
			<p>Why are Google image search results so clichÃ©d in the case of climate change? At
				the level of how climate change image searches differ in different regions and
				language areas, the following points need to be discussed further: Climate
				communication using images seems to be fairly standardised around the world. It
				was striking how many similar and identical images Google displays in each
				location. Each location has similar clusters such as polar bears, polar regions,
				or people at conferences.</p>
			<p>When we look at a t-SNE visualisation, the question is: How do these images
				cluster? There is no automated method for detecting the clusters. We had no
				comprehensible criterion for the <term>hotspots</term> or for
				measuring the similarity of the images as what we eventually interpreted
				visually. Discrepancies between the qualitative determination of a group of
				images and the technical detection of the clusters by the algorithm became
				apparent. Similarity in the technical sense in the form of the <term
					>hotspots</term> does not guarantee the determination of a high number of
				related images. As we have seen, the term clustering as a hinge term between
				methodological approaches can even be confusing. Thus, it is better to
				understand <term>hotspots</term> as technical catch images instead of
				(qualitative) image groups. Regarding the t-SNE approach, we can recommend to
				mention the language use explicitly to be fair to the concepts of the different
				disciplines. </p>
			<p>To what extent do human and automatic image recognition differ in image sorting?
				At first glance, it can be stated that humans tend to sort images according to
				motifs, while algorithms sort images according to structure. This became
				particularly clear in the form of a workshop in which we as a research team
				developed a section of the Google image corpus' on the German <term
					>locale </term>(550 images) as photographs and sorted them by hand. The
				sorting was intuitive and based on themes and motifs. In doing so, unlike the
				t-SNE algorithm in physical space, we did not set distances between image
				groups, since we did not know at the outset how many images would belong to each
				image group and since the size of the floor was limited. The efficiency of the
				technology to manage huge amounts of images was clearly felt here. The colour
				distribution of the manually created t-SNEs was a result of the image themes,
				while the algorithm sometimes blew up content-related image correlations due to
				different colour patterns. It nevertheless came out surprisingly that the human
				image selection converged with that of the t-SNE in terms of clustering the
				dominant image groups (drought/dry soil, heat/fire, earths, CO2- refineries,
				maps, cartoons, etc.). This is significant because the process of creating t-SNE
				visualisations from the source images does not extract semantic information from
				the dataset.</p>

				</div>
				<div>
			<head>Outlook</head>
			<p>In conclusion, further research and in-depth arguments are needed to understand
				the full implications and scope of the use of automated image recognition in
				order to make a sound argument about the methods described. For example, Google
				image ranking and the logic of the PageRank algorithm, i.e., the images Google
				ranks on websites, need to be examined: Where exactly does the image corpus come
				from? Who supplies the images to be found? Are there some globally ubiquitous
				sources? Working with machine learning in the context of the Digital Humanities
				also needs to be questioned, especially on an infrastructural level. This is
				because working with datasets depends on software companies. There are few and
				large tech companies able to offer their pre-trained algorithms (often free and
				freely available). Reflection on the worldviews and values inscribed in them
				must not give way to strong fascination with technical productivity. In general,
				considering the qualitative moments in automation and the quantitative aspects
				in analysis according to our model of 'more than distant viewing' is an
				elaborate and laborious investment, but ultimately rewarding for the research
				process.</p></div></div>
