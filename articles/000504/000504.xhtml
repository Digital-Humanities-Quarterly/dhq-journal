                  <p>Studying collaboration in music is a prominent area of research in fields such as
                     cultural studies, history, and musicology. For scholars interested in studying
                     collaboration, network analysis has proven to be a viable methodological approach.
                     Yet, a
                     challenge is that heterogeneous data makes it difficult to study collaboration networks
                     across music genres, which means that there are almost only studies on individual
                     genres.
                     To solve this problem, we propose a generalizable approach to studying the topological
                     properties of music collaboration networks within and between genres that relies on
                     data
                     from the freely available Discogs database. To illustrate the approach, we provide
                     a
                     comparison of the genres Jazz and Hip Hop.

                  <div class="ptext" id="p1">The enormous increase in machine-readable data has been one of the main drivers of
                     the
                     digital humanities in recent years. This new data enables new, computer-aided approaches
                     [<a class="ref" href="#jockers2013">Jockers 2013</a>, 4], both from an exploratory and an empirical
                     perspective. So far, the focus of digitization has been mainly on textual sources.
                     Still,
                     as more and more musical data is becoming available in digital form, we are witnessing
                     an
                     increase in music information retrieval applications [<a class="ref" href="#burgoyne2016">Burgoyne et al. 2016</a>] within
                     the digital humanities. Work in this area is rather heterogeneous, but may be divided
                     into
                     two main branches: (1) 'sound and audio studies', where music is processed and analyzed
                     as
                     an actual audio signal, and (2) 'symbolic music studies', where music is analyzed
                     from a
                     more formalized perspective, as it is written down in some kind of notation system.
                     Typically, the latter branch is dedicated to questions such as digitization of analog
                     music scores (optical music recognition), music representation formats (MusicXML,
                     MEI,
                     etc.), and the quantitative analysis of musical features (e.g., melodic similarity).
                     As
                     symbolic music collections are widely available, this branch of music studies seems
                     to be
                     particularly well suited for quantitative analyses. One specific subcategory of symbolic
                     music is music metadata, which comes in many shapes and sizes, for instance, in the
                     form
                     of audio features (danceability, energy, etc.) via the Spotify API<a class="noteRef" href="#d4e211">[1]</a> or as
                     metadata about artists, genres, etc. (<a href="https://www.last.fm/" onclick="window.open('https://www.last.fm/'); return false" class="ref">Last.fm</a>).

                  <div class="ptext" id="p2">In this work, we propose the use of the Discogs database to study patterns and strategies
                     of music collaboration. The larger theme that motivates this research is the importance
                     of
                     collaborative contexts for problem-solving, creativity, and innovation in general
                     [<a class="ref" href="#mertl2008">Mertl et al. 2008</a>], the latter two of which are particularly important in the field
                     of music production. Teitelbaum et al. [<a class="ref" href="#teitelbaum2008">Teitelbaum et al. 2008</a>] note that “music is one of the richest sources of interaction between
                     individuals”, i.e., music collaboration between artists is a common social
                     phenomenon. However, the concrete strategies of collaboration, such as the role of
                     particular artists as hubs and the formation of communities, may vary widely between
                     genres. This is illustrated by a large body of existing studies on music collaboration

                  <div class="ptext" id="p3">Typical research questions that are investigated in the above studies are, for instance,
                     the analysis of structural properties of collaboration networks (e.g., small worlds)
                     [<a class="ref" href="#park2007">Park et al. 2007</a>]
                     [<a class="ref" href="#teitelbaum2008">Teitelbaum et al. 2008</a>] or the study of local scenes / regional communities in the
                     respective genres [<a class="ref" href="#hammou2014">Hammou 2014</a>]
                     [<a class="ref" href="#makkonen2017">Makkonen 2017</a>]. The methods used in these studies are very diverse, as they
                     include qualitative approaches (i.e., interviews) as well as quantitative approaches.
                     When
                     it comes to quantitative approaches, the predominant method is network analysis, which
                     is
                     well known in many related fields of application. Examples include analyzing collaboration
                     between Hollywood actors [<a class="ref" href="#amaral2000">Amaral et al. 2000</a>]
                     [<a class="ref" href="#zhang2006">Zhang et al. 2006</a>], scientists [<a class="ref" href="#newman2001">Newman 2001</a>], or business alliances
                     [<a class="ref" href="#schilling2007">Schilling and Phelps 2007</a>]. Within the sub-genre of network analyses of music
                     collaboration, we also find a multitude of different datasets used in existing studies.
                     However, most of them only collect small amounts of data, are limited to a single
                     timeframe, genre, or geographic area, and work with diverse understandings of the
                     concept
                     of "collaboration". These differences in methods and data make it very difficult to
                     investigate collaboration strategies between different genres of music on a wider
                     range.
                     With a few exceptions [<a class="ref" href="#seddon2005">Seddon 2005</a>], there are hardly any studies that
                     compare different genres in terms of their cooperation strategies and networks. Yet
                     comparative studies are particularly exciting, as they allow scholars to work out
                     specific
                     topological patterns of different genres and discuss them in relation to artistic
                     characteristics, especially with regard to creativity and innovation.

                  <div class="ptext" id="p4">For this reason, we propose a reusable digital humanities approach for studying
                     topological properties of music collaboration networks within and between genres that
                     may
                     pave the way for further, more comprehensive comparative studies in the field of music
                     cooperation. Since we use metadata from the Discogs database, we have to limit our
                     data
                     set to collaborations between artists that are explicitly documented by a joint release.
                     In this work, we also perform an actual comparison of two genres to illustrate our
                     proposed method. We picked Jazz and Hip Hop for two reasons. The first is the existing
                     scholarship about the two genres, which provides important context for interpreting
                     the
                     results of network analysis. The second is that the two genres are known for sharing
                     a
                     similar approach to collaboration, for single artists are often collaborating in varying
                     constellations. Yet, their collaboration networks are rarely compared. Not only is
                     network
                     analysis a particularly amenable method to studying the style of collaboration that
                     are
                     prominent in Jazz and Hip Hop communities, but the method also provides a way to compare
                     the two genres in new ways.

                        of
                        research in existing work on music collaboration. This can mainly be attributed to
                        the
                        extensive amount of collaboration within this genre. Unlike in other genres, such
                        as
                        Rock, where fixed groups are the most common form of collaboration, Jazz musicians
                        usually play and record in constellations. Real-time Jazz performances themselves

                        highly interactive and collaborative, as musicians typically react to each other and
                        improvise while sticking to a common framework with regard to tempo and harmonics
                        [<a class="ref" href="#macdonald2006">Macdonald and Wilson 2006</a>]. This fluid nature makes Jazz a prime research interest for
                        social network analysis in the music domain, as the resulting networks tend to be
                        rather
                        complex. In the existing related work on Jazz collaborations, researchers use very
                        different types of data, ranging from archival and biographical sources to existing
                        collections of metadata on the genre.

                        connections between those interviewees and 529 other Jazz artists. In more recent

                        source of data when it comes to making connections that actually represent the real
                        world, this approach has two major disadvantages. First, it is difficult to make
                        generalizable statements, since only a very limited number of musicians are considered.
                        Although such data sets may be interesting from a historical perspective, they are
                        not
                        suitable as a basis for empirical statements on the structure of collaboration in
                        Jazz.
                        Second, the actual data acquisition entails a lot of work, as the qualitative data
                        source is not readily available in a structured format.

                        more detailed biographical information for 192 musicians. The data was compiled manually
                        from a variety of sources, such as oral histories, biographies, and several historical
                        books on the Jazz culture of that era. The <em class="emph">Red Hot Jazz Archive</em> was created

                        some of the previously described problems, namely the lack of generalizability and
                        the
                        time-consuming preparation of the dataset. The authors use a two-stage process to
                        examine Jazz collaborations based on this archive. First, they infer a network of
                        individual artists, which are connected if they played in the same band. From there
                        on,
                        they create a network of bands, with two bands being connected if they share at least
                        one member. Studying both networks topologically with respect to degree distributions,
                        clustering, and average nearest neighbor degree, they note two major limitations of
                        their network model: artists may be credited with different spellings or under
                        pseudonyms, and relations between artists are not time-stamped, which makes the analysis
                        of the evolution of networks over time impossible.

                        that
                        Jazz musicians who perform in closed groups are less likely to have a successful career
                        than those who maintain a more open structure of collaborative connections.

                        In other words, Hip Hop was and is a cultural phenomenon with many facets, of which
                        music is only one aspect. According to Smith [<a class="ref" href="#smith2016">Smith 2016</a>], collaboration
                        in Hip Hop is an essential mechanism for interaction and communication of shared

                        vocal part in a song are listed in the metadata of the songs, a connection can be

                     <div class="ptext" id="p17">There are several options available to establish connections between nodes, all
                        different with respect to their weighting, direction, and sparseness. When studying
                        collaboration, the edges are supposed to represent a collaborative process shared
                        between the two connected nodes. With music records being the main available data
                        source
                        to infer these connections, one choice is to establish edges between all artists that
                        appear together on a record. The main advantage of a release-centered approach over
                        alternative methods – such as the definition of an edge between two artists being
                        if
                        they are part of the same band or collective [<a class="ref" href="#gleiser2003">Gleiser and Danon 2003</a>] – is the
                        possibility to assign different weights to the connections. We may well assume that
                        artists who recorded more tracks together have a strong creative influence on each
                        other. Therefore, the network edges are weighted by the number of collaborations.

                     <div class="ptext" id="p18">However, an apparent problem here is that a music release is usually a collection
                        of
                        different tracks, and these tracks are not always recorded with the same set of
                        musicians. Therefore, if only album-wide credits are available, not all of the listed
                        musicians can automatically be assumed to have shared a collaborative process, violating
                        the hypothesized definition of edges. The only person that is connected to all other
                        credited artists with a high probability is the main artists of the release. This
                        problem can be tackled in two different ways: (1) create connections between all
                        credited artists, on at the cost of possibly introducing unwarranted ones; or (2)
                        only
                        create connections between credited artists and the main artist of the album, thus
                        only
                        creating warranted connections at the cost of missing some. Several factors should
                        be
                        considered in this decision: first, it can be theorized that the amount of missed
                        connections in the latter case is higher than the number of unwarranted ones in the
                        former since, for a high proportion of releases, a big subset of credited artists
                        appeared on all tracks of an album. Accordingly, the data/noise trade-off seems
                        favorable when adding all possible connections to the network.

                     <div class="ptext" id="p19">Another relevant factor is the metrics that will be used to derive conclusions from
                        the
                        network data, especially metrics measuring network centrality. The first option would
                        place higher network importance on primary artists, as they would receive a
                        disproportionally high amount of connections. Also, this approach invalidates metrics
                        that operate on notions of transitivity, such as the clustering coefficient, since
                        the
                        transitive edges are explicitly excluded from the dataset if the credited artists
                        are
                        not interconnected. Therefore, we opt to include all possible connections between
                        the
                        artists associated with a release. This is also the most common approach [<a class="ref" href="#gleiser2003">Gleiser and Danon 2003</a>]
                        [<a class="ref" href="#hannibal2015">Hannibal 2015</a>]
                        [<a class="ref" href="#smith2006">Smith 2006</a>]. Since no information can be derived about the direction of
                        collaborative influence from simple co-appearance on tracks, the network can be assumed
                        to be undirected. However, to incorporate relevant information about the concrete
                        role
                        each musician has played on a record (i.e., instruments, vocals, producing roles,
                        etc.),
                        we relied on two parallel directed edges (see <a href="#figure01">Figure 1</a>).
                        These connections can be interpreted as “<em class="emph">x</em> played with
                        <em class="emph">y</em> in role <em class="emph">a</em>” and as a parallel edge “<em class="emph">y</em> played with <em class="emph">x</em> in role
                        <em class="emph">b</em>”, where <em class="emph">x</em> and <em class="emph">y</em> are two connected
                        musicians, and <em class="emph">a</em> and <em class="emph">b</em> are instruments or other musical roles.
                        This information about the specific roles of musicians on a record can later be used
                        to
                        filter the data and create tailored sub-networks that – for instance – might only
                        include edges representing piano players or producers. Besides the option to select
                        specific nodes in the data set via their role annotations, we treat these directed
                        parallel edges as a single undirected edge when we apply our network metrics (see
                        next
                        section) for the analysis of music collaborations.

                           of
                           developing connections, hence boosting their degree. Similarly, preferential
                           attachment means that establishing links reinforce a positive bias toward the
                           connected nodes, as a node of high degree (also called "hub") seems to be more
                           attractive to establish connections with, in turn, attracting more future connections

                           structure by further specifying for which nodes the correlation occurs, as the ANND
                           is
                           a function of <em class="emph">k</em>. Furthermore, Pearson's degree correlation has been shown
                           to depend on the size of the network, an issue that the average neighbor degree does
                           not face [<a class="ref" href="#yao2017">Yao et al. 2017</a>]. As we deal with large networks, we compute the
                           average neighbor degree in addition to the degree correlation to complement the
                           interpretation of the assortative properties of music collaboration given by the
                           degree correlation.

                           complete the nodes in a network are connected to each other. This notion of
                           completeness is based on the idea of triangles forming in the neighborhood of a node:
                           when two nodes in the neighborhood are in turn connected to each other, the network
                           is
                           more tightly knit. The local clustering of a node is thus given by the ratio of
                           triangles that exist to all possible triangles in its neighborhood. The mean local
                           clustering coefficient is then defined as the mean of all local clustering
                           coefficients. Applied to the collaborative nature of our network, a higher clustering
                           coefficient would indicate that musicians that share a common collaborator are likely
                           to collaborate with each other too, facilitating the exchange of creative ideas
                           throughout the genre.

                        <div class="ptext" id="p29">A network's transitivity score, also called global clustering coefficient, is another
                           metric describing the connectedness of the network [<a class="ref" href="#newman2010">Newman 2010</a>]. In
                           contrast to the local clustering coefficient, it characterizes the whole network by
                           applying the notion of complete triangles vs. possible triangles to all edges in the
                           graph on a global, instead of a local level. Similar to the mean local clustering
                           coefficient, this metric provides insight into the transitive properties of the
                           network. In our case, such a transitive relation can be expressed as "if musician
                           A
                           recorded together with musician B, and musician B with musician C, chances are high
                           that A and C also recorded music together". The transitivity scores in social networks
                           tend to be rather high [<a class="ref" href="#newman2010">Newman 2010</a>], especially in collaborative
                           networks: for music, in particular, Smith gives a value of <em class="emph">C</em> = 0.18; in
                           other applications such as a network of film actor collaborations, we have similar
                           values: <em class="emph">C</em> = 0.20 [<a class="ref" href="#newman2003">Newman 2003</a>]. For our formalization of a
                           network, these scores (and also the local clustering coefficients) are expected to
                           be
                           even higher. Since we add a fully connected subgraph for each music record (which
                           in
                           itself has a transitivity score of 1), and if the number of artists on a given record
                           is high, the transitivity score of the whole network is boosted in turn.

                        degree of 28.27 connections per musician, is considerably denser compared to the Linked
                        Jazz network. This disparity could be explained by the fact that Gleiser and Danon's
                        network is generated from biographical information from the years 1895 to 1929. During
                        this time, Jazz is characterized by larger collectives of musicians, as it coincides
                        with the musical styles of New Orleans Jazz, Dixieland Jazz, and Chicago Jazz. In
                        modern
                        Jazz, a larger variety of group sizes is found, with an inclination towards solo artists
                        and trios [<a class="ref" href="#gioia1998">Gioia 1998</a>]. Consequently, a node in the network of Gleiser and
                        Danon is more likely to have more connections, as the band size at the time was
                        comparatively large, introducing a higher number of connections. Deriving data from
                        oral
                        recollections further facilitates that the network consists of one large coherent
                        component. If, in contrast, the network was based on music releases, smaller clusters
                        only representing one album would appear that are not connected to the main network
                        in
                        any way. As a matter of fact, the Discogs Jazz network spans 1,100 separate components,
                        ranging from 1 to 35,128 musicians in size. 75% of these components have a maximum
                        of 6
                        nodes. Yet, 87% of musicians are included in the largest component.

                        musicians with only a few direct connections to other musicians, while nodes with
                        a
                        higher number of connections are increasingly rare. In fact, over 75% of nodes have
                        a
                        degree smaller than the mean. The resulting distribution therefore resembles a power-law

                        scale-free networks, such outliers commonly occur and the degree distribution in <a href="#figure02">Figure 2</a> is very similar to a power-law distribution for
                        degrees greater than approximately 10. Consequently, we can classify the Jazz
                        collaboration network as a scale-free network. Previous work did not calculate a scaling
                        exponent for their networks; hence no comparison can be given in that regard.

                        that musicians tend to collaborate with other artists who have a similar degree.
                        Possible reasons for this correlation effect become apparent in <a href="#figure03">Figure 3</a>, which plots ANND by degree and indicates the general trend with a

                        most of the correlation effect can be attributed to the mentioned small components

                        network, can be found, but smaller, separate groups of artists play a significant
                        role
                        too. A large number of musicians only appear in a fixed set, forming their own network
                        components, bearing no connection to the rest of the artists. However, since most
                        nodes
                        are included in the largest component, the existing interpretation of Jazz as a highly
                        collaborative genre still stands, as expressed by the transitive, closely-knit network
                        structure. As the network is scale-free, it exhibits only a few highly connected hubs.
                        These hubs may be theorized to stand for those artists who have a huge influence on
                        the
                        overall genre.

                        times as many musicians in our network, sharing 1.4 times as many connections. Once
                        again, with 7.07 the average degree is considerably lower in the Discogs data, with
                        an
                        average number of 20.95 neighbors in Smith's network. This could be partly due to
                        the
                        methods used for network inference, as already mentioned for the Jazz networks.
                        Moreover, the granularity of the data could be assumed as a different reason for the
                        Hip
                        Hop genre, since the time frame and general method are similar for both Hip Hop
                        datasets. Smith uses around 30,000 lyrics files to collect the network data, about
                        4.5
                        times more releases than were included in our study. A single song, as opposed to
                        a
                        whole record, usually has fewer people involved. Therefore, the number of involved
                        artists per release is much higher in the Discogs data, but the total number of releases
                        used to infer the network is lower. These numbers facilitate a higher ratio of edges
                        to
                        nodes, in turn explaining the divergence in average degrees.

                        work. Both the average local clustering degree and the global clustering coefficient
                        are
                        much higher in the Discogs network than in Smith's analyses. Following the same line
                        of
                        reasoning as for the Jazz network, some of these observations may be attributed to
                        the
                        overall large number of components included in our network. In total, 3,076 components
                        are present, ranging from 1 to 11,285 in size. Half the network is included in the
                        largest component, while 75% of components consist of four nodes or less. <a href="#figure05">Figure 5</a> shows the degree distribution for the Hip Hop
                        network, with the majority of nodes showing a rather low degree, quickly decaying
                        for
                        fewer nodes with higher degrees. More concretely, the distribution indicates that

                        out of four artists have only collaborated with eight people or less.

                        difference in our data can mostly be attributed to the network creation approach:
                        as the
                        Discogs network presumably is more sparse with regard to connections (as indicated

                        Ultimately, both values lead to the same conclusion, which is to classify the
                        collaboration structure of Hip Hop as being scale-free. The high number of disconnected
                        components in the network, in conjunction with the diameter of these local sub-networks
                        being small, gives a possible explanation for the high degree correlation of ρ =

                        networks, which can be assumed for the case of Hip Hop collaboration.

                     <div class="ptext" id="p51">Jazz is typically characterized as a highly dynamic and versatile genre. Especially
                        the
                        Jazz community of the 1940s and 1950s is shaped by constant upheavals and change,
                        not
                        only concerning the musical style itself but above all, the constellations of musicians
                        in this time seemed to be in constant flux. Unlike in current Pop or Rock bands, it
                        is
                        rather atypical in Jazz to play in the same constellation of musicians for a longer
                        period of time. Instead, many musicians belong to several formations simultaneously
                        [<a class="ref" href="#hinton1988">Hinton et al. 1988</a>, 244 ff.]. This tendency is well reflected in the
                        collaboration networks. In comparison to the Discogs Hip Hop network, the average
                        Jazz
                        musician has more than four times more connections than a Hip Hop artist. The data
                        shows
                        that collaborations in Jazz are more frequent and involve more people than collaboration
                        in Hip Hop. The Hip Hop community is more compartmentalized than the Jazz community,
                        with only 50% of the artists being included in the main component, and 75% in Jazz,
                        respectively.

                     <div class="ptext" id="p52">After all, we can observe that Jazz musicians in the course of their career tend to
                        collaborate with more different musicians than hip hop artists do. A similar picture
                        emerges with regard to the clustering coefficient: While the Discogs Hip Hop network
                        exhibits a total global clustering coefficient of 0.63, the Jazz network is only half
                        as
                        transitive. Thus, while the Jazz network as a whole seems to be highly connected,
                        in Hip
                        Hop, we see a tendency towards the development of smaller, though very closely connected
                        groups. The degree correlation also shows that there seems to be a higher tendency
                        of
                        two actors with similar degrees to work together on a project in the Hip Hop network,
                        which appears to be less the case in Jazz.

                        networks. A complete visualization of the two networks is not possible due to their
                        size. Instead, we opted to show the neighborhood of important hubs in each network.
                        For
                        Hip Hop, we chose <em class="emph">Tupac Shakur (2Pac)</em> and <em class="emph">Biggie Smalls</em>

                           Fitzgerald.</em> The visualizations illustrate the differences described before: a
                        musician in Jazz is connected with many more other artists than is the case in Hip
                        Hop,
                        Jazz is less transitive, and the other nodes a hub connects to vary more in degree.
                        Also, in Jazz, most nodes are in one large interconnected component, with smaller
                        groups
                        in the periphery, while in Hip Hop, we find smaller, tightly knit clusters.

                  <div class="ptext" id="p54">The study of collaboration patterns in music is a lively branch of musicological,
                     sociological, and historical research. However, most existing research is based on
                     very
                     heterogeneous data collections, making it hard to compare different results to each
                     other.
                     Furthermore, the lack of a common collection of data and of a shared definition of
                     collaboration makes it almost impossible to compare different genres. Accordingly,
                     existing research on music collaboration is mainly focused on singular genre analyses,
                     with Jazz being the most studied genre by far. To support future inter-genre comparisons,
                     we propose an approach that makes use of the freely available, ever-growing metadata
                     collection Discogs. We further suggest deriving collaborations between musicians by
                     extracting information of shared music releases from Discogs. Whenever two musicians
                     played together on a record, we treat this as an instance of collaboration. We are
                     well
                     aware that this particular view on music collaboration comes with some conceptual
                     limitations, as collaboration might also take place by means of unrecorded live gigs
                     or
                     private jam sessions. Yet, this approach to modeling collaboration can be scaled-up
                     very
                     easily, allowing us to obtain networks that are much more comprehensive in size than
                     any
                     of the data sets of comparable existing studies. These networks further include a
                     rich set
                     of additional metadata, for instance the time and role of each collaborative connection.
                     Furthermore, the data source does not suffer from noisy data, as unique identifiers
                     for
                     artists are used in Discogs to map different spellings and pseudonyms to the same
                     node.

                  <div class="counter"><a href="#p55">55</a></div>
                  <div class="ptext" id="p55">To illustrate the potential of the suggested approach, we also present a case study
                     in
                     the inter-genre comparison of Jazz and Hip Hop, applying a variety of metrics commonly
                     used to describe topological properties in collaborative networks. In contrast to
                     previous
                     work on music collaboration, we were able to demonstrate the influence of smaller
                     artist
                     groups and lesser known musicians. Accordingly, we were able to get some novel insights
                     in
                     this direction, as the collaboration networks seem to consist of many more components
                     than
                     previously assumed. This difference accounts for most of the divergence of metrics
                     when
                     comparing our results to those of previous music collaboration studies. The Discogs
                     data
                     suggests that the networks at hand are scale-free, (although with a very low scaling
                     exponent). In other words, very few artists are very well connected to a lot of other
                     artists, while most of the artists only have very few relations to other artists.
                     The
                     collaboration patterns of the two investigated genres mainly differ in group size,
                     number
                     of collaborations per artist, and overall density of the network. In Jazz, collaboration
                     is more frequent, takes place with more people at a time, and with a greater variety
                     of
                     people overall than in Hip Hop in formal recordings.

                  <div class="ptext" id="p56">Future work could provide a more detailed insight into collaboration patterns, e.g.,
                     by
                     interrelating network position (i.e., centrality) with popularity metrics from other
                     sources, as shown in Smith [<a class="ref" href="#smith2006">Smith 2006</a>]. Another possibility would be the
                     inclusion of a more in-depth analysis of the formed cliques using the Girvan-Newman
                     method
                     of betweenness centrality [<a class="ref" href="#girvan2002">Girvan and Newman 2002</a>], as previously employed by Gleiser
                     and Danon [<a class="ref" href="#gleiser2003">Gleiser and Danon 2003</a>]. Other future directions might point toward the
                     exploration of the scale-free properties of the networks in more detail. Central questions
                     here are whether the length of a music career or the overall degree is a reliable
                     indicator for success. Providing an interactive exploration interface similar to Filippova
                     et al. [<a class="ref" href="#filipova2012">Filipova et al. 2012</a>] could further enhance the usefulness of our approach
                     for future research, as it allows researchers from all backgrounds to gain insight
                     into
                     the collaborative patterns. An example of such an application based on Discogs data
                     is the

                  <div class="ptext" id="p57">Finally, the network data itself could be enhanced in several ways, for instance,
                     by
                     adding more releases (also from lower quality levels) in order to further increase
                     the
                     network size. Metadata about sub-genres of a release would be a valuable addition
                     for
                     historical network analysis, since the evolution of those sub-genres and the musicians
                     associated with them could be studied in more detail. Enhancing the networks to records
                     that are listed with more than one genre would provide the grounds to facilitate research
                     in inter-genre collaborations. On the whole, we hope that the approach described in
                     this
                     article will initiate many further, more detailed studies that will examine collaboration
                     strategies and patterns between artists of different genres, thus adding to the emerging
                     field of computational musicology as part of the digital humanities.
