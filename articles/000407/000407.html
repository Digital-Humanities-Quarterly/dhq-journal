                  <p>The use of new technologies, media and computational methods in Humanities may
                     evolve and indeed it is already changing the “contents” and
                     “forms” of contemporary education, opening new scenarios
                     previously unimaginable. Nowadays Visual Mobile Devices, smartphones, tablets,
                     etc, contribute to a range of computer-mediated activities, which are related to
                     specific locations and times. But for such critical reflection, we need a closer
                     look to deeper layers of our culture to unveil the characteristics of new
                     technologies and devices. This paper describes some emerging aspects of the
                     teaching use of visual communication techniques in primary and secondary
                     schooling. In particular it reviews the evidence of the efficiency of visual
                     communication for learning both in varied curriculum disciplines and of
                     transversal socio-ethical affective skills necessary for the promotion of health
                     and the construction of a planetary citizenship. The paper illuminates the
                     didactic applicability and unique potential of images for the epistemological
                     peculiarities of different disciplines, highlighting how educational use of
                     images in creative pedagogy can be more focused given the function they perform
                     in the more general cognitive process of individuals. The theoretical analysis
                     of the teaching validity of the use of visual communication, as reported in the
                     international literature, seems to receive confirmation from a case study, which
                     provides detailed analyses of how this technique can enhance specific projects
                     and demonstrates its significance for wider practitioners.

                  <div class="ptext" id="p1">In the last decade societies have witnessed the sudden and widespread
                     introduction of new technologies, all of which involve sophisticated and complex
                     processes of communication. This phenomenon has been described as a digital
                     revolution that, on a daily basis, transforms contemporary life. However, the
                     increasing spread of technologies for managing information and communication in
                     effect runs parallel to the changing learning needs and learning modes of
                     individuals. This in effect has resulted in the need to plan and organize new,
                     more flexible and responsive pedagogical approaches <span class="error"><a class="ref" href="#gallelli2011">#gallelli2011</a></span>. We live in a society increasingly dominated by communication via
                     images. In recent years, new information technologies have significantly
                     expanded the possibilities for representing information. The Internet
                     facilitates speedier access to and downloading of images, as well as their
                     manipulation and reuse. It makes great use of visual and multimedia formats in
                     all areas, particularly that of education. Ease of production and consumption,
                     however, does not always lead to educationally conscious and/or indeed moral or
                     ethical use of images. Innovations produced in the Internet era, and the impact
                     of the World Wide Web on science, commerce and entertainment, are certainly
                     evident for all to see. Less understood are the long-term effects of the digital
                     era on humanity and indeed how it inexorably changes human life. It will take
                     many years, in fact, to fully understand how these changes affect the human
                     cognition <span class="error"><a class="ref" href="#veen2006">#veen2006</a></span> or indeed to understand the changes
                     occurring in the relations between individuals <span class="error"><a class="ref" href="#burgess2009">#burgess2009</a></span>.
                     Despite these problems, in the last two decades, studies that investigate the
                     relationship between image use and learning have increased and this led to the
                     development of an initial survey of the “state of the art”
                     that can help practitioners to be more aware of the function that image
                     consumption performs in the more general cognitive process of individuals. The
                     desire to help practitioners to be more aware of the real potential that visual
                     communication offers as learning support drove this project. When an image is
                     used to promote learning, it is necessary to consider whether and how it will
                     become functional in the general cognitive process of students. It is also
                     important to consider whether it is even possible to assess its impact and
                     usefulness. In-depth analysis of the existing literature on the evidence of
                     effectiveness of visual communication on human learning is an important first
                     step in developing understanding of the degree of functionality of image usage
                     and should also serve to inform guiding principles for the education of
                     practitioners, so as to prompt more effective and educationally aware choices.

                  <div class="ptext" id="p2">There are clearly myriad variety in image types, and Calvani advocates that a
                     first distinction can be made between static and dynamic images and the degree
                     of realism they contain. Calvani differentiated between realism, realism adapted
                     and symbolization <span class="error"><a class="ref" href="#calvani2011">#calvani2011</a></span>. Initially it may appear easy to
                     distinguish static and dynamic figures if one refers to the surface
                     characteristics of the image itself, i.e. how it is done. However, if one
                     transfers the discourse to a more cognitive (even philosophical) plane, one
                     might argue that there is dynamism even in stillness. In fact, in many
                     physically static diagrams there can exist a dynamic plane, because cognitively
                     they may indicate the occurrence of an action, and the representation of a
                     graphical model encourages the onlooker to think laterally toward some changes
                     <span class="error"><a class="ref" href="#calvani2011">#calvani2011</a></span>
                     <span class="error"><a class="ref" href="#paoletti2011">#paoletti2011</a></span>. For example <a href="#figure01">figure
                        1</a> represents a physically static diagram: the water cycle. However,
                     note what the arrows represent; they encourage the onlooker to think of the
                     changes taking place and therefore imply an intellectual dynamism.

                  <div class="ptext" id="p3">Bearing in mind that the idea of reproduction of an objective reality is rather
                     naïve, one can still explore the concept of “realism” when referring to
                     representations that maintain a direct and explicit connection with the object
                     represented. This realism category includes artifacts such as photographs,
                     imitative drawings, maps, video sequences in real time, which have not been
                     manipulated in any form. Educationally relevant cognitive operations that are
                     associated with the use of these types of images are those such as object
                     recognition, comparison, classification, spatial orientation, discovery of the
                     types of views experienced and measurement. Calvani’s second category is defined
                     as “adapted realism”. In adapted realism, an alteration is intentionally
                     sought for specific purposes; it maintains a discreet relationship with the
                     original image (concrete referent) and is still recognizable, but there are
                     specific amendments in order to further understanding. This category usually has
                     an educational motivation. In this case selected operations are performed on the
                     image such as highlighting or schematization. This type of endeavour includes
                     the majority of the diagrams in scientific texts that simplify the complexity of
                     an object being represented, or which highlight particular aspects of it.
                     Dynamic representations can include endeavours such as demonstration videos,
                     which have been subjected to mounting, with specific space-time manipulation, in
                     order to highlight and communicate the relationship between elements or between
                     the parts and the whole. The educational functions prompted by these resources
                     are related to the focus of attention on internal aspects and recognition of
                     relationships and internal connections.

                  <div class="ptext" id="p4">In the images shown here (<a href="#figure02">Fig . 2</a>), one can discern
                     a photo and a drawing of the cardiac system. Both represent the same concrete
                     referent, but in design one notes changes or differences to some features of the
                     system, simplifying them and enlarging them. This is done because non-experts,
                     for example, would possibly have difficulty interpreting photos alone.
                     Therefore, to prompt better understanding of the structure and operation of the
                     system that is being viewed the drawing or symbolisation is used. This is the
                     third dimension that Calvani articulated, that of symbolization in the strictest
                     sense. According to the existing literature, symbolism concerns the
                     representation of complex phenomena. The representation adheres to the rules of
                     an entirely conventional code, through the use of lines, arrows, blocks,
                     organized patterns, or data and numbers arranged in specific orders. In this
                     context they include most of the diagrams with which one is familiar,
                     (conceptual maps, flowcharts, etc.). The cognitive functions that connect to
                     this type of images include: symbolizing, correlating, interpreting,
                     hypothesizing, deducing, constructing and testing models and systems <span class="error"><a class="ref" href="#calvani2011">#calvani2011</a></span>. A pie chart, for example, provides immediate
                     quantitative and qualitative information on a phenomenon (<a href="#figure03">Fig . 3</a>) that one subsequently interprets and
                     applies to one’s prior understanding.

                        Coding Theory</cite> that has significantly influenced theories of
                     multimedia learning <span class="error"><a class="ref" href="#paivio1991">#paivio1991</a></span>. Dual Coding Theory argues that
                     there are two different encoding systems for processing and presentation of
                     information: a verbal system that takes care of verbal information and
                     linguistics and a nonverbal system that processes visual information and mental
                     images. When a stimulus, such as a word, is presented audibly, it is encoded by
                     the verbal system that uses the auditory subsystem. Because the word is
                     identified, it is compared with a basic representation unit, called
                     <em class="term">logogen</em>, that is the representation of the word contained in
                     long-term memory. The same type of structure also characterizes the nonverbal
                     system, therefore image is encoded in the visual subsystem and is compared with
                     the <em class="term">imagens</em> units of representation of the images. The
                     <em class="term">logogens</em> and the <em class="term">imagens</em> are related to each
                     other. For example, one can apprehend the mental image of a tree and then
                     describe it with the word tree, or hear the word tree and then form a
                     corresponding mental image. Various studies have shown the effect of superiority
                     of images or figures in remembrance <span class="error"><a class="ref" href="#calvani2011">#calvani2011</a></span>
                     <span class="error"><a class="ref" href="#paivio1991">#paivio1991</a></span>. When asked to recall a list of figures and words,
                     memory is better served by figures. With words, also, those referring to a
                     concrete object are remembered better than abstract ones. This happens,
                     according to Paivio, because the figures are processed by both systems. This
                     awareness may render more efficient designing of formative and learning
                     essentials for students in different age groups.

                  <div class="counter"><a href="#p6">6</a></div>
                  <div class="ptext" id="p6">Theoretical relationships between images and learning have been enhanced by the
                     work of German researcher Wolfgang Schnotz who proposed a model of multimedia
                     learning, noting the role of external representations, i.e. text and figure, and
                     internal, mental models in building a multimedia knowledge <span class="error"><a class="ref" href="#schnotz2001">#schnotz2001</a></span>. External representations can be divided into verbal
                     and descriptive or pictorial representations or visual representations. External
                     ones can be descriptive or pictorial<a class="noteRef" href="#d4e346">[1]</a> solely or
                     exclusively. Internal representations can be both descriptive and pictorial.
                     Mental models<a class="noteRef" href="#d4e349">[2]</a> are in fact verbal
                     representations, because they are descriptions of inner language, but they are
                     also pictorial representations, as a mental model maintains the structural
                     characteristics of the object represented, that is, the object based on a
                     structural or functional analogy. Learning more effectively takes place in an
                     integrated model of such representations. Paoletti also has dealt with this
                     issue explaining that both text and shape can give life to a mental model, but
                     realize it by different routes. The first goes through the reading and
                     understanding of the text and this is the most challenging, because there are
                     several levels to be navigated, firstly the representation of the surface
                     structure of the text, then the representation of the ideas expressed in the
                     text and finally the formation of the mental model. A figure is more immediate
                     and direct; in fact the visual perception passes directly to the mental model.
                     In this case the figure, being an external analog representation, isomorphic to
                     the situation described by the text, can drive the process of elaboration of the
                     text, and so facilitate the construction of a mental model <span class="error"><a class="ref" href="#paoletti2011">#paoletti2011</a></span>. Another theory that has made a great contribution
                     to the understanding of the relationship between images and learning is the
                     Cognitive Load Theory (CLT) by Chandler and Sweller<a class="noteRef" href="#d4e354">[3]</a>. This theory focuses on the concept of cognitive resources available
                     during the execution of a task and how those resources are used and directional
                     during learning <span class="error"><a class="ref" href="#chandler1991">#chandler1991</a></span>. For the Cognitive Load Theory,
                     learning involves the construction of mental schemes and their automation. The
                     schemes are internal representations capable of mediating between the
                     information coming from the environment and knowledge that the subject already
                     possesses. The memory system is the tool that makes this possible link. It is
                     formed of three major subsystems: the sensory memory (MS), the working memory
                     (ML) and the long-term memory (LTM). For the CLT learning can be optimized if
                     the subject efficiently employs its working memory in the construction of mental
                     schemes required by the task.

                  <div class="ptext" id="p7">In this respect, Sweller has developed the concept of cognitive load, which was
                     defined as the load imposed on the working memory from information presented
                     <span class="error"><a class="ref" href="#sweller1988">#sweller1988</a></span>, also understood as the mental effort perceived
                     by the student during learning. The cognitive load can be of three types: alien,
                     inherent and relevant. The extraneous cognitive load is associated with
                     processes that are not directly necessary for learning. That is instead
                     determined by the interaction between the intrinsic nature of the contents to be
                     learned and the student's pre-knowledge while the relevant concerns processes
                     that are directly associated with learning, namely the construction and
                     automation of patterns in the working memory. The theory was first concentrated
                     on the reduction of external loads and later studied the treatment of intrinsic
                     load which must be adapted to the student's needs through simplification
                     operations of the material to be learned. Such material can be considered more
                     or less complex in relation to the differences in the level of experience of the
                     subject and, therefore, the presentation mode should be selected on the basis of
                     pre-knowledge of the student <span class="error"><a class="ref" href="#landriscina2011">#landriscina2011</a></span>.

                  <div class="counter"><a href="#p8">8</a></div>
                  <div class="ptext" id="p8"> One of the most comprehensive theoretical models that try to explain the
                     cognitive dynamics underlying multimedia learning is that proposed by Richard
                     Mayer <span class="error"><a class="ref" href="#mayer2000">#mayer2000</a></span>. The author, taking into account the concept of
                     double-encoding by Paivio and of the concept of cognitive load by Chandler and
                     Sweller, has developed an integrated model. Cognitive theory of multimedia
                     learning is based on three basic assumptions. The first states that visual and
                     auditory information processing takes place through two different channels. The
                     second states that the amount of information we can process in each channel is
                     limited so an undue burden hampers processing. The third basic assumption
                     observes that learning takes place when the subject develops actively the
                     information, i.e. when selecting the relevant information in each channel,
                     organizes them into consistent representations and integrates them with each
                     other and with those already held <span class="error"><a class="ref" href="#mammarella2005">#mammarella2005</a></span>. The cognitive
                     load theory and cognitive theory of multimedia learning have developed some real
                     operational guidelines for multimedia design. In particular the first identified
                     the effects produced on learning on the basis of how texts and figures are put
                     together and on the basis of the characteristics of the user and Mayer advocated
                     a number of fundamental principles to be taken into account in the
                     implementation of products. The first is the principle of multimedia, which adds
                     appropriate figures to a text, making it easier to understand. The second is the
                     spatial and temporal contiguity principle that enhances the closeness between
                     text and illustration. The third is the principle of consistency that highlights
                     negative effects of irrelevant information. The fourth is the modality principle
                     demonstrating the benefit of bimodal presentation (auditory and visual). The
                     fifth is the principle of redundancy that critiques lodged information in many
                     formats, such as: image, text and audio. The sixth and last is the segmentation
                     principle according to which it is better to present the multimedia material in
                     short segments controllable <span class="error"><a class="ref" href="#mayer2000">#mayer2000</a></span>

                  <div class="ptext" id="p9">Sometimes a figure is enough to understand a message, but more often than not the
                     interpretation of a message also requires some text. It is therefore appropriate
                     to examine the relationship of figure-text, which is accomplished through the
                     function that takes place within the text and vice versa. Many authors have
                     ventured into typological classification of the forms of visual communication
                     with different criteria. The authors distinguish between the surface
                     characteristics of an image and its psychological and communicative functions.
                     The surface characteristics affect the appearance of an image and the way in
                     which it was created; communicative functions are for image transmission
                     aspects, i.e. how the image conveys information. Psychological ones, however,
                     relate to the way in which visual elements interact with the human cognitive
                     system and provide useful information in relation to the purposes with which
                     images can be used in teaching. The surface characteristics affect teaching
                     effectiveness only marginally. The communicative functions and psychological
                     ones, instead, make more effective use of the photo from the point of view of
                     learning. According to the taxonomy of Clark and Lyons the communicative
                     functions are: decorative, mnemonic, organizational, relational, representative,
                     transformative and interpretive; while psychological functions are: support for
                     the attention, enabling knowledge, cognitive load minimization, construction of
                     mental models, support for the transfer of learning and support for motivation

                     The first educational workshop of ethical values in Italy project involved 132
                     students in fifth grade curriculum and experienced experts (pedagogues,

                     “G. Bovio” in Ruvo di Puglia (Ba). The premise
                     for the project was based upon reflection on cultural and social contexts
                     underlined by the previous two surveys of the juvenile condition in Italy
                     Istituto IARD “at the beginning of the new century”. They reveal the
                     restlessness and confusion of youth in the face of the profound changes that
                     characterize post-modernity and provide a mass of data of particular interest to

                     the human person? In tandem with the research focus was the desire for an

                     informal educational agencies to promote integral health and human wellbeing
                     from the early years of life. In the school year 2015-2016 the “Quality of life” network was developed, involving

                     at youth health promotion, and included a pedagogy of cooperation between formal
                     and informal training agencies, through a process of growing awareness of the
                     potential and the risks that young people now face <span class="error"><a class="ref" href="#morin2015">#morin2015</a></span>.
                     Secondly, the project aimed to explore with young people how to take care of
                     themselves and others through the means of visual communication, writing fiction
                     and autobiographical writing, to chart a new path of sustainable development
                     ethics and inclusive education in a shared model.

                  <div class="ptext" id="p13"> We believe the positivistic paradigm is inadequate to investigate some areas of
                     education. Much of the essence of the educational phenomenon is as a unique and
                     unrepeatable epistemic device that does not lend itself easily to the positivist
                     lens. Epistemic ecological paradigm-related guidelines are best suited to
                     investigate the world of education. That is why we chose to use
                     quanti-qualitative tools and standards to investigate the particular scope of
                     educational research represented by the ethical education of values, within a
                     framework of full welfare and health promotion. There were several epistemic
                     ecological paradigm-related underpinnings, which included a phenomenological
                     approach, a critical approach and a participatory approach. These approaches
                     express different philosophies which are not mutually exclusive. In this
                     research work, in particular, we favored a phenomenological-hermeneutic
                     interpretive approach, which takes account of empirical data. The
                     phenomenological hermeneutic paradigm aims at the elaboration of scientific
                     reports defined as “interpretative descriptions”. It's mostly this
                     paradigm, which has developed theories of phenomenological research as it
                     applies to education. The starting point was the experience, to investigate
                     networks and meanings that participants identified. The phenomenological
                     methodology excludes generalizations. The essence of the phenomenological
                     orientation is to be faithful to the phenomenon itself; the epistemic imperative
                     is to “go to the things themselves”. Things are not perceived
                     as factual, but as elements of consciousness, objects of intuition, the essence
                     of things revealed to consciousness. The researcher should, according to this
                     paradigm, study things in their setting, knowing that they can manifest
                     themselves in different ways according to the ways of accessing them. In order
                     to be faithful to the phenomenon researchers should refer to the principle of
                     evidence: and the authors adhered to this principle. They also recognized that
                     phenomena do not always appear to be completely transparent to one’s gaze, but
                     rather that everything has its own specific way of transcending appearance. This
                     makes the researcher humble and modest in the results obtained and motivates
                     further research that can identify and promote empowering strategies that can
                     contribute to new improvements for the human person.

                     virtues indispensable for the integral development of the human person, we used
                     the interactive whiteboard (IWB) that is a device that, when compared to other
                     similar technological tools, is designed specifically for the school and with
                     the school. As is with the size of a traditional whiteboard, on the surface it
                     is possible to write, manage files, images, videos and browse the web resources.
                     A projector projects the computer's desktop on the surface of the Board, on
                     which one can interact through the use of a pen, a finger, a stylus or other
                     device (Wikipedia 06/2013). The students were very interested in using the IWB.
                     Our research shows that the digital whiteboard has a direct effect on the degree
                     of students' participation in the lesson. The digital whiteboard has made
                     possible a better presentation of content based on the use of images and movies

                     experienced as spectators / protagonists. After completing this mnemonic effort,

                     efficient in relation to what Morin defines as the main objective of education:
                     “teaching to live”. In
                     particular, through a set of questions that investigate thought and action of
                     young people we verified whether the educational activity is capable of focusing
                     the heart of the educational issue: the development of a thought useful for
                     life. The basic hypothesis, confirmed by the international literature and

                     marginally interested in the integral formation of the human person. In

                     and, in detail, factorial validity. Face validity or apparent validity refers to
                     the perception of detecting instrument on the part of those involved in the data
                     collection and for which we have adapted questions to the subject of the search
                     so that those questions were then recognized as valid in relation to the
                     objectives of the research. The content validity refers to contents expressed by
                     indicators, which should be consistent with how you plan to detect and represent
                     the objectives of the survey. In our study the set of indicators chosen for a
                     concept actually covers the entire domain of meaning of the concept in question.
                     To do this we have controlled on a purely theoretical basis, decomposing
                     analytically the concept studied in all its dimensions and ensuring that the
                     indicator covers all through a review of the literature and listening to the
                     opinion of several courts. Factorial validity can be seen in the correspondence
                     between the contents of the hypothesis (the gaps in moral education) and
                     empirical data that we obtained by the indicators (see T 1; T 2; T 3; T 4; T 5).
