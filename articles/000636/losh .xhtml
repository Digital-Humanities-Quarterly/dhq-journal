                  <p>Black DH is central rather than peripheral to the field of the digital humanities
                     and
                     challenges the origin stories of humanities computing and its blind spots about data
                     and white supremacy. Unfortunately the same issues about diversity and inclusivity
                     in
                     conferences, professional organizations, and scholarly communication remain unchanged
                     over the decades, and the burden falls on Black and Brown DHers
                     disproportionately.</p>
                  </div>
               
               
               
               
               <div class="counter"><a href="#p1">1</a></div>
               <div class="ptext" id="p1">When I first started presenting at digital humanities events twenty years ago, the
                  field
                  was still called “humanities computing.” My first international conference
                  experience was at “Digital Resources in the Humanities” in 2000. Sessions were held
                  at the University of Sheffield, which had recently been the location of the popular
                  British film <cite class="title italic">The Full Monty</cite>. The movie had dramatized the
                  plight of unemployed steel workers and their precarity under Thatcherism. Consequently,
                  the conference seemed to me very disconnected from questions of class as well as those
                  of race and ethnicity. In addition to being a very obviously white space in terms
                  of who
                  was in the room at any given moment, there was definitely a sense that the urban
                  landscape outside needed to erased from the consciousness of participants in order
                  to
                  focus on the output of elite institutions and their scrupulous digital annotations
                  of
                  canonical texts. </div>
               
               <div class="counter"><a href="#p2">2</a></div>
               <div class="ptext" id="p2">At the time there was a strong emphasis on the preservation of “cultural heritage”
                  without a lot of reflection about whose heritage was being preserved and why, who
                  would
                  have access to it and how, and who would be curating and interpreting these objects
                  of
                  study in the future. I was very interested in the politics of digitization at the
                  time
                  and how nation-states were rhetorically positioning themselves with millennial
                  enthusiasm as they launched ambitious initiatives for national digital libraries that
                  promised universal access to rare materials connected to a country’s founding myths.
                  I
                  was doing a lot of field work interviewing librarians and visiting archives in the
                  US,
                  France, and the UK, but institutional administrators were very reluctant to let me
                  chat
                  with people actually sitting at digitization machines. I found the outsourcing of
                  labor
                  in this workflow to immigrants or workers in former colonial possessions particularly
                  repugnant. There were often “mistakes” in which a Black or Brown person’s hand
                  would be visible on a digitized page or the insertion of nonstandard language or
                  classification would appear, and I wanted to know about these people and their stories.
                  </div>
               
               <div class="counter"><a href="#p3">3</a></div>
               <div class="ptext" id="p3">In 2000 there was also growing recognition that there would need to be more
                  standardization so that digital humanities projects could be more sustainable and
                  interoperable. Many of the sessions at the Sheffield conference were about TEI, which
                  seemed like a cutting-edge innovation, although it had apparently been around since
                  the
                  eighties. Publishers were also trying to capitalize on subscription database services.
                  I
                  vividly remember a rather clunky demo of JSTOR, which was still in its infancy, and
                  there was also much discussion of Google Books. Yet, no one seemed to be talking about
                  the politics of classification or the exclusionary practices of proprietary
                  corporations, even though they were clearly part of the DH mythology that I was seeing
                  being formalized firsthand. </div>
               
               <div class="counter"><a href="#p4">4</a></div>
               <div class="ptext" id="p4">These early experiences really drew me to seminal work in Black digital humanities
                  that
                  aired issues in the field that were clearly being suppressed. Regardless of their
                  affiliation or status or chosen mode of publication (since blogs were important venues
                  for Black DH), these were the first major critics in the field in my opinion. These
                  were
                  the voices that raised substantive questions about politics, access, participation,
                  labor, prestige, corporate influence, the surveillance state, and the racist and
                  colonial legacies of supposedly universal standards. By 2010, people like Anna Everett,
                  Beth Coleman, Marisa Parham, and Kim Gallon were also asking fundamental questions
                  about
                  the definition of the digital humanities itself and the limitations of grounding its
                  origin story in corpus linguistics rather than transmedia storytelling, collective
                  world-building, digital activism, or civic media. When I teach seminars or workshops
                  in
                  the digital humanities, I see work by Black and Brown digital humanists as central,
                  and
                  I am perplexed by those who devalue this important corpus of scholarship as peripheral.
                  Jessica Marie Johnson, Moya Bailey, Catherine Knight Steele, Angel David Nieves, Dorothy
                  Kim, and Roopika Risam are always on my syllabi. </div>
               
               <div class="counter"><a href="#p5">5</a></div>
               <div class="ptext" id="p5">Although I would hope that international digital humanities organizations would do
                  more
                  to use their platforms as transnational, multilingual communities of scholarship to
                  elevate Black DH, too often I hear nonsense that reinforces a false “quality vs.
                  diversity” binary among decision makers. Moreover, too often committees and task
                  forces composed of already overworked faculty of color are charged with changing the
                  culture and infrastructure of DH organizations without the means for effecting the
                  unfunded and unresourced mandates that they have been assigned. Having been around
                  for
                  two decades, I have seen multiple restagings of these supposedly good faith efforts.
                  The
                  cast of characters changes, but the problems remain.</div>
               
               <div class="counter"><a href="#p6">6</a></div>
               <div class="ptext" id="p6">Instead it might be more useful to invest energies in regional digital humanities
                  organizations that treat access-oriented institutions and communities of color with
                  more
                  respect. For example, Ravynn Stringfield has argued that conferences like “Intentionally Digital, Intentionally Black” and “Race, Memory, and the Digital Humanities” energize graduate
                  students and other emerging scholars because they sustain networks of care and repair.
                  These conferences in which most of the presenters are Black are also connected to
                  particular geographies of shared practice and lived legacies of oppression rooted
                  in
                  space and place that must be addressed by Predominant White Institutions (PWIs). </div>
               
               <div class="counter"><a href="#p7">7</a></div>
               <div class="ptext" id="p7">Having taught in the Netherlands and having been part of research groups based in
                  Norway
                  and Germany, I don’t think that these place-based DH approaches should just be the
                  domain of U.S. exceptionalism, even if American truth and reconciliation processes
                  still
                  need to acknowledge the continuing and lasting damage of mass incarceration, redlining,
                  segregation, Jim Crow, and the Transatlantic slave trade in a matrix of material and
                  digital relations. Digital humanities projects everywhere can make space for restorative
                  justice that comes to terms with colonial institutions, racist immigration policies,
                  and
                  ethnic genocides by decentering White voices and opening up opportunities for true
                  collaboration with initiatives led by Black and Brown scholars.</div>
