            <!--Include a brief abstract of the article-->
            <p>Black DH is central rather than peripheral to the field of the digital humanities and
               challenges the origin stories of humanities computing and its blind spots about data
               and white supremacy. Unfortunately the same issues about diversity and inclusivity in
               conferences, professional organizations, and scholarly communication remain unchanged
               over the decades, and the burden falls on Black and Brown DHers
               disproportionately.</p>
         </dhq:abstract>
         <dhq:teaser>
            <p>Instead it might be more useful to invest energies in regional digital humanities
               organizations that treat access-oriented institutions and communities of color with
               more respect.</p>
         </dhq:teaser>
      </front>
      <body>
         <p>When I first started presenting at digital humanities events twenty years ago, the field
            was still called <q>humanities computing.</q> My first international conference
            experience was at <q>Digital Resources in the Humanities</q> in 2000. Sessions were held
            at the University of Sheffield, which had recently been the location of the popular
            British film <title rend="italic">The Full Monty</title>. The movie had dramatized the
            plight of unemployed steel workers and their precarity under Thatcherism. Consequently,
            the conference seemed to me very disconnected from questions of class as well as those
            of race and ethnicity. In addition to being a very obviously white space in terms of who
            was in the room at any given moment, there was definitely a sense that the urban
            landscape outside needed to erased from the consciousness of participants in order to
            focus on the output of elite institutions and their scrupulous digital annotations of
            canonical texts. </p>
         <p>At the time there was a strong emphasis on the preservation of <q>cultural heritage</q>
            without a lot of reflection about whose heritage was being preserved and why, who would
            have access to it and how, and who would be curating and interpreting these objects of
            study in the future. I was very interested in the politics of digitization at the time
            and how nation-states were rhetorically positioning themselves with millennial
            enthusiasm as they launched ambitious initiatives for national digital libraries that
            promised universal access to rare materials connected to a country’s founding myths. I
            was doing a lot of field work interviewing librarians and visiting archives in the US,
            France, and the UK, but institutional administrators were very reluctant to let me chat
            with people actually sitting at digitization machines. I found the outsourcing of labor
            in this workflow to immigrants or workers in former colonial possessions particularly
            repugnant. There were often <q>mistakes</q> in which a Black or Brown person’s hand
            would be visible on a digitized page or the insertion of nonstandard language or
            classification would appear, and I wanted to know about these people and their stories. </p>
         <p>In 2000 there was also growing recognition that there would need to be more
            standardization so that digital humanities projects could be more sustainable and
            interoperable. Many of the sessions at the Sheffield conference were about TEI, which
            seemed like a cutting-edge innovation, although it had apparently been around since the
            eighties. Publishers were also trying to capitalize on subscription database services. I
            vividly remember a rather clunky demo of JSTOR, which was still in its infancy, and
            there was also much discussion of Google Books. Yet, no one seemed to be talking about
            the politics of classification or the exclusionary practices of proprietary
            corporations, even though they were clearly part of the DH mythology that I was seeing
            being formalized firsthand. </p>
         <p>These early experiences really drew me to seminal work in Black digital humanities that
            aired issues in the field that were clearly being suppressed. Regardless of their
            affiliation or status or chosen mode of publication (since blogs were important venues
            for Black DH), these were the first major critics in the field in my opinion. These were
            the voices that raised substantive questions about politics, access, participation,
            labor, prestige, corporate influence, the surveillance state, and the racist and
            colonial legacies of supposedly universal standards. By 2010, people like Anna Everett,
            Beth Coleman, Marisa Parham, and Kim Gallon were also asking fundamental questions about
            the definition of the digital humanities itself and the limitations of grounding its
            origin story in corpus linguistics rather than transmedia storytelling, collective
            world-building, digital activism, or civic media. When I teach seminars or workshops in
            the digital humanities, I see work by Black and Brown digital humanists as central, and
            I am perplexed by those who devalue this important corpus of scholarship as peripheral.
            Jessica Marie Johnson, Moya Bailey, Catherine Knight Steele, Angel David Nieves, Dorothy
            Kim, and Roopika Risam are always on my syllabi. </p>
         <p>Although I would hope that international digital humanities organizations would do more
            to use their platforms as transnational, multilingual communities of scholarship to
            elevate Black DH, too often I hear nonsense that reinforces a false <q>quality vs.
               diversity</q> binary among decision makers. Moreover, too often committees and task
            forces composed of already overworked faculty of color are charged with changing the
            culture and infrastructure of DH organizations without the means for effecting the
            unfunded and unresourced mandates that they have been assigned. Having been around for
            two decades, I have seen multiple restagings of these supposedly good faith efforts. The
            cast of characters changes, but the problems remain.</p>
         <p>Instead it might be more useful to invest energies in regional digital humanities
            organizations that treat access-oriented institutions and communities of color with more
            respect. For example, Ravynn Stringfield has argued that conferences like <title
               rend="quotes">Intentionally Digital, Intentionally Black</title> and <title
               rend="quotes">Race, Memory, and the Digital Humanities</title> energize graduate
            students and other emerging scholars because they sustain networks of care and repair.
            These conferences in which most of the presenters are Black are also connected to
            particular geographies of shared practice and lived legacies of oppression rooted in
            space and place that must be addressed by Predominant White Institutions (PWIs). </p>
         <p>Having taught in the Netherlands and having been part of research groups based in Norway
            and Germany, I don’t think that these place-based DH approaches should just be the
            domain of U.S. exceptionalism, even if American truth and reconciliation processes still
            need to acknowledge the continuing and lasting damage of mass incarceration, redlining,
            segregation, Jim Crow, and the Transatlantic slave trade in a matrix of material and
            digital relations. Digital humanities projects everywhere can make space for restorative
            justice that comes to terms with colonial institutions, racist immigration policies, and
            ethnic genocides by decentering White voices and opening up opportunities for true
            collaboration with initiatives led by Black and Brown scholars.</p>
