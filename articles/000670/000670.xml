			<p>This essay considers two archives and their traces: the Banff New Media Institute
				(BNMI) and the Daniel Langlois Foundation (DLF). Both archives are the product
				of transitory but significant initiatives in the media arts and digital media
				context. Both suffered unanticipated project endings due to institutional and
				human agency and are now in varying stages of recovery and rediscovery . A third
				personal artistic, cultural, and social history collection – the Sara Diamond
				Fonds – seeks lessons from the endings of those first two archives;
				administrators of this third archive at the Christa Dahl Media Library and
				Archives and Simon Fraser University have developed a dynamic partnership
				strategy to prevent the same issues that resulted in the disappearance of the
				BNMI and DLF archives.<note> The BNMI archive does not contain complex
					interactive new media art works. The Langlois Collection includes
					documentation of video, web, CD, and interactive works but few are online.
					My collection includes video and web works. New Media archiving is
					demanding because of changing platforms - many works have found a home with
					the Archives of Digital Art (ADA) and Rhizome, discussed later in this
					essay.</note> In the instances of the BNMI and DLF, disappearance has meant
				the removal from public access. Disappearance has a second meaning in the
				context of digital media whether online or platform (such as CDs, DVDs). As
				Grau, Hoth, and Wandl-Vogt (<ref target="#grau">2019</ref>) stress: <quote rend="inline">Due to lack of institutional
				support and rapid changes in storage and presentation media, works that
				originated ten years ago can no longer be recovered technically for exhibition
				or preservation purposes</quote> <ptr target="#grau2019" loc="20"/>. Giselle Beiguelman further asks, “How to deal in the
				field of preservation and conservation with files that disappear, works that
				stop functioning, services that vanish from one day to the next <ptr target="#beiguelman2019" loc="118"/>?
				Media art works and Internet art rely on connections to databases, links, and
				third-party servers and services. Moreover, many works are interactive and
				contributor-driven so there is no easy beginning and end and often exist in many
				versions. Both interpretations of disappearance address the challenge that, as
				Sue Breakell suggests, <quote rend="inline">the records do not simply go through a life cycle from
				creation and currency through to interactivity and the archive but move in and
				out of currency</quote> <ptr target="#breakell2008" loc="4"/>. This is in part an argument to sustain institutional
				archives that mark a specific time period and to exert best practices such as
				emulation in preserving digital materials and licensing to allow the use of
				copyrighted materials. It is also an argument for the creators of collections,
				whether inside institutions (BNMI), or as alternative archives (DLF, CDMLA), to
				negotiate clear accessioning and deaccessioning relationships with their own
				institution (The Banff Centre) or potential partner institutions (DLF, CDMLA)
				early in the process of creating or acquiring an archive, or as soon as there is
				a perceived sense of the significance of that collection, whether within the
				institution and/or the stakeholders that it serves. </p>
			<p>The period of the late 1990s through the early twenty-first century was one of
				intense interest in archives on the part of institutions, governments, curators,
				and artists, and coincides with the creation of the BNMI and the DLF
				documentation centre. The <q>allure</q> of the archive, as Sue Breakell (<ref target="#breakell2015">2015</ref>) notes,
				was sparked by a heightened engagement with memory and the emergence of memory
				technologies (such as databases, hard drives, and centralized server storage).
				The drive to digitize meant that some records would be left behind, fueling
				concerns about inclusion, and about who should have the right to choose which
				materials would be digitized. The massive production of online materials seemed
				to some to be a gift towards a universal human memory; to others, <quote rend="inline">the more
				absolute knowledge on the Internet becomes, the harder it is to comprehend as it
				[knowledge] transforms into an unreadable amount of data</quote> <ptr target="#hoth2021"/>. </p>
			<p>Post-modernism challenged the authoritative nature of historical records and
				archives, in part instigated by Michel Foucault’s (<ref target="#foucault1969">1969</ref>) analysis of archives as
				a demonstration of relationships and institutions in process, perpetually
				incomplete repositories that represent power, through what is present and absent
				in their contents. Jacques Derrida in Archive Fever: A Freudian Impression,
				argues for the political nature of the archive, observing that power resides in
				control over its content and access. Anticipating the rise of the Internet and
				digital preservation, he astutely described a contemporary obsession with
				archives and the desire to preserve. He painted a tension between the public
				domain and personal memory materials that plays out today, for example, in
				debates about the right to be forgotten,<note> This is the argument that an
					individual should be able to have their records removed from social media
					and other Internet sites. </note> or the ways that social media intermingle
				personal and institutional commentary and politics, or the growing interface
				between personal health data collection and medical records. In An Archival
				Impulse (<ref target="#foster2004">2004</ref>), Hal Foster recognizes the archival turn and analyzes three kinds
				of artists’ works: those that use archival content, those where the artist
				performs methods drawn from archival practices, and those in which artists
				create unique archives. Powerful works have occurred when archivists invite
				artists into collections to create new interpretations. The Artist-in-Residency
				Program at the City of Portland Archives and Record Centre supported Portland
				Archives artists-in-residence Garrick Imatini and Kaia Sand. They interviewed
				selected subjects who were documented in the city’s Police Bureau’s surveillance
				fonds of 576 activists, augmenting the police fonds with <quote rend="inline">lives embedded, yet
				silenced, in the records</quote>, resulting in a new understanding of that history
				and the expungement of criminal records <ptr target="#carbone2015" loc="51"/>. Antonio
				Muntadas’ The File Room is at the same time both an emulation and critique of
				archival practices and an archive in its own right. It is a project
				intentionally without an ending, a travelling installation of physical archival
				files and a connected and collectively created and ongoing database of instances
				of censorship–political, cultural, and scientific.<note> It opened in 1994 and
					the database was hosted over the years at several sites, eventually
					migrating to Rhizome (a digital arts archive) who upgraded and restored it
					for exhibition in 2016 at its affiliate the New Museum and online
					presence</note> The historical context provides a framework for motivations
				and activities at the core of the three case studies that follow. </p>
			<p>Archives and archivists have various standards to guide them in considering which
				collections to acquire, the methods of accessioning collections and conditions
				to deaccession collections. The Canadian Council of Archives (CCA, 2018)
				describes accessioning as, “… the physical and legal addition of predominantly
				unpublished documentary material to an archival repository’s holdings. It
				follows an archival appraisal decision identifying the records as having
				enduring value in relation to the acquisition mandate and policies of the
					repository.”<note> The CCA’s National Archival Accession Standard Working
					Group (NAASWG) wrote a content standard for archival accession information
					which governs metadata standards, information sharing, research within and
					across archives, and management of digital archives. See
					http://archivescanada.ca/CWG_AccessionStandard.</note> The Society of
				American Archivists (SAS) provides terms, process and considerations for
				deaccessioning (2017). Deaccessioning represents the removal of materials from
				an archive and is perceived by most archives to be a component of best
				practices, but it is understandably controversial. SAS argues that policy and
				guidelines are needed, with clear options for the materials deaccessioned.
				Decisions should be made by archivists, the archive, and its home institution.
				Processes need to be transparent, properly documented, and overseen in an
				ethical manner. The SAS suggests that deeds of gift should include clear
				deaccessioning terms. Reasons for deaccessioning materials include reappraisal
				of a collection’s relevance to institutional mandate, frequency of use, its
				potential research value, whether it would be more meaningful and better used in
				a different repository, its condition, and maintenance costs. Other
				considerations include the ability to define provenance, or legal requirements
				to retain documents over time periods. Archives ideally seek a transfer of fonds
				to a different repository. They may return materials to original owners, or they
				may sell the collection or, ultimately, destroy the records. These routes are
				relevant for the case studies considered below. </p>
			<p>Also relevant are increased options in collections management and permissions,
				given the rise of digitization and the acquisition of creative media works. The
				British Archive for Contemporary Writing has adopted two complementary
				practices, the creation of a “storehouse” and a “collection.” The first is the
				short-term loan of writers’ archives to support thematic archival research, for
				example for six months rather than the 20 years minimum required by most
				archives (Whibley, 2019). The goal is that emerging writers will see BACW as a
				trusted agent, and that writers will provide their archives to the collection as
				their careers mature (University of East Anglia, 2022). Licensing is an
				alternative to “deposit” as it allows multiple institutions to hold digital
				materials and retains the originator’s copyright. For example, with a deposit
				license, such as that of the Oxford University Research Archive (ORA, 2014), the
				intellectual property creator retains their rights and can continue to license
				it and earn revenue and agrees to grant the University a non-exclusive,
				sub-licensable, worldwide license to store and access the work to the public. </p>
			<p>The last decades have witnessed continued dialogue within the archival community
				and between communities and archivists that shift archival best practices in
				relation to Indigenous records and records of other vulnerable groups. This
				includes replevin, or repatriating holdings to Indigenous groups at their
				request, or the renegotiation of ownership and access with Indigenous peoples
				for archives remaining in collections. Call 70 of Canada’s Truth and
				Reconciliation Commission requires the inclusion of Indigenous recordkeepers and
				researchers, their perspectives, and their methodologies within the Canadian
				archival system. Critical archival studies foster archival practices that resist
				reinforcing oppression based on race, class, gender, sexuality, and ability.
				Instead, the goal is to develop inclusive, accessible, multivocal sites for
				cultural participation and dissemination (Caswell &amp; Cifor 2019). </p>

			</p>
			<p>The Banff New Media Institute (BNMI) ran from 1995 to 2010 at The Banff Centre
				(TBC) in Alberta, Canada, on the heels of the centre’s early history of virtual
				reality and new media research. It was an international think tank on the
				present and future practices of new media, with leaders engaged in developing
				the science and technologies, creative and design practices, jurisprudence,
				business models, and theories; it was also a training hub and business
				incubator, with three research labs and a co-production program. BNMI staff
				curated exhibitions and events both at the Walter Phillips Gallery on site and
					abroad.<note> To see the breadth of the events and participants explore
						<ref
						target="https://livingarchitecturesystems.com/publication/euphoria-dystopia/"
						>https://livingarchitecturesystems.com/publication/euphoria-dystopia/</ref>.</note>
				Over the course of its first ten years, it held over 150 summits, symposia,
				workshops, conferences, and events which were recorded (audio) and from which
				relevant records such as release forms, agendas, analysis of events, and other
				memorabilia were kept. Co-productions were described and catalogued, and the
				documentation made available on-line, as were exhibition descriptions and
				documentation. The BNMI created Horizonzero.ca, a Heritage Canada funded
				experimental online gallery and site for discourse regarding the new media world
				which acted as a guide back to the summits and co-productions. </p>
			<p>The BNMI team were attentive to gender imbalance in the growth of the new media
				industry, the presence of female identified creative practitioners and their
				lack of inclusion in festivals, and the burgeoning of a diverse global creative
				new media community. As much as possible there was mitigation against digital
				exclusion, accepting George Gerbner’s concept of “Symbolic annihilation,” where
				absence from the historical record removes practices and voices that could shape
				the future, a concept applied to archives by Caswell (Caswell et al., 2016;
				Caswell, 2014).<note> For example, the sequential events Bridges (co-created
					with Celia Pearce from the University of Southern California), Bridges 2,
					and Skinning Our Tools bear testimony to the ways that the BNMI insisted on
					bringing discussions of race and Indigenous identity to art, science, and
					technology tables.</note> A feature of BNMI was its deep commitment to
				Indigenous creators and technical leaders, whose creative practices and
				self-governed events were supported by BNMI (such as <hi rend="italic">Drum Beat
					to Drum Byte</hi>, two gatherings regarding Indigenous practices and
				presence on the Internet that were two decades apart). Indigenous artists,
				technicians, theorists, curators, and elders engaged in all manner of BNMI
				activities. BNMI also built collaborations with local Indigenous
					communities.<note> Jules Bergis (2016) underscores the danger that digital
					archives in particular, because of technical and programming needs will
					exclude traditionally marginalized groups.</note> Despite its government
				and industry funding the BNMI fearlessly hosted agonistic debates over video
				game sexism, algorithmic bias, anthropocentric notions of intelligence,
				open-source vs copyright, bioengineering and environment, and other
				controversial topics.<note> The BNMI was funded by the Canadian Tri-council
					research agencies, Alberta research, Telefilm Canada, the Canada Council
					for the Arts, Heritage and Industry Canada, international councils, and
					Canadian and international industry. </note>
			</p>
			<p>In synch with Foucault, Derrida, and Foster’s calls to reexamine the archives, the
				BNMI held summits and workshops that considered the transition to digital
				archives; events debated memory and history, the archive versus the database and
				their ultimate integration, and the question of what should be digitized and how
				it should be conserved, with titles such as “Media, Material and Culture:
				Communicating Canada’s Heritage”, “Unforgiving Memory”, and “ReFresh” (which
				have become the biannual Media Art History conferences).<note>
					<ref target="https://www.mediaarthistory.org/mah-conf-series"
						>https://www.mediaarthistory.org/mah-conf-series</ref>.</note> These
				strengthened the accelerating “archive fever” within the BNMI and the belief
				that it must leave a record of this complex era. That intuition is rewarded
				today as the BNMI fonds include documentation of prescient debates that are in
				contemporary reprise (such as the nature of social media, gender, and race bias
				in AI systems, the mapping potential of GPS/GIS technologies, or control over
				data), and engage deeply diverse actors regarding technologies, systems, tools,
				and creative expressions that have shaped our lives today.<note> These include
					machine learning, genomics, neuroscience, nanotechnology, Artificial
					General Intelligence, social media, blogs, mobile devices and their
					affordances, Augmented and Virtual Reality, open source, streaming, and
					digital currencies.</note>
			</p>
			<p>For the archive project, a decade of audio recordings and documents were digitized
				and brought up to 2005 standards and a physical archive and finding aid were
				created by a professional archivist seconded from the National Archives Canada.
				There was an online interface which was searchable by events, names, and dates,
				and it was easily accessed on TBC’s website, as was the co-production catalogue.
				The BNMI team felt a contractual, financial, and emotional connection to the
				fonds. We had raised a significant amount of public funding to build this
				collection and create a related book. Speakers had signed release forms and
				expected that the associated materials would be present on the BNMI web site.
				The same contractual and affective bonds were not shared across The Banff
				Centre. In 2005 the BNMI team hoped that the fonds could reside with the Paul
				Fleck Library and Archive at the Banff Centre, but the Archive had no interest
				in the physical or digital archive nor did the archivist at that time recognize
				value in placing the BNMI fonds online.<note> This memory was provided by Susan
					Kennard, who was the Director of the BNMI from 2005 – 2010.</note> I left
				TBC in 2005; Susan Kennard, then Director of the BNMI, left in 2010; and TBC
				closed the BNMI shortly afterwards. The digital archive persisted, available on
				the main web site, and was well used. Dr. Sarah Cook and I co-edited the book
					<hi rend="italic">Euphoria and Dystopia: The Banff New Media Institute
					Dialogues</hi> and it was published in 2011 by TBC and University of
				Waterloo’s Riverside Press.<note> It included essays reflecting on the
					activities and themes of the BNMI, transcripts from the BNMI archives,
					information on attendees, and a visualization of BNMI activities. A DVD
					documenting horizonzero.ca was bundled with the book. The full version is
					available here: <ref
						target="https://livingarchitecturesystems.com/publication/euphoria-dystopia/"
						>https://livingarchitecturesystems.com/publication/euphoria-dystopia/</ref>.
				</note> The e-book version in 2013 was meticulously linked to the online archive
				as a thematic, discursive, and critical finding aid. The BNMI efforts
				represented a strategy for archival access comprising multiple interpretive
				publications (the e-book and Horizonzero.ca) linked to a digital archive. This
				approach is appropriate for reinvigorating archives, introducing fonds to new
				audiences, and making them available for creative interpretation by artists and
				new generations of scholars. </p>
			<p> </p>
			<p>Euphoria &amp; Dystopia and Horizonzero.ca DVDs – physical traces of digital
				archives</p>
			<p>In 2016 Indigenous artist Cheryl L’Hirondelle found that the archive was no longer
				accessible and sounded an alert. Indeed, it had been removed after a change of
				leadership and a web rebranding and would never return to its original online
				form, thus severing all the meticulous links made to several thousand digital
				records and to the digital archives from other publications. Two years later,
				The Banff Centre did not renew the HorizonZero.ca domain or pay the small fee
				for hosting, so this legacy of the BNMI also disappeared. </p>
			<p>Contributors to the archive – most poignantly Indigenous artists and historians –
				along with other scholars and archivists, the book publisher Philip Beesley,
				Sarah Cook, and I appealed to The Banff Centre to return the archive to
				researchers and the public again through a digital interface and volunteered to
				find or contribute funding. In 2018 TBC’s archivist John Yolkowski stepped in
				and moved the project from an IT-led web site initiative to an archive-led
				initiative. The physical fonds moved to the Paul Fleck Library and Archives and
				were accessioned. Work began and a number of documents were made available on
				the TBC’s archive site and mirrored on Alberta on Record.<note>
					<ref target="https://albertaonrecord.ca/banff-new-media-institute"
						>https://albertaonrecord.ca/banff-new-media-institute</ref>.</note>
				Then Yolkowski left. Indigenous artists and media historians insisted that the
				Indigenous media arts history be reconstructed, as TBC was an epicenter of
				Indigenous and international media production, new media, and digital arts
				creativity. The Banff Centre acted on this in 2021 and hired a team of
				researchers to undertake an oral history of Indigenous media art at TBC, which
				is now completed. These efforts underscore the responsibility (Bergis, 2016)
				that institutions bear in relation to their engagement with Indigenous and other
				equity seeking communities if they collect and represent their data. </p>
			<p>Perhaps The Banff Centre leadership perceived the BNMI archive as the expression
				of a specific leadership and their program priorities, not as an archive. While
				many institutions do retain program records, they are rarely featured as part of
				a current marketing web site. There was no continuity in Banff’s Indigenous
				leadership, and hence no awareness of the archive’s Indigenous contents or
				advocate. Institutional memory is fragile at best; however, the formal nature of
				an archive and the policies surrounding it can create some ballast. The
				collection represented consciously collected and ordered institutional records,
				but it was not an archive – in this period it was not yet appraised or perceived
				as having “enduring” institutional value and hence formally accessioned. Rather,
				it was a counter archive within an institution. TBC has a deaccessioning policy
				in place for its visual art collection, and its Paul Fleck Library and Archives
				holdings, but the BNMI archive, treated as an orphan record of program contents,
				was not covered under this policy. </p>
			<p>It is valuable, nonetheless, to consider the principles of deaccessioning in
				collections management as defined by the SAS (2017). Richard Gerrard (2013) in
				his instructional text on deaccessioning lays out the rigorous staged nature of
				removing collections: due diligence institutional governance processes are
				required. The driver should be to improve the collection, and the goal of
				disposal to find a new home more able to house a collection. Writing on
				“Archival Appraisal and Deaccessioning” in <hi rend="italic">Indigitization:
					Tools for Digitizing and Sustaining Indigenous Knowledge</hi> (2020), Kayla
				Lar-son says of deaccessioning that materials should be returned to the original
				donors or holders of a collection. This principle is relevant for HorizonZero.ca
				as the “Tell” issue included a reversioning of the Elderspeak website of the
				Meadow Lake Tribal Council with their permission as they could no longer host
				the original Elderspeak collection of stories. The issue was edited by Cheryl
				L’Hirondelle who undertook that reversioning. With the end of Horizonzero.ca, an
				unforeseen consequence was that MLTC lost access to Elderspeak although it is
				present on the Internet Archive.<note>
					<ref
						target="https://web.archive.org/web/20160316203351/http://www.horizonzero.ca/elderspeak/index.html"
						>https://web.archive.org/web/20160316203351/http://www.horizonzero.ca/elderspeak/index.html</ref>.</note>
				With L’Hirondelle’s support, MLTC will work with the DVD version and
				L’Hirondelle’s original files to repatriate the files and recreate the site. </p>
			<p>A formal agreement should have been put in place for the care and transition of
				the BNMI records and the maintenance of HorizonZero, or for its disciplined
				disposal to another identified archive. As its creators, we should have built in
				redundancy and distributed the resonsibility for maintenance while we were still
				working at TBC (Endings Symposium chat 14:08:32), and possibly created a fund to
				upgrade and support the fonds. In the Q. and A. of my presentation at the
				Project Endings conference, Martin Holmes urged “archives, mirrors, repos, web
				servers, Internet Archive — make as many copies as possible.” We should have
				arranged for a second repository. Alternatively, The Banff Centre could have
				returned the BNMI archive to Cook, Diamond, and Beesley and enabled them to find
				a home, as several institutions stepped up to offer to take it — but even that
				would have required staff effort and institutional prioritization.<note> In
					another example, the leadership of Toronto’s Design Exchange brought back
					the original curator of its collection for the sole purpose of finding it a
					new home; they followed Canadian Museum Association standards and it now
					resides with the ROM and the Canadian Museum of History.</note> The
				physical and some digital archives are available on site to researchers who
				travel to The Banff Centre. In 2022 Jessica Zimmerman, the new archivist of the
				Paul Fleck Archive, reached out with a commitment to “find a home for the BNMI
				story”, integrating it into The Banff Centre’s history and timeline and
				revitalizing its online presence, including its audio recordings and previous
				archival interface. Banff is initiating this process and I will collaborate with
				the archives to seek funds for these endeavors. They may redescribe material
				into AtoM<note> AtoM (Access to Memory) provides the following definition of an
					archival description, “Archival description is a body of information about
					an archival record or records. The descriptions provide contextual
					information about the archival materials and are arranged into hierarchical
					levels (<ref
						target="https://www.accesstomemory.org/en/docs/2.3/user-manual/glossary/glossary/#term-fonds"
						>fonds</ref>, series, files, items, and variations of these in
					accordance with institutional standards).” <ref

						>https://www.accesstomemory.org/en/docs/2.3/user-manual/add-edit-content/archival-descriptions/#archival-descriptions</ref>.</note>
				to afford greater public accessibility and retrieval options and create a Rules
				for Archival Description (RAD) standard-compliant finding aid for easier access
				for distance researchers.<note> Jean Gagnon provided details of the motivation
					for these initiatives and the transition process in an interview with me in
					March of 2021. </note> Demand for access to the archive has grown and The
				Banff Centre seeks to revitalize its digital programs and celebrate its fifty
				years of work with Indigenous communities. The collection now fits CCA’s
				criteria for accessioning (2018). This plan would mean that the BNMI’s role and
				impact will be visible to the current generation of scholars, artists, and
				researchers, heralding a happy ending. </p>

			</p>
			<p>The second case study underscores the importance of establishing a back-up
				repository. The Daniel Langlois Foundation Centre for Research and Documentation
				was initiated in 1998 by Jean Gagnon with the support of Daniel Langlois, the
				co-founder of Softimage.<note> The collection grew to comprise 2691 video works
					or source documents, DVDs, documentary works and documentation of art
					works, 2084 files of artists, festivals, biennales, 764 audio documents,
					documentation, and CD-ROMs by artists. From 2000 to 2005 the Centre
					acquired 6,000 books.</note> It became an important repository for the new
				media art works funded by the foundation and an expanded place to collect
				archives from artists, institutions and events that represented the history of
				media arts.<note>
					https://www.fondation-langlois.org/html/e/page.php?NumPage=742.</note>
				Langlois renovated the Ex-Centris buildings which included theatres, gathering
				spaces, and a home for the documentation centre’s materials, with offices for
				visiting researchers. The DLF bought collections including those of stellar
				video artists the Vasulkas, and EAT, Experimental Art and Technology — the 9
				EVENINGS OF THEATRE AND ENGINEERING, an exhibition that heralded the opening of
				an American epoch of art and science collaboration. A robust web presence
				accompanied the centre, allowing users to identify artists and projects. In
				2005, the Documentation and Conservation of Media Arts Heritage (DOCAM) network,
				led by Alain de Pacard, was spearheaded by DLF, and comprised 20 institutions,
				from universities, to the prestigious new media journal <hi rend="italic"
					>Leonardo</hi>, to digital media centres and museums, with funding from
				SSHRC. It sought to create standards for the documentation, exhibition, and
				archiving of new media art works. DOCAM and the Education Centre invited
				artists, curators, and historians into this rich collection through a series of
				residencies. For example, in her residency, Dr. Caroline Langill produced <ref
					target="https://www.fondation-langlois.org/html/e/page.php?NumPage=742">
					<hi rend="italic">Shifting Polarities: Proposing a Canon of Canadian
						Electronic Media Art, 1970-1990</hi>
				</ref> (2006), an influential treatise that made the case that the contemporary
				art canon must expand to integrate new media art.<note> Xerox is used here to
					denote that Sheridan used Xerox processes rather than that she was a Xerox
					employee. </note>
			</p>
			<p>Over time Langlois’ attention drifted. His investments were not flourishing, and
				the cinemas at Ex-Centris were bleeding $2 million/year. By 2006, concerned
				about the sustainability of the documentation centre, Gagnon began approaching
				DOCAM members as well as the La Cinémathèque québécoise to take the centre’s
				holdings and turn them into an archive. Acquisition contracts stipulated that
				the Foundation was legally responsible to find a not-for-profit home if it
				stopped functioning. Gagnon left in 2008. Langlois was hard hit by the 2008
				financial crash. Access to the documentation centre ended with the collection
				boxed up and stored. International scholars and donors alike began to pressure
				the DLF to find a home for the collection. Ultimately, contractual obligations
				with individuals or agents who had donated their records, user activism, and the
				commitment of an individual, Jean Gagnon, resulted in a safe landing for this
				valuable archive. This transfer represents a deaccessioning best practice as
				defined by the SAS (2017). </p>
			<p>La Cinémathèque québécoise accepted the fonds as the director Pierre Renault was
				interested in new media. Gagnon moved to the CQ as head of collections in 2010.
				He immediately began negotiations with the DLF, and secured a grant of $75,000
				to move and update the finding aid and web site; the collection formally moved
				on October 11, 2011. No further acquisitions would occur, hence avoiding a
				debate about whether CQ should begin to acquire new media art works which could
				have halted the transfer of the collection. The DLF collection remains one of
				CQ’s most popular archives, with valuable holdings like the records of 1960s
				Xerox artist Sonia Sheridan.<note> https://www.docam.ca/index-2.html. </note>
			</p>
			<p>The DLF site also leads to the DOCAM project web site.<note> Partners are the
					National Gallery of Canada, Musée d’art contemporain de Montréal, Montreal
					Museum of Fine Arts, and Canadian Centre for Architecture including artists
					such as Janet Cardiff, Stan Douglas, Gary Hill, Nam June Paik, David
					Rokeby, Greg Lynn, and Bill Viola. Resources include a <hi rend="italic"
						>Preservation Guide for Technology-Based Artworks</hi>; a <hi
						rend="italic">Cataloguing Guide for New Media Collections</hi>; a  <hi
						rend="italic">Documentary Model</hi> adapted to media arts; <hi
						rend="italic">DOCAM Glossaurus</hi>, a bilingual terminological tool;
					and a <hi rend="italic">Technological Timeline</hi>, which includes both
					media artworks and technological components.</note> DOCAM research
				identified and investigated five axes that distinguish methodologies and tools
				needed to address the preservation and technological documentation of electronic
				works of art, relevant to all archives, museums, libraries, and other collecting
				agencies managing new media and digital arts collections:
				“conservation, documentation, cataloguing, history of technologies
				and terminology.” DOCAM includes case studies conducted with museum partners.
					<note> After Jean Gagnon left, the NGC terminated the role of media arts
					curator.</note> The association of the DOCAM and DLF sites is valuable
				because DOCAM provides a contextual understanding of the works in the collection
				as well as wisdom for current archives that collect physical, online, or
				post-Internet art (online with physical expression). Langlois recently
				subsidized the conversion of elements of the collection through emulation,
				including works with online links from Flash to HTML5 as many artists’ websites
				and related CD-ROM and DVD projects were built in Flash in the early 2000s.,
				Although proprietary, Flash provided highly malleable graphic design tools. This
				is a positive example of the archive’s originator in concert with the current
				archive taking responsibility for the ongoing maintenance of the fonds. </p>
			<p>When asked if he regretted the path that he took to create a media arts
				documentation centre, Gagnon indicated his belief that there was no other route
				available at the time. He had just left his role as Media Arts curator at the
				National Gallery of Canada and there was no capacity or interest there.<note>
					CodeZebra was emulated from Flash onto the HTML5 platform, maintaining the
					initial quality of its integrated web sites which began in 1997 and
					continued until 2004. Unfortunately, several of the servers where the
					original games and software resided are no longer connected and
					reconstructing the links from the last version of the software to the site
					is a project requiring future efforts.</note> He is concerned that CQ
				remains dependent on him for deep knowledge of the archive because there is no
				time or resources there to train another expert. </p>

				documentary, experimental documentary, narrative, synaesthetic, animation, and
				event documentation videotapes by artists and independent producers. The
				collections represent sixty years of production, an extensive archive of
				publications from the video and media art world and documentation of events,
				exhibitions, organizations, social movements, government policies, as well as
				the history of VIVO, founded in 1973. Over the last decade it has expanded its
				efforts to create fifteen special collections, as well as nine major fonds and
				five minor fonds. The CDMLA fonds align with Foster’s description of artists’
				engagement with archives. The CDMLA has developed finding aids and projects
				including exhibitions built from the collections and fonds with artists’
				residencies to reinterpret contents. They have raised funds to digitize aspects
				of the archive and provide effective navigation interfaces. In 2016-17, VIVO
				approached me to donate my materials to them from my earlier life as an artist,
				activist, and academic. I was the board president and an artist and curator

				Project and its photographic and print exhibitions relied heavily on film,

				Columbia — hence components of this collection are archives of archives, acting
				as a means of understanding what was collected and what was absent. The oral

			<p>As with Jean Gagnon and the DLF, VIVO relies on one person, Karen Knights, who is
				the current driving force behind the media archive, just as it relied on Crista
				Dahl for the print and print materials archive. I moved forward with the
				donation with the stipulation that we bring Simon Fraser University into the
				project as a formal partner, acting on lessons learned from the BNMI and DLF
				archives. Copies of my Women’s Labour History Project audio collection reside in
				the Royal British Columbia Museum archives, which were the first repository, and
				the SFU archive, where I am an alumna and recipient of an Honorary Doctorate.
				SFU has made a contractual commitment to acquire my collection should VIVO need
				to deaccession it. The responsibility for the digitization, maintenance, and
				dissemination of this fonds is shared between the archive (CDMLA), SFU, and me,
				the living donor. While there are currently affective ties to the collection on
				the part of VIVO, SFU, and me, the former could wane with generational change.
				We have curated a partnership to create an ecosystem that will link my fonds at
				VIVO with nine other relevant collections and interested organizations and
				research centres.<note>
					<ref target="https://www.vivomediaarts.com/"
						>https://www.vivomediaarts.com/</ref>.</note> Partners will gain by
				examining the histories and methodologies that shaped their institutions and
				fonds and by making connections between historical and contemporary actors
				including originating communities and individuals to explore reinterpretation
				and redescription.</p>
			<p>Our methods to develop the bridge are highly collaborative and include
				participatory design (Robertson &amp; Simonsen, 2013) incorporating Sabharwal’s
				concept of “socialized digital curation” (2021); visualization (Harris &amp;
				Harris, 2019; Bahde, 2017); and research-creation (2014) in a case study
				approach. We will undertake workshops to create the specification for the
				ecosystem and develop microsites that foreshadow the design. Metadata,
				annotation, and social media tagging tools (Fatona, 2021; Allison-Cassin, 2020)
				will be applied through metadata and redescription workshops with Indigenous,
				Black, and other community groups. Artist-in-the-archives and researcher
				workshops will encourage exploration, discovery, application, integration, and
				dissemination of archival contents. We will sketch visualizations that show
				relationships between fonds and metadata. A series of historical case studies by
				Dr. Andrea Fatona, Dana Claxton, Karen Knights, and me will include research,
				curation, and/or artmaking. </p>
			<p>
				<hi rend="italic">Conclusions</hi>
			</p>
			<p>Perhaps institutions, creators of archives, and their users all bear
				responsibility for the protection and continuity of archives. Individuals have
				affective ties to the artists and archives that house their work and that they
				have built, but it is not viable to rely only on a few knowledgeable and
				emotionally-attached individuals. Collections within institutions, alternative
				archives, and significant fonds would benefit from strategies and contracts that
				address deaccessioning and alternative repositories. Temporary forms of
				accessioning such as the storehouse may serve to test interest in a collection
				before its donation. Where possible, donor commitments to raise dollars for
				maintenance and dissemination in partnership with archives are beneficial but
				should not lead to excluding the acquisition of fonds from marginalized groups.
				Institutions need to address duty of care for fonds representing Indigenous
				knowledge and history. Knowledge dissemination that creates new interest and new
				proponents for an archive including its recovery and rereading is both an
				individual and an institutional responsibility. Dr. Jennifer Kennedy from
				Queen’s University serves as an example — she is exploring the BNMI archives to
				understand contemporary feminist practices in new media that were sparked
				through encounters at the BNMI events and its co-productions and became a strong
				advocate for its revitalization (2021). The partnership between VIVO, other
				archives, and community organizations and underrepresented groups should
				stimulate ongoing interpretation of my fonds. And the renewal of the BNMI’s
				Indigenous media archive through oral histories is testimony to effective user
				activism. </p>
