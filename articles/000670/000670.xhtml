                     transitory but significant initiatives in the media arts and digital media context.
                     Both suffered unanticipated project endings due to institutional and human agency
                     and are now in varying stages of recovery and rediscovery. A third personal artistic,

                     first two archives; administrators of this third archive have developed a dynamic
                     partnership strategy to prevent the same issues that resulted in the disappearance
                     of the BNMI and DLF archives.[1] In the instances of the BNMI and DLF, disappearance

                     				administrators of this third archive at the Christa Dahl Media Library and

                     				BNMI and DLF archives.<a class="noteRef" href="#d3e190">[1]</a> In the instances of the BNMI and DLF, disappearance has meant
                     				the removal from public access. Disappearance has a second meaning in the
                     				context of digital media whether online or platform (such as CDs, DVDs). As
                     				Grau, Hoth, and Wandl-Vogt (<span class="error"><a href="#grau">2019</a></span>) stress: “Due to lack of institutional
                     				support and rapid changes in storage and presentation media, works that
                     				originated ten years ago can no longer be recovered technically for exhibition
                     				or preservation purposes” [<a class="ref" href="#grau2019">Grau, Hoth, Wandl-Vogt 2019</a>, 20]. Giselle Beiguelman further asks, “How to deal in the
                     				field of preservation and conservation with files that disappear, works that
                     				stop functioning, services that vanish from one day to the next [<a class="ref" href="#beiguelman2019">Beiguelman 2019</a>, 118]?
                     				Media art works and Internet art rely on connections to databases, links, and
                     				third-party servers and services. Moreover, many works are interactive and
                     				contributor-driven so there is no easy beginning and end and often exist in many
                     				versions. Both interpretations of disappearance address the challenge that, as
                     				Sue Breakell suggests, “the records do not simply go through a life cycle from
                     				creation and currency through to interactivity and the archive but move in and
                     				out of currency” [<a class="ref" href="#breakell2008">Breakell 2008</a>, 4]. This is in part an argument to sustain institutional
                     				archives that mark a specific time period and to exert best practices such as
                     				emulation in preserving digital materials and licensing to allow the use of
                     				copyrighted materials. It is also an argument for the creators of collections,
                     				whether inside institutions (BNMI), or as alternative archives (DLF, CDMLA), to
                     				negotiate clear accessioning and deaccessioning relationships with their own
                     				institution (The Banff Centre) or potential partner institutions (DLF, CDMLA)
                     				early in the process of creating or acquiring an archive, or as soon as there
                     is
                     				a perceived sense of the significance of that collection, whether within the
                     				institution and/or the stakeholders that it serves. </div>

                  <div class="ptext" id="p2">The period of the late 1990s through the early twenty-first century was one of
                     				intense interest in archives on the part of institutions, governments, curators,
                     				and artists, and coincides with the creation of the BNMI and the DLF
                     				documentation centre. The “allure” of the archive, as Sue Breakell (<a href="#breakell2015">2015</a>) notes,
                     				was sparked by a heightened engagement with memory and the emergence of memory
                     				technologies (such as databases, hard drives, and centralized server storage).
                     				The drive to digitize meant that some records would be left behind, fueling
                     				concerns about inclusion, and about who should have the right to choose which
                     				materials would be digitized. The massive production of online materials seemed
                     				to some to be a gift towards a universal human memory; to others, “the more
                     				absolute knowledge on the Internet becomes, the harder it is to comprehend as
                     it
                     				[knowledge] transforms into an unreadable amount of data” [<a class="ref" href="#hoth2021">Hoth 2021</a>]. </div>

                  <div class="ptext" id="p3">Post-modernism challenged the authoritative nature of historical records and
                     				archives, in part instigated by Michel Foucault’s (<a href="#foucault1969">1969</a>) analysis of archives as
                     				a demonstration of relationships and institutions in process, perpetually
                     				incomplete repositories that represent power, through what is present and absent
                     				in their contents. Jacques Derrida in Archive Fever: A Freudian Impression,
                     				argues for the political nature of the archive, observing that power resides in
                     				control over its content and access. Anticipating the rise of the Internet and
                     				digital preservation, he astutely described a contemporary obsession with
                     				archives and the desire to preserve. He painted a tension between the public
                     				domain and personal memory materials that plays out today, for example, in
                     				debates about the right to be forgotten,<a class="noteRef" href="#d3e227">[2]</a> or the ways that social media intermingle
                     				personal and institutional commentary and politics, or the growing interface
                     				between personal health data collection and medical records. In An Archival
                     				Impulse (<span class="error"><a href="#foster2004">2004</a></span>), Hal Foster recognizes the archival turn and analyzes three kinds
                     				of artists’ works: those that use archival content, those where the artist
                     				performs methods drawn from archival practices, and those in which artists
                     				create unique archives. Powerful works have occurred when archivists invite
                     				artists into collections to create new interpretations. The Artist-in-Residency
                     				Program at the City of Portland Archives and Record Centre supported Portland
                     				Archives artists-in-residence Garrick Imatini and Kaia Sand. They interviewed
                     				selected subjects who were documented in the city’s Police Bureau’s surveillance
                     				fonds of 576 activists, augmenting the police fonds with “lives embedded, yet
                     				silenced, in the records”, resulting in a new understanding of that history
                     				and the expungement of criminal records [<a class="ref" href="#carbone2015">Carbone 2015</a>, 51]. Antonio
                     				Muntadas’ The File Room is at the same time both an emulation and critique of
                     
                     				archival practices and an archive in its own right. It is a project
                     				intentionally without an ending, a travelling installation of physical archival
                     				files and a connected and collectively created and ongoing database of instances
                     				of censorship–political, cultural, and scientific.<a class="noteRef" href="#d3e238">[3]</a> The historical context provides a framework for motivations

                     				describes accessioning as, “… the physical and legal addition of predominantly

                     				follows an archival appraisal decision identifying the records as having

                     				American Archivists (SAS) provides terms, process and considerations for
                     				deaccessioning <span class="error"><a class="ref" href="#americanarchivists2017">#americanarchivists2017</a></span>. Deaccessioning represents the removal of materials from
                     				an archive and is perceived by most archives to be a component of best
                     				practices, but it is understandably controversial. SAS argues that policy and
                     				guidelines are needed, with clear options for the materials deaccessioned.
                     				Decisions should be made by archivists, the archive, and its home institution.
                     				Processes need to be transparent, properly documented, and overseen in an
                     				ethical manner. The SAS suggests that deeds of gift should include clear
                     				deaccessioning terms. Reasons for deaccessioning materials include reappraisal
                     				of a collection’s relevance to institutional mandate, frequency of use, its
                     				potential research value, whether it would be more meaningful and better used
                     in
                     				a different repository, its condition, and maintenance costs. Other
                     				considerations include the ability to define provenance, or legal requirements
                     				to retain documents over time periods. Archives ideally seek a transfer of fonds
                     				to a different repository. They may return materials to original owners, or they
                     				may sell the collection or, ultimately, destroy the records. These routes are

                     				British Archive for Contemporary Writing has adopted two complementary
                     				practices, the creation of a “storehouse” and a “collection.” The first is the
                     				short-term loan of writers’ archives to support thematic archival research, for
                     				example for six months rather than the 20 years minimum required by most
                     				archives [<a class="ref" href="#whibley2019">Whibley, Sara 2019</a>]. The goal is that emerging writers will see BACW as a
                     				trusted agent, and that writers will provide their archives to the collection

                     				their careers mature [<a class="ref" href="#eastangila2022">University of East Anglia 2022</a>]. Licensing is an
                     				alternative to “deposit” as it allows multiple institutions to hold digital
                     				materials and retains the originator’s copyright. For example, with a deposit
                     				license, such as that of the Oxford University Research Archive (<a href="#ora2014">ORA, 2014</a>), the
                     				intellectual property creator retains their rights and can continue to license
                     				it and earn revenue and agrees to grant the University a non-exclusive,
                     				sub-licensable, worldwide license to store and access the work to the public.

                     <div class="ptext" id="p7">The Banff New Media Institute (BNMI) ran from 1995 to 2010 at The Banff Centre
                        				(TBC) in Alberta, Canada, on the heels of the centre’s early history of virtual
                        				reality and new media research. It was an international think tank on the
                        				present and future practices of new media, with leaders engaged in developing
                        				the science and technologies, creative and design practices, jurisprudence,
                        				business models, and theories; it was also a training hub and business
                        				incubator, with three research labs and a co-production program. BNMI staff
                        				curated exhibitions and events both at the Walter Phillips Gallery on site and
                        					abroad.<a class="noteRef" href="#d3e290">[5]</a>
                        				Over the course of its first ten years, it held over 150 summits, symposia,
                        				workshops, conferences, and events which were recorded (audio) and from which
                        				relevant records such as release forms, agendas, analysis of events, and other
                        				memorabilia were kept. Co-productions were described and catalogued, and the
                        				documentation made available on-line, as were exhibition descriptions and
                        				documentation. The BNMI created Horizonzero.ca, a Heritage Canada funded
                        				experimental online gallery and site for discourse regarding the new media world
                        				which acted as a guide back to the summits and co-productions. </div>

                     <div class="ptext" id="p8">The BNMI team were attentive to gender imbalance in the growth of the new media
                        				industry, the presence of female identified creative practitioners and their
                        				lack of inclusion in festivals, and the burgeoning of a diverse global creative
                        				new media community. As much as possible there was mitigation against digital
                        				exclusion, accepting George Gerbner’s concept of “symbolic annihilation,” where
                        				absence from the historical record removes practices and voices that could shape
                        				the future, a concept applied to archives by Caswell [<a class="ref" href="#caswell2016">Caswell, Cifor &amp; Ramirez 2016</a>] [<a class="ref" href="#caswell2014">Caswell 2014</a>].<a class="noteRef" href="#d3e305">[6]</a> A feature of BNMI was its deep commitment to
                        				Indigenous creators and technical leaders, whose creative practices and
                        				self-governed events were supported by BNMI (such as <cite class="title italic">Drum Beat
                           					to Drum Byte</cite>, two gatherings regarding Indigenous practices and
                        				presence on the Internet that were two decades apart). Indigenous artists,
                        				technicians, theorists, curators, and elders engaged in all manner of BNMI
                        				activities. BNMI also built collaborations with local Indigenous
                        					communities.<a class="noteRef" href="#d3e311">[7]</a> Despite its government
                        				and industry funding the BNMI fearlessly hosted agonistic debates over video
                        				game sexism, algorithmic bias, anthropocentric notions of intelligence,
                        				open-source vs copyright, bioengineering and environment, and other
                        				controversial topics.<a class="noteRef" href="#d3e317">[8]</a>

                     <div class="ptext" id="p9">In synch with Foucault, Derrida, and Foster’s calls to reexamine the archives, the
                        				BNMI held summits and workshops that considered the transition to digital
                        				archives; events debated memory and history, the archive versus the database and
                        				their ultimate integration, and the question of what should be digitized and how
                        				it should be conserved, with titles such as “Media, Material and Culture:
                        				Communicating Canada’s Heritage,” “Unforgiving Memory,” and “ReFresh” (which
                        				have become the biannual Media Art History conferences).<a class="noteRef" href="#d3e331">[9]</a> These
                        				strengthened the accelerating “archive fever” within the BNMI and the belief
                        				that it must leave a record of this complex era. That intuition is rewarded
                        				today as the BNMI fonds include documentation of prescient debates that are in
                        				contemporary reprise (such as the nature of social media, gender, and race bias
                        				in AI systems, the mapping potential of GPS/GIS technologies, or control over
                        				data), and engage deeply diverse actors regarding technologies, systems, tools,
                        				and creative expressions that have shaped our lives today.<a class="noteRef" href="#d3e340">[10]</a>

                     <div class="ptext" id="p10">For the archive project, a decade of audio recordings and documents were digitized
                        				and brought up to 2005 standards and a physical archive and finding aid were
                        				created by a professional archivist seconded from the National Archives Canada.
                        				There was an online interface which was searchable by events, names, and dates,
                        				and it was easily accessed on TBC’s website, as was the co-production catalogue.
                        				The BNMI team felt a contractual, financial, and emotional connection to the
                        				fonds. We had raised a significant amount of public funding to build this
                        				collection and create a related book. Speakers had signed release forms and
                        				expected that the associated materials would be present on the BNMI web site.
                        				The same contractual and affective bonds were not shared across The Banff
                        				Centre. In 2005 the BNMI team hoped that the fonds could reside with the Paul
                        				Fleck Library and Archive at the Banff Centre, but the Archive had no interest
                        				in the physical or digital archive nor did the archivist at that time recognize
                        				value in placing the BNMI fonds online.<a class="noteRef" href="#d3e345">[11]</a> I left
                        				TBC in 2005; Susan Kennard, then Director of the BNMI, left in 2010; and TBC
                        				closed the BNMI shortly afterwards. The digital archive persisted, available on
                        				the main web site, and was well used. Dr. Sarah Cook and I co-edited the book
                        					<cite class="title italic">Euphoria and Dystopia: The Banff New Media Institute
                           					Dialogues</cite> and it was published in 2011 by TBC and University of
                        				Waterloo’s Riverside Press.<a class="noteRef" href="#d3e350">[12]</a> The e-book version in 2013 was meticulously linked to the online archive
                        				as a thematic, discursive, and critical finding aid. The BNMI efforts
                        				represented a strategy for archival access comprising multiple interpretive
                        				publications (the e-book and Horizonzero.ca) linked to a digital archive. This
                        				approach is appropriate for reinvigorating archives, introducing fonds to new
                        				audiences, and making them available for creative interpretation by artists and
                        				new generations of scholars. </div>

                     <div class="ptext" id="p11">In 2016 Indigenous artist Cheryl L’Hirondelle found that the archive was no longer
                        				accessible and sounded an alert. Indeed, it had been removed after a change of
                        				leadership and a web rebranding and would never return to its original online
                        				form, thus severing all the meticulous links made to several thousand digital
                        				records and to the digital archives from other publications. Two years later,
                        				The Banff Centre did not renew the HorizonZero.ca domain or pay the small fee
                        				for hosting, so this legacy of the BNMI also disappeared. </div>

                     <div class="ptext" id="p12">Contributors to the archive – most poignantly Indigenous artists and historians –
                        				along with other scholars and archivists, the book publisher Philip Beesley,
                        				Sarah Cook, and I appealed to The Banff Centre to return the archive to
                        				researchers and the public again through a digital interface and volunteered to
                        				find or contribute funding. In 2018 TBC’s archivist John Yolkowski stepped in
                        				and moved the project from an IT-led web site initiative to an archive-led
                        				initiative. The physical fonds moved to the Paul Fleck Library and Archives and
                        				were accessioned. Work began and a number of documents were made available on
                        				the TBC’s archive site and mirrored on Alberta on Record.<a class="noteRef" href="#d3e383">[13]</a>
                        				Then Yolkowski left. Indigenous artists and media historians insisted that the
                        				Indigenous media arts history be reconstructed, as TBC was an epicenter of
                        				Indigenous and international media production, new media, and digital arts
                        				creativity. The Banff Centre acted on this in 2021 and hired a team of
                        				researchers to undertake an oral history of Indigenous media art at TBC, which
                        				is now completed. These efforts underscore the responsibility (Bergis, 2016)
                        				that institutions bear in relation to their engagement with Indigenous and other
                        				equity seeking communities if they collect and represent their data. </div>

                     <div class="ptext" id="p13">Perhaps The Banff Centre leadership perceived the BNMI archive as the expression
                        				of a specific leadership and their program priorities, not as an archive. While
                        				many institutions do retain program records, they are rarely featured as part
                        of
                        				a current marketing web site. There was no continuity in Banff’s Indigenous
                        				leadership, and hence no awareness of the archive’s Indigenous contents or
                        				advocate. Institutional memory is fragile at best; however, the formal nature
                        of
                        				an archive and the policies surrounding it can create some ballast. The
                        				collection represented consciously collected and ordered institutional records,
                        				but it was not an archive – in this period it was not yet appraised or perceived
                        				as having “enduring” institutional value and hence formally accessioned. Rather,
                        				it was a counter archive within an institution. TBC has a deaccessioning policy
                        				in place for its visual art collection, and its Paul Fleck Library and Archives
                        				holdings, but the BNMI archive, treated as an orphan record of program contents,
                        				was not covered under this policy. </div>

                     <div class="ptext" id="p14">It is valuable, nonetheless, to consider the principles of deaccessioning in
                        				collections management as defined by the SAS (<span class="error"><a href="#sas2017">2017</a></span>). Richard Gerrard (<a href="#gerrard2013">2013</a>) in
                        				his instructional text on deaccessioning lays out the rigorous staged nature of
                        				removing collections: due diligence institutional governance processes are
                        				required. The driver should be to improve the collection, and the goal of
                        				disposal to find a new home more able to house a collection. Writing on

                        				Lar-son says of deaccessioning that materials should be returned to the original
                        				donors or holders of a collection. This principle is relevant for HorizonZero.ca
                        				as the “tell” issue included a reversioning of the Elderspeak website of the
                        				Meadow Lake Tribal Council with their permission as they could no longer host
                        				the original Elderspeak collection of stories. The issue was edited by Cheryl
                        				L’Hirondelle who undertook that reversioning. With the end of Horizonzero.ca,
                        an
                        				unforeseen consequence was that MLTC lost access to Elderspeak although it is
                        				present on the Internet Archive.<a class="noteRef" href="#d3e415">[14]</a>
                        				With L’Hirondelle’s support, MLTC will work with the DVD version and

                        in

                        				arranged for a second repository. Alternatively, The Banff Centre could have
                        				returned the BNMI archive to Cook, Diamond, and Beesley and enabled them to find
                        				a home, as several institutions stepped up to offer to take it — but even that

                     <div class="ptext" id="p16">The second case study underscores the importance of establishing a back-up
                        				repository. The Daniel Langlois Foundation Centre for Research and Documentation
                        				was initiated in 1998 by Jean Gagnon with the support of Daniel Langlois, the
                        				co-founder of Softimage.<a class="noteRef" href="#d3e471">[18]</a> It became an important repository for the new
                        				media art works funded by the foundation and an expanded place to collect
                        				archives from artists, institutions and events that represented the history of
                        				media arts.<a class="noteRef" href="#d3e473">[19]</a>
                        				Langlois renovated the Ex-Centris buildings which included theatres, gathering
                        				spaces, and a home for the documentation centre’s materials, with offices for
                        				visiting researchers. The DLF bought collections including those of stellar
                        				video artists the Vasulkas, and EAT, Experimental Art and Technology — the 9
                        				EVENINGS OF THEATRE AND ENGINEERING, an exhibition that heralded the opening of
                        				an American epoch of art and science collaboration. A robust web presence
                        				accompanied the centre, allowing users to identify artists and projects. In
                        				2005, the Documentation and Conservation of Media Arts Heritage (DOCAM) network,
                        				led by Alain de Pacard, was spearheaded by DLF, and comprised 20 institutions,
                        				from universities, to the prestigious new media journal <cite class="title italic">Leonardo</cite>, to digital media centres and museums, with funding from
                        				SSHRC. It sought to create standards for the documentation, exhibition, and
                        				archiving of new media art works. DOCAM and the Education Centre invited
                        				artists, curators, and historians into this rich collection through a series of
                        				residencies. For example, in her residency, Dr. Caroline Langill produced <a href="https://www.fondation-langlois.org/html/e/page.php?NumPage=742" onclick="window.open('https://www.fondation-langlois.org/html/e/page.php?NumPage=742'); return false" class="ref"><cite class="title italic">Shifting Polarities: Proposing a Canon of Canadian

                     <div class="ptext" id="p17">Over time Langlois’ attention drifted. His investments were not flourishing, and
                        				the cinemas at Ex-Centris were bleeding $2 million/year. By 2006, concerned
                        				about the sustainability of the documentation centre, Gagnon began approaching
                        				DOCAM members as well as the La Cinémathèque québécoise to take the centre’s
                        				holdings and turn them into an archive. Acquisition contracts stipulated that
                        				the Foundation was legally responsible to find a not-for-profit home if it
                        				stopped functioning. Gagnon left in 2008. Langlois was hard hit by the 2008
                        				financial crash. Access to the documentation centre ended with the collection
                        				boxed up and stored. International scholars and donors alike began to pressure
                        				the DLF to find a home for the collection. Ultimately, contractual obligations
                        				with individuals or agents who had donated their records, user activism, and the
                        				commitment of an individual, Jean Gagnon, resulted in a safe landing for this
                        				valuable archive. This transfer represents a deaccessioning best practice as
                        				defined by the SAS (<a href="sas2017" onclick="window.open('sas2017'); return false" class="ref">2017</a>). </div>

                     <div class="ptext" id="p18">La Cinémathèque québécoise accepted the fonds as the director Pierre Renault was
                        				interested in new media. Gagnon moved to the CQ as head of collections in 2010.
                        				He immediately began negotiations with the DLF, and secured a grant of $75,000
                        				to move and update the finding aid and web site; the collection formally moved
                        				on October 11, 2011. No further acquisitions would occur, hence avoiding a
                        				debate about whether CQ should begin to acquire new media art works which could
                        				have halted the transfer of the collection. The DLF collection remains one of
                        				CQ’s most popular archives, with valuable holdings like the records of 1960s 
                        				Xerox artist Sonia Sheridan.<a class="noteRef" href="#d3e499">[21]</a>

                        					<a class="noteRef" href="#d3e529">[23]</a> The association of the DOCAM and DLF sites is valuable
                        				because DOCAM provides a contextual understanding of the works in the collection
                        				as well as wisdom for current archives that collect physical, online, or
                        				post-Internet art (online with physical expression). Langlois recently
                        				subsidized the conversion of elements of the collection through emulation,
                        				including works with online links from Flash to HTML5 as many artists’ websites
                        				and related CD-ROM and DVD projects were built in Flash in the early 2000s.,
                        				Although proprietary, Flash provided highly malleable graphic design tools. This
                        				is a positive example of the archive’s originator in concert with the current
                        				archive taking responsibility for the ongoing maintenance of the fonds. </div>

                        				the current driving force behind the media archive, just as it relied on Crista
                        				Dahl for the print and print materials archive. I moved forward with the
                        				donation with the stipulation that we bring Simon Fraser University into the
                        				project as a formal partner, acting on lessons learned from the BNMI and DLF
                        				archives. Copies of my Women’s Labour History Project audio collection reside
                        in
                        				the Royal British Columbia Museum archives, which were the first repository, and
                        				the SFU archive, where I am an alumna and recipient of an Honorary Doctorate.
                        				SFU has made a contractual commitment to acquire my collection should VIVO need
                        				to deaccession it. The responsibility for the digitization, maintenance, and
                        				dissemination of this fonds is shared between the archive (CDMLA), SFU, and me,
                        				the living donor. While there are currently affective ties to the collection on
                        				the part of VIVO, SFU, and me, the former could wane with generational change.
                        				We have curated a partnership to create an ecosystem that will link my fonds at

                  <div class="ptext" id="p26">Perhaps institutions, creators of archives, and their users all bear
                     				responsibility for the protection and continuity of archives. Individuals have
                     				affective ties to the artists and archives that house their work and that they
                     				have built, but it is not viable to rely only on a few knowledgeable and
                     				emotionally-attached individuals. Collections within institutions, alternative
                     				archives, and significant fonds would benefit from strategies and contracts that
                     				address deaccessioning and alternative repositories. Temporary forms of
                     				accessioning such as the storehouse may serve to test interest in a collection
                     				before its donation. Where possible, donor commitments to raise dollars for
                     				maintenance and dissemination in partnership with archives are beneficial but
                     				should not lead to excluding the acquisition of fonds from marginalized groups.
                     				Institutions need to address duty of care for fonds representing Indigenous
                     				knowledge and history. Knowledge dissemination that creates new interest and new
                     				proponents for an archive including its recovery and rereading is both an
                     				individual and an institutional responsibility. Dr. Jennifer Kennedy from
                     				Queen’s University serves as an example — she is exploring the BNMI archives to
                     				understand contemporary feminist practices in new media that were sparked
                     				through encounters at the BNMI events and its co-productions and became a strong
                     				advocate for its revitalization (<span class="error"><a href="#bnmi2021">2021</a></span>). The partnership between VIVO, other
                     				archives, and community organizations and underrepresented groups should
                     				stimulate ongoing interpretation of my fonds. And the renewal of the BNMI’s
                     				Indigenous media archive through oral histories is testimony to effective user
                     				activism. </div>
