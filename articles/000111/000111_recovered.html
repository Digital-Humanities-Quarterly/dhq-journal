            <h1>Pertinent Discussions Toward Modeling the <em>Social</em> Edition: Annotated Bibliographies</h1>

                <p>In the very early days of the world wide web, but well into a period in which our community understood the positive and transformative impact that computational technique has had on scholarly editing, we were reminded that literary studies are, and always have been, focused on engagement with texts regardless of interpretive theoretical predisposition. In digital literary studies, that textual focus manifests in a number of theories about the nature of the text in general and the electronic scholarly edition in particular, and has developed to the point that we can begin to construct, in a relatively straightforward manner, a basic typology of electronic scholarly editions via the approach each type takes in handling and engaging with its textual materials: from edited electronic text plus analytical tools for its readers (dynamic text), to text plus a static set of additional supporting materials in digital form for reader navigation and subsequent analysis (hypertextual edition), to text augmented by both dynamic analytical means and hypertextually-linked access to fixed resources plus automated means of discovering and interrelating external resources (dynamic edition).  Such a typology, reductive as it may be, allows us to look forward – as many leaders in our field have encouraged us to do, variously – to what lies ahead in our treatment of the texts, and the textual editions, that sit at the core of our contemplation in literary studies and similar disciplines.</p>  
                    <p>Well into what is often called the new age of the internet – becoming immersed as we are in a generation of online tools facilitating collaboration, information sharing, and interoperability; becoming immersed as we are by social media interaction on the web – it is worth noting that the types of electronic scholarly editions we see prominently today were largely developed before the ubiquity of the web that we now enjoy, and do not accurately reflect the full range of useful possibilities present for academic engagement and interaction around the textual materials that are our focus. While the electronic medium is most certainly a productive space in which to present and analyse editions, it is increasingly difficult to ignore the influence of new and emerging possibilities for the electronic scholarly edition in the current phase in the social formation of the web.  As such, our understanding of the electronic scholarly edition in its current form requires reconsideration in light of the collaborative potential of already extant and newly-emerging digital technologies; put another way, we need to extend our understanding of the scholarly edition in light of new models of edition production that embrace social networking and its commensurate tools.  Toward understanding the scholarly edition in the context of new and emerging social media, our work – which comprises the article <span class="titlem">Toward Modeling the Social Edition: An Approach to Understanding the Electronic Scholarly Edition in the Context of New and Emerging Social Media</span> (conjointly published in <span class="titlem">LLC</span>) and these bibliographies – offer an early engagement of pertinent issues and, ultimately, a utility-based consideration in an academic context of the toolkit that allows us to consider the social edition as an extension of the traditions in which it is situated and which it has the potential to inform productively.</p> 
                   <p>In this work, we consider a typology of electronic scholarly editions adjacent to activities common to humanities scholars who engage texts as expert readers, noting therein that many methods of engagement both reflect the interrelated nature of long-standing professional reading strategies and are social in nature; extending this framework, the next steps in the scholarly edition’s development in its incorporation of social media functionality reflect the importance of traditional humanistic activities and workflows, and include collaboration, incorporating contributions by its readers and re-visioning the role of the editor away from that of ultimate authority and more toward that of facilitator of reader involvement.  The two annotated bibliographies present in this publication work to document and feature pertinent discussions toward the activity of modeling the <em>social</em> edition, first exploring reading devices, tools and social media issues and, second, social networking tools for professional readers in the Humanities.</p>

                    <p>This survey supports those interested in exploring the development of collaborative work in academics, leading up to and including the use of the Internet and Social Media (SM). From a situation where the Internet had just become open to the mainstream public, up until now, we have seen great changes in the possibilities and ways of thinking that concern collaborative academic work. In this list, the focus shifts from collaborative work mainly to support student learning, to general collaborative work. This is perhaps logical, as collaboration on a greater scale, including sharing of information online – as opposed to in-university collaboration – has only begun to materialize fairly recently. The materials will reflect the relative novelty of the application in academia and offer a wide range of topics that can be explored further.</p>
                        
                    <p>From two sections that provide a base in the history of collaborative reading, current practices are presented: reflecting on how often and in which fashion Social Media are currently used and consecutively providing a number of small-scale experiments and recommendations to engage more widespread use. Referencing and soft peer-review are also included as these are important issues in the changing world of academic scholarship because of the influence of Web 2.0.

                        <p>Prior to the advent of online Social Media, several attempts have been made to offer students, teachers and researchers digital environments to facilitate the research workflow. These three – mostly theoretical – articles have been influential in academic research on digital (shared) annotation. </p>

                            <p>In this article, the authors first give an overview of the field of annotation systems, starting with offline software such as MS Word. It gives insight in a wide variety of annotation tools with different underlying principles, most of which are now obsolete. A number of these systems were meant for online use, and some of the systems described show how the hyperlink was still a point of focus in academic research. The authors then report a qualitative survey on paper annotation, one of the findings of which is that scholars primarily highlight and write in margins (as opposed to writing on top of the text or between the lines for instance); another result was that reasons for annotation are to remember, to think, to clarify and to share. Sharing is seen as least important by the authors and is of secondary importance to their research, as the authors claim is not typical of the academic environment to do so and more of interest for business purposes. The authors suggest a taxonomy which classifies annotations with respect to their content, form and functionality. Consecutively, based on this taxonomy Annotation Technology (AT) is developed, ‘a set of recommendations for software design’ (p. 340). Interesting features are: non-local referencing, where annotations on a similar topic across documents is recognized; a tight integration of note-taking and reader ergonomics which includes a <span class="term">non-menu approach</span>; the importance of linking, which includes the use of URLs to point to specific notes; the separate storage of annotations in a database - or several databases, so the reader is able to choose which ones to publish; intelligent automated search; format-independent anchors so readers can annotate any type of document. The authors see automated annotation search as the greatest benefit over paper annotation. In the last section, the authors present Annotator, a tool built on AT, which is described in detail. Further research is said to be directed at annotation-driven search.</p></li><li class="item"><strong><span class="bibl">Marshall, Catherine C. <span class="titlem">Annotation: From Paper Books to the Digital Library.</span> (1997). <span class="titlem">Proceedings of the Second ACM International Conference on Digital Libraries</span>.

                                <p>An influential study on the annotation behavior of college students in their (paper) university textbooks. The author studied used textbooks from a campus bookstore, with as many samples of the same edition of a textbook as possible. Student selection criteria concerning the annotations as they bought used textbooks were also taken into account. Annotations are generally seen as private, whereas in this case students would sometimes select the books on the quality of the annotations. The annotations in the selected books were then classified by form and function. The author classifies a total of six functions, among which aids to memory and records of interpretative activity. In the final section implications for annotations in the digital library are discussed, where the author notes that in the design of new facilities, four conditions should be supported: annotation <em>in</em> the text, but distinguishable from the original text; non-interpretive markings; fluidity of form (freeform type of annotation) and informal codings (being able to switch between colors or implement systems). </p>

                                <p>This article is focused on annotation to aid student learning. In the first section, the author provides a description of the use of annotation in medieval manuscript culture, explaining how digital annotation can provide these same functions and more. The goal of the article is to provide a review of current tooling, but to prevent the information of becoming outdated too soon, the author has described different groups of annotation tools, discerning them through context: annotations readers make to themselves; annotations readers make and are meant to be shared with the author; annotations readers make and are meant to be shared with other readers; annotations from the author, intended for readers. This division is perhaps no longer as relevant as the social web has rendered the distinction between these roles less important, but it is nevertheless an interesting starting point to consider the different functionalities tools provide. The author then describes seven factors in which tools can vary, including input, anchor, storage and searching and filtering. The four types of context are then analyzed, providing first possible strategies of form and function by reviewing literature on the topic, followed by examples of annotation tools. The author has included a wide variety of tools. Examples in the first group are a dedicated reader, XLibris (<a class="link_ref" href="http://www.fxpal.com/?p=xlibris">http://www.fxpal.com/?p=xlibris</a>), that has flexible annotation options, including linking of a single annotation to several text fragments and Animal Landlord, a tool for classroom video annotation. In the second group, MS Word 2000 and iMarkup are discussed. In the final section, the author discusses difficulties for research groups and companies in developing and maintaining their tools. An interesting example is mentioned, ThirdVoice (1999), which gave readers the opportunity to annotate web pages, resulting in law suits from companies who did not care for unpermitted comments. The more recent Google Sidewiki (<a class="link_ref" href="http://www.google.com/sidewiki/intl/nl/index.html">http://www.google.com/sidewiki/intl/nl/index.html</a>) faced the same problem. The author sees future possibilities in stylus-based annotation and sharing and suggest that a reader/annotator might want to be able to switch between interfaces, when either annotating themselves or reading another person’s notes for instance.</p></li></ul>

                        <p>From academia, there have been (and still are) numerous attempts to build social platforms for shared learning and reading, which has eventually developed into a distinct discipline (Computer Supported Collaborative Learning) - stressing the value of shared information processing through the computer. Two influential earlier systems are described in this section, CoNote which makes use of the web and CSILE which works on a local network. CSILE eventually developed into the still available Knowledge Forum (<a class="link_ref" href="http://www.knowledgeforum.com">http://www.knowledgeforum.com</a>). Both make use of restricted groups in an educational setting.</p>

                                <p>This article shows an interesting conceptual model for collaborative work through annotation, offering anchored discussions in documents. The authors present CoNote, a collaborative system that is based on shared annotation. First the system is described. CoNote is an online system that requires no additional client software, and functions on HTML and ASCII text. The annotations are anchored - although horizontally separated from the base text and thus interrupting the annotated text - and comments upon comments can be made. The annotations function much like a discussion forum: the annotations appear as links in a structured tree; the links contain meta-data: the title, author and date of creation; and creation of annotations is done by filling out a form. The annotations took the shape of questions and answers. The authors then briefly describe the conceptual model behind the system. The system can for instance be used by a group with a shared set of documents and users can have different roles. In the fourth section a trial during an introductory college computer science course (Fall 2004) is discussed. Findings were that students who performed less were helped by the annotations, that the students could answer each others questions correctly, that they expected fast responses because of the connection to the Internet and that the students conducted much work at home. Future research is said to be directed at refinement of the system and implementation in other settings.</p>

                               <p>This article shows nicely how education has been changing over the last decades, due to the widespread adoption of digital media. The authors first provide a theoretical background in education and software. They sketch the current educational situation and stress the importance of knowledge building over knowledge reproduction. They argue that the desktop metaphor of the personal computer, because it is intended for business use, hinders the educational possibilities of the machine. Consecutively, a framework for knowledge building is sketched, according to a constructivist view, where coherence and completeness are central concepts, built through social activity. In this global perspective, six features are added, such as source referencing in order to facilitate situating of information. The authors then describe their implementation of a second-order computing facility, computer-supported intentional learning environments (CSILE). The system itself is not based on documents provided, but allows students to make texts and comment on one another. The process is not described (or shown) in much detail however. CSILE was implemented in local networks of several grade schools and proved to be successful for the goals the authors had formulated. Note: CSILE eventually evolved into Knowledge Forum, which still exists: <a class="link_ref" href="http://www.knowledgeforum.com">http://www.knowledgeforum.com</a>.</p>

                        <p>In recent years, a number of articles and reports have been published on scholars’ attitudes and practices towards Social Media and Web 2.0. Some small-scale, others spanning five years of study, these show a largely coherent and perhaps not surprising image: a small group of academics is experimenting (in all academic disciplines), but most scholars are still apprehensive of the possible downsides and prefer ‘traditional’ academic publishing and peer review as long as there is no sound alternative - and many do not expect there to be one in the near future. Interestingly enough, the younger scholars often appear the most rigid, but this can be easily explained as they can (or will) take few risks in trying to obtain tenure or recognition.</p>

                                <p>Report issued by Emerald Publishing Group to CIBER on Social Media use among scholars of several disciplines. The researchers focused on retrieving the survey from users of Social Media (n=1923) but compared it to a set of non-users (n=491), all geographically dispersed and from several disciplines. The findings suggest two broad kinds of Social Media user: one who conjointly uses microblogging, social tagging/bookmarking and blogging (and who is also likely to own an iPad); one who uses SM for sharing documents, organizing meetings and their calenders. The former is the least established; the newest Social Media are the least popular in general. Findings are similar to that of the Research Information Network (2011): interinstitutional collaboration is an important incentive (reported as peer pressure outside of the institution); SM acts as a <em>complement</em> to traditional publishing; lack of time and lack of knowledge on the benefits are important barriers; personal motivation is important. A difference with aforementioned report: users under 35 appeared to be more prone to use of Social Media, although the general use is not limited to that group. Other findings include: the scholars did not use niche tools especially developed for their purposes, but general tools like Skype, Wikipedia and Facebook; and a peculiar outcome: uptake is smaller in Asia and North-America than the rest of the world. (p.14) The questioned users also gave recommendations for publishers, they would like to have better access, and articles linked with data; and from libraries they requested easy full-text search.

Over all disciplines, according to the authors, scholars tend to hold onto traditional publishing values, looking onto peer review as Churchill’s democracy: it is seen as the least worse measure of quality and a filter for the amount of research available. Young scholars are the most rigid. The authors as a result have identified five key areas that need attention according to the interviewees (p. V), which after realisation would lead to a situation close to current practices, including peer-reviewed journals and tenure. Thus, Social Media are not seen nor wanted as an important part of scholarly communication. The discipline of Digital Humanities is mentioned as an exception several times.

                            <div class="p">Association of Research Libraries research conducted by Ithaka on the use of digital scholarly resources. It is based on in-depth interviews with humanities, social sciences and STM scholars in the US and Canada. The researchers identified resources of which scholars report use, but <span class="quote_inline">limited to resources containing born-digital content by and for a scholarly audience</span>, among which E-only journals, preprints, blogs and discussion forums; social tools for the general public like Facebook or Diigo were excluded. The article describes these eight types of resource, their role in academics, providing description and images of examples in all three academic areas. The scholars report that the resources need to 1) give access to current research 2) facilitate exchange among scholars and 3) supply useful co-location of works. STM scholars focused on the first, humanities and social science on the second. The authors draw several conclusions from the interviews, including: digital innovations are taking place in all disciplines; digital publishing in academia has a long tail (many niche publications); for a digital publication establishing credibility is important - many of the more frequently mentioned publications existed at least several years; and sustainability is a general problem. The authors conclude with a brief section on how librarians can use this information in their work of selection of materials.</div>

The authors identify nine factors influencing adoption, many of which institutional. The most important are 1) local support, i.e. encouragement from within the institution - unfamiliarity often prohibits use and as researchers report lack of time as a reason for adoption, making encouragement from within the institution crucial and 2) bottom-up implementation instead of top-down, thus no imposition of tooling but service providing and information exchange. Another finding is that frequent and occasional users use Web 2.0 as a supplement rather than a replacement of traditional media. Lack of trust in non-peer reviewed resources is an important factor in this, among users and non-users. Collaborative research activities are also often an incentive for the uptake. </p>

                                <p>Full report on which Procter et al (2010) have published results. Although conducted among UK researchers only, this report provides a wealth of information on scholarly communication and Web 2.0. It is well-structured and freely available online in a well-designed screen-friendly version. The report first defines contours of adoption. The authors signal that although scholars remain loyal to traditional forms of publication, they are not hostile towards the digital possibilities. Adaption is most likely when stimulated locally and when needed for interinstitutional collaboration. Social Media are seen as a supplement rather than a replacement for traditional research and publishing. Then the authors describe five case studies, among which arts-humanities.net (<a class="link_ref" href="http://arts-humanities.net/">http://arts-humanities.net/</a>) and PLoS (Public Library of Science, <a class="link_ref" href="http://www.plos.org/">http://www.plos.org/</a>). These indicate that their uptake is now in the hands of a small group of enthusiasts. The authors signal that growth of these platforms is important for their survival, but sustainability and stability need to be safe-guarded beforehand. In the final chapter, the implications are discussed for universities, funders and researchers, making recommendations for further adoption. University computing and information services are explicitly mentioned as important possible stimulators for the uptake of Web 2.0 tools.</p>

                        <p>As the general research reports on scholarship and Social Media and Web 2.0 show that uptake in universities is in its infancy, a perspective from the tools that are available currently might provide insight on future possibilities of supporting the academic workflow and communication. These originate in academia (Zotero) but more often in the trade or non-profit sector (Diigo, Twitter) or through collaborations (CommentPress). Trials have been conducted and research has been performed within universities and libraries that can unveil new opportunities for digitally supported research.</p>

                                <p>The author discusses a different model for digital publishing. The argument is built up from the perspective that experiments have relied too often on the metaphor of the codex and the incorrect notion of the single, isolated academic author and reader. Instead, the author states, the metaphor of the network, allowing for dialogue, is more efficient, with the blog as a good starting point. This has materialized in CommentPress, an open source Wordpress theme and plugin. The author then describes several experiments with the model, conducted with the Institute for the Future of the Book: G4M3R 7TH30RY (the web version of the book <span class="titlem">Gamer Theory</span> by McKenzie Wark, <a class="link_ref" href="http://www.futureofthebook.org/gamertheory/">http://www.futureofthebook.org/gamertheory/</a>) which was the basis for CommentPress; and consecutively two projects taken up to develop CommentPress further: Mitchell Stephens’s article <span class="titlem">Holy of Holies</span> and a commentable version of the Iraq Study Group Report.

                                <p>In 2005, a new class of social bookmarking tools was arising that catered more to academic needs, which meant the inclusion of metadata. In this article, such bookmarking tools are discussed. After a brief discussion of the origin of links, including taxonomies and bookmarklets, the authors describe the nature of tagging (participatory, bottom-up instead of a top-down process, a flat structure instead of hierarchical) and the reason for tagging - most tools discussed are bookmarking sites where users tag content by others intended for personal use. The authors then briefly identify benefits, such as being able to locate information in a smaller pool than the whole web; and a few issues, among which privacy. The authors have built link lists in Connotea (<a class="link_ref" href="http://www.connotea.org/">http://www.connotea.org/</a>) to demonstrate the usefulness of the tool. These provide invaluable information by following them now - several years after publication. The authors had used a complex tag to accompany the article to prevent others using the same tag for different topic. However, the tag they have chosen to accompany the article is not unique (anymore) and spamming appears to be an issue. The most useful lists in the current day are those that combine the tag with the references restricted by poster, in this case the references that were tagged by one of the authors of the article. This indicates the usefulness of a filter. The authors end with a summary of elements usually present in social bookmarking tools.  An accompanying article focuses on one of the bookmarking tools mentioned, Connotea:

                                <p>The author first describes previous research on the motivation for blogging, which is a small base of research, often auto-ethnographic. The author states that it was possible to identify recurrent themes however, among which information or knowledge management, social purposes and expressing opinions. A qualitative research method was then employed, by conducting in-depth semi-structured  interviews with twelve Swedish, Dutch and Danish blogging researchers in 2009, from a variety of disciplines, including humanities and STM who were selected through snowball sampling. The author has also used the blogs themselves in analyzing the interviews. From the material, six functions were distilled: disseminating content, expressing opinions, keeping up-to-date and remembering, writing, interacting and creating relationships (although not every blogger mentions them all). The author elaborates on these functions, using ample quotes from the interviews. Motivations for blogging were then extracted from the interviewees’ statements on the functions: 1) sharing with others, 2) providing room for creativity and 3) feeling connected. Sharing (1) is not reserved for academic peers, especially in the STM sector, where people from the industry also follow the blogs. The mentioned creativity (2) originates from fact that the bloggers can write with less restriction than in articles, and can thus be used to develop and organize ideas. The bloggers mention strong personal motivations for keeping their blogs, even though they are not part of their academic publishing record and the researchers do not think it will aid their careers in the near future. A table shows the interplay of the functions and motivations and the intended audience (self or others).</p>

The direct citations are called first-order, the citations which linked to an intermediary web page are second-order citations. The authors also conducted qualitative research by doing interviews. Reasons given for not citing directly are workflow and the existence of a paywall, which was supported by the quantitative data. Citing in Tweets is reported to be seen as part of an ongoing conversation. The participants favored the speed with which articles spread (also supported by the quantitative data). Moreover, the platform aided their daily academic process: Twitter functions as a filter and helps point to interesting articles. The authors conclude by stating that Twitter citations could be a valuable part of bibliometrics to supplement traditional citation analysis.</p>

As the Digital Humanities (DH) community is known as an early adopter of such technologies, tweets from three DH conferences from June through September 2009 were used. The Tweets were collected and archived by Twapper Keeper (<a class="link_ref" href="http://www.twapperkeeper.com">http://www.twapperkeeper.com</a>). The database was analysed using qualitative and quantitative methods. Automated analysis was hindered because of the use of abbreviations, different spellings, etc. due to the maximum length of a Tweet (140 characters). Tweets were categorized manually according to types of <em>user intention</em> for which the authors have developed their own categories: comments on presentations; sharing resources; discussions and conversations; jotting down notes; establishing an online presence; and asking organizational questions. (p. 219) Most of the Tweets fell into the category of ‘jotting down notes’, indicating that sharing is more important than collaboration. The findings also suggest that a minority of users generates a great proportion of the Tweets, whereas many users produce none or only one Tweet during the conference, indicating an unevenness of use. Regulation by the organizers of the conference (communicating a hashtag up front for instance) could improve this situation according to the authors. Consecutively, the users with the highest amount of tweets were sent an online survey, resulting in 11 responses, where the aggregation of proceedings for other attendees (through ‘jotting down notes’) was also mentioned as most important. The authors conclude by stating, among other things, that the backchannel of Tweets offer more than ‘whispering in class’ but that <span class="quote_inline">new, dedicated methodologies for the analysis and understanding of Tweet-based corpora are necessary</span>.

                                <p>This article describes a Social Media tool that has been built in academia (within the discipline of Computer Supported Collaborative Learning) to support collaborative learning, PAMS 2.0. An overview of earlier research in and outside CSCL is first given, including several approaches to collaborative and cooperative learning. Then, PAMS 2.0 is described. PAMS 1.0 was not Web-based whereas this version is. Some features that are mentioned: PAMS 2.0 makes use of the Web Services Resource Framework technology (WSRF), which is XML-based; readers can annotate on document files and web pages - although they the latter have to be imported; it allows for role assignment; and it provides synchronous discussion possibilities next to the read/annotation space. Consecutively, an experiment is discussed. Two groups of student volunteers - one using PAMS, the other not - read, annotated and discussed materials during a semester, which they were tested on in five iterations. The students using PAMS performed equally to the other group at the beginning of the trial, but performed better at the end. The authors hope to implement the system on the Web. This article not only shows the possible benefits of this system, it also provides an indication of the possible benefit of using (semi-)commercial applications in educational settings, for instance Diigo. Not much research as yet has been done on such platforms. </p>

The study was conducted at Sawyer Business School of Suffolk University in Boston, Massachusetts. This research shows that when readers make long-term use of a e-reading device, adoption becomes more likely.  Annotation possibilities were seen as an important aspect. Especially the tablet was seen as an interesting option for reading - and these allow for collaborative reading, although the study does not report on this opportunity. 
                                    Other researches mention the strain of annotation and hightlighting - and thus never get to the social part of annotation - if it was available at all in the chosen device at that time, see for instance:

                    <p>Peer review is central to academic recognition and it is one of the main concerns when Social Media and online publishing are discussed: how does one guarantee quality, that is to say filter information without it? This section includes an essay confronting this issue and an article that proposes to include Web-based metrics to obtain recognition.</p>

                            <p>An alternative model for measuring academic impact is suggested, including Social Media data but still built around single article reference. First, the authors offer a quick discussion of existing models, the most important of which is the Journal Impact Factor (JIF) which is used by tenure committees but only measures the impact of journals as a whole. In the third section, tables are presented with practical overviews that can serve as a basis for scientometrics: 1) an overview of several types of Social Media, aimed at the general and specifically at the academic public (often in science); 2) an overview of research recommending and discussing webmetrics. The authors consecutively supply a list of data sources explaining why and how these can be used for scientometrics and what the pitfalls are. This list includes reference managers, comments on articles, microblogging and blogging. In the conclusions, the application of scientometrics is discussed cautiously. The main uses described are evaluation, filtering and study and mapping of scholarship. The authors end with a discussion of the limitations and opportunities, encouraging new research.</p>

                            <p>In developing the online scholarly publishing network MediaCommons (see <a class="link_ref" href="http://mediacommons.futureofthebook.org/">http://mediacommons.futureofthebook.org/</a>) with the Institute of the Future of the Book, the author was often questioned about peer review, as the articles shared through this platform will not be peer-reviewed in the traditional sense. The topic of digital scholarly peer review is addressed in this essay. The author first notes that on the Web in general, the shift in authority towards decentralization is accepted, but that in academia scholars are not willing to consider such a notion for intellectual authority, resulting in the risk of becoming completely detached from the non-academic world. The downsides of peer review are explained, for instance how the system sustains itself and the author then offers online peer-to-peer review as an alternative, where filtering replaces gatekeeping. The author concludes by stating her hopes that a community surrounding projects like MediaCommons can set the parameters for such a system in such a way that current systems can learn to adhere to this type of review.</p>

In this second part of the bibliography, the possibilities of such an engagement are explored. First there is a theoretical focus where researchers - for different reasons - argue the benefit or even necessity of employing Web 2.0 strategies to include the public in the academic knowledge system. In the second section, examples of the employment of Social Media - thereby including the products and help of a wider audience - are given, including discussion on the benefits and downsides and possible strategies for improving these tools.</p>

                        <p>The articles in this section have different backgrounds which the authors have used as a base: industry, (global) education and university, but all have in common that they advocate a university model based on the Web 2.0 model and/or technologies in order for the university to survive as a knowledge producer in a fast-changing world. </p>

                                <p>The authors argue that because of the rising demand for higher education, it is near impossible to meet the global demand in the future, at least if this demand needs to be met by building brick-and-mortar institutions. The solution is seen in access through the Internet, but more importantly Web 2.0 technology: participatory resources that can support different types of learning, according to the authors. The notion of social learning is employed to support this claim, where 1) the way something is learned - collaboratively - is becoming more important than what is learned, countering the Cartesian view of knowledge and learning based on knowledge transferal; 2) learning to be a <em>participant</em> in the field is included in the learning process. The authors point to the open source software community as an example of how new-comers learn through participation and mention that this model is incorporated by other communities such as Wikipedia, stressing the importance of the visibility of the creation process. The authors then continue to describe some examples of formal and informal social learning based on the first type of social learning, using SecondLife and Social Media in general. Consecutively some projects are described based on the second type of social learning, where content and community are used as equal parts in the learning process. On example is The Decameron Web by the Italian Studies Department at Brown University, where students can find source materials, but also can emulate on established researchers’ work and submit their own contributions. The authors argue that learning will develop into Learning 2.0, where students will not only learn in college, but during their whole life according to a demand-pull principle instead of supply-push, connecting to niche communities of people with the same interest, where they will engage in informal learning. The Open Educational Resources movement, together with eScience, eHumanities and Web 2.0 resources provides a base for <span class="term">Open Participatory Learning Ecosystems</span> in which people can continue to take part, also from outside an institution. The authors state that reflective practicums in formal and informal learning institutions can help shape such ecosystems. </p>

                                <div class="p">This (for many research universities daring) framework for institutional change in university builds on Web 2.0 and Enterprise 2.0 strategies. The author first sketches the environment of the developments: the economic importance of knowledge, including the Lisbon strategy to forward Europe in the global economy; the adaptation and integration of e-learning, where the increase of ICT in higher eduction has led to new pedagogy models and embedding of e-learning; current university models, where the Corporate University is explained in more detail; and lastly, Web 2.0 and Enterprise 2.0. Enterprises have acknowledged the importance of Web 2.0 technologies and have thus incorporated them, because these technologies provide <blockquote class="quote inline"><p>opportunities for company improvements in the area of innovation, collaboration, knowledge sharing, using collective intelligence and searching and discovering</p></blockquote> (p. 4). Part of these developments is the emergence of <span class="term">ideagoras</span>, Web 2.0 based environments where researchers and developers can collaboratively innovate. On the bases of these developments and models, the author builds a model of University 2.0. It means an adaptation of a large part of the principles of the Enterprise 2.0 model and thus the integration of Web 2.0 technologies and applications. An application is found in the concept of the Community of Practice (see Wenger 1998), upon which the university should build and maintain a community in order to collaborate with the industry. In the final section, the implementation of such a strategy at the University of Sofia is briefly explained, which is partially based on the European e-Competence Framework (2008). </div>

                                <div class="p">In this essay, the author argues that universities need to rethink their strategies to perform their core business of cultivating knowledge. Using a nineteenth century article on the distribution of books through railroads, the author distills the concept of <span class="term">information friction</span>, which - explained roughly - describes impeding factors on the distribution of information and the positive effect of a new technology. The author sees universities as monolithic, slow organizations that impede innovation and need to learn from Web 2.0 strategies. He advocates ‘seamy’ systems (as opposed to seamless): top-down, small-scale, non-finalized tools that encourage users to think about information processing. Examples he uses are BibApp - for building publication networks based on one’s own faculty staff, available through <a class="link_ref" href="http://bibapp.org/">http://bibapp.org/</a> - and BRAIN, a <span class="quote_inline">peer finder for institutional repositories</span>, which is of his own making. (p. 233). The end user is crucial in making the latter operable, as demander and supplier of content. The author argues that if universities makes its information accessible properly, users (including non-academic) will build upon this knowledge by building tools to provide different kinds of access, through apps for instance. In the conclusion the author repeats part of a fifteen-year-old lecture in which he stated that the university should not wait for the public to come, but to actively engage it by meeting in their own environment - if it is not already too late. </div>

Although the concept was designed for use in business practices, it is particularly useful in describing online communities; the identity of the CoP is shaped by the contents of what the members share, thus by knowledge, and not by the institution or other official affiliations or even shared tasks. Although these communities grow naturally, organizations can influence them. Five strategies of nurturing the community are described.</p>

In this article, reCAPTCHA (now acquired by Google: <a class="link_ref" href="http://www.google.com/recaptcha">http://www.google.com/recaptcha</a>) is described, a system that uses human processing power to help transcribe digitized textual archival material where OCR has failed. CAPTCHAs (completely automated public Turing-test to tell computers and humans apart) are used on websites to prevent machines from automatically filling out forms. Computer-generated strings of letters and digits, which are also distorted by the computer to make them illegible for machines, are shown which the reader then needs to replicate to prove she is human. In reCAPTCHA, next to one string of computer-generated content, scanned words from archival documents are inserted - which two OCR systems have failed to recognize. Thus, free human transcription of words is provided. The workings of the system are first explained in a clear and detailed fashion. Empirical research proves that 1) archival documents can be transcribed with a 99.1% accuracy using reCAPTCHA; 2) reCAPTCHAs are better at preventing computers to read their contents than (computer-generated) CAPTCHAs are. This is a good example of the useful employment of non-expert knowledge for problems that are generally solved by experts, but that can be performed on a much larger scale than would have been possible without such application.</div>

This article gives an interesting example of the application of Web 2.0 to facilitate large-scale collaborative networks that include the general public. The authors first discuss the importance of transdisciplinary collaboration for societal problem-solving. Consequently, a two-day workshop on web-scale collaboration is described, where three groups (each discussing an issue in STM, humanities or social science) discussed the conditions of such collaboration and gave examples of ITexts that could be of use. CommentPress and Wikipedia were mentioned for instance in a group focused on the topic of scholarly data. All groups defined five heuristics for suitable platforms, among which providing incentives to attract user participation and mechanisms for ensuring privacy and dedicating ownership. Three examples of IText for transdisciplinary collaboration are discussed: Wikipedia (<a class="link_ref" href="http://www.wikipedia.org/">http://www.wikipedia.org/</a>), Galaxy Zoo (for identifying galaxies, <a class="link_ref" href="http://www.galaxyzoo.org/">http://www.galaxyzoo.org/</a>, now the second version) and reCAPTCHA (which aids in deciphering words of difficult to read archival material, see Von Ahn et al.

                                <p>Although this article is not explicitly on academic and non-academic <em>scholarly</em> use of Social Media, folksonomies are a good example of how expert and non-expert users document objects of interest, guiding access to information, as opposed to sole expert classification in for instance libraries. The authors suggest opportunities to ameliorate tagging, based on a research sample of delicious (<a class="link_ref" href="http://www.delicious.com/">http://www.delicious.com/</a>) and Flickr (<a class="link_ref" href="http://www.flickr.com/">http://www.flickr.com/</a>), from the side of the user as well as the system’s creator. They discuss the possible consequences of for instance automated tag suggestion, opportunities for discussion among users and offering a rule set to users, suggesting that too much intervention might impoverish the tag set; thereby implicitly supporting the possible benefit of using a system which includes non-experts.</p>

                                <p>This article is aimed at reforming student composition education, where students generally are presented with an artificial distinction between research and writing (and between doing research and Web 2.0). The author uses a combination of four Web 2.0 platforms to show how students can be taught a more realistic image of composition: Wikipedia (<a class="link_ref" href="http://www.wikipedia.org">http://www.wikipedia.org</a>), JSTOR (<a class="link_ref" href="http://www.jstor.org/">http://www.jstor.org/</a>), ARTSTOR (<a class="link_ref" href="http://www.artstor.org">http://www.artstor.org</a>) and del.icio.us. (now called <span class="titlem">delicious</span>, <a class="link_ref" href="http://www.delicious.com/">http://www.delicious.com/</a>). Each of these websites is explained as having affordances for either research, writing or a combination of both and the author expands on the teaching possibilities for each of them. The importance is stressed of connecting Web 2.0, which students are familiar with, to academic research, offering students - and non-academic researchers - an opportunity to relate more easily to this type of research. Moreover, the focus in teaching should shift from consumption (what have others written on the subject?) to the production side (what do I have to say about this?). The author also argues for students to be better taught how to discern quality on the Internet, rather than forcing them to read only materials that are available through the library. In the conclusion, the author focuses on the academic Web 2.0 counterparts for providing - for instance - annotation possibilities and urging composition teachers to teach students how to become - and see themselves as - ‘capable knowledge producers’, using the affordances of Web 2.0.</p>

                                <p>The authors have conducted an informal online survey through the MediaCommons e-mail list and the Cultural Studies listserv on practices and attitudes towards engaging non-academic communities through online scholarly work. Some of the outcomes are described, for instance the gap between the interest in engaging non-academics and actual practices. Many scholars prefer to engage other academics and students first and are not completely comfortable with sharing unfinished work online, although 46% of the respondents report maintaining blogs. In the final section, possibilities for engaging the non-academic community are mentioned - including existing examples - and the authors stress the importance of making an effort to do so. The benefit of this engagement is mentioned briefly: education and perhaps in the best case scenario, aid from the non-academic community in knowledge construction. The authors find that the Web is starting to be used to disperse scholarly discourse more widely and encourage scholars to take risks.</p>

                                <p>The author has performed linguistic discourse analysis on the comments section of three health science articles in a newspaper to find whether experts, either personal or scientific, interact with one another. The small sample indicates that the origin of personal experience needs to be given or else is demanded, whereas scientific expertise is assumed with the use of a certain type of discourse. The author notes that the personal and scientific experts commented within their peer-groups and where they did interact (in one case), the personal experts ‘scientised’ their language use. Since the origin of scientific expertise was rarely explicitly mentioned, it is not certain whether the scientific experts are academics or not. It is an interesting article however, as it points to the notion that linguistic markers of (a lack of) academic education have a great influence on the interaction between commentators; and possibly disproves (although the sample is small) the fact that a shared discussion space automatically allows for connection between different communities of practice.  </p>

                    <p>Supplementing the above, this review of electronic reading environments and tools is meant to provide a baseline for understanding new e-Reader hardware and software. Although it is striking in one sense how little seems to have changed in a decade – for example, the vast majority of scholarly ‘reading tools’ that have been developed or theorized are either annotation systems or lookup engines – new file formats and commercial testing grounds are rapidly accelerating this work.</p>
                    <div class="teidiv2" id="index.xml-body.1_div.2_div.3_div.1"><h4><span class="headingNumber">2.3.1. </span><span class="head">2.3.1 e-Reader Hardware</span></h4>
                       <ul><li class="item"><strong><span class="titlem">Sony Reader</span></strong>
                               <p>The first ‘modern’ dedicated e-Reader platform was the Sony Reader, released through Borders booksellers in the United States in September 2006. It featured a greyscale screen similar to that of the first- and second-generation iPod and iPod Mini, and was a surprisingly multi-functioned device, able to play MP3 audio and natively display PDF, ePub, Mobipocket, and MS Office document formats. Of these, PDF support was handicapped by the device’s low refresh rate, which made horizontal scrolling of documents that did not conform to the screen width very inconvenient. Sony also introduced their own proprietary eBook format, called <span class="titlem">BBeB</span> (<span class="titlem">Broadband eBook</span>), though it was not very successful, probably due to an inability to purchase content on-the-go without using a PC as an intermediary. Newer revisions of the device are now on sale in the US, UK, and Canada, but support is flagging.</p>
                           </li><li class="item"><strong><span class="titlem">Amazon Kindle</span></strong>
                               <p>In November 2007, twelve years after they sold their first physical book over the internet, Amazon.com gave the e-Book a gargantuan, consumer-grade push, in the form of their Kindle. The device was only on sale in the United States until late 2009, when it was gradually introduced into hundreds of other markets worldwide. The Kindle's loudest boast, and perhaps its entire raison d'etre, was a screen made from the revolutionary Vizplex, brainchild of Cambridge, MA startup E-Ink. Without a backlight, Vizplex is easier on the eyes; with the help of a technique called electrophoresis, Vizplex displays can freeze, without any power consumption, until a user presses the ‘next page’ button. Now, a revision of Vizplex is used in every major commercial e-Reader, and is arguably the single greatest advantage of using a dedicated device.</p>
                               <p>Its other greatest innovation, and almost certainly its financial triumph, is the ease with which it allows users to download and purchase content on-the-fly without the use of a tethered PC. Amazon’s Kindle is still the only device to provide free wireless 3G access to all users for the purpose, and the only device <em>not</em> to support the open <span class="titlem">ePub</span> document format, in a relatively transparent effort to push its own DRM-secured, proprietary eBooks.<span class="note" id="Note3"> [Although ePub was designed to support DRM, its security was compromised by hackers in 2009 and the ePub consortium has not made any attempt to circumvent their efforts since.]</span> Despite this, Amazon has been successful in part because their content library is the undisputed largest, and with their considerable resources will likely remain so. The Kindle is also the only dedicated e-Reader device to include a full physical keyboard, which some users may prefer for text entry when searching or annotating content.</p>
                                  <p>Because the Kindle was for a good while the market leader, it was they who addressed many of the growing pains of e-Readers, and in some cases – such as the provision of page and line numbers for scholarly use of texts, as would be present in physical editions – they still provide the best solution. In early 2011, Amazon released an Application Development Kit (ADK) for third-party developers to build software specifically for its dedicated Kindle device, though it remains in closed beta.

                               <p>Barnes &amp; Noble booksellers’ <span class="titlem">Nook</span>, released in November 2009, runs on a variant of Google’s Android smartphone platform, thus alleviating the need for a proprietary Application Development Kit. Unlike the Amazon Kindle, it supports <span class="titlem">ePub</span> content and does not have a full keyboard. There is also a version of the Nook with a colour display – named, appropriately, the <span class="titlem">Nook Color</span> – which is unique among dedicated e-Readers and may be ideal for heavily illustrated content. Beyond this, though, newer iterations of the device have made it very similar, both ergonomically and feature-wise, to the Kindle, with Barnes &amp; Noble’s selection of available content impressive in its own right.</p>

                               <p>The Kobo, developed by an independent Toronto-based firm in 2010 and marketed primarily through the US <span class="titlem">Borders</span> bookstore chain and <span class="titlem">Chapters</span> in Canada until the former’s recent bankruptcy, was initially much less expensive than its competition (at $149 CAD), and served as a budget alternative to the Nook and Kindle until it effectively drove down the cost of all three devices. It, too, has become strikingly similar to its brethren on modern revisions, offering a near-identical feature set to the Nook (including ePub) and a notably better selection of Canadian content. The Kobo’s ADK is expected to be released in mid-2011.</p>

                               <p>Apple’s iPad is, of course, a multifunction device, and not a true dedicated e-Reader insofar as it does not use Vizplex display technology (as would be inappropriate for other content displayed on an iPad). It has, however, garnered an extraordinary amount of developer interest for its novel form factor, and in fact all of the manufacturers of dedicated e-Reader hardware now provide an iPad app<span class="note" id="Note4"> [Along with, it is worth noting, applications for the iPhone, Android, and Windows/Mac OSX desktop platforms.]</span> which provides most or all of the functionality of a dedicated device.</p></li></ul>    
                        <p>Per the current software market, supplemental reading tools such as annotation are typically handled by third-party application developers<span class="note" id="Note5"> [The apparent leaders in annotation functionality as of Summer 2011 are <span class="titlem">iAnnotate</span> on iPhone or iPad and <span class="titlem">RepliGo</span> on Android or Blackberry. <span class="titlem">RepliGo</span> deserves further praise for its ability to reformat PDF documents into a single-screen view for easier browsing on a mobile device – a powerful and rare feature.]</span>, and may not necessarily be compatible with the more straightforward reading environments of the Kindle/Nook/Kobo apps. For example, the Kobo iPad app has been criticized for deleting all stored annotations whenever the software is updated and the user’s library is refreshed, making it apparent that so-called ‘active reading’ has not been a priority for the application’s developers. There has been a clear focus on the provision of reading statistics and other metrics, as evidenced by the graphical breakdown below.</p>

In a time before ubiquitous cloud server architecture, the annotation environment described by the authors more closely resembles an asynchronous chat log containing symbolic links to a particular document than the ‘living’ documents that have been theorized since. What this may tell us, however, is that simple online chats are officially of the ‘want to happen’ persuasion – in the ‘information wants to be free’ sense – and any way that we can sustain them is nevertheless useful. Indeed, the frequency with which users annotated documents appeared to follow a common power law, as with many other collaboration systems.</div>

The author begins by reviewing reading research from the 1950s through the 1970s which assessed the tradeoff in reading speed versus comprehension, and notes that a range of 55 to 70 characters per line was and remains something of a sweet spot for monospace and variable-width fonts alike. Curiously, longer line lengths of up to 100 characters seem to be better for the express purpose of skimming, and, of course, the idea that there can be more than one optimal document layout strongly reinforces the advantages of reflowable text. In 2001, this finding stood in opposition to her participants’ apparent preference for paginated, rather than scrolling documents, as the de facto paginated document, PDF, only supported a fixed document layout. Now, new formats such as <span class="titlem">ePub</span> appear to combine the best of both worlds.</p>

                                <p>This article, while not about a reading tool or tools <em>per se</em>, provides an excellent thinking-through of the affordances of reader discourse in electronic documents. The authors begin by noting that the shift in literary theory of the 1960s and 70s toward analyzing the reader’s response to literature has not quite been carried through to our study of digital media. In order to understand the behaviour and expectations of blog readers, they conducted an ethnographic study of fifteen participants, which revealed that blog reading is a deeply habitual process – simultaneously productive and time-wasting – and that blogs unsurprisingly command an enormous degree of authenticity relative to other written media. The study also suggests that the <span class="term">non-chronicity</span> of blogs was somehow special, in that posts have a clearly defined <em>sequence</em> of following one after another, this is the full extent to which blogs have any relevant temporality. The authors believe that these factors should be taken into account in the design of new and novel reading tools.</p>

For example, where similar lookup engines might require a great deal of editorial effort to create a functional ‘dictionary’ and attempt to use the long-standing WordNet lexical database for disambiguating word meanings, Wikification gets by on statistical relevance judgments, using one of the largest such databases in existence (dwarfing WordNet’s coverage of noun phrases). In this paper, the authors explain in detail their method for making these relevance judgments, noting with amusement that the overall machine-derived statistical relevance for their results is somehow identical to that of the aggregate relevance judgment of their user study participants – 79%.</p>

                                <p>This article, an extension of the author’s dissertation work, reports on the electronic document reading, sharing, and interaction habits of graduate students. He found that the vast majority of annotations fall into just two categories – underlined or highlighted text, and anchor points for some marginalia. Either selection of text (in the first case, the original author’s; in the second, the reader’s) could be indexed by a sufficiently powerful reading environment and presented to the reader or readers as a table of contents of notes. One finding from this study which seems all too logical and subverts a key assumption of open online annotation systems is that many individuals do <em>not</em> want to inherit an already-annotated document, even less so if the prior annotator is anonymous. While we can learn much from the wisdom of crowds, we seldom sit out to read a self-contained document with these crowds in mind, as doing so can be confusing or overwhelming. It is thus a sensible assumption that the annotation layer should be secondary to the original text in a well-designed reading environment – and worth considering when this assumption may <em>not</em> hold true.</p>

                                <p>The authors report on a study of user opinions on using the scholarly article reading tools embedded within the Public Knowledge Project’s <span class="titlem">Open Journal Systems</span>. According to the authors, the single most interesting finding from this research was that the reading tools were overwhelmingly found to be better at locating articles within their respective scholarly context than actually assisting with individual readings. The most likely reason volunteered for this is that there are simply not many productive ways that software can intervene in readers’ variously idiosyncratic means of interacting with isolated documents (with the exception of annotation, which not well-supported by Open Journal Systems at the time of the study). Indeed, their think-aloud protocol evinced almost as many descriptions of individual reading processes than commentary on the tools themselves. Among the tools that did work well was an engine for discovering authors’ related work, assisting in readers’ credibility judgments of authors whom they had not previously been introduced to (and all the more so in the context of Open Access). Among those that did not work well for many readers were broader-scale ‘find more like this’ options, usually because the article metadata which was mined for search terms was insufficient to compete with the relatively trivial alternative of readers formulating their own Google Scholar search.</p>

                                <p>This lengthy volume, while not about electronic reading per se, is a comprehensive single source for much of what we currently know about the reading process from the perspective of education. The book’s short first chapter deals with how controlled reading studies are best conductive, in both an ethnographic and computational context. After this, the book turns to focus entirely on the reading process itself: in the second chapter, through the life cycle; in the third, at various levels of linguistic depth; and in the fourth, in the teaching and learning of reading. The fifth and final chapter, also the most diverse, deals with many sociocultural facets of reading – such as how popular culture has altered our approach to language and literacy, how second languages are learned, and how literacy can thrive in informal contexts. The lattermost is perhaps of particular note for reading specifically non-academic content on the web.</p>

The introduction is a retrospective approach to how reading has changed with the advent of hypermedia. There is a review of the long relationship between typography and reading behaviour, and entire chapters on annotation and social reading. After a brief discussion of how reading is best understood and studied, the book’s second half focuses largely on metadata, text markup, and other issues concerning file formats. Although the book’s relatively recent publication date makes the absence of any discussion about modern platforms such as the iPad or file formats such as <span class="titlem">ePub</span> all the more disappointing, and there are some subjects (such as DRM) which the author is unable and perhaps justifiably unwilling to give full recognition in the allotted space, this is very probably the most comprehensive review of electronic reading, as a process and a history, currently available.</p>

The authors detail a user study which was designed with the express purpose of determining which components of active reading (annotation being the obvious long-standing example) are still better-supported by pen and paper than they are in electronic reading environments. Their findings, on which their system design is predicated, are summarized as follows: the messiest and most valuable insights are usually located in a cross-document context, not in a single PDF or Word file but in the margins of Powerpoints and email threads. As such, LiquidText is being built to preserve the context of text snippets once they have been dragged and dropped (or, as per the tablet paradigm, pinched or pulled) out of their original home, while still allowing them to be dynamically re-formed elsewhere, and highlighted or bookmarked accordingly.

                                <p>This article recounts the trials and tribulations of the University of Washington’s Amazon Kindle DX pilot program for students. Like many articles reviewed here, it mentions the XLibris digital paper prototype (Fuji-Xerox, Palo Alto) of years prior as the high bar to beat in the field, despite the fact that it was never widely adopted. The authors of this article are quite critical of the Kindle DX, noting that the degree to which students expect to be able to skim physical textbooks is totally unlike their expectations of speed-reading PDFs which are usually read on screen, and the Kindle is not up to this task. In addition, the Kindle was found to be poorly-suited to both horizontal scrolling and annotation (both of which have been addressed in later revisions of the hardware). Kinesthetic clues such as flipping to a dog-eared corner halfway through a textbook were also badly missed, and some complex illustrations were evidently not rendered properly. The researchers conclude somewhat unequivocally that this incarnation of the Kindle is not nearly as well-suited to multimodal academic reading as its consumer success might suggest.</p>

                        <p>The key activities of professional readers in the humanities include: evaluating the scholarly value of research material, communicating with other scholars, and managing physical and electronic collections of research material. In our recent study of expert readers and their experience with the Open Journal System, we observed that participants were most satisfied with the online reading tools when they modeled existing reading strategies. Participants expressed dissatisfaction when the online reading tools proved less effective than their existing strategies.</p>
                         <p>As expert readers also become expert at using online tools, they will demand an even higher level of sophistication from an online reading environment. Professional readers are becoming increasingly aware of the potential of social networking tools as scholarly research tools. A successful online reading environment would integrate social networking tools in a way that extends readers’ existing strategies. The value of such an environment to the professional reader would be that he or she would not have to use a variety of disjointed tools. Instead, he or she would be able to perform the same tasks from within the reading environment. To date, no one social networking tool models all three main aspects of readers’ existing strategies.

                        <div class="p"><span class="term">Social software</span> refers to <span class="quote_inline">software which supports, extends, or derives added value from human social behaviour</span> (Coates qtd. in boyd <span class="titlem">The Significance of Social Software</span> 16; cf. Ridings and Gefen; Cohen and Clemens; Horizon Report 2007). Donath and boyd write, <blockquote class="quote inline"><p>underlying all the networking sites are a core set of
                            assumptions -- that there is a need for people to make more connections, that using a network of existing connections is the best way to do so, and that making this easy to do is a great benefit</p></blockquote> (71). The common factor among almost all social software is the idea of sharing (Gross and Acquisti 71). What exactly is being shared differs from network to network but almost all provide tools to create and maintain an identity, connect with other users, exchange information, and classify/sort that information.</div>
                          <div class="p">Wellman et al. suggest <span class="quote_inline">that on-line relationships are based more on shared interests and less on shared social characteristics</span> (231) while Donath and boyd note <span class="quote_inline">to turn an encounter into a connection, there generally must be some common ground</span> (77). The New Media Consortium refers to the internet as a <span class="quote_inline">third place</span> after home and work where people <blockquote class="quote inline"><p>connect with friends, watch television, listen to music, build a sense of togetherness with people across the world, and provide expressions of ourselves . . .</p></blockquote> (3). According to Ellison, Steinfeld and Lampe, this <span class="term">third place</span> does not weaken offline social ties, rather <span class="quote_inline">may indeed be used to support relationships and keep people in contact, even when life changes move them away from each other </span> n.p).. Ellison, Steinfeld and Lampe also note, <blockquote class="quote inline"><p>in addition to helping student populations, this use of technology could support a variety of populations, including professional researchers, neighborhood and community members, employees of companies, or others who benefit from maintained ties</p></blockquote> (n.p)..

                        <div class="p">The ability to create and maintain an online identity is one of the key features common to social networking tools. Boyd writes<blockquote class="quote block"><p>
                           Social network sites are based around profiles, a form of individual (or, less frequently, group) home page, which offers a description of each member. In addition to text, images, and video created by the member, the social network site profile also contains comments from other members and a public list of the people that one identifies as Friends within the network (‘Why Youth’ 123).</p></blockquote>
                            Pew Internet’s <span class="titlem">Digital Footprints</span> study reports that <span class="quote_inline">one in ten internet users have a job that requires them to self-promote or market their name online</span> (iii) and <blockquote class="quote inline"><p>voluntarily posted text, images, audio, and video has become a cornerstone of engagement with Web 2.0 applications. Indeed, being <span class="quote_inline">findable and knowable</span> online is often considered an asset in participatory culture where one’s personal reputation is increasingly influenced by information others encounter online </p></blockquote> (4). Girgensohn and Lee suggest that one of the benefits of creating an maintaining a profile on a social networking site is the opportunity to create a <span class="quote_inline">persistent and verifiable identity</span> (137) while Boyd and Ellison note, <blockquote class="quote inline"><p>what makes social network sites unique is not that they allow individuals to meet strangers, but rather that they enable users to articulate and make visible their social networks</p></blockquote> (n.p).. Given the importance expert readers place on markers of authority such as credentials and past publications, it is in the individual’s best interest to exert some control over his or her online identity. Creating and maintaining an online profile would help give humanities scholars this control and would allow them to include the kind of information expert readers use when evaluating the value of research material. In their discussion of Peers, a social networking application created and used by design and consulting firm Avenue A | Razorfish, Cohen and Clemens focus on the ability of social networking tools to foster collaboration. Like most social networking tools, Peers gives users the ability to create profiles, share information, and collaborate on projects. Users also have the ability to rate projects posted by other members in the same discipline. Cohen and Clemens write, <blockquote class="quote inline"><p>in this structure for presenting individual work, the standard for  quality work naturally becomes higher. Work deliverables that were prior routine now  become viewable, visible and available to a highly critical audience</p></blockquote> (254). Cohen and Clemens emphasis is on the influence the peer-rating system has on quality of work. A rating system in a reading environment for expert readers would have a slightly different focus. At the site Faculty of 1000, scientists rank research articles in order to highlight the best of new research. For expert readers in the humanities, a rating system would help readers evaluate the scholarly importance of an article and assess the relevance and trustworthiness of its author. If ratings were incorporated into an author’s online profile, readers would have ready access to information about an author’s recent publication history and information about how well his or her research has been received.

                        <div class="p">Expert readers learn about new ideas and develop existing ones by engaging in scholarly communication with their peers and colleagues. Online, these readers participate in online forums, email listservs, and use commenting tools on blogs and other social networking sites. Kathleen Fitzpatrick writes 
                            <blockquote class="quote block"><p>Scholars operate in a range of conversations, from classroom conversations with students to conference conversations with colleagues; scholars need to have available to them not simply the library model of texts circulating amongst individual readers but also the coffee house model of public reading  and debate. This interconnection of individual nodes into a collective fabric is, of course, the strength of the network, which not only physically binds individual machines but also has the ability to bring together the users of those machines, at their separate workstations, into one communal whole. (n.p).</p></blockquote>
                            Hoadley and Kilner write, <blockquote class="quote inline"><p>knowledge-building communities are a particular kind of community of practice focused on learning. Based on scholarly communities, knowledge-building communities take as an explicit goal the development of individual and collective understanding</p></blockquote> (32). They describe conversation as the method by which information becomes knowledge (33). An online community that models a community of practice combines content with communication. Social networking applications provide tools to facilitate both information sharing and dialogue.</div>
                           <div class="p">Noah Wardrip-Fruin recently participated in an experiment using CommentPress and the blog <span class="titlem">Grand Text Auto</span> to explore how social networking tools might be used in the peer-review process. In January 2008, Wardrip-Fruin released the manuscript of his forthcoming book, <span class="titlem">Expressive Processing</span>, to members of the Grand Text Auto community. Using CommentPress, community members were able to comment on the text paragraph by paragraph. In his introduction to the experiment, Wardrip-Fruin observes <span class="quote_inline">I soon realized that blogs . . . contain raw research, early results and other useful information that never gets presented at conferences</span> (<span class="titlem">Expressive Processing: An Experiment in Blog-Based Peer Review</span>, <span class="titlem">Grand Text Auto</span> 22 Jan. 2008). By using CommentPress to collect early reviews of his manuscript, Wardrip-Fruin has been able to engage with the scholarly community in a new and less formal way. The editorial suggestions made in the comments do not carry the weight of traditional peer review, but they provide an interesting interim step between private circulation of a manuscript in process and official submission of a manuscript to a publisher for peer review.</div>
                           <div class="p">In a follow-up conversation between Wardrip-Fruin, Ben Vershbow from the institute for the Future of the Book (creators of CommentPress), Doug Sery of MIT Press (publishers of Wardrip-Fruin’s book) and Don Waters of the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation, there is an attempt made to clarify the role of open peer review in the publishing process. Waters writes, <blockquote class="quote inline"><p>there is a sense in which the experiment is not aimed at ‘peer review’ at all in the sense that peer review assesses the qualities of a work to help the publisher determine whether or not to publish it. What the exposure of the work-in-progress to the community does, besides the extremely useful community-building activity, is provide a mechanism for a function that is now all but lost in scholarly publishing, namely <span class="term">developmental editing</span></p></blockquote> (<span class="titlem">Developing Books in Networked Communities</span>).</div>
                           <div class="p">The use of CommentPress as an editing tool suggests a number of applications for an online reading tool. Larry Sanger writes, <blockquote class="quote inline"><p>strong collaboration – which is made possible on a wide scale by the Internet – goes one step further. Not only are there multiple authors, and not only are those people each others’ editors, but there is no set group of people who are the authors and editors of the work</p></blockquote> (n.p). Rather than being used only to leave notes or comments on material that has already been published, readers could participate in the development of works in progress and, in turn, benefit from the participation of other members of the scholarly community.</div>
                            <p>The ability to leave a paragraph-specific comment rather than a comment at the end of a text makes CommentPress a useful annotation tool. Authors could invite community members to clarify aspects of his or her work that reflect their field of expertise. This makes possible a fluid, up-to-date system of reference that goes beyond the citation of published material. Readers could use CommentPress to leave questions or comments that are tied to specific passages in a text. Multiple users could engage in multiple conversations around different points in the text rather than in one long, threaded conversation at the end of the text. This kind of communication system combines the reach of global community with the specificity of local conversation.

                        <div class="p">Searching, retrieving, classifying, and organizing research material is a primary activity of professional readers. Expert readers employ a variety of strategies ranging from simple filing systems to elaborate systems of classification and storage. Reference management tools such as Zotero, Citeulike, and Connotea allow users to find, store, and organize research materials online. This kind of organization system has the benefit of giving the user access to his or her research material from any computer connected to the internet.
                            The use of folksonomy tagging in reference management tools can improve on a reader’s existing research strategies by providing him or her with a flexible and easily accessible way of organizing research according to his or her own criteria. These tools also allow users to share research collections with colleagues and find material relevant to their interests in other collections. Alexander describes the role of social bookmarking in higher education as a tool for <span class="quote_inline">collaborative information discovery</span>. He identifies a number of benefits to using social bookmarking: <blockquote class="quote inline"><p>finding people with related interests can magnify one’s work by learning from others or by leading to new collaborations. . . [and] the practice of user-created tagging can offer new perspectives on one’s research, as clusters of tags reveal patterns (or absences) not immediately visible . . .</p></blockquote> (n.p.). User incentives for tagging include the ability to quickly retrieve research material, to share relevant material with colleagues, and to express an opinion or make a public statement about one’s interests (Marlow et al 34-35).

Rather than replace expert readers’ existing strategies, a successful online reading environment would extend and improve those strategies. The use of social networking tools would contribute to this extension and improvement, particularly in the key areas of evaluation, communication, and management of resources.</p>

In the same way that it is possible to catalog web pages (with Furl and del.icio.us) or photographs (with Flickr), scientists can share information on academic papers with specific tools (like CiteULike) developed for that purpose. The website is sponsored by the publisher Springer Science+Business Media. Richard Cameron developed CiteULike in November 2004 and in 2006 Oversity Ltd. was established to develop and support CiteULike.  When browsing issues of research journals, small scripts stored in bookmarks (bookmarklets) allow one to import articles from repositories like PubMed, and CiteULike supports many more. Then the system attempts to determine the article metadata (title, authors, journal name, etc). automatically. Users can organize their libraries with freely chosen tags and this produces a folksonomy of academic interests. (From Wikipedia).</p>
