                <head>Introduction</head>
                <p>While digital literary studies are well established, digital art history is only
                    taking its first baby steps. As distant reading has contributed to
                    revolutionizing traditional literary studies, distant viewing is lagging behind.
                    Machines are taking their first looks at visual artworks in the research
                    projects that, at this stage, are confusingly bordering domains of computer
                    science and art history. This essay attempts to better demarcate these borders
                    by looking at possible questions that are both art-historical in nature and
                    impossible or hard to answer without computational techniques. For this task, we
                    compare the distant reading with distant viewing and explore the experience of
                    the <q>older sister</q> discipline of digital literary studies.</p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <head>Related Work</head>
                <p>Although articles dedicated to defining digital art history acknowledge digital
                    literary studies as its predecessor in digital humanities, the systematic
                    research comparing the two disciplines is minimal. <ptr target="#bishop2018"/>
                    points out parallels between the disciplines by providing critical arguments
                    against digital art history. <ptr target="#arnold_tilton2019"/> analyze
                    similarities and differences between natural language processing and computer
                    vision in their essay on <quote rend="inline">distant viewing.</quote> However,
                    the authors focus on methodological aspects of machine vision rather than
                    epistemology and research questions.</p>

                <p>This essay primarily relies on the articles on digital art history (<ptr
                        target="#rodriguez-ortega2020"/>, <ptr target="#drucker2015"/>
                    <ptr target="#bender2015"/>), critique of the quantitative approach in art
                    history (<ptr target="#pollock2014"/>), and theoretical and methodological
                    inquiries on digital literary studies (<ptr target="#stefan2015"/>
                    <ptr target="#moretti2000"/>
                    <ptr target="#coste2018"/>). We review the literature to identify similarities
                    in goals and challenges in digital art history and digital literary studies and
                    how the experience of the latter can help to define research questions most
                    suitable for using machine-aided vision in art history.</p>

                <head>Digital Art History and Digital Literary studies</head>
                <p>Digital art history and digital literary studies are the disciplines under the
                    umbrella term of digital humanities – an area broadly described as an
                    intersection of humanities disciplines and computing or digital technologies
                        <ptr target="#drucker2021"/>
                    <ptr target="#burdick2016"/>. The inception of this interdisciplinary field is
                    often linked to the work of Roberto Busa on computer-generated concordance of
                    the works of Thomas Aquinas in 1940 and has long time been synonymous with the
                    study of text <ptr target="#schneider2012"/>
                    <ptr target="#dalbello2011"/>. Therefore, it comes as no surprise that digital
                    literary studies have already earned their status through acknowledged
                    contributions to the more general domain of digital humanities. In contrast,
                    digital art history is still trying to prove itself <ptr
                        target="#joyeux-prunel2008"/>. Digital scholars in digital humanities like
                    Stephen Ramsay, Franco Moretti, Matthew Jockers, Geoffrey Rockwell, and others
                    have established the use of digital tools as part of the interpretative process
                    and means of approaching literary works in novel ways through the methodology of
                    distant reading <ptr target="#earhart2015"/>. Digital art history, however,
                    relied on the processing of textual meta-data and, until recently, did not
                    experience the deep transformation of the relationship between object and
                    subject in its research. Although computational techniques of signal processing
                    aiding art historians in authorship attribution and dating tasks have been
                    around for more than four decades <ptr target="#stork2009"/>, only recent
                    advances in computer vision have brought a possibility of research parallel to
                    distant reading in digital art history. The key milestones for computer vision
                    were the introduction of Convolutional Neural Network algorithms and the
                    creation of the ImageNet image database in 2012, which enabled the training of
                    deep learning algorithms for object recognition. They were later generalized for
                    other tasks, including style recognition in artistic images <ptr
                        target="#bar2014"/>. Possibilities to challenge human sight when looking at
                    art images have attracted computer scientists and art historians alike <ptr
                        target="#ginosar2015"/>
                    <ptr target="#lang-ommer2018"/>

                    <ptr target="#schich2008"/>
                    <ptr target="#schich2015"/>.</p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <head>Distant Reading and Distant Viewing</head>

                <p>The idea of distant reading is linked to the emergence of open data initiatives
                    and digitization of texts, for example, Google Books, Internet Archive PHI, and
                    Perseus Digital Library <ptr target="#stefan2015"/>. Distant reading in the
                    field of literature was introduced by Franco Moretti <ptr target="#moretti2000"
                    /> and Matthew Jockers's "macroanalysis" <ptr target="#jockers2013"/> as a
                    possible answer to the challenges of massive text corpora. While Moretti mostly
                    focuses on visualization techniques (like Manovich in digital art history),
                    Jocker draws analogy from macroeconomics and emphasizes statistical analysis
                    methods <ptr target="#stefan2015"/>. The analog term in visual culture -
                        <term>distant viewing</term> - already appeared in 2015, although it
                    referred to statistics of artworks metadata, not the computer-vision analysis of
                    images <ptr target="#bender2015"/>. A new formulation of distant viewing
                    methodology already relies on machine-aided vision <ptr
                        target="#arnold_tilton2019"/>. The idea of analyzing artistic images at a
                    scale that came before the articulation of the concepts is enabled by
                    digitization and opening of visual image archives - Getty Research Institute,
                    Google Art Project, and others <ptr target="#drucker2015"/>. Some interesting
                    studies on social media image content or classical paintings have entered the
                    art history scene <ptr target="#manovich2012"/>
                    <ptr target="#schich2008"/>
                    <ptr target="#schich2015"/>. </p>

                <p>Similarly to distant reading, distant viewing includes statistical techniques and
                    visualization and enables a macro view of big image data <ptr
                        target="#arnold_tilton2019"/>. There are, however, important differences.
                    One of them is the semantic gap between raw pixels of an image and structured
                    features extracted by a deep learning algorithm <ptr target="#arnold_tilton2019"
                    />. Other – inherent materiality of most of the classical objects of art history
                    and digitization error <ptr target="#drucker2015"/>. Those two factors make the
                    interpretation and role of the researcher even more implicit in the methodology
                    of distant viewing. Both distant reading and distant viewing enable data-driven
                    discovery; however, this essay attempts to clarify questions that this approach
                    can anticipate.</p>

            <div>
                <head>5. Statistics versus Interpretation</head>
                <p>As the very term <q>Distant Viewing</q> is inspired by its predecessor <q>Distant
                        Reading</q>, the criticism towards this new approach is similar to that of
                    new literary study methodologies. The reoccurring motif in the criticism is
                    juxtaposing the quantitative and qualitative approach with binaries of counting
                    or reading, statistics, or critical thinking. Still, as Mark Algee-Hewitt points
                    out, the goal of computational humanities is to find a balance between them <ptr
                        target="#algee-hewitt2019"/>. According to Coste, the quantitative approach
                    to literature has qualitative implications; the scope achievable with distant
                    reading transforms the relationship with the unit observed, making it comparable
                    with the big literary data corpora <ptr target="#coste2018"/>. On the one hand,
                    we have a reality conditioned by our senses (close reading), and on the other –
                    by the instruments (distant reading). However, it is the researcher that creates
                    knowledge through the act of interpretation, not the machine. The same is true
                    about the field of digital art history. The idea that statistical methods do not
                    involve the interpretation or critical thinking is a misconception rooted in the
                    popular imagination, with labels such as <q>dry statistics</q> instead of
                    intuition and insight. Every statistical model is rooted in the qualitative
                    assumptions of the world. For example, the mathematical model of image and style
                    has an implicit concept of an image and modes of vision <ptr
                        target="#rodriguez-ortega2020"/>. The other extreme, pointed out by Claire
                    Bishop in the critical article on digital art history, is overly enthusiastic
                    reliance on empiricism or data as bearing objective truth and abandoning
                    interpretation and search for causality <ptr target="#bishop2018"/>. Here we
                    explore how art history can be enriched with approaches that consciously apply
                    computational methods together with theory and interpretation. </p>

            <div>
                <head>Flat comparisons versus the big questions</head>
                <p>The first successful attempt to use algorithms to identify artistic influences in
                    paintings made the headlines promising computers will push art historians out of
                    business <ptr target="#sparkes2014"/>
                    <ptr target="#emergingtechnology2015"/>. Computer scientists-led project
                    explored a database of more than 80,000 paintings by more than 1,000 artists
                    created over 15 centuries. The authors have built models for attributing
                    artistic styles and spotting influence links among the artists from
                    algorithmically extracted visual features in the artworks. Apart from being able
                    to match well-acknowledged links between styles and artists (for example,
                    expressionism and fauvism), the algorithms also showed a never-before-seen
                    visual resemblance between Frederic Bazille's Studio 9 Rue de la Condamine
                    (1870) and Norman Rockwell's Shuffleton's Barber Shop (1950) <ptr
                        target="#saleh2016"/>. It did not take long for the community of art
                    historians to react. The findings were dismissed as representing an outdated
                    "connoisseurial art history" which ignores social, ideological, economic, and
                    political components to form "larger narratives" <ptr target="#pollock2014"/>.
                    As evident from the authors' response to criticism <ptr target="#elgammal2014"
                    />, here we see the case where art history is used to test and develop
                    algorithms rather than to answer big questions about art history. But can it
                    work the other way around? Can distant viewing enable the eyes of an art
                    historian to see differently and answer or raise new questions through the
                    process of interpretation? As Matthew Lincoln points out, good research starts
                    with art-historical rather than computer science questions <ptr

                    answerable with massive data and computer algorithms? In the following
                    paragraphs, we will explore the cases from literary studies and digital art
                    history to identify questions that can bring qualitative value to the discipline
                    and transform the relationship with analyzed artworks. </p>

                <head>Challenging the Canon</head>
                <p>Pollock calls computational <quote rend="inline">influence tracing</quote> a
                    disguised way of protecting the canon <ptr target="#pollock2014"/>. The ongoing
                    project <title rend="quotes">Images' Contagions</title> aims to prove quite the
                    opposite. The Artl@s research group of art historians, engineers, and cognitive
                    scientists approach the massive corpora of digitized images and related textual
                    data with Deep Learning algorithms for pattern and object recognition. In
                    addition, qualitative methods from history, visual studies, and cognitive
                    sciences are applied <ptr target="#joyeux-prunel2012"/>. The project's
                    objectives are to identify the most recurrent images and circulations of their
                    copies and visual quotations. Iconographic and stylistic similarities and
                    influences are analyzed by applying a model of epidemiology of images inspired
                    by biology and based on mathematical network analysis. According to the
                    project's authors, this approach, together with the available big image data, is
                    the opportunity to challenge the <quote rend="inline">old geopolitical model of
                        prescriptive centers and imitative peripheries</quote>
                    <ptr target="#joyeux-prunel2012"/>. The macro level of distant viewing can help
                    to challenge the ideological defense of canon better than traditional art
                    history which favors monographic studies <ptr target="#joyeux-prunel2008"/>
                    According to Franco Moretti, close reading limits one to the <quote
                        rend="inline">canonical fraction</quote> of Western literature, let alone
                    world literature <ptr target="#moretti2013"/>.</p>

                <p>The broader horizons provide a different relationship with the artwork but are
                    unreachable to the human eye. It is even more true if one adds user-generated
                    content on social media as a contemporary art form <ptr target="#manovich2012"
                    />. Therefore machine-aided vision comes as a tool that opens important
                    possibilities, even if it does not allow the intimacy of close reading or close
                    viewing. As Bender points out, studying the spread of visual quotations requires
                    a quantitative approach <ptr target="#bender2015"/>.</p>

                <head>Counting and Counter-intuitive insights</head>
                <p>Reading or viewing at a large scale is an unachievable task for humans not
                    equipped with algorithmic tools. Another one is precise quantification. The
                    application of algorithmic graph analysis and network visualization technique to
                    classic plays by Shakespeare and Sophocles has revealed that main characters do
                    not necessarily have the central role in the character network of the play, for
                    example, Cesar in Shakespeare's <title rend="italic">Julius Caesar</title>
                    <ptr target="#coste2018"/>
                    <ptr target="#grandjean2015"/>. One may argue that simple counting does not
                    change the role of the main character. However, it can encourage a more detailed
                    look at characters' space and how literary means are used to create centrality.
                    Arnold and Tilton applied a similar approach to analyzing visual culture. The
                    authors use a deep learning face recognition algorithm to study the appearance
                    of main characters in situational comedies <title rend="italic"
                        >Bewitched</title> (1964–1972) and <title rend="italic">I Dream of
                        Jeannie</title> (1965–1970). The authors start by locating the faces in each
                    frame, then identify the main characters and cluster them based on camera angles
                    and distances <ptr target="#arnoldetal2019"/>. The study aimed to inquire about
                    the gender roles promoted by television. It has challenged the intuitive
                    perception of both Samantha in <title rend="italic">Bewitched</title> and
                    Jeannie in <title rend="italic">I Dream of Jeannie</title> as leading characters
                    by showing that Jeannie appears on the screen much less than Samantha.</p>

                <p>Furthermore, Jeannie is often visually framed as a supporting rather than the
                    main character <ptr target="#arnoldetal2019"/>. This revelation challenges
                    dominating views that two TV series represent the same female roles <ptr
                        target="#arnoldetal2019"/>. The study is an example of how digital methods
                    allow massive data analysis that would be tedious work, if at all possible,
                    without computational aid. However, the central insight of the study would not
                    be possible without an art historian's intuition and knowledge of visual tools
                    for building character in TV drama. </p>

                <head>Conclusions</head>
                <p>Traditional art historians often critique distant viewing, and distant reading is
                    controversial in literary studies. However, both methods provide possibilities
                    unachievable with conventional methods. Recent examples of computer algorithms
                    in art history suggest that this methodology allows the transformation of the
                    relationship with the art object rather than mere counting. The analog research
                    cases from literary studies strengthen this claim. While traditional methods
                    have their place in the discipline, the digital approach is superior in working
                    with the massive scope of data in global or longitudinal studies. It has the
                    advantage of questioning traditional beliefs and well-established canons with
                    quantitative analysis. Therefore, computational tools can help to reposition
                    standard objects in their historical or ideological contexts. Computational
                    tools become even more relevant when new objects – internet and social media
                    content – begin to capture the attention of researchers in art history. However,
                    the future challenges include establishing rigorous interdisciplinary frameworks
                    and evaluation criteria together with openly available high-quality datasets. In
                    addition, developments in institutional support, availability of
                    multidisciplinary training, and technical infrastructure are important in
                    developing distant viewing in digital art history research.</p>
