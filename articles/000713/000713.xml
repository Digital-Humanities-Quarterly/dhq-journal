      <body>
         <p>Almost two decades ago, at the start of Critical Code Studies (CCS), we asked two
            provocative questions: <quote rend="inline">What does computer source code
                  <emph>mean</emph>?</quote> and <quote rend="inline">What do we discover when we
               read code with the interpretive tools of the humanities?</quote></p>
         <p>At the 2006 MLA Convention in Philadelphia <ptr target="#pmla2006"/> where we launched
               <ref target="https://electronicbookreview.com/essay/critical-code-studies/">the
               manifesto</ref>, some humanities scholars in the audience asked whether reading code
            was a conversation better suited for a technology conference. Conversely, some computer
            scientists reacted to our endeavor by asking why English majors were reading code at
            all. Incidentally, that MLA panel was organized by Rita Raley and one of the speakers
            was John Cayley, both of whom are included in this collection, so you might say this
            first volume is a bit of a reunion — appropriately so, since from the beginning CCS was
            a collaborative project, inviting and requiring a diverse group of thinkers and
            makers.</p>
         <p>On roads paved by cultural studies, semiotic analysis, science and technology studies,
            and media archaeology, we set out on the journey to understand code. Along the way we
            launched critical explorations — sometimes alone, but more often in groups. Since 2010
            we have convened seven biennial gatherings of the Critical Code Studies Working Group
            (“the major online think tank for critical code studies, a hub of dialogue and
            collaborative inquiry that generates major thrust in the reading of code.”) Those
            multi-week gatherings gave rise to multi-author books such as <hi rend="italic">10 PRINT
               CHR$(205.5+RND(1)); : GOTO 10</hi>
            <ptr target="#10print"/>, monographs such as <hi rend="italic">Critical Code
               Studies</hi>
            <ptr target="#marino2020"/>, and numerous conference presentations and journal articles,
            including early publications in <title rend="italic">Digital Humanities
               Quarterly</title> 2013 <ptr target="#montfort2013"/>
            <ptr target="#marino2013"/>.</p>
         <p>Following these initial publications, we are delighted to present this sequence of two
            Digital Humanities Quarterly special issues on Critical Code Studies as the latest
            scholarly work in the field. Their contributions extend and develop CCS through close
            readings of code and theoretical interventions, offering new methods of reading and
            interpretation while introducing new programming languages, expanding the scope of code
            studies even as they refine its methods and practices.</p>
         <p>Critical code studies is the application of the hermeneutics of the humanities to the
            interpretation of the extra-functional significance of computer source code.
               <q>Extra</q> here does not mean <q>outside of</q> or <q>apart from</q> but instead it
            refers to a significance that is <q>growing out of</q> an understanding of the
            functioning of the code. While the <ref
               target="https://electronicbookreview.com/essay/critical-code-studies/">initial
               manifesto</ref> spoke of treating code as a <q>text</q>, in later clarification (<ref
               target="https://hcommons.org/deposits/item/hc:19537/"
               >https://hcommons.org/deposits/item/hc:19537/</ref>), Mark has explained that
               <q>text</q> refers to a cultural object, rather than a collection of words. More
            significantly, if early definitions positioned the code object as the <emph>ends</emph>,
            over time, the code has proven instead to be an entry point, a <emph>means</emph> to
            open up conversations about a wide variety of topics in techno-culture. This may be part
            of what drives the intersectionality of critical code studies with related subfields in
            cultural studies and technology. CCS is as much a field constituted by methods (code
            reading) as it is by a particular objects of study (code), and as such it can provide
            new approaches into many areas of investigation; indeed, the revealed object of study is
            often not the code <emph>per se</emph> but instead <q>the border</q>, <q>the lunar
               lander program</q> et cetera.</p>
         <p>Still, reading code, even *without* interpreting its cultural significance, may be no
            easy task. Ask a professional programmer who inherits legacy code to maintain or, worse
            yet, to improve, and they may tell you about the dread of sorting out just-in-time code,
            minimally documented, written with hasty patches, and full of compromises and
            workarounds. Even those who write their code in artistic projects can be shy about
            sharing their code out of embarrassment and self-consciousness. It is a product of the
               <quote rend="inline">encoded chauvinism</quote> of programming culture, one that can
            be fostered on the internet as much as it is in classrooms <ptr target="#marino2020"
               loc="148"/>. </p>
         <p>Trying to interpret code, in the humanities sense of interpretation, compounds the
            challenge of reading code, which may be why scholars so often eschew the attempt. In
            spite of the groundwork we have tried to lay in the form of methods and models,
            workshops and working groups, most essays and books about software objects either tend
            to present code writing in functional and utilitarian terms from computer science /
            software engineering perspectives or else tend to gesture toward the existence of code
            from humanities / social sciences / cultural studies perspectives — but rarely analyze
            it. Surely, the task may be arduous. Even we editors have admitted to feeling a sense of
            doubt when faced with a new code object to interpret, wondering whether an examination
            will lead anywhere at all. In our classrooms, both of us have discovered the challenges
            of teaching students how to engage in the practice. The daunting challenge of
            interpreting code is part of what makes this collection such a milestone. </p>
         <div>
            <head>Origins &amp; Extensions</head>
            <p>Critical code studies grew out of a moment when many interconnected groups of
               scholars were turning new forms of attention to digital and computational objects.
               The namings of multiple new groups, organizations, journals, conferences, and
               subfields in the period around 1999-2009 were often both sudden emergences and
               simultaneously culminations: <q>electronic literature,</q>
               <q>game studies,</q>
               <q>software studies,</q>
               <q>platform studies,</q>
               <q>digital humanities</q> and more were all ascendent at this time.</p>
            <p>For years, scholars such as Jay David Bolter, George Landow, Kathleen Fitzpatrick,
               Paul Saint-Amour, Janet Murray, and Brenda Laurel had examined the new media forms of
               literary hypertext and digital theatre. The Electronic Literature Organization was
               founded in 1999, organizing conferences and ELC digital literary anthologies around
               bringing sustained critical attention to digital literary objects. In Game Studies,
               Espen Aarseth’s <title rend="italic">Cybertext: Perspectives on Ergodic
                  Literature</title> (1997), Gonzalo Frasca’s <title rend="quotes">ludology</title>
               (1999), the new journal of <title rend="italic">Game Studies</title> (2001), and the
               Digital Games Research Association (2003) brought a focus on the analysis of rules,
               procedures, and processes in (often digital) games.</p>
            <p>After decades of <q>humanities computing</q> research, a new banner term <q>digital
                  humanities</q> was popularized by the influential anthology <title rend="italic">A
                  Companion to Digital Humanities</title> (2004) edited Susan Schreibman, Ray
               Siemens, and John Unsworth, followed by the the formation of The Alliance of Digital
               Humanities Organizations (ADHO) (2005) and thereafter its first issue of this
               journal, <title rend="italic">Digital Humanities Quarterly</title> 1.1 (2007) under
               editors Julia Flanders, Wendell Piez, and Melissa Terras. In the United States,
               funding through the NEH Digital Humanities Initiative (2006) / Office of Digital
               Humanities (2008) further helped DH become the organizing term for what would
               eventually become the DH <q>big tent</q> — incorporating two factions that N.
               Katherine Hayles would describe as <quote rend="inline">scholars who use digital
                  technologies in studying traditional humanities objects and those who use the
                  methods of the contemporary humanities in studying digital objects.</quote>[<ref
                  target="https://archive.ph/FNyko#selection-1845.116-1845.285">*</ref>]<ptr/></p>
            <p>Within this broader scene, an additional crucial context for the emergence of
               critical code studies were the respective calls of both Lev Manovich (<title
                  rend="italic">The Language of New Media</title>, 2001) and N. Katherine Hayles
                  (<title rend="italic">Writing Machines</title>, 2002) for scholars to employ
               media-specific analysis to attend to unique features and material conditions, to
               develop new approaches more suited to these new and emerging forms. In seeming answer
               to that call came a stampede of <q>studies,</q> including critical code studies,
               software studies, and platform studies. Software studies brought interdisciplinary
               attention to software systems and their social and cultural effects with The Software
               Studies Workshop (2006), Software Studies Initiative (2007), and Software Studies: a
               Lexicon (2007) edited by Matthew Fuller. In 2006, Ian Bogost and Nick Montfort also
               announced the Platform Studies book series they would edit for the MIT Press
               alongside their forthcoming <title rend="italic">Racing the Beam: The Atari Video
                  Computer System</title> (2009), and defined platform studies as investigating “the
               relationships between the hardware and software design of computing systems and the
               creative works produced on those systems.” Alongside these came the continued
               development of media forensics as practiced by Matthew Kirschenbaum (e.g. <title
                  rend="italic">Mechanisms: New Media and the Forensic Imagination</title>, 2012),
               and of media archaeology, whether by Kittler and his students or by Lori Emerson.</p>
            <p>The development in critical reading practices has been attended by an expansion in
               the way programming itself is presented in works such as Nick Montfort’s introduction
               to <title rend="italic">Exploratory Programming</title> (2016) and in <title
                  rend="italic">Code as Creative Medium</title> (2021) by Tega Brain and Golan
               Levin. Taking up questions of cultural meaning, Geoff Cox and Winnie Soon released
               their <title rend="italic">Aesthetic Programming</title> (2020) on Gitlab and invited
               readers to fork it, an invitation Mark took up with Sarah Ciston when they added a
               chapter of their own. We would also be remiss to omit Daniel Shiffman’s <title
                  rend="italic">The Nature of Code</title> (2013), which has become a staple for
               novice programmers.</p>
            <p>The number of books examining the culture of programs has also increased, beginning
               with David Berry’s <title rend="italic">The Philosophy of Software</title>.
               Furthermore, Annette Vee’s <title rend="italic">Coding Literacy</title> offers a
               cogent argument about the nature of programming knowledge. <title rend="italic"
                  >Speaking Code</title> by Alex McLean and Geoff Cox offers a kind of duet with Cox
               reading McLean’s code and vice versa. Recent books have taken up subcultures of
               programming, such as <title rend="italic">Live Coding</title>. Algorithms have
               received their own attention, as in Jeffrey M. Binder’s <title rend="italic">Language
                  and the Rise of the Algorithm</title>. More recently, James Brown’s <title
                  rend="italic">The Ethics of Code</title> and Kevin Brock’s <title rend="italic"
                  >Rhetorical Code Studies</title> offered even more methods of interpreting code.
               Interpreting the code of a digital object has contributed to as in <title
                  rend="italic">Reading Project</title>, our collaboration with Jessica Pressman,
               which includes an analysis of the source code and source files of William
               Poundstone’s <title rend="italic">Project for Tachistoscope {Bottomless Pit}</title>. </p>
            <p>As more critical attention takes up software, scholars have turned their attention to
               racial bias and software, following on the work of pioneers such as Alondra Nelson.
               More recently Safiya Noble in <title rend="italic">Algorithms of Oppression</title>
               and Joy Buolamwini with her Algorithmic Justice League have worked to bring the topic
               of racial discrimination in software to the forefront. Ruha Benjamin has, likewise,
               traced out bias in code with her extension of <q>race critical code studies.</q>
               Historians are documenting the role of race in programming spaces in books such as
                  <title rend="italic">Think Black: A Memoir</title> and with respect to gender as
               in Mar Hicks’ <title rend="italic">Programmed Inequality</title>. micha cárdenas’
                  <title rend="italic">Poetic Operations</title> has examined algorithms with
               respect to trans of color. The social side of code and computers continues to be the
               subject of scholars as in the recent collection <title rend="italic">Your Computer is
                  on Fire</title> and in the groundbreaking work of Wendy Chun.</p>
            <p>At the same time, code poets have begun publishing their code. For example, Nick
               Montfort’s <title rend="italic">#!</title> (pronounced she-bang) and the <title
                  rend="italic">True List</title>, JR Carpenter’s <title rend="italic"
                  >Generation(s)</title>, Lillian-Yvonne Bertram’s <title rend="italic">Travesty
                  Generator</title>, or Milton Laufer’s <title rend="italic">A Noise Such as a Man
                  Might Make</title>. Code poets have played with code from the creole of <title
                  rend="italic">mezangelle</title> by Mez Breeze to the code poems of Margaret Rhee,
               collected in <title rend="italic">Love, Robot</title>. And for something completely
               different, Angus Croll’s <title rend="italic">If Hemingway Wrote Javascript</title>
               offers humorous though insightful renditions of the writing styles of famous natural
               language creative writers (from Jane Austen to Virginia Woolf) adapted into
               programming languages.</p>
            <p>This may be an odd claim to make, but not everyone who writes about code is a
               humanities scholar. A collection called <title rend="italic">Beautiful Code</title>
               asked programmers to discuss their favorite lines of code. In <title rend="italic"
                  >Once Upon an Algorithm</title>, Martin Erwig offers lessons in programming in the
               language of storytelling. Books about the cultural meaning of code surely go back to
               Don Knuth’s <title rend="italic">Literate Programming</title> and even <title
                  rend="italic">The Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs</title>.
               Though these authors might not write in the language of critical theory or
               hermeneutics, the vast insight from their works drawn out of lifetimes of work in the
               field of programming and computer science continue to direct and instruct critical
               code studies. </p>
            <p>In addition to these special issues of DHQ, scholars can look to a number of
               collections of publications on <title rend="italic">electronic book review</title>,
               which has been a major outlet for critical code studies since its inception. There

            <p>These special issues of DHQ are the first fruits of our work to foster the
               development of critical code studies in conference presentations and biennial working
               groups over these past two decades. Over the course of the six working groups so far,
               participants have conducted fruitful investigations into several bodies of code, from
               Joseph Weizenbaum’s ELIZA to William Crowther’s ADVENTURE. More recent working groups
               have looked at the code for the Apollo Moon Lander. We have taken up issues of race
               and gender, creative coding and the ethics of code. We have explored platforms for
               annotating code, from repositories to annotation tools on Google Docs and ANVC
               Scalar. Scalar itself has served in readings of the <ref
                  target="https://scalar.usc.edu/nehvectors/border-codes/index">Transborder
                  Immigrant Tool</ref> and <ref
                  target="https://thedigitalreview.com/issue02/marino_entanglements/index.html"
                  >FISHNETSTOCKINGS</ref>. And we have speculated about alternatives to dominant
               models of code, as in our discussions of feminist AI and a feminist programming
               language. Every working group takes up new themes, as the international group of
               scholars, artists, and programmers, and every combination therein, posted code
               critique threads to see what could be said about a menagerie of objects made out of
               code. </p>
            <p>We continue to develop new venues for critical code studies practices as well. In the
               past three years, we have launched an Anti-Racist Critical Code Studies Reading
               Group, inspired by the work of Noble, Benjamine, and Buolamwini, as well as the
               Knit&amp;Perl group co-organized with Anne Sullivan and Anastasia Salter, a sewing
               circle of scholars which looks at the intersection of coding and stitchcraft or the
               fibre arts. We have also launched a subgroup of the Humanities and Critical Code
               Studies (HaCCS) Lab that advocates for the public release of code (such as predictive
               policing code) that affects, governs, and shapes the lives of citizens. This new
               group is called the Sunshine Source Force, drawing its name from the movement for
               legal transparency, known as the Sunshine Laws. Surely, new initiatives are on the
               horizon. </p>
            <p>Code is never one thing and is as dynamic as any semiotic form, constantly in flux.
               As we write this, machine-learning code generators, such as Github’s Copilot, are
               emerging as a major part of programming assistance even as LLMs also assist essay
               writing. We suspect, and our recent experiments have confirmed that suspicion, that
               they will also offer assistance in the interpretation of code. Like the seas of
               natural language, the ecology of computer source code is constantly shifting and so
               there is always a need for more reading practices and of course a wider and more
               diverse set of scholarly and creative minds embarking on this endeavor. </p>

            <head>In this issue</head>
            <p>Before you is the first special collection of critical code studies readings. This
               landmark publication, offered in the first of two issues, presents a variety of
               interpretations and theoretical reflections that apply and extend the methods of
               critical code studies and also offer a resource for scholars looking for models of
               what these readings can accomplish. In addition to demonstrating established methods
               and best practices, scholars in this issue offer new and nuanced approaches to a wide
               range of code objects as well as developing new approaches, expanding the realm of
               what can be analyzed through critical code studies — accompanied by in-depth readings
               performed by top scholars in the field. This first issue presents three groupings of
               articles: 1) exemplary close readings of code, 2) new directions in critical code
               studies (such as code legibility and Critical AI), and 3) new work in programming
               languages and linguistics (including esoteric programming languages and indigenous
               programming languages).</p>
            <p>First, this issue contains exemplary close readings of code. In <title rend="quotes"
                  >Reverse Engineering the Gendered Design of Amazon’s Alexa: Methods in Testing
                  Closed-Source Code in Grey and Black Box Systems</title>, Lai-Tze Fan examines the
               gendered design of Amazon Alexa’s voice-driven capabilities, or, <q>skills,</q>
               (despite closed source impediments) in order to better understand how Alexa, as an AI
               assistant, mirrors traditionally feminized labour and sociocultural expectations. In
                  <title rend="quotes">BASIC FTBALL for Everyone and Computer Programming for
                  All,</title> Annette Vee puts the 1965 BASIC program FTBALL in the a historical,
               cultural, gendered context of <quote rend="inline">computer programming for
                  all</quote> while gesturing to the tension between a conception of <q>all</q> and
               FTBALL’s context in an elite, all-male college in the mid-1960s. In <title
                  rend="quotes">Computational art Explorations of Linguistic Possibility Spaces:
                  comparative translingual close readings of Daniel C. Howe’s Automatype and Radical
                  of the Vertical Heart 忄</title>, John Cayley elaborates a comparative,
               transculturally implicated, code-critical close reading of two related works, by
               Daniel C. Howe, which explore linguistic possibility spaces in English and Chinese.
               This reading engages distinct and code-critically significant programming strategies,
               and underappreciated comparative linguistic concepts with implications for the theory
               of writing systems, of text, and of language as such. In <title rend="quotes"><quote
                     rend="inline">Any Means Necessary to Refuse Erasure by Algorithm:</quote>
                  Lillian-Yvonne Bertram’s Travesty Generator</title>, Zach Whalen creates an
               expansive reading of Bertram’s <quote rend="inline">challenging, haunting, and
                  important achievement of computational literature</quote> while dig more broadly
               and deeply into how specific poems work to better appreciate the collection's
               contribution to the field of digital poetry. In <title rend="quotes">Poetry as Code
                  as Interactive Fiction: Engaging Multiple Text-Based Literacies in <title
                     rend="italic">Scarlet Portrait Parlor</title></title>, Jason Boyd examples how
               various text-based literacies (procedural, poetic, ludic) can, when used together,
               elucidate the meanings of an Inform7-programmed interactive fiction in the form of a
               sonnet. This examination suggests how critical code studies may engage in more
               nuanced discussions of natural language programming.</p>
            <p>Second, this issue contains new directions in critical code studies, pursuing areas
               such as machine learning software and the limits of code, non-code, and <quote
                  rend="inline">nonsense code</quote>. In <title rend="quotes">How to Do Things with
                  Deep Learning Code</title>, Minh Hua and Rita Raley consider the feasibility and
               critical potential of CCS as a method when the object of study is deep learning code.
               Calling for a <quote rend="inline">critical urgent</quote> need for basic
               understanding of the composition and functioning of large language models, they
               extract a representational map of OpenAI’s GPT-2 which they then verify through case
               studies of two popular GPT-2 applications: the text adventure game, <title
                  rend="italic">AI Dungeon</title>, and the language art project, <title
                  rend="italic">This Word Does Not Exist</title>. In <title rend="quotes">Tracing
                     <q>Toxicity</q> Through Code: Towards a Method of Explainability and
                  Interpretability in Software</title>, David M. Berry examines how we can use
               concepts of explainability and interpretability drawn from computer science in
               critical code studies. By examining a set of code artifacts the paper looks at how
               following conceptual traces in concrete source code layers can contribute to
               understanding and explaining them. In <title rend="quotes">Nonsense Code: A
                  Nonmaterial Performance</title>, Barry Rountree and William Condee analyze three
               case studies in which a literal reading of each program’s code is effectively
               nonsense, however, the programs generate meaning in performance. Using the framework
               of nonmaterial performance (NMP) and its four tenets (code <q>abstracts</q>,
                  <q>performs</q>, <q>acts within a network</q>, and <q>is vibrant</q>), they
               consider the 1950s Univac 1 <title rend="quotes">Happy Birthday</title>, the
               Firestarter processor stress test, and the Platypus family of side-channel attacks to
               decenter text from its privileged position and to recenter code as a performance.</p>
            <p>Finally, we offer reflections on code, language, and linguistics, in particular both
               esoteric and indigenous programming languages. In <title rend="quotes">ᐊᒐᐦᑭᐯᐦᐃᑲᓇ
                  ᒫᒥᑐᓀᔨᐦᐃᒋᑲᓂᐦᑳᓂᕽ | acahkipehikana mâmitoneyihicikanihkânihk | Programming with Cree#
                  and Ancestral Code: Nehiyawewin Spirit Markings in an Artificial Brain</title>,
               Jon Corbett discusses his project <title rend="quotes">Ancestral Code</title>, which
               consists of an integrated development environment (IDE) and the Nehiyaw (Plains Cree)
               based programming languages called Cree# (pronounced: Cree-Sharp) and ᐊᒋᒧ (âcimow).
               These languages developed in response to western perspectives on human-computer
               relationships, which Corbett challenges and reframes in Nehiyaw/Indigenous contexts.
               In <title rend="quotes">The Less Humble Programmer</title>, Daniel Temkin explores
               the aesthetics of how esoteric programming languages (esolangs) break from the norms
               of language design by explicitly refusing practicality and clarity. Through examples
               that make code disordered (e.g. Malboge) or even impossible to write (e.g.
               Unnecessary), esolangs may challenge or re-affirm wider ideas in programming culture
               and in how computer science is taught: specifically the sometimes-contradictory
               aesthetics of Humbleness and Computational Idealism.</p>
