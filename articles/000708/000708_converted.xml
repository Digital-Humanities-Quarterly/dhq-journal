            <p>Reprocessing printed source material and facilitating large-scale qualitative
                         as well as quantitative analyses with digital methods poses many
                         challenges. A case study on approximately 10,000 inventory entries for
                         legal cases from the Special Court Munich (1933–1945) highlights those and
                         offers a glimpse into a digitisation workflow that allows for in-depth
                         computer-aided analysis. For this paper, different methods and procedures
                         for developing categorisation systems for legal charges are discussed.</p>

            <p>Many printed historical sources still await systematic reprocessing, or
                         “upcycling” (Donig and Rehbein, 2022) in order to facilitate large-scale
                         qualitative and quantitative analyses by digital means. In this instance,
                         we are dealing with approximately 10,000 legal cases from the Special Court
                         Munich throughout the entire period of the National Socialist regime in
                         Germany (1933–1945) which were thoroughly documented in a printed format as
                         “Archive Inventory” in the 1970s (BayStMUK, 1975–1977). While the original
                         court files are heterogeneous in their structure and comprise all kinds of
                         documents, from handwritten notes to typewritten forms, and therefore are
                         not predestined for a systematic and automated approach in extrapolating
                         the content, the documentation done in the 1970s, the “Archive Inventory”,
                         presents us with a semi-structured repository of knowledge that can be
                         analysed by digital methods. First steps towards such were set about
                         recently (Gerstmeier et al., 2022). For further analyses, we have to
                         pre-process the semi-structured data from the “Archive Inventory” – i.e.,
                         categorisation in the form of organising the information contained within
                         the source material.</p>
            <p>The ultimate goal of the future work is a large-scale study of the sentencing
                         practices of the Special Courts. In this study, for example, correlations
                         between social status, accusation, and sentencing level are to be sought as
                         well as general patterns. Overall, this serves the objective of describing
                         the legal norm (or “average” practice) and at the same time uncovering
                         anomalies (cf. Schlumbohm, 1998, p. 28). We are discussing the following
                         six theoretical considerations:</p>
            <list rend="numbered">
               <item>Categorisation moves between macro- and microhistorical approaches.
                              Such a path to a comprehensive macrohistorical study contrasts with
                              smaller-scale microhistory, for which studies based on few samples of
                              single records already exist. For computer-assisted macrohistorical
                              research, corresponding digital tools are being developed under the
                              metaphor of “macroscopy” (Graham, Milligan, and Weingart, 2016).
                              However, this research approach generally still awaits a theoretical
                              foundation. When Jürgen Schlumbohm (1998, p. 29) discussed whether
                              micro- and macrohistory are to be understood as complementary or
                              incommensurable, he concluded with regard to the aggregation of data
                              following categorisation that “a kind of ’theory of aggregation’” does
                              not yet exist for historical science. This still seems to be true, and
                              the resulting desideratum needs to be addressed. This is not only the
                              case because of the increase of data-driven research also in
                              “traditional” Humanities disciplines such as History, but especially
                              because a sharp division (in the understanding of a counterpart)
                              between macro and micro studies seems to be as outdated as the rigid
                              adherence to disciplinary boundaries. However, just as there might be
                              no interdisciplinarity without disciplines, the interchange between
                              macro and micro studies should not lead to the abandonment of the
                              cores of the respective research paradigm, but rather form a smooth
                              transition. It is here that categorisation or general modelling forms
                              an important bridge between the study of the particular at the micro
                              level and that of the general at the macro level — from the close-up
                              view to the distant view and back again. Such bridge-building,
                              however, must be purposeful as well as systematic and shall not result
                              in eclectic bricolage and thus arbitrariness.</item>
               <item>Categorisation is data modelling. All categorisation is modelling and
                              the models we create help “understanding the world by means of
                              patterns and principles” (Bod, 2018, p. 78) in the sense of the
                              macrohistory we seek. Hence, general model theory applies to
                              categorisation. Among other things, this means that categorisations
                              are reasoned (and subjective) selection processes. This is of
                              considerable methodological importance for any data-driven work,
                              especially in the Digital Humanities, but is apparently too often
                              neglected, which significantly diminishes the value of the results.
                              Categorisations are conscious typifications or exemplifications and
                              must be demarcated not only from arbitrariness but also from
                              unconscious formation of stereotypes (cf. Ginzburg and Poni,
                              1991).</item>
               <item>Categorisation is complexity reduction. This, too, forms an area of
                              tension between micro- and macrohistory. In the context of
                              methodological approaches of the Digital Humanities, reference could
                              be made here to procedures of close and distant reading. In close
                              reading, the human researcher processes significantly more information
                              from each source but fewer sources, whereas, in distant reading,
                              significantly more sources are condensed into less information. In our
                              case, for example, microhistory corresponds to the close reading of
                              complete, more substantial, but only few sample records, while the
                              macrohistorical approach corresponds to the distant reading of
                              aggregated data. In such a reduction of complexity, it has to be
                              weighed up how much of the source content has to be taken over 1:1 and
                              how much may be typified. The higher the degree of abstraction, the
                              greater the danger of losing relevant content without achieving any
                              more selectivity. This is a problem we have encountered especially in
                              the pragmatic approach below. In the case of the Special Courts,
                              reducing potentially substantial sources (“<term>Akte</term>”/file) to a few data (“<term>Aktenregest</term>”/record), which are then additionally
                              aggregated into categories, could be considered typical for
                              macro-historical questions based on secondary data from “upcycling”
                              processes.</item>
               <item>Categorisation of historical data means dealing with time. The period
                              of validity of categories is often limited, which becomes especially
                              evident over the transition from pre-modern to modern times (“<term>Sattelzeit</term>”) but should be seen as a
                              fundamental challenge of historical macro studies in general. Here we
                              usually have two levels to consider: first, the present time from
                              which we write history, and second, the past about which we write,
                              whose sources we use, and whose terminology we rely on. In the case
                              discussed here, there is even a third temporal level, namely the
                              indexing of the files carried out in the 1970s and the vocabulary used
                              there to produce the “Archive Inventories”. This results in the
                              challenge to do justice – as far as possible – to the conceptuality
                              and the vocabulary of the source while at the same time creating a
                              valid categorisation over different temporal levels and evaluating it
                              critically (cf. Seiffert, 2006, p. 205; Wehler, 1972, p. 20).</item>
               <item>Categorisation is hermeneutical and ontological. It has already been
                              described in the literature that there is a tense but also distinctly
                              appealing relationship between source vocabulary and modern typology.
                              In addition, in our case it is especially important not to fall for
                              the Nazi ideology and the language they used (cf. Klemperer,
                              1947/2020), which often stands in contrast to actually valid law (of
                              the Weimar Republic), to a modern understanding of law, and to human
                              rights, which are considered universal today. The question of
                              universals alluded to here is also of fundamental importance for
                              categorisation. Seiffert (2006, p. 159) distinguishes between “source
                              terms”, “modern terms”, and “supra-temporal terms”. Certain terms, he
                              claims are “timeless”, such as the category “human being,” and thus
                              “so general and formal that we can unhesitatingly apply them to any
                              historical epoch without fear of doing violence to the historical
                              fact”. It is essential to keep this ontological dimension in mind when
                              categorising. In the three approaches we have followed, especially the
                              inductive-computational (automated) one attempts a clustering via the
                              source terms (of the secondary source). It takes the finding of the
                              source terms without further interpretation as its basis of
                              categorisation, while the first two approaches interpretively process
                              a priori or inductive theoretical presuppositions. But here, too, the
                              question remains: is this interpretation present-tense, is it situated
                              within the hermeneutically understanding of the past under
                              investigation, or can it be supra-temporal?</item>
               <item>Categorisation has a normative function. Directly linked to these
                              considerations is the question of whether a categorisation is
                              descriptive or normative: does it describe (ontologically: “A is an
                              X”) or does it norm (“shall A be an X”, “shall A be understood as an
                              X”)? A source approach is arguably more descriptive, while the use of
                              modern terms tends toward a normative view. Thus, categorisation, like
                              any kind of norm-setting, runs the risk of having a domination or even
                              ruling function inherent in it (cf. Richter, 2021, p. 53 with
                              reference to Durkheim and Mauss, 1901). This is particularly relevant
                              in data-based research: Whoever prescribes the data categories sets
                              norms. Therefore, given categories must always be critically
                              questioned, which is especially important when “upcycling” older data.
                              This also applies to primary data (take Census data, for example: here
                              the exercise of domination is particularly conspicuous, which
                              admittedly was also practised under Nazi rule, but not only there, see
                              e.g., race laws). Such categorisations can then have an impact on the
                              formation of society/ies.</item>

            <p>The following pages present a case study on three different approaches
                         towards the categorisation of legal sources from the Nazi era taking three
                         different points of view into account: a) a deductive one, which operates
                         on the basis of legal-philosophical and legal-historical theory; b) a
                         pragmatic-explorative one, operating with secondary source texts, but using
                         contemporary understandings for category formation; and c) an
                         inductive-computational approach. They highlight the varying spectrum and
                         different views one can take on the past while simultaneously showcasing
                         the interplay between the theoretical considerations described above.</p>

            <head>Introduction to the Source Material</head>
            <p>Although not an entirely new phenomenon in NS Germany, the Special Courts
                         were distinctive in the sense that they combine regular criminal law and
                         charges of the form of non-conformity according to Nazi ideology under one
                         jurisdiction. Not least because of this, the contents of the cases are
                         particularly diverse and hard to grasp in modern legal terms. The
                         corresponding case files are just as complex and heterogenous in their
                         content and structure – from typewritten forms to handwritten notes. The
                         compilatory work done in the 1970s helps to get a better grasp on the
                         content of the original files by putting the information in a model of a
                         more concise and structured nature.</p>
            <p>The inventory, which was compiled by a team from the Bavarian State Archives
                         between 1975 and 1977, is in itself remarkable in several respects. It was
                         printed in a limited quantity of copies, self-published in off-set
                         technology, bound off-site and not distributed on the book market, but
                         given away to libraries and archives. The resulting volumes are thus rather
                         to be understood as “grey literature”, as auxiliary means for the internal
                         use of authorities and for scientific purposes. They are not only a finding
                         aid but a possible answer to the challenge of indexing mass sources and a
                         source in themselves, reflecting editorial decision-making processes of
                         that time. In the example of entry number 165, we get a glimpse of the
                         overall structure of an inventory record with the main content description
                         by the authors in English added in blue: </p>

            </figure>
            <p>Instead of highlighting individual fates and putting emphasis on particular
                         information of the respective procedure reflected in the file and its
                         transmission process, the editors decided to define a standardised set of
                         general characteristics to be collected for each case. That this
                         standardisation changed over the long-stretched process of compilation is
                         only natural, e.g., for cases from 1939 onwards, the underlying relevant
                         legal paragraphs have been added. Thus, additionally complicating the
                         computation process of today. As researchers of digital history, this
                         circumstance confronts us with several challenges at once, especially in
                         the context of categorisation.</p>
            <p>Nonetheless, analysis of a more comprehensive nature is made possible through
                         the digital transformation. Because the corresponding primary sources,
                         i.e., case files, have been analysed only partly, the inventory still
                         retains great relevance for research today. The main aim lies in digitally
                         upcycling the inventory in order to make the records available and
                         pre-process the data for quantitative analyses, e. g., correspondence
                         analysis for which well-designed categorisation is essential. After
                         digitisation and pre-processing, information extraction from the
                         machine-readable text is possible through its formalised structure. The
                         compilatory work done in the 1970s has been meticulous and offers access to
                         the content on a systematic level. Nonetheless, close reading raises
                         questions about how the editors structured their approach. There also seems
                         to be some inconsistency in how the information was processed (e.g., the
                         wording of the charges laid against the defendants). Those inconsistencies
                         pose a challenge for the digital upcycling in the sense of automated
                         processes taking, for example, the extraction of accusation categories: For
                         further large-scale analysis, cases on derogatory or critical remarks – by
                         far the largest group of charges – belong in the same category, whether
                         they may refer to the spreading of rumours (on Hitler or otherwise) or
                         rants about the regime in general. Those cases are to be differentiated
                         from crimes still liable to prosecution today, like rape or theft.</p>

            <head>Workflow – From Paper to Dataset </head>
            <p>Automatic recognition of typewritten text (OCR) is a comparatively
                         established field that already has a number of standardised procedures.
                         Permissively licensed OCR engines such as Tesseract (Smith 2007) or
                         Calamari (Wick, Reul, and Puppe, 2018) are not inferior in quality to
                         proprietary solutions (Reul et al., 2018). The workflows associated with
                         these solutions can be better shared and adapted for similar usage
                         contexts. As part of the project, we therefore implemented and
                         incrementally improved numerous pipelines.</p>
            <p>Initially, the books have been scanned using an overhead book scanner.
                         Unsurprisingly, the resulting digitised pages showed warping and skew.
                         Several attempts of performing optical character recognition after
                         automatic de-warping and de-skewing did not lead to satisfying results. The
                         overall error in the OCR results introduced by distorted pages, combined
                         with deteriorated and contaminated typeface could not be reduced to an
                         acceptable level, after the fact, by software alone. Page warping is due to
                         the pages being bound into books. By unbinding the books and digitising
                         single pages using a document feeder scanner, page warping and page skew
                         could be eliminated almost completely. Deterioration and contamination of
                         the typeface were still present, but the overall error rate was
                         significantly reduced.</p>
            <p>In the next step, we employed Tesseract for OCR on all pages, specifying a
                         German dictionary and the calligraphy hand “Fraktur” and outputting one
                         file per digitised page, in hOCR format (Baierer, 2020). Compared to plain
                         text, hOCR has the added advantage of preserving layout information. Each
                         page contained several inventory records, with entries sometimes spanning
                         two pages, when starting close to the bottom of a page. We continued
                         processing the text programmatically by undoing the physical boundaries at
                         page-level and, instead, splitting the text at logical boundaries, namely
                         at the inventory record level. Out of 9,955 inventory records, 8,531 or
                         86 % could be extracted successfully [2]. With separate inventory records
                         in plain text format, our algorithm continued to parse and translate each
                         entry into JSON format [3]. Each JSON record captures meta information,
                         such as page number and name of the hOCR file containing the record, and
                         the content of the inventory record itself in separate fields, as detailed
                         in Figure 1. It should be noted that we also retain the underlying plain
                         text within each JSON record, to maintain the opportunity to make (manual)
                         corrections or to retrace decisions later. </p>
            <p>In a final step, we selected relevant information from a subset of JSON
                         fields and created a CSV file, serving as the baseline for the different
                         categorisation approaches described throughout the rest of this article.
                         Each row in the CSV file contained a unique identifier, the inventory
                         record, the “law” or legal basis / “<term>Gesetzesgrundlage</term>”, respectively, and the duration of the case,
                         as well as normalised versions of the inventory record and duration. The
                         normalised inventory records retained only the accusation / “<term>Anklagegrund</term>”, stripping off the result of the
                         proceedings and lemmatizing all words. The normalised duration contains the
                         starting date only, standardised as YYYY-MM-DD. After this pre-processing,
                         the information is principally available for computer-aided analysis but
                         additional strategies for systematically approaching the data had to be
                         developed. </p>
            <p>Different approaches may be taken in processing, categorising and engineering
                         an in-depth analysis of the 10,000 cases. After the initial digitisation
                         and information extraction – processes which were formalised with regard to
                         reusability and a proof-of-concept workflow for source digitisation in mind
                         –, challenges are posed by different categorisation models that may be
                         applied to the corpus. The different methods, from an intuitive approach
                         based on keywords to automated processes utilising natural language
                         processing and clustering the results, exemplify how varying methods can
                         influence our view on the past. In this paper, these different perspectives
                         and their interconnections will be discussed in order to open up a new
                         scholarly approach to the inventories. They are especially important for
                         subsequent statistical analyses.</p>

            <head>Categorisation Methodologies</head>
            <p>Even though positive law was seen critically or even derogatory within the
                         ideologically affected legal system of the “Third Reich”, NS judiciary
                         somehow cleverly understood to use the benefits of a traditionally grown
                         and reliably functioning judicial machinery like in modern Germany for its
                         own ideological means of arbitrariness and terror throughout all changes of
                              20th century political systems (Lahusen,
                         2022). The other way around, the extent to which the German judiciary more
                         or less voluntarily made itself a “stooge” (Weber and Piazolo, 1998, pp.
                         13–14; Gruchmann, 2001) of the Nazi regime is exemplarily proofed by the
                         Special Courts, while their specific legal bases, which were enacted from
                         1933 onwards without any parliamentary participation, exemplify the
                         dissolution of the legislature in the “Third Reich”. </p>
            <p>Simultaneously, the ancient Greek etymology of the term “category” comprises
                         primarily nothing else than a legal significance – “κατηγορεῖν” means “to
                         accuse”, “to charge” (Gemoll, 2006, p. 453; TLL III, 1906–1912, col. 602).
                         As we focus on a court, a categorisation along its authoritative working
                         base regards a deepened consideration of applicable laws, legal
                         regulations, ordinances, decrees, or even – depending on the granularity
                         depth of data modelling – the specific legal paragraphs that were valid at
                         the time. And indeed, each decision of a court in the modern sense refers
                         to a concrete legal basis: Even in the “<term>Unrechtsstaat</term>” of NS dictatorship judges could not simply render
                         judgements at their own discretion, according to the legal principle “<term>nulla poena sine lege</term>” (Feuerbach, 1801, p. 20).
                         This formal aspect of Special Courts was dedicatedly criticised by
                         ideologically convinced Nazis in German Judiciary and Faculties of Law
                         (Garbe, 1999, pp. 141–142; Fröhlich, 1983, p. 210). So, purely
                         theoretically, such a deductive approach might be the most reasonable.</p>
            <div>
               <head>a) Deductive-(Legal-)Philosophical and (Legal-)Historical Approach </head>
               <p>Our first approach of categorisation can be classified as <emph>deductive</emph>
                  <hi rend="italic">.</hi> There
                              is a certain degree of legal-philosophical background behind the
                              historical phenomenon investigated, but more prominently we are
                              offered references to specific legal sources – at least for part of
                              the case files. </p>
               <p>Deduction is considered a most distinguished philosophical method of
                              categorisation (Kant, 1787/1904, pp. 104–130, §§14–27). The most
                              paradigmatic modern contribution to the conceptualisation of deduction
                              as a philosophical method relates to law (Fichte, 1966/70). Concerning
                              the NS Special Courts, a categorisation alongside the legal bases is
                              particularly interesting as their qualities are remarkably diverse.
                              First of all, we chose a legal theoretical distinction between the
                              positive law (Kelsen, 1934/2017) and laws and legal regulations,
                              respectively, in the sense of Carl Schmitt’s (1922/2002) and other NS
                              legal thinkers’ theory of law and society. It marks the peculiarity of
                              NS Special Courts within the contemporary judicial system of the Reich
                              that in the same way of their institutionalisation beyond the regular
                              courts, the NS regime began with its legislation of special penal
                              regulations besides the regular criminal laws that had been
                              systematically codified in the German Nation State since 1871 (RStGB,
                              1871/1935). The proceedings before the Special Courts concerned first
                              of all exclusively such “crimes”, or – to be more semantically neutral
                              – actions that only had been criminalised by a certain kind of NS
                              special penal regulations. A closer look on the complex process of the
                              Nazi Seizure of Power shows that the NS regime relaunched special
                              penal legislation even before relaunching the Weimar-invented Special
                              Courts (“<term>Verordnung</term>”, 1933), at first by
                              means of the “Reichstag Fire Decree” (1933). The scientific estimation
                              of this ordinance as “the fundamental exceptional law on which the
                              National Socialist dictatorship was primarily based until its
                              collapse” (Bracher, 1960, p. 82) shows the principal significance of
                              this kind of repression for the establishment of NS dictatorship. </p>

                              of NS special penal judiciary most often applied special legal
                              regulation (Hüttenberger, 1981) became the so-called “<term>Heimtückegesetz</term>” (1934). Thereby, the term
                                   “<term>Heimtücke</term>”, i.e., “insidiousness”, must
                              be understood as a typical NS dysphemism. This law criminalised every
                              kind of verbal or written critical comment on the NS regime or on
                              certain Nazi politicians – whereas in regular German criminal law,
                              “insidiousness” is actually an essential characteristic of murder
                              (RStGB, 1871, §211,2). We define the early NS special penal law

                  <emph>D-2:</emph> As another facet of their peculiar
                              role within the NS system of persecution and repression, Special
                              Courts were increasingly used for “regular crimes”. The longer the NS
                              regime lasted, the more frequent such cases were brought before it.
                              This phenomenon is well known by existing research literature (e.g.,
                              Dörner, 1998, pp. 36–39; Wogersien, 2007). Apart from a few exceptions
                              (e.g., Graczyk 2021, pp. 250–330), concrete numbers or data on this
                              topic have not been presented yet. The Mannheim Special Court shows,
                              for example: In 1933 18.6 % of “regular” first instance judgements
                              (like theft or murder) were tried before it, but in 1943 this
                              percentage would increase up to 43.9 % (Oehler, 1997, pp. 36–37).
                              Precise statistical analyses on the question of how often in 1933
                              still valid laws (RStGB, 1871/1934) were applied represent a
                              desideratum. By the example of Special Court Munich, this can be
                              approached through our computer-based investigation of its archive
                              inventory from the 1970s (cf. section below). Besides the codified
                              law, Munich Special Court even applied rather marginal regulations and
                              decrees of regular penal law for its judgements, up to the late Weimar
                              “Animal Protection Act” (1930) or exclusive Bavarian state laws – what
                              surprises in the face of anti-federal Nazi system –, like the
                              “Slaughter Tax Act” (1930).</p>

                  <emph>D-3:</emph> Research so far has also thematised
                              that the beginning of World War II meant a significant incision in the
                              history of NS special judiciary. Already since 1938, a veritable boost
                              of new specific NS special penal law regulations began to unfold. This
                              ‘second wave’ of NS special criminal law-making is correlating with
                              the sheer increase in the number of cases brought to trial before,
                              e.g., the Munich Special Court since 1939: Between 1933 and 1938,
                              3,123 proceedings were carried out, but in the years 1939–1945 they
                              reached 6,823. This tremendously increasing repression no longer
                              exclusively referred to the regime’s ‘own’ German “<term>Volksgemeinschaft</term>” but to foreigners (mostly forced
                              labourers and prisoners of war), too, since the annexations of 1938
                              and 1939 and particularly since Germany’s war of aggression. This
                              justifies the formation of another deductive-legal-historical
                              category, especially since these new products of NS special penal law
                              regulation [4] – in contrast to the more generally applicable “<term>Heimtückegesetz</term>”– are concerned with more or
                              less specific war-related deviance or resistance, or with the racial
                              or ethnic affiliation of prosecuted people itself, respectively:</p>

                                   penalty, which VVO §1 provides, e.g., in the case of looting. The

                              the legal basis of another non-regular jurisdiction instance, namely
                              to the proprietary penal law of the German “<term>Wehrmacht</term>”. The Military Penal Code (MStGB, 1943),

                              would be the legal basis for three judgments of the Munich Special
                              Court in 1944/45.</p>
               <p>For an understanding of the historical phenomenon of NS Special Courts
                              and their – since 1939 once again changed – role within the Nazi
                              repression system, a deductive categorisation along the concrete legal
                              bases of proceedings may provide a substantial epistemological profit.
                              It might even go to the core of the complex relationship between
                              National Socialism and law as well as justice, respectively, in a
                              diachronic perspective. As far as the legal bases of the Munich
                              Special Court during World War II are concerned, we are dealing with a
                              simultaneous set of legal sources that arose at different times and,
                              according to legal theory, are to be evaluated differently.
                              This multimodality of legal bases, some of which are applied simultaneously in proceedings, is to be modelled in categories<emph> </emph>D-5,
                                   D-6<emph>,</emph>
                              and D-7 (concrete numbers cf. below, “Comparison” and Figure 5).
                                   Especially since 1939, Munich Special Court often would apply D-2
                                   legal bases – above all paragraphs of the RStGB (1871) – in
                                   addition to the D-3 NS special penal law regulations whenever
                                   possible. Also, the “<term>Heimtückegesetz</term>” (1934) of D-1 would still be applied
                              extensively in addition to the new special penal law regulations from
                              1938 onwards; even the “Reichstag Fire Decree” (1933), still kept
                              being applied by the Munich Special Court, even in times of “total
                              war” (17 times, remarkably in most cases against Jehovah’s
                              Witnesses).</p>
               <p>Ideally, deductive categorisation seems to be the most rational method
                              of understanding the actual nature of this historical phenomenon. In
                              our present research, however, it indeed proves to be only partially
                              purposeful. Formally, the façade of a rationally acting judiciary was
                              maintained even under the conditions of “total war” (Lahusen, 2022,
                              pp. 141–185,
                              illustrated with the example of Aachen Special Court), although the
                              Munich NS Special Court was undoubtedly part of a state of injustice.
                              The problem lies rather in the fact that in our research we do not
                              work primarily on the basis of the court records themselves but with
                              the help of secondary records prepared in the 1970s (cf. above,
                              introduction to the source material). As is the case with many digital
                              humanities projects today, the editors of the “pre-digital” database
                              of the BayStMUK-“Archive Inventory” changed their metadata scheme in
                              the course of data entry. Thus, it happens that the
                              laws/ordinances/legal paragraphs that had been applied by the NS
                              Special Court were only recorded in the inventory records from the
                              beginning of Part 3 (1939) onwards during the scientific retrospective
                              of the 1970s (BayStMUK, 1976, p. 619; 1977, p. 2349). In the records
                              on the trials and discontinued proceedings of the years 1933–1938, no legal basis
                              is given in the records of the “Archive Inventory” at all and for the
                              phase from 1938 to 1945 are also some instances where such explicit
                              information is missing (specifically in 473 cases). Nonetheless, even
                              for the proceedings where the record entries offer no paragraph in the
                              “Archive Inventory”, the offence recorded in each case can always be
                              used to draw conclusions about an unambiguous criminal offence and the
                              applied written law (cf. below, comparison). For the research design
                              of our project, this means that a categorisation along the legal basis
                              of the special court proceedings actually only makes sense for the
                              period from the beginning of 1939 onwards, even though 6,830 of the
                              entire 9,954 cases captured by the “Archive Inventory” took place
                              after the beginning of 1939.</p>

                              have to find a more pragmatic methodology in order to focus on the

                              its repressive practice or the “everyday” resistance and deviance of
                              the wider population in the “Third Reich” and the “wartime society”

               <p>Through a random sample of cases for close reading and the intensive
                              study of the source material in the context of the digitisation and
                              data modelling process, we could gain an overview of the content. This
                              insight allowed us to think of several topics relevant to categorising
                              the charges by applying an intuitive system. In some cases, the
                              demarcation was relatively easy: A huge part of the charges concern
                              negative remarks against the regime (e.g., the claim that the
                              Reichstag was set on fire by National Socialists) and leading figures
                              thereof (e.g., the allegation that Hitler and Göring are gay). Another
                              very clear category deals with social interactions with prisoners of
                              war. Non-war-related inventory records contain crimes from bodily
                              harm, e.g., in the form of murder, to theft. Evaluating the charge
                              content showed that the wording used to describe the individual
                              accusations is in many cases standardised. This offered the
                              possibility of sorting the whole corpus with a few selected keywords
                              per category – so our hypothesis. </p>

                              categories, by analysing a sample of 90 randomly chosen cases and
                              looking for similarities in their content for classification (1-bodily
                              harm, 2-fraud, 3-economic crimes, like theft, 4-war-related economic
                              crimes, like illicit butchering, 5-interactions with prisoners of war,
                              6-sophisticated regime critique, written and oral resistance,
                              7-conspiracy, like pamphlet distribution, 8-negative remarks) – revealed a
                              disproportional surplus with over 40 % of cases concerning negative
                              remarks. To cater for deeper statistical analysis in the future,
                              differentiating within this main part of accusations became relevant
                              in order to gain better insights into the relationship between
                              accusations, results, and socio-political backgrounds of the accused.
                              So, through a review and quality control loop, we decided to refine
                              categories, what they each comprise as well as which keywords to use.
                              Thereby, comparing the success and failure of predicted results from
                              single keywords places induction in a pragmatic context (cf. Holland
                              et al., 1986).</p>
               <p>The query or category allocation was carried out on the basis of the
                              normalised charge text. The number of keywords necessary per category
                              varies. Through a review loop for each, the most efficient and concise
                              word variations were sought and found. Working with a spreadsheet, the
                              course of action was to test keyword variations on the column with the
                              normalised charge text before incorporating the best version into a
                              nested formula, i.e., the most efficient one in terms of the number of
                              cases that could be allocated without compromising the results for
                              other categories. In some cases, only parts of words and phrases were
                              used in order to incorporate as many different word and verb forms as
                              possible without compromising the results by accidentally returning
                              cases dealing with wholly different content. This process led to the
                              following categories with the different topics included in each. </p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">E-1</hi> bodily harm and morality: The primary aim was
                              to separate cases of murder, manslaughter and other bodily injury
                              offences from those that were purely regime-related. A review loop
                              revealed that many charges deal with people accused of talking about
                              how Hitler and other NS functionaries should be murdered or otherwise
                              harmed, but where no actual deed was done. Additionally, the review
                              process revealed that there were also many instances of morality
                              (indecent behaviour) and rape brought before the Special Court. Though
                              many different accusations are part of this category and almost 20
                              keywords were necessary for allocating them into this category (the
                              highest number from all out of the categorisation process), overall,
                              only 264 instances are dealing with cases that are still (mostly)
                              relevant under criminal law today. </p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">E-2</hi> fraud: 308 cases are related to fraudulent
                              behaviour. Only five keywords sufficed in order to collect all
                              relevant instances. “<term>Betrug</term>”/fraud was
                              commonly used in the inventory in this case but also forgery (e.g., of
                              documents) gets mentioned. </p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">E-3</hi> theft and bribery: This category comprises
                              not only economic crimes still punishable by law today, like theft of
                              goods, burglary, or tax evasion but also instances where begging or
                              embezzlement are concerned. In the end, 909 cases are sorted into this
                              category. </p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">E-4</hi> war-related economic crimes: Cases in this
                              category are differentiated from the former by their relation to war.
                              They mostly concern food supply whereby black-market dealings, illegal
                              slaughtering of livestock, and illicit dealings with ration coupons
                              are meant. Additionally, foreign exchange crimes are also put in the
                              same category which, in the end, comprises 644 cases. </p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">E-5</hi> prisoners of war-related crimes: This is
                              another instance, similar to the second category, where sorting was
                              relatively easy and a small number of keywords sufficed to cover 661
                              cases. The wording, for the most part, stays the same throughout all
                              inventory records for the cases where – mostly (young) women – helped
                              or socially interacted with prisoners of war. Additionally, escape aid
                              was also put in this category. </p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">E-6</hi> regime criticism including religious and
                              political persecution: Differentiating between categories 6 and 7
                              involved the toughest decisions in the process. In the end, mainly due
                              to the extensive review and quality control process, it seemed most
                              prudent to aggregate political and religious persecution (like members
                              of the Communist Party and Jehovah’s Witnesses) with instances where
                              politically or religiously motivated active resistance in the form of
                              written statements or preaching against the regime during Sunday
                              service are concerned. Initially, cases involving the unauthorized
                              ownership and/or wearing of NS-uniforms or badges were also put here.
                              But the main motivation behind this pretence of being part of or
                              supporting the regime was self-preservation, thus not being on the
                              same resistance level as the other entries within the category. Those
                              keywords were therefore relegated to category E-7 and also resulted in
                              decimating the number of relevant cases by approximately 200 till only
                              238 remained in category E-6. </p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">E-7</hi> conspiracy and protest: Through the
                              additional cases moved from the former one, 528 instances could be
                              found where active resistance in the form of protest or consummation
                              of illegal media but also active actions for self-preservation are
                              concerned. This also comprises the distribution of leaflets as well as
                              listening to foreign radio channels. </p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">E-8</hi> negative remarks and hearsay: Although the
                              review and quality control process helped in distinguishing more
                              properly between the different categories, the by far most extensive
                              category remains the one related to negative remarks. 3,005 instances
                              can still be ascribed to people commenting on different aspects of the
                              regime in different settings – from people repeating hearsay about
                              deaths in concentration camps to others insulting the government
                              during a session at the local inn. </p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">E-9</hi> person-related remarks: As the first trial
                              run of this approach showed, disproportionately many cases deal with
                              accusations based on negative remarks and/or hearsay. In order to
                              differentiate those a little bit more, cases where Hitler/the “<term>Führer</term>” or other leading figures of the
                              regime, like Goebbels or Himmler, are part of the claim are separated
                              from the rest, resulting in 1,523 cases.</p>
               <p>Due to varying phrasing of the editors from the 1970s for the charges
                              within the inventory records (e.g., for negative remarks we have “<term>schimpfen</term>”/ranting, “<term>negativ, abfällig äußern</term>”/speaking derogatorily, “<term>kritisch äußern</term>”/critical remarks etc.),
                              partly due to the long process of collecting data and creating the
                              inventory and partly due to the fact, that different persons worked on
                              them as well as still remaining OCR-errors, it helped to keep the
                              single category keywords as short as possible. Thus, we encapsulated
                              varying spellings and verb forms as well as common OCR-errors like “a”
                              instead of “ä” within one query. As the search for the keywords is
                              operated via the normalised and shortened text, which is sometimes
                              very individual in its wording concerning the charges, additional
                              approximately 100 cases, which otherwise would result in being
                              relegated to the group of uncategorised records, can be allocated to
                              the group of “negative remarks and hearsay” by querying for “<term>gesagt haben soll</term>” (reported to have said)
                              in the full text at the end. In the end, 451 records remain
                              uncategorised (<hi rend="italic">E-0</hi>) due to poor quality of the
                              OCR-text or because an accusation related to certain allegations is
                              mentioned only once, e.g., there is one accusation of poisoning wells,
                              a trope used against Jews since the Middle Ages.</p>
               <p>The resulting formula of nested if-then queries [6] is quite intricate
                              but also streamlined concerning efficiency. Nonetheless, one has to
                              keep in mind that the sequence within the query influences the result.
                              If we, for example, retrieve cases by filtering for charges of the
                              category “bodily harm and morality”, like fornication/“<term>Unzucht</term>
                  <hi rend="italic">”</hi> or murder,
                              first, we would also put cases in the same category where hearsay in
                              relation to such crimes is concerned. The assigning of the cases to
                              single crime categories by particularly chosen keywords is subject to
                              individual biases as some – like the unauthorised wearing of badges
                              and uniforms (ultimately put into <hi rend="italic">E-7</hi>) – could
                              be placed in different categories depending on where we as editors
                              choose to put them. Therefore, we also developed a more “objective”
                              inductive-computational approach.</p>
            </div>
            <div>
               <head>c) Inductive-Computational Approach </head>
               <p>The inductive-computational approach aims at producing a categorisation
                              with little manual intervention by applying algorithms from natural
                              language processing (NLP), machine learning, and clustering. Most
                              algorithms used must be parameterised which requires expert knowledge,
                              structured exploration of the parameter space and experimentation. </p>
               <p>Starting from the baseline CSV file (cf. “Workflow” above), we first
                              trained a doc2vec model (Le, 2014) using the gensim library for Python
                              3 (Rehurek, 2010). The algorithm defines an ample set of parameters,
                              some of which have a strong influence on the quality of the document
                              embeddings produced. Our goal was to cluster similar inventory records
                              close together and far apart from non-similar ones. Finding the right
                              set of parameters requires trial and error: define a parameter
                              configuration, train a doc2vec model, obtain embeddings for all
                              documents, and evaluate the results visually. At this point, we would
                              like to note that we added a manual intervention: doc2vec does not
                              solve a classification task (there is no ground truth) but, instead,
                              generates document embeddings. Thus, no metric exists to assess the
                              quality formally and automatically in terms of classification accuracy
                              of the embeddings produced. Therefore, we selected a doc2vec model
                              manually: we first computed embeddings for all documents and plotted
                              them in 2D space separately for each model; we then used visual
                              inspection to select a model that would generate a non-homogeneous
                              distribution of documents with clear clusters. Figure 2 exemplifies
                              how we explored the parameter space to select a model: each subplot
                              represents a model trained with a distinct set of parameters and shows
                              the document embeddings generated by the model projected into 2D
                              space.</p>
               <figure>
                  <head>Figure . Exploring the parameter space to select a model: each
                                   subplot represents one model trained with a distinct set of
                                   parameters and shows embeddings for all documents after
                                   projection into 2D space. For example, the models 9–12 show a
                                   homogeneous distribution of documents, without pronounced
                                   clusters; other models, such as model 3, are better for our
                                   purpose because they result in more structured alignments of
                                   document embeddings.</head>
                  <graphic url="media/image2.png"/>
               </figure>
               <p>Even a small set of parameters result in a huge space to explore: for
                              example, five parameters with three possible values each would require
                                   35 = 243 models to be trained and
                              assessed. To limit the number of parameter configurations and, thus,
                              the number of models to be trained, we relied on our expertise and
                              followed the advice given by Lau (2016) on recommendations for optimal
                              doc2vec hyper-parameter settings. We then systematically explored the
                              parameter space, by first defining for each parameter a range of
                              allowed values and then iterating each possible combination of all
                              parameters. For example, when allowing a = {1, 2, 3} and b = {4, 5,
                              6}, we would obtain nine possible combinations of a and b, namely {1,
                              4}, {1, 5}, … {3, 5}, {3, 6}. After training only a small number of
                              doc2vec models and inspecting the results visually, we were able to
                              identify some parameter values which would always produce insufficient
                              results, independently of all other parameters. For example, disabling
                              negative sampling or switching on hierarchical softmax would always
                              produce a homogeneous distribution of documents, without distinct
                              clusters, which is undesirable for our purpose. We excluded these
                              parameters from the exploration by setting a fixed value and shrinking
                              the parameter space to explore by orders of magnitude.</p>
               <p>Besides exploring doc2vec parameters configurations, the selection of a
                              training corpus has a significant impact on the quality of the models
                              produced. Initially, we trained our model on our own inventory records
                              and used the same set of documents to obtain document embeddings. Our
                              corpus consisted of 8,532 valid inventory records with an average
                              length of 5.3 words. We were able to improve our models to show more
                              pronounced clusters by using a different corpus during training,
                              containing 1,454 legal documents from between 1933 and 1945 with an
                              average length of 444 words [7].</p>
               <p>After training and manually selecting a doc2vec model through visual
                              inspection [8], we were ready for the final step: clustering. First,
                              we inferred a high-dimensional embedding for each inventory record and
                              then projected each 300-dimensional vector into 2D space by applying
                              t-SNE (van der Maaten, 2008). We then transformed our data into
                              quantiles [9] before clustering by applying DBSCAN (Ester, 1996). We
                              used pandas (McKinney, 2010), numpy (Harris, 2020), and sklearn
                              (Pedregosa et al., 2011) to implement all steps. The image below shows
                              a clustering of document embeddings representing our inventory
                              records.</p>
               <figure>

                                   inductive-computational approach.</head>

               </figure>
               <p>Each dot represents a doc2vec embedding which corresponds to a single
                              inventory record. Similar documents are located close together and
                              form clusters. Each cluster corresponds to one category. Outliers are
                              not part of any cluster. Note that the image shows results from a
                              particular choice of parameters used for training the doc2vec model
                              and for clustering document embeddings. We manually chose a set of
                              parameters. Different parameters would produce a significantly
                              different output.</p>
               <p>The number of clusters/categories in this approach was much higher than
                              in the other two approaches. This was because documents were grouped
                              solely based on contextual information found in the texts, whereas the
                              other approaches grouped legally related documents together, even if
                              they were appearing in completely unrelated contexts. For example,
                              category E-5 (prisoner of war-related, pragmatic-explorative approach)
                              collects all accusations concerning contact with prisoners of war,
                              whereas the three categories C-35, C-37, C-38 are produced in the
                              inductive-computational approach, seemingly distinguishing between the
                              nationality of the prisoners.</p>
               <p>The following table (Figure 4) shows statistics for all 46 clusters
                              sorted by the number of documents within each cluster. The third
                              column shows the relative number of documents contained within each
                              cluster. The right-most column shows the top three most frequent words
                              occurring within the cluster. Almost 16 % of all documents belong to
                              C-00 which collects outliers and corresponds to the “uncategorised”
                              category in the other two approaches. The clusters are unevenly sized.
                              The eight largest clusters (17 % of all clusters, not including C-00)
                              contain 50 % of all categorised documents. Out of these eight
                              clusters, five contain the word “<term>Äußerung</term>”
                              (remark) within the top three cluster words which correspond to 35 %
                              of all documents. This clearly shows that a large proportion of all
                              accusations concerned remarks about the regime, leaders, the war
                              etc.</p>

            <head>Comparison of the Different Approaches &amp; Conclusion </head>
            <p>As described, the different categorisation approaches offer various and
                         specialised views on the source material. The comparison of the individual
                         case numbers per category (cf. Figure 5 as well as compared to Figure 4)
                         already makes that clear. </p>

            </figure>
            <p>Nevertheless, some degree of overlap can be identified as well (cf. Figures 6
                         and 7). For several of the categories formed in the pragmatic-explorative
                         approach, for example, it can be said that the offences subsumed under each
                         category were criminalised in the first place by a very specific Nazi
                         special criminal law ordinance:</p>
            <p>The simplest compatibility of one of the
                         pragmatic-explorative categories is in category E-5 prisoners of
                         war-related crimes. An indictment or conviction in this case always took
                         place under §4 of the “<term>Wehrkraftverordnung</term>” and is
                         therefore also part of the deductive category D-3 (as can also be seen in
                         the overlaps and distinctive colouring of clusters in the top-left quadrant
                         in Figures 6 and 7). As already mentioned, C-35, C-37, and C-38 combined
                         show a similar composition of cases. Conformity in this instance is
                         predominantly owed to the wording used by the editors in the 1970s and the
                         clearly defined legal basis for prisoners of war-related crimes.</p>
            <p>Three of these pragmatic-explorative categories even refer to
                         a single Nazi special criminal law ordinance, namely the “<term>Heimtückegesetz</term>”, or to be even more precise, to
                         three concrete paragraphs of the “<term>Heimtückegesetz</term>”
                         (§§1, 2, and 4), namely E-8 negative remarks and hearsay and E-9
                         person-related remarks. Offences subsumed in E-6 regime criticism including
                         religious and political persecution, however, were also based on the
                         “Reichstag Fire Decree” in some clearly identifiable cases – always against
                         Jehovah’s Witnesses (known and listed in the records as <term>Ernste Bibelforscher</term>). This shows the qualitatively, but also
                         quantitatively extremely large role that the “<term>Heimtückegesetz</term>” had for the juridical practice of the Nazi
                         special courts. Through the inductive-computational approach, we find that
                         this distinction is made even more clear in the category C-28.</p>
            <p>For “regular” offences where prosecution by the special court was primarily
                         based on very specific paragraphs of regular codified criminal law, similar
                         correspondences between the categorisation approaches can be determined.
                         Overall, for the diachronic analysis of the 1970s “Archive Inventory”
                         regarding the various legal sources used as a basis for the NS Special
                         Court proceedings, this at least partial factual correspondence of the
                         pragmatic-explorative categorisation carried out along semantic terms with
                         certain laws, ordinances, or even certain legal paragraphs helps to gain a
                         better understanding for the source material as well as for a more thorough
                         reflection on what the categories represent. This enables us to choose the
                         most suitable approach for different questions and also to better take into
                         account the necessary theoretical background (cf. above, remarks on
                         categorisation). </p>
            <p>Through the different categorisation approaches, all of which took into
                         account the various theoretical considerations of categorisation as
                         initially stated in this paper, we now have templates for processing those
                         inquiries. Next steps also include a refinement of the extracted
                         information from the hOCR files in order to maximise the number of valid
                         cases that can be incorporated in the analysis as well as to get a more
                         accurate picture of categorising them. Successful categorisation – not only
                         of charges but of other relevant information such as results of the
                         proceedings – also provides the basis for more far-reaching analyses. For
                         example, it is planned to conduct correspondence analyses on different
                         aspects, like (in-)dependencies between socio-demographic markers and
                         charges as well as results. The workflow initially adopted the terminology
                         used in the 1970s which is essentially based on the source terms and not
                         yet on a controlled and reduced vocabulary. Since statistical/quantitative
                         in-depth analyses are not very fruitful when based on a large number of
                         source terms as they tend to be less significant and more confusing in the
                         (visual) representation, data has to be aggregated employing different
                         kinds of categories, for instance on questions of social status or
                         professions. For this paper, we focused on accusations. Yet, our
                         considerations apply analogously to other categories to be formed. The
                         presented deliberations on categorisation are to be understood in
                         preparation for the upcoming historical investigation of the data with the
                         help of this kind of statistical method.</p>
